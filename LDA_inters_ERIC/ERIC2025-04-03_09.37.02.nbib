AB  - Agile methods, initially used by cross-functional teams in software development projects, can also facilitate teamwork in collaborative research projects. For this, project management-related issues need to be addressed, including the challenge of finding practical means for coordinating scientific collaboration, while garnering commitment from all participants. This article explores the utilisation of agile methods by a semi-distributed scientific team, for coordinating a multidisciplinary research project. It examines how these methods can contribute to task coordination in scientific research and highlights key factors for successful adoption of the agile framework in collaborative research projects. Data are collected from a research team, after a 10-week phase of implementing agile methods. Data analysis focuses on the effectiveness of the digital tools used for communication and coordination during the project. The findings indicate a perception that agile methods contribute to coordination and improved teamwork during project development, with less agreement on the utility of some of the tools used. Also, it suggests the importance of involvement of the principal investigator and the role of a facilitator.

AB  - This article examines the importance of caring in schools and school leadership. It analyzes the concept of caring and how it functions and introduces a model of caring school leadership situated within this broader exposition. The analysis and model are informed by literature including academic and professional works from education and education-related fields and disciplines--philosophy, ethics, feminist theory, positive psychology, and the organizational sciences. In addition, the analysis and model draws on literature of human-service occupations--health care, social services, and the ministry--that consider caring and caring leadership at both interpersonal and organizational levels. The synthesis of this literature results in a multidisciplinary and cross-occupational model that extends and deepens current understanding and theory about caring school leadership.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) impacts various developmental domains, requiring interventions by professionals from multiple disciplines. In Israel, ASD community preschools' multidisciplinary teams aim to provide each child with an integrative intervention program. The current study focused on the working experience of 21 professionals from multidisciplinary teams in ASD-preschools, with special emphasis on their perceptions of the intra-staff dialogue in their teams. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed through grounded theory. Arising themes covered: challenges characterizing the delivery of intervention to children with ASD in a community setting; challenges met by professionals when attempting to navigate multidisciplinary teamwork; and factors that facilitate multidisciplinary work. Practices that support multidisciplinary team cohesion at the team, the organizational, and the policy-making levels are discussed.

AB  - Socialization has become a common framework through which to understand the doctoral student experience; however, the framework has predominately been used as a lens through which to understand traditional, single-discipline doctoral student experiences. Interdisciplinary doctoral programs are becoming increasingly common in both the United States and elsewhere but relatively little empirical research exists about this distinct experience. Through multiple interviews with 18 doctoral students and their 35 faculty members, we discuss differences in the socialization process for these students in regard to knowledge acquisition, investment, and involvement. Implications for practice and future research are included.

AB  - This paper describes a faculty-led summer program in Madrid, Spain. We argue that it represents a case study in the implementation of best practices in study abroad, particularly as it relates to experiential programs that include an internship component. Adding to a growing consensus on best practices for these types of educational opportunities, we claim that study abroad experiential learning should include purposeful interdisciplinarity, in particular as it relates to the interconnection between a liberal arts education and useful business acumen. We believe that this integrative approach can serve as model for the liberal arts in the twenty-first century. In the article, we present detailed data on 15Â years of the program, allowing the reader to contemplate and analyze the intricacies of implementation. We conclude that the benefits to students participating in experiential study abroad programs will be maximized in the post-pandemic world of this century.

AB  - This instructional article describes recent implementations of ethics education in a teacher education course at a large university in the Southwest United States. Using a case analysis framework in tandem with a principle-based ethics schema, a teacher educator and his research assistant designed five content interventions for their content area literacy curriculum in the hopes of helping preservice teachers position their developing pedagogies alongside a cultivation of ethical reasoning and decision making. Rooted in ethics education literature that reveals a lack of empirical data surrounding the impact of professional ethics in teacher education settings, the article explains innovative teaching methodologies while sharing samples of student work along with a review of students' reactions. Finally, questions are posed for further research in higher education regarding the implementation of ethics for future teachers.

AB  - The article introduces the continuous course lab (CCL) as an alternative model for conducting undergraduate research in the humanities. CCL segments large-scale research projects into smaller-scale projects that are run over a series of semesters. The CCL model is unique in that it provides majors from outside the humanities with exposure to humanities research questions, methods, and communities of practice. To illustrate how the CCL model may be adopted in the humanities classroom, a case study is presented of the model at work in a technical communication class over seven semesters.

AB  - First-Year Seminars (FYS) offer a unique mode of introducing college students to new topics, research practices, and approaches to learning that they may not have been exposed to in high school. In this article, we outline the successes and challenges of team teaching a combined cultural anthropology and biochemistry course on the topic of blood, an aspect of our everyday lives that is both vital and hidden. Using our own experiences in and out of the classroom along with direct student feedback, we discuss the importance and relevance of using interdisciplinary, team-taught FYS to engage, excite, and educate students about the inherent value of thinking and working across disciplinary boundaries.

AB  - University efforts to galvanize work that is often siloed and disconnected across departments is supported by collaborative and creative initiatives. Campbell University's mission to support community engagement at multiple levels of university life, while also emphasizing faith and vocation, is an example of how one university is modeling this work. This case study on a specific program at Campbell University, the Campbell Youth Theological Institute, demonstrates how remembering the mission and how it connects it to the larger university and is implemented can reenergize faculty and students towards a deeper understanding of faith and vocation, as well as transformational community engagement.

AB  - Due to investments in interdisciplinary research endeavors, the number and variety of interdisciplinary research centers have grown exponentially during the past decades. While interdisciplinary research centers rely on varied organizational arrangements, we know little about the conditions and processes that mediate collaborative arrangements and interdisciplinary research outcomes. This study examines how different collaborative arrangements shape scholars' experiences of interdisciplinary research and understandings of interdisciplinary knowledge culminations in the context of university-based research centers. We conducted three in-depth qualitative case studies on different centers, which recruited researchers from natural sciences, medicine, and social sciences. We refer to them as the Biotech Center, the Environmental Center, and the Premature Birth Center. Our analysis of 53 interviews with interdisciplinary scholars across the three centers demonstrates that the scholars perceive particular features of the centers' collaborative arrangements as meaningful for interdisciplinary collaboration. Specifically, the center's mission, physical architecture, and leadership and task structure were seen as affecting scholars' motivation, interaction, and inclusion in the centers, which then shaped the interdisciplinary knowledge culminations. At the Biotech Center, knowledge was translated towards concrete "products," at the Environmental Center knowledge was pooled together from varied fields to create new problem "framings," and at the Premature Birth Center, interdisciplinary collaboration was crafted through top-down knowledge "brokerage."

AB  - Experiential learning is touted as an effective way of imparting research skills. This suggests that master's students undergoing training in research psychology should be exposed to managing projects and supervising interdisciplinary research teams and projects before entering the workplace. The Department of Psychology and Department of Town and Regional Planning at a South African university developed a near-peer mentoring programme in which the psychology master's students mentored undergraduate urban planning students who were writing their final-year research reports. Focus group discussions with the psychology students about their experiences of the programme were analysed using phenomenography. The psychology students experienced their role as mentor in five hierarchical variations. The first four were seen as challenging, while the benefits were only experienced at the highest level of the hierarchy. Lessons learnt from the mentoring relationship that mirror certain workplace research skills are discussed followed by recommendations for improving the mentoring programme.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a case study of the establishment and development of a minor program in Sustainable Development in Tongji University, China, and how it contributes to embedding sustainable development into higher education system as an alternative platform for researchers and students to involve in a transdisciplinary teaching and learning process. Design/methodology/approach: This case reviews the institutional setting and the different studying models and requirements for postgraduates and undergraduates. Postgraduate students have to take four core courses, select one module with four themed courses (4 + 4 fixed) and complete a transdisciplinary essay, and undergraduates can choose any three courses in all modules apart from the four core courses (4 + 3 open), with a transdisciplinary group project. Findings: The development of the minor program reveals the popularity and decline of different modules, because of the popularity of the schools and institutes behind them, the university legacy and the media influence. The program design spurs transdisciplinary thinking on sustainable development but brings about challenges including time conflict with students' major study. In conclusion, this program explores alternative education practices in embedding sustainable development in education system, contributing to and reflect on Education for Sustainable Development and the education reform in China. Originality/value: The case presents a unique way of implementing Education for Sustainable Development in higher education system, in which minor education stands between formal and informal curriculum to tackle the barriers in undertaking sustainable development initiatives in curricula, through nurturing the culture and providing organizational support.

AB  - There is growing interest in the use of intergenerational practice in arts and health to support psychological well-being and community cohesion. However, little research has addressed the facilitation of such projects, or how higher education institutions can support them. Here we examine the role of the University of Bedfordshire in Generations Dancing, an 11-week dance and photography project for older adults and young people in Bedford. Focus groups were conducted with the older adults, young people, artists, independent living centre leaders, and schoolteachers involved. Inductive content analysis highlighted the university's role in brokering between community sectors, promoting the project, and offering resources. These factors appeared to play a significant part in enabling the project to develop beyond what smaller organizations working independently might have achieved, and in facilitating a sustainable model for its perpetuation.

AB  - New liberal arts refer to the reorganization of traditional liberal arts to realize the intersection and integration within liberal arts and between liberal arts and natural sciences. The characteristics of new liberal arts are mainly problem-orientation, cross-integration, new technology application and innovative development. Under the background of new liberal arts, the implementation of interdisciplinary education in foreign language majors is an effective way for local colleges and universities to promote the construction of "new foreign languages" and the training of interdisciplinary and applied foreign language talents. Based on the connotations of new liberal arts and interdisciplinary education, and in view of the institutional and cultural barriers to the planning and implementation of interdisciplinary education, this paper proposes an optimized path for the design and implementation of interdisciplinary education for foreign language majors in local colleges and universities: deepen the integration between foreign language majors and other disciplines, build a staged, multi-level talent training system, set up cross-discipline curricular groups, apply new technology to transform traditional teaching and learning methods, strengthen the construction of interdisciplinary education platforms and faculties, and establish a foreign language interdisciplinary education system guarantee mechanism.

AB  - As change agents at our university, we sought to facilitate a transition within our STEM college toward more extensive use of evidence-based instructional practices (EBIPs) that promote student-centered learning. We sought a multifaceted approach for this challenge, with the goal of achieving lasting change among the faculty, resulting in the creation of the STEM Faculty Institute (STEMFI). Supported by multiyear funding from the National Science Foundation, STEMFI provides instruction on EBIPs through a summer workshop, along with yearlong support in redesigning curriculum through one-to-one mentoring of each faculty participant. The first cohort of STEMFI participants has been successful, with most faculty showing significant shifts toward more student-centered practices in their teaching. Feedback on the post-workshop survey indicated participants considered the material helpful and engaging, encouraging a shift in their attitudes toward supporting EBIPs in their own classrooms. This article describes factors critical to the STEMFI approach and reports on the initial effectiveness observed.

AB  - An increasingly important aim in education is to develop students capable of addressing complex, interdependent problems. This study integrates theories of situated learning, authentic science research, socioscientific issues, and interdisciplinary STEM education to construct a program for high school students. Drawn from Vygotsky and Dewey's philosophy of social constructivism, we developed a framework to incorporate situated learning, authentic science research, and socioscientific issues in fostering sustainable development competencies of systems thinking and problem-solving to provide opportunities for students to transition from newcomers to adaptive experts. Using qualitative methods, we explored the development of a systems thinking approach in problem-solving related to climate change and air pollution in fifty-seven international school students in Taiwan. We found patterns of (1) systems thinking application in innovative solutions, (2) understanding the practices of authentic science research, and (3) interconnections between science and society. The findings suggest the framework has relevance to high-value learning of systems thinking and for discussions of problem-solving in community contexts and future research directions.

AB  - Background and Context: Computational Thinking (CT) has been recently integrated into new and revised Digital Technologies content (DTC) in the Technology learning area of the New Zealand School Curriculum. Objective: To aid this change, this research examined how CT supports learning outcomes in both music and programming with the Sonic Pi platform. Method: A mixed-methods case study designed by the researcher was developed and trialled in a regular middle school classroom. The design of instruments and analysis utilised a widely used CT assessment framework at a school level. Findings: Many successes and challenges not reported in the literature on how CT can support learning outcomes in music and programming were revealed. Implications: Provided some significant limitations are considered, the major implication of the results suggest educators can use Sonic Pi to support many learning outcomes in music and programming for interested students.

AB  - Background: The goal of this research was to determine students' perceived self-efficacy in science classes through involving students in expanding disciplinary core idea (DCI) and interdisciplinary core idea (ICI) maps, as a method to visualize knowledge (utilizing mind mapping and concept mapping) to support students to integrate interdisciplinary learning. The research involved (a) creating (by science educators) eight curriculum-related, disciplinary core idea maps and two interdisciplinary core idea maps; (b) teachers guiding students in an experimental group, to make interdisciplinary connections so as to expand DCI and ICI maps in an intervention lasting a year and a half from grade 10 to 11; (c) providing feedback on students' developed DCI and ICI maps; (d) administering questionnaires seeking students' perceptions about their self-efficacy towards core ideas, both before and after the intervention and (e) interviewing science teachers (5) and selected students (25), after the intervention, about their perceptions towards the use and outcomes of their DCI and ICI maps. Besides the experimental group, a control group (no intervention) was involved. Results: Outcomes showed that the intervention (guiding students in creating disciplinary and interdisciplinary core idea maps to visualize their learning) supported students significantly in their perceived self-efficacy in the fields of Life Science and Earth Science, plus in the use of Models and Systems. In Physics and Chemistry, the students' perceived self-efficacy was not statistically significantly positive after the conducted intervention. This stemmed from disciplinary core ideas, related to Physics and Chemistry, being more abstract, with students making fewer connections and integrating less new knowledge into the related DCI and ICI maps. In the interviews, both teachers and students stated that the intervention (including expansion of DCI and ICI maps) supported students' science learning. Conclusions: Creating and expanding disciplinary and interdisciplinary core ideas more clearly indicates students' learning, through their ability to make meaningful connections, enabling students to raise their self-efficacy in preparing for their future. The results from this research demonstrate that students' perceived self-efficacy can occur through knowledge visualization by expanding both DCI and ICI maps enabling the making of greater interdisciplinary connections.

AB  - Background: Student anxiety about statistics may lead to poorer learning outcomes. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate an exercise designed to teach students in an introductory statistics class the principles of bivariate regression and to emphasize how statistical tools used by psychologists are also implemented in other fields. Method: Students used a published model on the relationship between tooth size and the length of great white sharks to estimate the length of extinct sharks and to explore factors that could affect the accuracy or validity of regression analyses. Data from an anonymous self-report scale were used to assess the activity. Results: More than 95% of respondents "agreed" or "strongly agreed" that the activity was engaging, approximately 95% of students "agreed" or "strongly agreed" that the activity helped them learn about factors that can lead to problems with bivariate correlation/regression, and approximately 91% of respondents correctly answered a question designed to assess basic content acquisition. Conclusion: Feedback data suggest that the exercise was successful in achieving its content and process learning goals. Teaching Implications: Implementation of similar exercises may improve student engagement and outcomes in psychology statistics courses.

AB  - This project produced an online astronomy course based on the free, online OpenStax textbook. When this project was conceived, about a year before the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors had no idea that in a short period of time, most college and university classes would be online. This abrupt change in modalities of courses, from traditional, face-to-face lectures and laboratories to a more modern online format, sparked energetic discussions about the effectiveness of online courses. This paper describes the online astronomy course and its creation and evaluates the success of the course at conveying the concepts and theories studied in astronomy courses. The success of this course is examined using a 100-question pre-test and post-test based on content knowledge. A survey was also completed of the students to evaluate the perceived success of the online course and the acceptance of online courses. The survey was adjusted to include opinions about the in-person labs that were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The effectiveness of interdisciplinary sustainability curriculum remains understudied in geography education. Accordingly, we deployed and evaluated an interdisciplinary sustainability and STEM module for in-person and online sections of a fall 2018 Human Geography course. Results indicate that sustainability knowledge improved after the interdisciplinary curricular intervention irrespective of course modality. Another focus is to explore student reactions to teaching modality due to COVID-19 disruptions. Results indicate that online student sustainability knowledge also improved during COVID-19 (fall 2020). For students in a section converted from in-person to blended, sustainability knowledge did not improve. Implications are provided.

AB  - We report our progress on the "River Memorial Museum" didactic intervention project developed with schools, in the basin of the Atoyac River in Mexico, that are significantly impacted by the pollution produced through industrialisation. The teachers of the elementary schools in these communities, environmental scientists, educators, and community activists participated jointly in a "co-construction" process, designing "interdisciplinary" educational activities to study local environmental issues and recovering the principles of a "socio-critical perspective of mathematical modelling." In this paper, we centre on presenting the methodology of the didactic intervention with the teachers of one school of an Atoyac River basin community and the principles for designing educational activities we developed collaboratively with them. We believe this methodology could be helpful to support others in thinking about similar opportunities in their communities.

AB  - As an outcome of multidiscipline integration, the polymeric surfactant is of growing importance in modern industry and scientific research. However, the instructional introduction on polymeric surfactants is still insufficient in universities nowadays. In order to effectively guide undergraduates to study polymeric surfactant, a new polymeric surfactant, polyÂ­(acrylic acid-"co"-octadecyl acrylate), was designed and synthesized by copolymerization between acrylic acid and octadecyl acrylate. Moreover, its surface activity and rheological performance were also analyzed by contact angle meter, laser scanning confocal microscope, polarizing microscope, and rotary rheometer. Generally, as a combination of the hands-on exercise with theoretical lecture, this laboratory experiment enabled students to understand the key concepts and chemical nature of polymeric surfactants in depth. In addition, the ability to incorporate multidiscipline concepts into the practical issues students must solve was also cultivated by this exercise.

AB  - The use of transdisciplinary approach to promote learners' interest in the acquisition of natural science at school provides new opportunities for a complex explanation of the phenomenon and improving the quality of the process of learning. The aim of the study is to explore the learners' cognitive interest, personal participation and the approaches chosen by teachers from the perspective of transdisciplinary approach. The study characterises students' subjective evaluations of their personal participation and cognitive interest in the subjects of biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics, and the approaches used by teachers. The participants were 9th grade students from 17 Latvian schools (536 respondents) with the average age of 15.3 (SD=0.63). The results of the study showed that students' evaluations concerning their personal participation in the process of learning were contradictory. They devote little of their free time to the acquisition of science subjects. As to teachers' activity, a variety of teaching approaches are used. According to students' subjective evaluations, the constructivist learning approach corresponds to the trends of sustainable education, whereas the overall context in which the development of learners' cognitive interest in the acquisition of natural science subjects takes place at school highlights issues concerning the sustainable development of the system and the prospects of using the transdisciplinary approach.

AB  - This paper proposes a transdisciplinary framework to allow for a multifocal exploration of classroom talk practices. It draws on data from a broader study of talk in South African Grade 4 mathematics classrooms where the language of teaching and learning (English) was the home language for neither the teachers nor their students. Lesson transcript data from one teacher's lessons on fractions are used to demonstrate how working with three strands of conceptual insight from the disciplines of psychology, sociology and linguistics conduces to a potentially richer understanding of a teacher's use of classroom talk in mediating her students' mathematical understanding. By drawing on elements of Vygotsky's sociocultural psychology, we make visible in the lesson data the ways in which this teacher used the 'everyday' in trying to navigate her students' towards more 'scientific' conceptualizations of unit fractions. By then taking up aspects of Bernstein's sociological work, we articulate, and make visible, how societal circumstances impinge on students' access to exploratory mathematical discourse needed for epistemological access to abstract and generalized mathematical concepts. Finally, through Halliday's work on the power of particular linguistic registers for meaning-making, we highlight challenges in learning mathematics in and through a second language and reveal the constraints placed on students' opportunity to maximally exploit the distinct forms of meaning contained within the mathematics register.

AB  - A course entitled "Science and Engineering Education: Interdisciplinary Aspects" was designed to expose undergraduate students of science and engineering education to the attributes of interdisciplinary education which integrates science and engineering. The core of the course is an interdisciplinary lesson, which each student is supposed to teach his/her peers. Sixteen students at advanced stages of their studies attended the course. The research presented here used qualitative instruments to characterise students' attitudes towards interdisciplinary learning and teaching of science and engineering. According to the findings, despite the significant challenge which characterises interdisciplinary teaching, a notable improvement was evident throughout the course in the percentage of students who expressed willingness to teach interdisciplinary classes in future.

AB  - There is growing evidence that coaching early childhood educators leads to higher quality teaching practices and improved child learning outcomes. Despite this, there is a lack of Australian evidence on the impact that coaching in collaborative, interdisciplinary teams in early childhood education and care settings has on teacher effectiveness and by extension child learning. This paper will draw on data from two collaborative interdisciplinary research projects -- the "Victorian Advancing Early Learning Study" and the "Every Toddler Talking Initiative" -- to explore the features of coaching, collaboration and interdisciplinary partnerships that support early childhood educators to engage in the process of continuous improvement. We argue that governance and leadership is critical in enabling interdisciplinary teams to engage in a collaborative process of continuous improvement and that threshold conditions are required within early childhood education and care services to foster interdisciplinary coaching collaborations in a sustained manner.

AB  - This review addresses a lacuna in the literature concerning interdisciplinary teaching by analyzing peer-reviewed articles that discuss empirical evidence of interdisciplinary teaching practices. The article reports on the wide array of purposes, approaches and designs of interdisciplinary teaching and learning found in the review, but an important, more general, point is that interdisciplinary teaching is, consistently, considered different from normal practices, hence positioning interdisciplinary teaching and learning as the other. This othering could be detrimental to establishing sustainable interdisciplinary educational provision. Our analysis suggests a need for stressing interdisciplinary practices as local, rather than as generalizable propositions

Integrative teaching (e.g., interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, cross-disciplinary, etc.) benefits middle-level learners as it potentially increases student engagement, motivation, and achievement. It provides learners with the opportunity to synthesize knowledge by exploring topics and ideas through multiple lenses. While the middle school concept certainly highlights the critical role of integrative teaching, many middle-level structures such as integrated teaching are "limited, absent, or not fully implemented". Given the reality in which we work (without a fully articulated middle level teacher education program), the faculty of elementary and secondary education are responsible for preparing future middle-level teachers. This article provides a description of how faculty in one university are preparing secondary education teacher candidates for the middle-level classroom through interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - Building a general education program from scratch for a population of first generation and underserved students provided both a challenge and opportunity. Faculty who had limited previous experience teaching and assessing first year students engaged in study of the best practices and research. Faculty designed a four-year general education curriculum that began with a robust First Year Seminar (FYS) course, the focus of this study. This required three-credit hour interdisciplinary humanities course (FYS) was designed to embrace the understanding of what it means to be human, including understanding oneself in relation to the natural world and to others. Full time faculty from all disciplines were selected through a competitive process to teach the FYS course with embedded High Impact Practices (HIPs). Four years of teaching FYS has provided qualitative and quantitative data on the effectiveness of the design, the role of faculty, and application of HIPs. Through the course assessment process and data analysis, faculty have expanded their repertoire of pedagogical strategies to engage the first year student, and as a result, positively influenced teaching in their other courses. This report offers insights on strategies for course design, the role of faculty, and the power of selected HIPs that may be replicated at other institutions.

AB  - While the collaborative trend among professional social workers and librarians gains traction and attention, literature about the utilization of student social workers partnering with libraries is non-existent. Over 64,000 students are currently enrolled in master-level social work (MSW) programs throughout the United States and nearly all are required to complete at least 900 hours of fieldwork. Such students provide untapped skills, knowledge, and values that can help address the broader--and very real--needs of patrons. By reaching out to MSW programs, public librarians play a critical role in helping advance tolerance for a diversity of people and much-needed services. While the professional values and ethics of both librarianship and social work have strong overlap, librarians can invite social work students to partner with them; particularly as libraries are still considered nontraditional service points. MSW students can work with libraries to expand programing, strengthen outreach, and enhance the professional development of both social workers and librarians to the benefit of marginalized patrons.

AB  - Looking to the possibility that interdisciplinary, thematic courses can build student confidence in the writing process, this essay argues that a first-year writing course that combines close attention to rhetorical skills, readings about an interdisciplinary field, and a carefully scaffolded assignment sequence enhances the potential transfer of rhetorical skills through student attention to boundary practices, the ability to analyze multiple rhetorical situations and discourse communities, and the opportunity to engage in sustained research and writing.

AB  - This paper examines the issues surrounding low-income immigrants in the U.S. and the ways they shape the educational experiences of their young children. Using a multidisciplinary lens including sociology, family studies, education, and mental health, the authors analyse multiple perspectives towards the educational experiences of children in low-income immigrant families. After providing a sample case study focusing on the educational experiences of Burmese refugee parents with early elementary education (Grades K through 3) in the Midwestern United States, the authors frame desirable responses from policy and practice that would best support the educational experiences of young children in low-income immigrant families including (a) understanding cultural strengths, (b) creating a positive and inclusive classroom environment, (c) supporting bilingual and bicultural competencies, (d) providing immigrant families with leadership opportunities, (e) teacher professional development on mental health and poverty, and (f) building integrated supports for the family.

AB  - There is no previous study of the benefits of attending a national multidisciplinary conference dedicated to undergraduate researchers, despite the growing number of such conferences internationally. This paper addresses the gap in knowledge of the learning gains from these conferences, and reveals a student driven learning process, a multidisciplinary signature pedagogy. It presents the results of 90 in-depth interviews with student conference participants conducted over three consecutive years of a multidisciplinary National Conference of Undergraduate Research (2012-2014). This paper uniquely captures the student voice on their perceived learning gains from this experience. The results reveal that some students co-create a pedagogy of Foucauldian reciprocal elucidation, through a sense of "unfinishedness", allowing them to reflect on their own learning in the light of divergent perspectives, questions and frames of reference. Bidirectional exchange of ideas and insights enabled students to ask and answer questions that transformed each other's thinking, allowing them to arrive at understandings they could not have achieved by themselves. The opportunity to present research in an authentic setting beyond disciplinary and institutional contexts developed students' skills and confidence, giving additional value over and above the recognised benefits of engaging in research. The undergraduate research conference is framed as a threshold experience for the development of self-authorship. Significant implications for practice include supporting constructive dialogues between students and the creation of authentic and professional multidisciplinary contexts for sharing research.

AB  - The rapid development of digital technologies and their increasing application in many areas of everyday life challenge all citizens to continuously learn digital skills. This also applies to older adults, among whom digital literacy is on average less well-developed than among younger adults. This article investigates why retired older adults participate in opportunities to learn digital skills. Multiple case design with both qualitative and quantitative methods was used to include the views of older adults from Austria, Finland, and Germany. The results of this interdisciplinary study indicated individual, social and technical reasons for their participation in digital skills training. Practical implications and recommendations for future studies are suggested.

AB  - Communication and dietetics departments co-created an assignment to design health campaign materials for a rural South African community that promotes healthy eating habits for pregnant mothers and mothers of young children. The goal of this assignment was twofold. First, we explored the possibility of incorporating a service-learning element into a large module (approximately 500 students) that lacks resources to take students into the community. Second, we explored the impact of the service-learning element on students' investment in the assignment. The dietetics department provided students on the persuasive communication course with information to develop material for the Trompsburg community. The communication students applied the skills they learned to design audience-centered health campaign materials for the dietetics students to take to the Trompsburg community. Students overwhelmingly provided positive feedback, indicating that they were more invested in the project, that the projects would have a positive impact, and that they were able to apply course concepts in a real-life situation. We argue that cross-disciplinary partnerships can effectively provide larger and/or underfunded classes with service-learning assessment opportunities. Courses: This project was implemented in a large, multi-campus persuasive communication class, but could also be applied to any module that teaches content creation, such as marketing communication, strategic communication, visual communication, and so on. Objectives: The objective of this project was to create an assignment that allowed students to apply the persuasive skills they learned throughout the semester in a way that benefitted a rural, poverty-stricken, South African community. Additionally, we wanted to assess whether students could receive the same benefits of service-learning projects without directly engaging with the community they were serving.

AB  - Purpose: This research is an interview-based study that captures the academics' perspectives toward the planning and design of an interdisciplinary General Education Curriculum for undergraduate students in the Chinese context, using the Common Core Curriculum at the University of Hong Kong as a case study. Design/Approach/Methods: A total of 28 academics with various levels of academic ranking, disciplinary context, proven teaching excellence, and research productivities were individually invited for and consented to a semi-structured and face-to-face interview. Findings: This article suggests four fundamental and interrelated dimensions for consideration when structuring an interdisciplinary General Education Curriculum, namely, how to design, what is worth learning, how to learn and teach, and how to know students have learned. It is suggested that the ideal curriculum should remain coherent and coordinated, broad and balanced, as well as open and flexible, ensuring the capture of knowledge, skills, and attitudes, with the facilitation of active, authentic, and contextualized pedagogies and assessments. Originality/Value: This article has the potential of providing insight for policymakers and educators around the world to better structure an interdisciplinary General Education Curriculum by creating an overall springboard for future discussion. They can also integrate these evidence-based elements and strategies into their everyday practices.

AB  - Implemented was a 45-minute per day Primary Science IDEAS intervention in grades 1-2 integrating reading and writing within science instruction in a multi-year study conducted in 8 experimental and 9 control schools. Results found a significant direct achievement effect in grades 1-2 on both the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) Science and Reading. In addition, the direct effect of the intervention in grades 1-2 also resulted in significant achievement transfer from grades 1-2 to grade 3 on both the ITBS Science and Reading. Discussed are policy implications of the findings for increasing instructional time allocated to science in grades 1-2 and expanding the focus of grade 1-2 student achievement assessment to include content-area learning.

AB  - This mixed-method study explored academics' beliefs about interdisciplinary research collaboration (IDRC) and their influences on collaborative practices in a Chinese research university. Exploratory interviews with nine academics were first conducted to examine their beliefs about IDRC. The findings revealed that the academics' beliefs about IDRC fell into six broad themes, that is, IDRC: helps better address research problems; helps achieve innovative results; helps expand new academic fields; is challenging which requires crossing boundaries among disciplines; is a gradual process that takes plenty of time and effort; and is not necessary as some research problems can be addressed through within-disciplinary research. Based on the interview findings, a questionnaire was developed to examine the influences of academics' beliefs about IDRC on their self-reported collaborative practices and then administered to 659 academics in the university. Results showed that four of the six beliefs significantly and positively affected self-reported collaborative practice; one belief significantly and negatively affected self-reported collaborative practice; and one belief had no significant effect on self-reported collaborative practice. Differences existed among the academics of different disciplines regarding the influence of their beliefs about IDRC on self-reported collaborative practice. The practical implications of the findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Contribution: Prior studies on pedagogical methodologies to acquire soft skills have shown that developing collaborative tasks produces positive impact in students' abilities. In this article, a pedagogical approach based on interdisciplinary practice and realistic problems is proposed to improve students' teamwork skills. Background: Traditionally, soft skill acquisition has received scarce attention in high education curricula. Consequently, students finish their studies without having developed important competencies, such as communication, conflict resolution and teamwork skills. Intended Outcomes: Students who follow a realistic interdisciplinary approach improve both their soft and hard skills compared to students who follow a traditional collaborative pedagogical methodology. Through the approach proposed, students progress in completing tasks, participating in the team, collaborating in the organization, accepting agreements and taking into account the others' points of view. Application Design: The experience involved students from two different disciplines, prospective computer science engineers and preservice teachers. They worked together to design an educational application that required prospective engineers to apply Human-Computer Interaction fundamentals. A quasi-experimental study was performed using either knowledge tests or self-assessment pre-post-tests, both subsequently analyzed using quantitative methods. Findings: 1) The prospective CS engineers who followed the interdisciplinary realistic practice approach achieved better learning outcomes than those who did not; 2) the educational context affects teamwork skill development; and 3) students improved their ability to work and participate in the team after the experience.

AB  - Background: Post-COVID Syndrome (also known as Long COVID) refers to the multi-system condition affecting individuals following COVID-19 infection. This can include speech and language therapy (SLT) needs, including voice, swallowing, communication and upper airway difficulties. There is limited published literature in this clinical area of practice, particularly for those receiving input from community SLT services. Aims: To describe and compare demand, typical SLT presentation and service delivery across two National Health Service (NHS) Long COVID multidisciplinary services. Independent retrospective service evaluation was completed for each service. Descriptive statistics were produced and compared across services. This service evaluation followed The Strengthening the Reporting of Observation Studies in Epidemiology guidelines for cohort studies. Outcomes & Results: The findings indicated similarities across the two services in SLT service need and demand, clinical presentations and intervention approaches provided within Long COVID services. There were specific differences in the service provision and delivery of intervention in cognitive communication and upper airways subspecialities. Conclusions & Implications: This study highlights the clinical complexities of SLT needs in individuals with Long COVID and the importance for an appropriately skilled and supported workforce within effective multidisciplinary teams. We call for consensus on SLT practices and a consistent and standardized approach to evaluation for SLT needs in Long COVID.

AB  - This study represents an extension of longitudinal studies regarding personal financial literacy. Graduating college students must have a financial plan in place as they enter the workforce along with a "game plan" on how to attack their college debt. A college personal finance course can help each student develop their personalized financial plans. However, other college or university disciplines can help reinforce sound financial principles in their courses. If you think about it, "money" is a common denominator that links everyone together in our society. Shouldn't our universities and colleges be responsible for helping their students become excellent "money managing" stewards?

AB  - Multiple barriers in the structure and function of American higher education conspire to impede the success of interdisciplinary programs in environmental studies. We present an amalgamated narrative case study to illustrate how barriers operate both independently and in concert to undermine individual and programmatic goals, innovation, and operations, resulting in lost opportunities for faculty, students, and curricula, and other program elements. Barriers are illustrated stemming from a variety of sources, including academic organizational culture, structure, and leadership. An analysis of three main barriers and strategies to address them led us to produce recommendations that foster new patterns of faculty interaction and leadership. These recommendations are based on a foundation of human dignity, shared respect, and common values. In turn, they require a clear conception of interdisciplinarity and integration, and practical means to achieve them in diverse contexts.

AB  - Disciplines are by their very "origin and nature" unstable--always already differed and deferred from themselves--due to their genetic relation to what Jacques Derrida calls "diffÃ©rance". In a sense, "diffÃ©rance" is what makes disciplines possible in the first place, and it can be thought of as the economy or mode of operation of disciplines as discursive knowledge formations. In light of this view, interdisciplinary endeavors are also always already subject to the conditions of "diffÃ©rance". Interdisciplinary integration--necessitated by the differing and deferring effects of "diffÃ©rance"--should then be thought of as a matter of creatively producing relations-in-"diffÃ©rance".

AB  - Rate of change concepts from calculus areÂ presented and applied rather differently in college mathematics, physics, biology, and chemistry classes. This is not simply a matter of pedagogical style but reflects real cultural differences between these disciplines. We describe the efforts of our interdisciplinary collaboration to understand and reconcile these differences as we designed and discussed instructional videos for students. We summarize our conversations about terminology, notation, functions, rates, units, and sign conventions across the disciplines. We present some strategies that enabled us to communicate effectively, resolve confusions, and reach shared understandings. Our work has implications for others involved in collaborative interdisciplinary projects and for STEM educators. "In theory, there's no difference between theory and practice. But in practice, there is." -- Benjamin Brewster. Also attributed to Yogi Berra.

AB  - This study proposed plugged and unplugged approaches for young students to simultaneously improve their interdisciplinary learning performance in English and Computational Thinking (CT). The plugged approach involved adopting educational robots to enhance CT and to provide English vocabulary and sentence practice via a board game. The unplugged version of the educational board game involved using a conventional board game without a computer, although it was designed for practicing CT as well as some foreign language vocabulary and conversational sentences. The results show that both approaches were helpful for simultaneously improving the students' English proficiency of the target vocabulary and sentences, and their CT competence. The students' foreign language learning anxiety during the English conversation in the plugged game was significantly lower than that of the students playing the unplugged game. On one hand, the cooperation tendency of the CT scale improved significantly for the students playing the unplugged game. On the other hand, the critical thinking of the CT scale improved significantly for those using the plugged approach. This research provides an innovation development and evaluation for plugged and unplugged approaches.

AB  - The authors present the results of a study of a three-way international collaboration project among one Hungarian class and two classes from Michigan and Washington, respectively. This multifaceted study focused on business planning, web design, and accessibility with the aim of investigating the effect of accessibility instruction on the production of business plans and websites. The distinguishing feature of this study was its emphasis to orient the three student groups on disability and accessibility issues from the perspective of the critical social model of disability advanced by disability studies theorists. The researchers collected quantitative and qualitative pre/postproject survey data from their three classes. They combined this data with the text of student emails sent among the project teams and instructor notes about their teaching to arrive at conclusions about the effectiveness of the collaboration using a mixed-methods approach. The results from the data analyses revealed significant benefit of the client-provider relationships among the three classes and the accessibility instruction provided by the Washington class to the other two classes on the business plans and websites.

AB  - The implementation of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) at school is one of the challenges of education in the twenty-first century, especially concerning the development of critical thinking during argumentative interactions. In this paper, I refer to an interdisciplinary approach with the aim to analyze the implicit inferential reasoning emerging in argumentative discussions among children during scientific activities. The study involved 25 preschool children at a kindergarten engaged in three problem solving tasks. The first activity was to build a tunnel, the second to build a bridge--both with the use of LegoÂ©--and the third to build an hourglass with recycled materials. The tasks were video-recorded and the discussions transcribed. The analysis implied different steps: first, I identified the argumentative structure of each exchange according to the pragma-dialectical approach; then, I found the implicit premises using the Argumentum Model of Topics; afterward, I analyzed the argumentative discussions according to a sociocultural approach. The findings show a predominance of arguments based on causal relationships and indicate how children reason regarding complex aspects of a problem, such as the negative consequences of an action, the adequacy of the available tools, and the (possible) future conditions connected to the scientific activity they are involved in. The study opens a possibility to shift from how to implement STEM activities to what children already do when engaged in scientific tasks. It also encourages the adoption of an interdisciplinary approach to investigating the complex process of argumentation in preschool children.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the value of teachers guiding students to generate their own representations to support conceptual learning in science and across complementary subjects such as mathematics. However, this approach to an interdisciplinary focus poses challenges for programme design and learning assessment. In this paper, we report on a 10-week study with a class of Year 5 students designed to (a) facilitate learning of key concepts in the topic of optics (e.g. reflection), and (b) make meaningful links between these concepts and relevant mathematical ones (e.g. symmetry and angles). Students were expected to construct, evaluate and refine representations to explain various experienced phenomena. We report on an assessment framework developed and applied to student work. Our findings indicate (a) some subject and interdisciplinary learning gains, and (b) specific challenges around designing this kind of programme, student learning assessment and teacher understanding to support this learning.

AB  - This article presents results from a Scholarships in STEM (S-STEM) grant from the National Science Foundation that supported students from three majors and funded the development of cocurricular activities designed to increase the workforce development of first-generation and underrepresented students. Scholar cohorts were interdisciplinary, with students majoring in biology, chemistry, and environmental science. We present details from four categories of activities: library resources and information literacy, career services, professional development, and community engagement. We discuss how the process of designing the activities created collaborations between STEM faculty and student support staff and between faculty and regional employers and nonprofit organizations. Results from formative assessments are presented from the group of scholars as a whole, as we did not detect significant differences as a function of gender, first-generation status, race or ethnicity, or academic major. Overall, the community engagement events were rated more poorly than other activities because they were viewed as contributing less to gains of knowledge or skills. Finally, we found that how the scholars viewed the activities depended more on how we discussed the activities with them than on the scholars' academic or demographic features.

AB  - Objective: This paper explores the expectations of teachers to contribute to fostering students' wellbeing in the revised Norwegian curriculum. A new construct in the curriculum is three interdisciplinary topics -- health and life skills; democracy and citizenship; and, sustainable development -- included to give priority to prevailing societal challenges. Our specific concern is the content of these topics, and the extent to which they provide a framework for connecting with complex health and social issues. Method: Thematic analysis is used to examine how wellbeing is framed in the curriculum texts. Results: Our analysis reveals an emphasis on individualism, the responsibilizing of choice, and the importance attached to individual agency and skills in the three interdisciplinary topics. The topics emphasise the importance of informed, ethical, and wise choices in a way that disconnects people from the world around them. This limits opportunities for students to be introduced to a socioecological perspective on human existence as well as overlooking opportunities for developing a sociocritical approach to students' wellbeing through engagement with the real world. Conclusion: More emphasis on collective challenges and dilemmas might stimulate students' engagement and could thereby connect wellbeing to empowerment and to a sense of meaning in belonging to a larger whole.

AB  - This paper draws on the theory of Basil Bernstein and on more recent applications of it by Rob Moore, John Beck and Michael Young to respond to recent calls for the replacement of discipline-based university faculties and departments with "problem-based" curricula and programmes of study. It considers, particularly, the potential consequences of such a shift in higher education policy for the identities of university teachers, researchers and students, and suggests that these calls for reform are premised especially on the problematic assumption that, in Bernsteinian terms, "regionalised" curricular inputs can be expected to produce "generic" knowledge outcomes within the university.

AB  - Over the past two decades, academic and research institutions increasingly moved toward a transdisciplinary model of knowledge production where collaborations occur among disciplines with seemingly divergent methods and ideologies. More complicated than less-integrated modes of collaboration, transdisciplinary research has been described as an inevitable evolution of knowledge making in advanced and post-industrial societies. The author reviews some of the common communicative barriers that emerge in transdisciplinary and radically interdisciplinary collaborations, and argues that as institutional investments in transdisciplinarity become more tangible, researchers and teachers of disciplinary writing should rethink some approaches to writing to learn pedagogy in WAC/WID. The author posits that writing to learn pedagogy should consider teaching disciplinary conventions as situated and negotiable structures, and outlines some specific curricular approaches that could better prepare students for rhetorical effectiveness in future transdisciplinary collaborations.

AB  - Although a transdisciplinary approach (TA) is considered best practice for children aged 0-3 years, there is limited information for professionals on how to successfully implement TA services. Using qualitative inquiry, in-depth interviews were conducted to explore the experiences of 6 service providers and managers who took part in early implementation of 2 pilot transdisciplinary teams. Although sought, no parents were recruited. Data were condensed by a system of coding and developed into inductive themes. The study findings reveal 3 main themes that captured the experiences of stakeholders. The primary theme is "ensuring alignment with organizational values" when guiding teams through change. The second theme is the "awareness" that is needed for "managing change" when an organization is going through a transformation. The third theme is "valuable learning occurs throughout the change process." For early intervention service providers and managers, the study findings emphasize the importance of ensuring participants' awareness of change management processes while staying true to organization values when developing new team structures. Balancing theoretical knowledge acquisition and practical learning opportunities is essential when learning a new service delivery approach. Further attempts to explore the involvement of parents within collaborative teams are recommended.

AB  - At the end of 20th century and especially in this century the education field is undergoing a significant change not only as a result of technological innovations but also pedagogical innovations on the bases of artificial intelligence (AI), cognitive science and neuroscience. What interested us was the attitude of students and teachers towards these changes. In the research the participating students were arranged in two groups, the control group (CG), where conventional lessons were carried out and the experimental group (EG), in which teachers used a transdisciplinary cognitive neuroeducation model. The performance data for the both groups was acquired via questionnaire adopted from TIMSS research. The teachers' attitude towards these changes was mostly monitored via qualitative research. As is apparent from the results, a positive shift can be seen in the students' attitude towards school. And this positive attitude towards school can create in students the suitable motivation, which is the first and most important step towards quality knowledge. A positive shift was also made in the minds of the teachers.

AB  - There is an overrepresentation of students with disabilities within the population of students excluded (i.e., suspended or expelled) from school. Students with disabilities are suspended for behaviors that are, for the most part, nonviolent and not unlike the behaviors of their general education peers. The Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) states that a disability should not be a hindrance to full participation in society and that improvement in educational practices for individuals with disabilities will increase equal opportunity and full participation of this population in school settings. One of the ways in which IDEA strives to ensure such access is through a manifestation determination review (MDR). The purpose of an MDR is to determine whether the offending behavior was a manifestation of the student's disability or due to failure to implement the student's program. An MDR must occur when a student with a disability demonstrates a problem behavior that results in a change in placement. Conducting meaningful MDRs that result in informed decision making and appropriate allocation of supports is crucial to student success. This article describes the MDR process, the purpose and interdisciplinary nature of MDR committees, and best practices for an interdisciplinary MDR committee.

AB  - This study is integrated in the field of Dance in Education, focusing on the instrumentalist aspect of art. We focused on creative dance as a catalyst to learn Mathematics' contents. This interdisciplinary work can enhance the learning, as far as the understandingÂ of Mathematics' concepts is achieved through the body and revealed by expressive and creative movement. The main purpose of the investigation, quasi-experimental, was to analyze the impact of creative dance in the learning of Mathematics' concepts in children (7/8Â year old) in primary education, in two Portuguese schools. The sample included 8 classes, 117 children in total, of both genders. The intervention has taken place in two groups (experimental group and control group), with four sessions of creative dance in the experimental group. Both groups were assessed on three different occasions (pre-test, post-test and retest). The statistical techniques used for processing the data were the analysis of variance of mixed plans and the Student's t test for paired samples. The conclusions showed that the students who consolidated the knowledge in the creative dance classes, exhibited significant differences in their learning gains in Mathematics, as compared to the control group.

AB  - This article reports on findings from a research project on interdisciplinary collaboration between mainstream school teachers and special school teachers. The aim of the research project has been to examine the knowledge of special school teachers and how this knowledge can contribute to the development of an inclusive learning environment in mainstream schools. Not as a simple task of transferring knowledge, but as a process of transforming knowledge through interdisciplinary collaboration and co-teaching. The design of the study is inspired by the notion of participation within action research as a research approach. Thus the thick data generated from reflective activities in the study design are analysed within a narrative and practice directed strategy of analysis.

AB  - School psychologists have long been regarded for their expertise in the assessment, evaluation, and delivery of mental and behavioral health services for children in schools. Given the growing attention to school safety, crisis prevention, and crisis intervention, school psychologists are also increasingly called upon to assist with systems-level prevention efforts and individual assessments of risk for targeted violence through participation in school-based threat assessments. In this article, I define the role of the school psychologist within the multidisciplinary threat assessment team in conducting comprehensive assessments and developing individualized interventions to mitigate threats of violence in schools. From my experience conducting threat assessments as a school psychologist, implications for schools, school-based practitioners, and university trainers are also explored.

AB  - Undergraduate research experience has been shown to enhance student learning and improve persistence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Researchers studying undergraduate research experiences have largely focused on student outcomes and have seldom investigated the outcomes of graduate and postdoctoral mentors. Here, we report a non-credit, year-long mentor professional development program designed for graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and research staff in STEM. Mentors attended a series of six interactive and discussion-based workshops and mentored first-year undergraduate students in independent summer research projects. We report evaluation findings for three mentor cohorts using a combination of qualitative analysis of mentoring philosophies and quantitative assessment of pre- and post-surveys about mentoring objectives and skills. Results indicate that mentors gained self-efficacy in some objectives and skills. However, many other objectives and skills remained unchanged. We explore possible explanations for the lack of more broad-scale gains across survey items and present ideas for program improvement.

AB  - This work identifies the human service sector as an important and growing destination for psychology graduates. It further identifies a number of key themes which flow from that observation and which are important to configuring psychology education in a way which takes account of emerging trends. The major theme identified in the research is the importance of breadth. The theme of the importance of breadth takes two related and repeated forms. The first is that graduates need to be thinkers rather than doers. The second is that employers in the human services stress the need for broad-based thinking and analytical skills to reflect social and contextual awareness of therapeutic situations and human service programmes and interventions. Stakeholders broadly commented that graduates seeking employment in the human service sector need upskilling in terms of a contextual awareness of the "real world". One idea which emerged in this research is that real-world multidisciplinarity is best underpinned by an interdisciplinary approach to teaching and learning.

AB  - Universities increasingly incorporate multidisciplinary design projects into their curriculum to better prepare their students for the labor market. In these projects, student team members of various disciplinary backgrounds develop new product or service concepts for organizational partners. This structure enables students to learn not only from the interaction with the content and lecturer, but also from communication with other team members. Little is known, however, about the relative effectiveness of specific communication modes on improving student learning outcomes in these interactions. This study examines the effect of three important communication modes--metaphors, visualizations, and narratives--on reported learning from other members. A total of 64 students working on two large multidisciplinary design student teams participated in this study. Survey results indicate that perceived learning increases through awareness and use of metaphorical communication, beyond previously supported effects for narratives and visualization. We conclude with implications for the way information is represented and structured within multidisciplinary design student teams, and future research directions.

AB  - An integrated curriculum that is transdisciplinary in nature seems to be a good fit for 21st Century learning. There are, however, few examples of transdisciplinary curriculum at the K to 12 level. One exception is the International Baccalaureate's Primary Years Programme (PYP) which features transdisciplinary curriculum for students from ages 3 to 12 around the world. This phenomenological study explored the lived experience of 24 PYP educators to deepen understanding of what such a curriculum looks like in practice. Three main themes were identified. The first, "It's a framework" outlines participants' understandings of transdisciplinary teaching and learning and the freedom a transdisciplinary framework can bring. The second theme, "Get on board", examines participants' thoughts around what is required to successfully implement a transdisciplinary curriculum. The final theme, "Their learning journey", discusses participants' beliefs around the success of a transdisciplinary curriculum. In general, participants appreciated the transdisciplinarity of the program. Concerns revolved around implementation issues. Suggestions on how to implement transdisciplinary teaching and learning in other contexts are provided.

AB  - Purpose: Problem-based learning (PBL) has been suggested as an approach to education for sustainable development (ESD); however, the integration of interdisciplinarity is continuously challenged as it requires transfer and collaboration across disciplinary boundaries, as well as integration into an often already-overflowing curriculum. Even in formalized PBL universities emphasizing student responsibility for defining relevant problems, envisioning sustainable solutions and developing transversal competences, interdisciplinary collaboration is still often "relocated" to extra-curricular activities. This paper aims to explore Aalborg University (AAU) Megaprojects as a case for systematically integrating principles of ESD, and particularly interdisciplinarity, into PBL at scale. Design/methodology/approach: The paper proposes a framework for analysing potentials and challenges concerning interdisciplinary framing and facilitation in large-scale projects based on PBL- and ESD-related research and presents findings from a case study on the first three rounds of megaprojects at AAU in 2019 and 2020. Findings: The findings indicate that interdisciplinary megaprojects have the potential to motivate students to engage in sustainable development; however, they require systematic framing and guided facilitation, particularly in the early stages, for students to take ownership, prioritize collaboration and see the contribution to and connection between disciplines. They also need prioritization at all institutional levels to succeed as an institutional strategy of ESD. Originality/value: The paper provides insights into the potentials and challenges of framing and facilitating large-scale megaprojects as an approach to integrate the SDGs and interdisciplinary collaboration into higher education. Hence, it aims to provide new insights, concepts and practices for ESD and PBL for sustainability.

AB  - The study aimed to investigate the effect of an interdisciplinary STEM course on children's attitudes of learning and engineering design skills. A total of 449 elementary school children in China were recruited from three different grade levels (i.e., second, fourth and sixth grade) to participate in this study. All participants attended a weekly interdisciplinary STEM course for two consecutive semesters. In order to understand how an integrative STEM curriculum interplayed with participants' attitudes of learning and engineering design skills, we conducted two measures to assess the results: the attitude measure (i.e., the attitude of learning questionnaire) and the outcome measure (i.e., the STEM knowledge assessment and the scenario design assessment). Meanwhile, pre-and-posttests were implemented for each measure when comparing the differences in learning. Our findings revealed that an interdisciplinary STEM course led to positive changes in children's attitudes of learning, yet its effect on different grade levels could vary depending on children's cognitive development. In addition, interdisciplinary learning experiences significantly improved second and fourth graders' engineering design skills, particularly in the scenario design assessment. Lastly, we summarized the relationship between one's attitudes of learning and engineering design skills along with its educational implications.

AB  - Research shows that interdisciplinary learning approaches increase student knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. However, there is little empirical evidence about teacher enactment of interdisciplinary curricula, especially at the middle school level. In the Designing Biomimetic Robots (BioRobots) project, teachers received professional development and enacted an interdisciplinary robotics curriculum in middle school classrooms. The purpose of this study was to explore how a science and an engineering teacher enacted an interdisciplinary curriculum, designed to support teachers in both disciplines. We sought to understand the choices they made during curricular implementation and the ways in which they supported students' use of disciplinary practices. We conducted participant observations, collected teacher implementation logs, and interviewed teachers. Analysis was through deductive coding and analytic memos. Results indicate that both teachers' enactment aligned with the overarching curricular goals. However, as others have found, the specific material adaptations and enactment choices they made were all influenced by their disciplinary background, goals, and the school context. Careful design of this educative curriculum supported the teachers to teach disciplinary content and practices outside their area of expertise. One implication for the design of educative curriculum is to make explicit the commonalities across the disciplines.

AB  - The importance of accurate identification and high-quality intervention for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is indisputable. Clinicians from multiple professions need adequate knowledge of ASD to make appropriate referrals to specialists, conduct thorough evaluations, and provide effective interventions. ASD knowledge development for many professionals may start at the pre-service training level. An interdisciplinary sample consisting of trainees from Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities (LEND) programs and University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities (UCEDDs) across the country (N = 155) was evaluated on their objectively measured ASD knowledge using the ASKSP-R. Self-reported knowledge of ASD and self-reported confidence in providing services to individuals who have ASD was evaluated using a 0-100 scale. Results from an ANOVA demonstrated a significant difference in objectively measured knowledge across disciplines, F(7, 146) = 4.68, p < 0.001. Specifically, trainees in psychology had significantly higher levels of objectively measured ASD knowledge than trainees in physical/occupational therapy, social work, and non-clinical disciplines. Pre-service and professional development experiences predicted trainees' objectively measured ASD knowledge, self-reported ASD knowledge, and self-reported confidence. Implications and recommendations regarding interdisciplinary training to improve outcomes for individuals with ASD are discussed.

AB  - This article reports on the early stages of a community-based participatory action research project aimed at understanding how medical, educational and social service providers in our community partner with refugee families whose children have special health care needs, what challenges they face, and how we might collaboratively address identified needs through forming a community of practice and collaboratively conducting action research. In this manuscript, we detail the methods used to gather interdisciplinary professionals from our community in focus groups centered on how participants collaborated and supported refugee families of children with special health care needs and how we could join together to engage in action research to benefit their work. Findings reveal strengths, barriers, and needs related to interdisciplinary collaboration and ideas for community-engaged action research projects on which the community of practice could focus moving forward. An implication of this study is the importance of participatory processes for initiating action research projects within the community. We also offer guidance around potential areas for improved practice across school, medical and community settings when serving refugee families whose children have special health care needs.

AB  - What will future rhetoric, composition, and communication graduate programs value, prioritize, and pursue? How will graduate studies in these disciplines evolve over coming decades in response to "new composition"? One program that explores such questions is the Rhetorics, Communication, and Information Design (RCID) PhD program at Clemson University. Since its creation in 2005, the RCID program has prepared doctoral students for innovative research, teaching, professional careers, and creative work. By prioritizing transdisciplinary research, committing to rhetoric as a connection builder, and recruiting diverse student populations through both residential and online options, this program continually updates what graduate study in rhetoric, composition, communication, and information design can do in the world. This article provides a profile of this program, showcasing the value, as well as some of the challenges, of interdisciplinary graduate degrees for the discipline of rhetoric and composition. The authors contend that interdisciplinary training, like that offered in Clemson's Rhetorics, Communication and Information Design PhD (RCID) program, prepares students to respond to both a narrowing job market and an increasingly diverse student population with broad backgrounds. RCID works to answer the call of composition scholars to broaden our definition of composing beyond hands on laptops and pen and paper to account for the needs of more diverse populations of students.

AB  - Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) incorporate research opportunities into the existing curriculum often by providing alternatives or replacing the traditional cookbook-based laboratory courses. Over the past 50 years, CURE courses have been shown to benefit both students and faculty members alike. Despite the large number of available publications on CUREs, few focus on their implementation at the first-year level. This article reports the design and implementation of a new interdisciplinary CURE based on antibiotic discovery that combines General Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Microbiology concepts allowing self-enrolled first-year students to satisfy the requirements for General Chemistry Laboratory I. The applicability and success of this CURE course is demonstrated through the significance of student-generated experimental results, improvement in competence tests, and affective surveys.

AB  - The article focuses on the re-constructions of power-securing structures behind social inequalities. This conceptual study aims to synthesize different transdisciplinary studies from critical age, gender, race, and disability studies to gain an intersectional view of the power effects of discriminatory social habits, practices, and structures. The results show an intersectional synthesis regarding the phenomenon of adultism. A typical definition of adultism is the abuse of power by adults towards children while adulthood/childhood are socially constructed. Adultism can be seen as the discriminatory axis of social positioning according to age or generation, consisting of subordinating social practices and attitudes that subsume into social norms and structures. The theoretical concept of adultism contains various methodological approaches and paradigms. Different fields according to social constructivism like ethnomethodology, poststructuralism, linguistics, and symbolic interactionism emerge into a new theoretical framework. Their offered terms like Doing Difference or Age, Subjectivation, and Generationing, are contrasted and brought together into a new theoretical framework and a Theory of Childilization. This theory shows a necessary shift of perspectives to the approach of critical adulthood and the question of how childhood is performed by adulthood regarding generationing practices, structures, and privileged adult acting. The new theory reveals recurring patterns, discriminatory structures, and dominating practices based on the example of adultistic narratives. These narratives combine the mentioned disciplines around the subject related to structures, interactions, and cultures. Here, using a relational perspective, unseen, unspoken, and unheard practices by adults are uncovered, and can be applied to a reframing of education and learning environments, or of negative power effects on the lower-status group of children. The theory of Childilization is enfolded in a triad of mature-normative framing, re-framings, and counter-framings to new perspectives on adultism. With empirical evidence, the article shows a re-framing of learning and identity-building on a community-based level and examples of counter-framings by young actors. In the context of a Hawaiian case study, age-different learning environments of progressive education at six schools in Oahu (n=6) can be shown. The case study illustrates examples of critical adulthood in contrast to common adultistic narratives like pathologizing, or educative ordering and the realization of some counter-framings of children. And finally, it emphasizes the necessity of conceptualizing adultism on the part of those affected--accompanied by the demand to equalize children's rights and to deconstruct adultistic concepts of "being a minor child" vs. "being a mature adult". The article is therefore challenging "good" norms and orders of adult societies, citizenship, education, and even research and sciences.

AB  - Objectives: Policymakers, health services researchers, community leaders and health care delivery organisations are key stakeholders in addressing economic, environmental, social and systemic barriers to health equity in vulnerable communities. However, they often operate in silos, leaving gaps in efforts to effectively address health disparities. It is important to develop a new approach to influencing responsive health equity--focused policies. Design: An innovative, collaborative model is outlined that leverages strengths across these four stakeholders to reduce inequity in target populations. The model brings together undergraduate and graduate student researchers in a front-end policy partnership with elected officials based on mutually agreed-upon commitment to address local health disparities impacting the policymaker's constituency. Setting: Students and faculty at Arizona State University partnered with the office of a Phoenix City Council member representing a constituency largely comprised of low-income and Hispanic community members. Method: Relationships were developed with the policymaker specifically targeting food insecurity and paediatric asthma. Graduate student researchers conducted academic placements within the elected official's office, attended relevant municipal meetings, engaged with local community-based organisations and partnered with a major academic medical centre to collect data and understand current efforts related to the two focus areas. Results: Elected officials were provided with a policymaker-tailored toolkit including a current state analysis, stakeholder assessment and recommendations for action. Collective discussion took place concerning the strengths and limitations of stakeholders' ability to improve population health and present findings from the model's first application to local government. Conclusion: By ensuring 'buy-in' from policymakers at the onset of collaboration, stakeholders worked as a transdisciplinary team to translate academic research into actionable policy to benefit high-need communities. This model adopted can potentially accelerate and improve the development and implementation of actionable policies, thereby increasing social capital and building relationships with policymakers to address the root causes of health inequities.

AB  - Contemporary research models are becoming increasingly transdisciplinary (TD), multilevel, community-connected, and bent on expediting the movement of research to impact. This requires not only fresh thinking about the science of social work but an educational architecture that fosters both cross-disciplinary understanding of complex underlying determinants and the ability to translate that knowledge into effective, sustainable action. This article illustrates the need for greater intentionality and coherence in preparing social work practitioners and researchers for participation in this changing landscape. We focus here on doctoral level training, but underscore opportunities for a robust educational "pipeline" linking undergraduate and graduate professional degree preparation to that at the doctoral and postdoctoral levels. We summarize selected literature that defines and operationalizes TD translational research, reflect strategically on social work's positioning within this scientific "marketplace," and offer recommendations for capacity building in social work doctoral education.

AB  - Industry and Community Project Units (ICPU) are a work-integrated learning (WIL) initiative designed to provide an interdisciplinary, project-based experience for students based on real-world industry problems. With any new program, reflecting on the course delivery is essential for future quality improvement. Brookfield (2017) has suggested many student-centred approaches through which we can reflect on teaching practice, including Letters to Successors, whereby current students reflect on their experience and provide guidance for surviving and thriving the course, in a letter to future students. This study aimed to analyse the anonymous Letters to Successors penned by four separate ICPU cohorts, to understand students' perceptions of undertaking interdisciplinary, industry-based projects. The text within the Letters to Successors was analysed adopting a thematic analysis, using a realist and inductive approach. Four key themes were identified in the letters: working with others, focusing on tasks, having fun, and the unique experience. The students were overwhelmingly positive in describing their experience and were grateful for the opportunity to participate in a unit unlike others in their degree programs. Many of the skills and behaviours the students attributed to success align with the transferable skills required to develop their employability; this demonstrates the value of this non-placement WIL initiative as an alternative for traditionally lengthy placements or internships that can be burdensome for both student and industry. Further research to expand our findings, or to alternatively explore the views of staff and industry partners, would be valuable in ongoing evaluations of interdisciplinary, industry-based projects as an alternative model of WIL.

AB  - The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) have described discipline-specific literacy skills needed to successfully engage with science concepts, and science assessments ask students to use language in many and varied forms to mediate their science thought and actions and prove mastery of content. Yet many science teachers have not been prepared with skills that help them recognize the ways literacy is integral to the discipline of science, much less integrate it. This research explored the experiences of three classroom science teachers as they worked to enact overlapping English Language Arts and science standards inherent in CCSS and NGSS through inquiry-based instruction. The 4Es' heuristic framed analysis of classroom observations of instruction, teacher interviews, and surveys. Ways the teachers utilized inquiry-based instruction to "E"ngage their students, "E"licit/Engineer their literacies, and "E"xamine and "E"valuate discipline-specific language practices are analyzed, with recommendations for specific, interdisciplinary, and ongoing support teachers will need in order to realize the disciplinary literacy goals of the CCSS and NGSS.

AB  - Over the last three decades, interdisciplinary cluster hiring programs have become popular on research university campuses as an approach to fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. These programs have not yet been rigorously evaluated across multiple institutions and multiple thematic fields. The paper reports the results of a survey of 199 cluster hires across 20 research universities, supplemented by interviews with 18 administrators and cluster leads at nine universities. Against the expectation of advocates, the survey responses indicate that cluster hire groups are often loosely organized and members do not typically spend much time collaborating with others in their group. Both the existence of common research agendas and the participation of individuals capable of translating across disciplinary languages are associated with higher levels of satisfaction with the collaborative environment of clusters, net of covariates, as are adequate lab spaces. Even if they do not typically lead to high levels of collaboration, clusters can, in the best case scenarios, help universities to align with emerging research areas in ways that departments may have difficulty doing.

AB  - For higher education graduates to be effective in the workplace, they require strong technical skills and the capability to operate across diverse knowledge landscapes to solve real world problems. At an Australian university, an interdisciplinary, short-term study tour programme was utilised to enhance students' inexplicit employability skills with a focus on managing complexity while developing agility and creativity. To investigate the effectiveness of such a programme, we examined students' perceptions of an interdisciplinary teamwork assessment task that was undertaken in an international context via a study tour model. We achieved this by, first, introducing a purposely designed interdisciplinary teamwork assessment task, which focused on students presenting innovative ideas to peers and industry members. Second, we elicited student responses via a case study approach that incorporated mixed methods, utilising several data collection instruments prior to, during, and after students participated in a study tour. The findings suggest that integrating a purposely designed interdisciplinary teamwork assessment task, via a short-term study tour model, uncovered certain inexplicit employability skills, namely managing complexity, developing agility and creativity. We make specific recommendations to support this insight, contributing to the mobility teaching and learning research field.

AB  - Methods traditionally used to teach and train in STEM fields are being used to educate for careers in homeland security, Wall Street investments, and financial planning. An example of this trend is the increasing number of courses offered at institutions of higher education, such as financial engineering, computational finance, and risk analytics. These jobs draw heavily on STEM knowledge and skills, and represent some of the most rapidly growing or wealth producing sectors of the U.S. economy. To better prepare non-STEM majors entering these fields, we developed an interdisciplinary science course for nonscience majors with the goals of reducing the negative perceptions and attitudes towards the science general education curriculum. This interdisciplinary course also created a venue to teach non-science majors how to deal with real world STEM issues. By engaging students in activities which promoted skills critical in STEM fields, we designed a course that integrated a sampling of content in physical and life sciences, while at the same time increasing scientific curiosity and literacy. This new course, STEM 1200-Scientific Decisions in Everyday Life was taught employing active engagement techniques and student-centered demonstrations to increase conceptual understanding of scientific concepts. Results of a Wilcoxon Signed Rants test on a pre- and post-course assessment question showed a significant gain in students' confidence in their conceptual understanding as a result of the engaging demonstrations.

AB  - To serve children with language impairments (LI), speech language pathologists and other educators need approaches supported by evidence (Hoffman et al., 2013). In evidence-based practice (EBP), educators integrate children's needs, strengths, interests, and preferences with research and expertise (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Cappello and Walker (2016) believe that visual-based experiences that capitalize on the strengths of children with language limitations provide access to the curriculum and promote equity for all learners. In this article, Patricia Becker suggests an interdisciplinary, literature-based approach for teaching kindergarten-to-second-grade children with LI through the visual arts. She begins by highlighting the importance of collaboration among educators who work with children with LI; identifying core beliefs and definitions of visual arts, arts integration, and universal design; and reviewing literature on the benefits of arts integration and literature-based approaches.

AB  - The learning goals of project-based courses are typically specific for each involved discipline. Game development is deeply interdisciplinary and some of its core principles are shared across disciplines, from art to programming. This article presents a project-based approach where students majoring in arts and students majoring in technology share learning objectives. The course has been developed in a Sino-Scandinavian collaboration. Experiences from well-established Scandinavian game development programmes have been transferred to a Chinese university context. This article presents an explorative mixed method evaluation of this course. The research design had two phases with an initial qualitative analysis resulting in a set of observations that were tested in the second, quantitative phase. A total of 34 students from a range of disciplines participated in a two week course. The quantitative analysis shows that art (n=13) and technology (n=14) students' reported very similar experiences and similar insights into core learning objectives. This study shows that deeply interdisciplinary project-based courses, with shared learning objectives can successfully be conducted even in a context with no prior experience of such approaches.

AB  - The purpose of this research study was to investigate the roles of English teachers and subject teachers engaged in the collaborative process of interdisciplinary teaching in English for Specific Purposes subjects at a Thai university and explore the benefits and drawbacks of implementing such collaborations. In addition, students' attitudes towards interdisciplinary teacher collaboration (ITC) in ESP classrooms were explored. Participants were English teachers, subject teachers, and students studying on ESP subjects. This research study used a mixed methods approach from four sources of data. The findings revealed the extensive roles taken on by both teachers involved in the ITCs. Roles for the English teacher involved being a lesson planner, teacher, learning organizer, and class activities designer. The subject teacher's role was identified as a consultant or informant, supporter, monitor, and facilitator. The benefits were that an English teacher gained confidence, reduced worry in teaching ESP subjects, and received instant feedback from the subject teacher. The drawbacks were that it was challenging to balance the different schedules of both teachers and that lesson planning was time consuming. Students showed positive attitudes towards this method of teaching. They liked to study because of the enjoyable and knowledgeable activities and the teacher's confidence.

AB  - This article of linked, short essays reflecting on the experiences of five female scholars across three disciplines--law, social work and political science--draws upon Britzman's (1991) notion of the "dialogic discourse" to explore how these professors' sense of self is constituted through interplay with colleagues and their perceptions of students within the classroom. The authors explore the teacher/learner relationship as a dialogue within which learners and educators shape each other as they come to understand how and what they know. What the collection makes explicit is what is often only implicit, that the ways in which professors understand their practices and subjective self is central to the identity of "a professor," which is never stable or certain, but is always a creative practice. Such practices, we argue, are best sustained through collegial reflective practices that help us make sense of ourselves and continue our work.

AB  - In defining successful collaborative international projects within the theory of change or logic model, focus is often on 'outcome' and 'impact'. Less empirical information is available regarding the 'input' and 'activities' aspects of this model. To address this knowledge gap and to offer insight into pivotal elements for management, this study focused on the lessons learned from the development and management of the international, intercultural, and interdisciplinary collaboration Caring Society (CASO) project. A needs analysis among project members was performed using a cross-sectional questionnaire with 31 multiple-choice and 10 open-ended questions. The combined quantitative and qualitative findings resulted in seven key elements being identified: information/communication, personal capacity building, finance, organization, time, facility, and quality. These elements are related in that the elements information/communication and organization play a central role with the element time mediating this role. Other elements such as finance, facility, and quality are on a secondary level of importance while personal capacity building is a meaningful outcome. The lessons learned from managing CASO as an international, intercultural, and interdisciplinary project are that: (1) managers should focus on how information is structured and disseminated as this increases the quality of organizational processes, (2) open dialogue through hybrid communication methods foster better levels of accountability and ownership of tasks, also leading to personal capacity development, enhancing a sense of belonging, and development of intercultural and interdisciplinary competencies, and (3) the role of finances, time and resources cannot be ignored as these impact quality, management, and organization of international projects.

AB  - This laboratory exercise integrates chemistry and biology concepts to give third/fourth-year undergraduate students an opportunity to apply knowledge from different subject areas to address a real-world biomedical issue such as pathogen inhibition using composite materials. It involves the preparation of a bacteria-derived cellulosic biopolymer through microbial cultivation, impregnation of the bacterial cellulose(BC) with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), followed by the analysis of the materials and the antimicrobial properties of the biomaterial-AgNPs composites. The methods are relatively simple and use inexpensive chemicals. A Tollens type approach is adopted to produce silver nanoparticles-bacterial cellulose (AgNPs-BC) composites by the reduction of [AgÂ­(NH[subscript 3])[subscript 2]]+ complex embedded in the cellulose matrix. The samples were dried by two different methods: freeze-drying or vacuum-drying. The dried AgNPs-BC films were evaluated for antimicrobial properties against a test organism, in this example, "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", a Gram-negative biosafety containment level 2 (BSL 2) bacterium, using an agar diffusion test. For additional flexibility and customization, options for dividing the chemistry/biology content of this laboratory into smaller units with an emphasis on characterization techniques of nanomaterials for chemistry majors are also discussed.

AB  - Public administration is a highly diverse and evolving field of scientific inquiry. The study domain is characterised further by often-competing paradigmatic perspectives and seemingly endless teaching modalities. There seems to be an increasing realisation that answers to complex societal challenges cannot be solved within the knowledge frameworks of individual disciplines. As a result, interdisciplinary teaching emerged to expose students to approaches, theories and methodologies from various disciplines of the social and natural sciences, in search of potential answers to these challenges. In spite of the qualities and potential contributions of interdisciplinarity, there may be fewer positive consequences for teaching efforts. This article intends to reflect on the potential consequences, both positive and negative, that interdisciplinary studies have on the teaching of public administration. The article will review the possible advantages or contributions of interdisciplinarity to the teaching of public administration, and reflect on the possibly less-desired consequences of interdisciplinary collaboration on curriculum design and teaching methods.

AB  - This paper illustrates how years 1 and 2 students were guided to engage in data modelling and statistical reasoning through interdisciplinary mathematics and science investigations drawn from an Australian 3-year longitudinal study: "Interdisciplinary Mathematics and Science Learning" (https://imslearning.org/). The project developed learning sequences for 12 inquiry-based investigations involving 35 teachers and cohorts of between 25 and 70 students across years 1 through 6. The research used a design-based methodology to develop, implement, and refine a 4-stage pedagogical cycle based on students' problem posing, data generation, organisation, interpretation, and reasoning about data. Across the stages of the IMS cycle, students generated increasingly sophisticated representations of data and made decisions about whether these supported their explanations, claims about, and solutions to scientific problems. The teacher's role in supporting students' statistical reasoning was analysed across two learning sequences: "Ecology" in year 1 and "Paper Helicopters" in year 2 involving the same cohort of students. An explicit focus on data modelling and meta-representational practices enabled the year 1 students to form statistical ideas, such as distribution, sampling, and aggregation, and to construct a range of data representations. In year 2, students engaged in tasks that focused on ordering and aggregating data, measures of central tendency, inferential reasoning, and, in some cases, informal ideas of variability. The study explores how a representation-focused interdisciplinary pedagogy can support the development of data modelling and statistical thinking from an early age.

AB  - In this article we study how members of an interdisciplinary research team use an online forum for communicating about their research project. We use the concepts of "community of practice" and "connectivity" to consider the online interaction within a wider question of how people from different academic traditions "do" interdisciplinarity. The online forum for this Grey and Pleasant Land project did not take off as hoped, even after a series of interventions and amendments, and we consider what the barriers were and how they might be overcome. Barriers to involvement included participants' expectations of interaction and collaboration--expectation that real interaction happens elsewhere, tensions between academic discourse and forum talk norms, unfamiliarity with the technology, and different conceptions of appropriate academic discussion. We suggest that common academic practice does not prepare us well for creating interdisciplinary research communities through online collaboration tools, whereas such tools are our best bet currently for including geographically dispersed members in collaborative projects. Therefore, careful planning and competence building would be necessary if such tools are to be used in collaborative research. Suggested interventions, based on our experience, include providing a more focused forum, making technical support easily available, and setting up particular tasks or items to debate, within a preset, synchronous timeframe, focusing on issues relevant to the project at that time.

AB  - In this article, I examine pedagogical understandings as captured through documented critical incidents of a transdisciplinary faculty self-study group which was designed and grounded in notions of sociocultural theory. I report from my lens as facilitator-participant-observer and from my work with eleven other participants in a three-semester research project in which we conducted individual self-studies of professional practice as well as a meta-study of the collective. A diverse data set, which included exit interviews, mid-project and end-of-project exit slips, and individual narratives, served to triangulate and support themes of our exchanging of pedagogical activities, learning with critical friends, and re-imagining our pedagogies. The study suggests that, as universities work to improve student learning, they might consider providing creative studio spaces for self-study of professional practice so that faculty can exchange their talents in order to more deeply understand and experience pedagogical innovations.

AB  - An uncertain world characterised by the complexity associated with 'Wicked' problems presents formidable challenges for the preparation of teachers. This paper reports on one cycle in a larger action research project in which subject specialist trainee teachers worked in inter-disciplinary groups to design and run classroom-based workshops on climate change for pupils aged 12-14. While the project sought to explore interdisciplinary working, subject specialisms and their values were not abandoned, recognising that diversity can lead to more powerful, collective knowledge being generated. The Wicked problem of climate change was initially examined from different subject perspectives, identifying the opportunities that the work afforded in each subject, along with the challenges that accompanied them. The findings suggest that trainee teachers valued the collaboration and the opportunity to develop different pedagogical approaches used by different subjects. The framing of the project around a Wicked problem supported trainee teachers in understanding that no one subject had an authoritative prerogative over the topic while the disquiet that the interdisciplinary project provoked, in some cases, served to instigate new transformative learning which stretched beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries.

AB  - In this critical literature review, we seek to understand why multidimensional, psychological measures of human emotion that have been popular in the study of emotion and learning to date, may not yield the statistical power or construct validity necessary to consistently explain or predict human learning. We compare competing theories and conclude that educational studies tend towards use of multi-dimensional models of human emotions which, while useful in educational psychology and therapeutic practice, suffer from psychometric flaws and generate lower power when used as empirical research constructs compared with the "basic emotion" models and their derivatives popular in the neurobiological, cognitive, and social sciences. Based on our review, we conclude that more extensive use of physiological measures and analysis of spontaneous emotion language, both rooted in the basic emotions tradition rather than continued psychological measurement of multi-dimensional emotions, may yield more consistent and significant results and reduce education researchers' reliance on self-report measures. Findings from the review may advance the selection of operational definitions and formulation of research questions for new empirical studies of the intersections between emotion and learning.

AB  - An integrative introduction to the sciences and an introduction to scientific writing can provide a strong foundation for broadly trained STEM majors to explore the interconnectedness of STEM disciplines and prepare them for scientific research. These goals have been accomplished through a sequence of two first-year courses, STEM 101: Integrative STEM Freshman Seminar and STEM 105: Inquiry Seminar. In STEM 101, students define the STEM disciplines, see the interconnectedness of the disciplines, learn scientific ethics, and develop team-building skills as they complete a group project that explores the nature and process of science. In STEM 105, students learn about and then engage in a variety of forms of scientific communication as they develop and present an independent research proposal.

AB  - Phosphates are essential components of any efficient fertilizer. Natural phosphate rock is, however, not available in every part of the world. According to the European Commission, phosphate rock has high economic importance as well as a certain supply risk--at least for Europe. For these reasons, environmental technology research has received a great attention from the stakeholders that provided support in developing processes for recovering phosphate from wastewater and sewage sludge to help to close the phosphate cycle and reduce potential risks, including eutrophication and its influence on the environment. In this paper, we present a design case study of integrating the idea of phosphate recovery into chemistry education via a nonformal learning experience for high school students in Germany. The paper discusses a series of experiments and shows how they were embedded through interdisciplinary curriculum development.

AB  - This study explores the types of professional learning teachers report when participating in an interdisciplinary team at the high school level. Most research on interdisciplinary teaming focuses on the middle school level, and it is unclear whether the benefits of teaming can be realized at the high school level. Analyzing teachers' reported experiences within this particular approach to collaboration is especially interesting because collaboration among teachers is often described as though it was a "natural" and "easy" thing to achieve, when in reality, rich and authentic collaboration can be quite difficult to foster. High-quality collaboration and teamwork are essential in all areas of life (e.g., schools, businesses, families) if outcomes are to be optimized. Focusing on interdisciplinary teaming at the high school level is of particular interest because much of the research pertains to teaming at the middle school level, and yet, high schools seem to be ideal contexts for facilitating teaming because often times students struggle with attendance, academics and dropping out during the first two years of high school and teaming offers a proactive approach to address these issues (Teaming, 2013). For this reason, the author uses social learning theory to analyze the professional learning of a newly created team of high school teachers.

AB  - This article examined the role of environmental interaction in interdisciplinary thinking and the use of different knowledge resource types. The case study was conducted with two classes (N = 40) of 8th-grade students, ages 13 to 14. The outdoor trail aimed to help students synthesize history, geography, and science knowledge. Two groups' discourse from each class was audio-Â­recorded and transcribed for content analysis. We coded the discourse to examine: (i) the use of different knowledge resource types (i.e., "contextual resource," "new conceptual resource," "prior knowledge resource"); (ii) the relationship among these knowledge resource types; and (iii) evidences of interdisciplinary thinking. Findings showed that contextual resources enhanced students' capacity to develop new conceptual resources and to activate prior knowledge resources. Further, about 80% of students' discourse demonstrated interdisciplinary connections of two subjects.

AB  - As a Mexican American school desegregation case, historians, legal scholars, and educational researchers have all explored "Mendez v. Westminster's" significance. Each discipline, with its own modes of analysis, has constructed a distinct interpretation of the 1940s California case. However, in focusing on different aspects of "Mendez," scholars tend to ignore complexities of the case that are fundamental to other fields. This is why I developed an interdisciplinary analysis of "Mendez" with the purpose to move the education field towards a more social justice understanding of the case. Doing so will unveil how racial and language categories changed over time so school officials and judges could manipulate the law to uphold White supremacy, segregation, and school inequality. Such interdisciplinary analyses can help unravel the multiple layers of discrimination that has perpetuated school inequality for decades.

AB  - The literature on interdisciplinary higher education is influenced by two overall trends: one looks at the institutional level of specially designed interdisciplinary institutions, while the other assesses individual interdisciplinary educational activities. Much less attention is given to the processes of creating interdisciplinary education initiatives within traditional monodisciplinary universities. In this study, we thus explore how interdisciplinary education and teaching emerge and develop within universities that have little or no established infrastructure to support interdisciplinarity. Using qualitative data from a multi-part case study, we examine the development of diverse interdisciplinary educational efforts within a traditional faculty-structured university in order to map the ways in which interdisciplinary educational elements have been created, supported, challenged or even strengthened by pre-existing monodisciplinary structures. Drawing on theories from economics, literature studies and sociology of education, we conclude that creating interdisciplinary education in such settings demands skills that we define as the 'art of managing interstitiality'.

AB  - This article, which presents an interdisciplinary research agenda grounded in a constructivist institutional approach, begins by unpacking relevant terms. It explains the new institutional approach in political science that simultaneously narrows the focus and broadens the scope of political research by encouraging a return to the "political" in political science while also opening political research to a variety of other disciplinary approaches. It then explores the ontological and epistemological assumptions underlying a constructivist approach. Such assumptions are an integral if often unacknowledged part of any research effort, interdisciplinary or not. The main part of the article then offers an interdisciplinary research agenda describing how political science, sociology, and history can provide an integrated constructivist guide to the study of political institutions. The article suggests employing a feld of consciousness approach to integrate the work of these three disciplines in order to situate interdisciplinary research on political institutions on the common ground of institutional standard operating procedures.

AB  - Challenges to the Arctic region abound and intersect. Warming, ice and permafrost melting, and pollution jeopardize health and food security of Indigenous and other Northern communities. Problems related to natural resource extraction and shipping are developing. Because these issues cross sovereign boundaries, they must be addressed multilaterally. The Arctic Council is the principal forum in which Arctic states and Indigenous groups address shared concerns in the region. We co-administered a five-day program on science and diplomacy in the Arctic at Dartmouth College in June 2017 to educate postsecondary students on Arctic challenges and governance, foster skills and confidence related to leadership and diplomacy, and inspire civic action in Arctic and international affairs. The program consisted of lectures, discussions, a teamwork and collaboration exercise, a negotiation workshop, and a Model Arctic Council (MAC)--a simulation of delegates' work in the Arctic Council. We found that students had strongly positive perceptions of the curriculum and felt that they accrued Arctic-related awareness and skills, while developing enthusiasm for engaging in civic affairs. Students attributed the program's value to the use of multiple pedagogies, especially simulation, an interdisciplinary environment, and mentorship from and engagement with Arctic Council and other practitioners.

AB  - Interdisciplinary education offers a collaborative approach to multifaceted topics, such as environmental sustainability. In this article, we present the conceptual framework and lessons learned from a team-taught course, entitled Sustainability, Energy, and the Green Economy (SEGE). Faculty from the departments of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology offered the course during the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 academic years at Bronx Community College (BCC). The described interdisciplinary approach was intended to engage students through research-driven, project-based learning using life cycle analysis (LCA) of a simple consumer product. By teaching solution-oriented approaches, SEGE translates complex real-world problems into classroom learning for nonSTEM majors. As compared to student performance and engagement data from three 100-level STEM courses at BCC, analyses of C or above grade performance, passing rate, and withdrawal rate indicate that SEGE effectively engaged and retained students. Additionally, student surveys are presented, and were used to guide instructional strategy for effective team teaching and assessment.

AB  - The first five years of a child's life are irrefutably important, establishing life-long health, social and economic outcomes. To optimize these outcomes, global policy is directing professionals from a range of disciplinary backgrounds to work more collaboratively than ever before with children in the early years. Such collaborations have proven problematic as individual disciplines and pre-service education requirements vary widely. Using Community-Based Participatory Research and Diffusion of Innovation approaches, this study aimed to develop an educational framework for professionals working with children in the early years and their families, to begin a cultural change for interdisciplinary collaboration and participation across the early years. Systematic reviews, modified Delphi rounds and focus groups identified the diverse demands of multiple professions, qualification levels and workforce agendas, as well as highlighting shared outcomes, knowledge and intentions across disciplines.

AB  - The expansion of ethics review, beyond its origins in medical research, is the subject of growing critical analysis internationally, especially from social science researchers. Our study builds on this analysis by considering ethics review specifically within tertiary-based educational research. As a foundation for a larger study, we explore the reporting of ethics review within articles from a snapshot of education journals. A cross-sectional review considered 125 articles from 24 journals spanning medical and nurse education, the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, and educational technology. Among similar types of research our findings highlight variation in institutional ethical review processes and outcomes. Despite most journals providing guidelines for reporting ethics review, adherence to these guidelines by authors or editors was not always evident, but more likely in health-related education journals. We argue that identified areas of variation may reflect the differing influence and proximity of biomedical values. This influence has been under examined in tertiary-based educational research but may contribute to inequitable learning, researching and publishing experiences, potentially adding to negative sentiment about ethics review.

AB  - Peer observation of teaching has been adopted as a method to improve the quality of teaching. It involves observers providing descriptive feedback to their peers on learning and teaching practices. However, although extensively described in the literature in the education field, its use as a tool for development beyond teaching skills has not been explored deeply, nor the best practices described. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare quantitative with qualitative peer observation, as well as to investigate the role of interdisciplinarity in the observation process. The present study results from experimental observation work carried out by four professors of higher education. Veterinary science, social work, pharmaceutical sciences, and education, the disciplinary areas of origin of the teachers, were the ecosystems in which the initial observation techniques were explored and applied, and the intention was to share good practices and pedagogical improvements through peer support. This study reports the experience of building an observation grid and its application, as well as the lessons learned during the observation experience. The aim was to evaluate whether the constructive criticism was focused on the pedagogical practices rather than on the content, which can be useful in understanding if the learning objectives are being attained, from the teacher's point of view. As such, we employed and assessed peer observation as a constructive, developmental process for higher education teachers from different fields of knowledge. The study concludes that feedback by peers is essential for the development of professional practice in higher education teaching, with the experience of qualitative observation being a fundamental path for teacher self-reflection in the search for their own authenticity. It further supports the notion that interdisciplinary differences, methodologies, styles, contexts, and practices can be used in a constructive way to improve course content and delivery, and, ultimately, to reinforce good teaching.

AB  - Western science has grown increasingly reductionistic and, in parallel, the undergraduate life sciences curriculum has become disciplinarily fragmented. While reductionistic approaches have led to landmark discoveries, many of the most exciting scientific advances in the late 20th century have occurred at disciplinary interfaces; work at these interfaces is necessary to manage the world's looming problems, particularly those that are rooted in cellular-level processes but have ecosystem- and even global-scale ramifications (e.g., nonsustainable agriculture, emerging infectious diseases). Managing such problems requires comprehending whole scenarios and their emergent properties as sums of their multiple facets and complex interrelationships, which usually integrate several disciplines across multiple scales (e.g., time, organization, space). This essay discusses bringing interdisciplinarity into undergraduate cellular biology courses through the use of multiscalar topics. Discussing how cellular-level processes impact large-scale phenomena makes them relevant to everyday life and unites diverse disciplines (e.g., sociology, cell biology, physics) as facets of a single system or problem, emphasizing their connections to core concepts in biology. I provide specific examples of multiscalar topics and discuss preliminary evidence that using such topics may increase students' understanding of the cell's position within an ecosystem and how cellular biology interfaces with other disciplines.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity and knowledge networking are at the core of current global, regional, and national initiatives concerning climate. Both scientifc knowledge and public participation are essential to enhance the capacity of different sectors and governments to respond to challenges posed by climate variability and change. Exchange and bridge building among disciplinary domains are needed as well as involvement of governmental agents and a variety of stakeholders in knowledge networks and quality assurance processes, with the aim of producing authoritative, relevant, and usable knowledge. This article presents initial results of ongoing research on a recently launched Regional Climate Center for Southern South America (RCC-SSA) that is distinguished by close partnership and continuous interaction. The dynamics of cooperation in this innovative interdisciplinary, interinstitutional, and trans-sector network are being ethnographically documented and their epistemic and political features analyzed. Echoing the World Meteorological Organization, combining perspectives of the meteorological community with diverse interests, expectations, and needs of the many relevant "users" is a core challenge for climate services in the region. Because of the broad diversity of decisions and decision makers, multiple networks of organizations or actors seek involvement of the best available physical, biological, social science, and stakeholder knowledge. They ask not just for predictions but for "translation" of climate information into outcomes of adaptation/mitigation actions. Current collaboration efforts offer lessons on how to understand and conceptualize new trends in research and political practices, with scientists of all backgrounds participating in deliberations involving technical claims and decision making. These lessons underscore the complexity and multilayered nature of difficulties and obstacles involved in co-production of knowledge.

AB  - A strong theoretical approach with a specific focus on disciplinary research characterizes the common science master's education in the Netherlands. However, a work-based learning (WBL) approach may as well be expedient and suitable for science education at master's level. In this paper, a case study is presented of a WBL-program designed for an academic setting: the one year Science, Business and Policy (SBP) master's track, offered at the Faculty of Science and Engineering of the University of Groningen. The paper describes the design and curriculum of the track, including its underlying theoretical framework, courses, multidisciplinary projects and work placements. Based on the SBP-track's design we identified six possible indicators of a successful elaboration of an academic WBL-program: the SBP-track (1) is designed in response to the Bologna process; (2) is offered fully within the curriculum of a master's program of a research university; (3) requires a sufficient academic level and disciplinary knowledge at entrÃ©e; (4) follows an educational project approach; (5) focuses on the integration and implementation of knowledge; and (6) applies learning objectives that are specifically formulated to match the WBL educational method. A directed content analysis of SBP work placements revealed an increase in the number of SBP-students between 2003 and 2019, with an overrepresentation of life science students, as well as a large variety of real-case problems addressed for both business and policy organisations diverse in sector, size and region. Students' grades showed a positive correlation between the initial theoretical preparation and the report made during the work placement. In conclusion, the societal interpretation of the Bologna process has been implemented successfully with SBP, by combining academic learning with gaining professional experience using a WBL-approach.

AB  - Innovative models of teaching through research have broken the long-held paradigm that core chemistry competencies must be taught with predictable, scripted experiments. We describe here five fundamentally different, course-based undergraduate research experiences that integrate faculty research projects, accomplish ACS accreditation objectives, provide the benefits of an early research experience to students, and have resulted in publishable findings. The model detailed is the Freshman Research Initiative (FRI) at The University of Texas at Austin. While there are currently 30+ active FRI research groups, or "streams", we focus this report on five different chemistry streams in these four areas (organic, inorganic, analytical, and biochemistry) to demonstrate how general chemistry laboratory skills are taught in the context of these varied research disciplines. To illustrate the flexibility of the FRI model for teaching first-year chemistry, we show how each stream teaches students three different skills within the context of their research: making (synthesis), measuring (UV-vis spectroscopy), and characterization. As a unifying example, all five chemistry streams describe using UV-vis spectroscopy to characterize new synthetic molecules, complexes, and compounds, followed by extensive quantitative collection, processing, and analysis of experimental data sets. The FRI model allows full integration of training in mandatory and accredited general chemistry skill sets with open-ended research experiences with unexpected outcomes in undergraduate science curricula. In turn, this model enables undergraduates to be productive contributors to new knowledge and scientific discovery at the earliest levels of the undergraduate experience.

AB  - This paper presents the experienced difficulties of students participating in the multidisciplinary, remote collaborating engineering design course challenge-based innovation at CERN. This is with the aim to identify learning barriers and improve future learning experiences. We statistically analyse the rated differences between distinct design activities, educational background and remote vs. co-located collaboration. The analysis is based on a quantitative and qualitative questionnaire (N = 37). Our analysis found significant ranking differences between remote and co-located activities. This questions whether the remote factor might be a barrier for the originally intended learning goals. Further a correlation between analytical and converging design phases was identified. Hence, future facilitators are suggested to help students in the transition from one design phase to the next rather than only teaching methods in the individual design phases. Finally, we discuss how educators address the identified learning barriers when designing future courses including multidisciplinary or remote collaboration.

AB  - Mental health services for rural youth are extremely limited, especially given the national shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists (CAPs). Patient-centered primary care medical homes (PCMHs) are often their only available portal of care, yet high-quality PCMH integrated models of behavioral health that include a CAP are rare. This manuscript presents a unique multidisciplinary teleconsultation model wherein integrated behavioral systems consultation was employed to increase access to integrated behavioral health services. Common referrals included complex presentations outside of provider comfort range or medication and diagnostic clarification. Primary concerns were symptoms of ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, and depression. Recommendations included referral to outpatient therapy, further coordination with the medical team, and follow-up with the CAP. Providers noted access to care, specialized quality of care, provider support, and enhancing principles of the PCMH as strengths of the teleconsultation. Challenges included patient engagement, scheduling/availability, challenges with the teleconsultation process, and provider-level barriers.

AB  - An interdisciplinary laboratory experiment was designed and carried out on the basis of the photo/electrochromism of N,N'-bis(cysteine)pyromellitic diimide (BCPD), suitable for organic chemistry laboratory I and physical chemistry laboratory II students. In the organic chemistry laboratory, students synthesized BCPD and studied its photo/electrochromic properties briefly. In the physical chemistry laboratory, students were asked to explore the photo/electrochemistry of the synthesized dimide through the use of various techniques such as UV-vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and conductometry measurements. By conducting this experiment, students not only learned the basic chemical concepts and techniques, such as photo/electrochemistry of imides, the use of reflux technique in organic synthesis, UV-vis spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry, but also perceived the interdisciplinary nature of chemistry research. Altogether, this experiment was designed to engage students in chemistry by connecting education to real-life situations, as well as indicating that their products in organic chemistry laboratory are valuable compounds.

AB  - Student learning and engagement are paramount for educational institutions. This paper examines the impact of an interactive learning space on teaching and learning for both faculty and students. Specifically, four faculty from disparate disciplines examine the impacts on teaching and learning of an active learning space designed for student engagement compared to traditional classrooms. Statistically significant results favor learning experiences in an interactive classroom due to ease of movement in the space as well as increased collaboration and active engagement. This work provides evidence that classroom design affects student learning.

AB  - Research models that bridge disciplinary, theoretical, and methodological boundaries are increasingly common as funders and the public push for effective responses to pressing social problems. Although social work is inherently an integrative discipline, there is growing recognition of the need to better prepare emerging scholars for sophisticated transdisciplinary and translational research environments. This article outlines a developmental, competency-oriented approach to enhancing the readiness of doctoral students and emerging scholars in social work and allied disciplines for transdisciplinary research, describes an array of pedagogical tools applicable in doctoral course work, and urges coordinated attention to enhancing the field's transdisciplinary training capacity.

AB  - The purpose of the traditional peer review process (TPR) is to provide a more constructive and scientifically rigorous critical review of scholarly research that builds scientific rigor and validity within diverse academic disciplines. Peer review has received criticism as the demand for publications in a variety of competitive journals has significantly increased while the number of individuals who are both willing and qualified to conduct thorough reviews is significantly declining. The purpose of this topic piece is to examine the overall efficacy of the peer review process and provide recommendations toward a more collaborative, transparent (i.e. "open"), and interdisciplinary communication process.

AB  - This study presents a conceptual framework for embedding interdisciplinary learning approaches in a postsecondary science program in order to foster interdisciplinary science habits in students. The framework was developed through the lens of a multi-year interdisciplinary postsecondary science program that encompasses a series of courses in which science disciplines are bridged within an authentic science research environment. The validity of the developed framework is supported by the empirical data comprising live experiences of the students obtained through questionnaires, interviews and focus groups. The data were processed and evaluated using content analysis and activity theory. This work provides design principles that will be useful for both program developers and education researchers seeking to launch effective interdisciplinary science programs.

AB  - The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether an experimental programme, based on interdisciplinary interactions between music education and history and the implementation of arts and cultural education objectives, could influence pupils' interest in Western classical music of the 20th century. The programme was designed on the basis of collaborating with music education and history teachers at two Slovenian primary schools and a Slovenian composer. Classes of pupils, aged fourteen and fifteen, were divided into an experimental and a control group. According to the outcome, the pupils in the experimental group showed a higher level of interest in contemporary classical music after the experiment than their peers in the control group. Furthermore, the pupils in the experimental group reported having listened on their initiative, to more classical compositions after the experiment than the pupils in the control group had.

AB  - Considering the need for writing and language programs to develop translingual and transdisciplinary pedagogies for teacher development at the graduate level (Canagarajah, 2016; Williams & Rodrigue, 2016), the authors examine the design of a multilingual pedagogy professional development series for first-year Spanish and Writing teaching assistants (TAs). As designers of and participants in the series, the authors explore the benefits and challenges inherent in transdisciplinary and translingual conversations and discuss implications for teaching and research in language and writing instruction and teacher development. In order to advance transdisciplinary and translingual approaches as a new normal in composition studies (Tardy 2017; Horner, NeCamp, and Donahue 2011), the authors hope to provide a professional development framework that adapts to the linguistic realities of different institutional contexts and students' lived language experiences.

AB  - As William Newell observed, in order to obtain an excellent undergraduate education, it is necessary for students to move between disciplinary and interdisciplinary educational experiences; additionally, he claims it is essential that "students alsoâ¦shuttle back and forth between the classroom and the outside world" (Newell, 2010, p. 12). This movement, both intellectual and physical, promotes the development of the perspective-taking that can help students better understand, and potentially begin to address, complex global issues (Newell, 2001). If moving between disciplines and beyond the classroom into the physical world (and back) could have an impact on students' perspective-taking development, what might happen if that movement happened across great distances -- if international experiences and the consideration of international topics were added to interdisciplinary learning? From 2010 to the present, faculty and staff at the American College of Norway, an international college serving American, Norwegian, and other international students, have developed and instituted multiple interdisciplinary learning experiences based on Newell's theory that interdisciplinary learning enhances high impact learning experiences like study abroad (Newell, 1999). This article examines three of these learning experiences and their outcomes within the framework of William Newell's theories, describing how the potent combination of international study and interdisciplinary learning can create significant growth in students' perspective-taking abilities.

AB  - In "Thinking Critically, Acting Justly," Naomi Yavneh Klos suggests that the key questions for honors education and social justice are first "how to engage our highest-ability and most motivated students in questions of justice" and second "how honors can be a place of access, equity, and excellence in higher education." These goals are both important and complementary; achieving the latter helps achieve the former. Honors education creates a fruitful space for inclusion where the knowledge and experience of diverse students develop skills oriented toward justice for the whole community. Making honors a place of access and equity prompts deeper engagement in questions of justice for all. Particularly in its emphasis on interdisciplinary and experiential learning, honors education creates, as Yavneh Klos writes, opportunities to "develop an understanding of the world in its complexities [and to] listen and engage [across difference]." Honors also prompts students to learn from the intersections of experience, recognize assumptions based in privilege, and challenge the notion that justice is about helping distant others. Through these practices, honors education is particularly well-positioned to cultivate empathy, a necessary foundation of social justice education. We base our conclusions about building empathy in honors education on our experience team-teaching an experiential, interdisciplinary course focused on mass incarceration in the University of New Mexico Honors College. Titled "Locked Up: Incarceration in Question," the two-semester course integrated methodologies and approaches from sociology and art, fostering interdisciplinary inquiry into the historic roots and contemporary practices of incarceration. The aim of the class was to cultivate empathetic and engaged citizens, both caring about the world around them and prepared to create change in their communities. During the fall semester, students examined mass incarceration as a civil rights issue and explored how art allows us to both construct meaning and communicate knowledge about injustice. This class prepared students for service learning projects during the spring semester, when student groups worked with community partners to provide requested services. During the activities of both semesters, students came to destabilize the false dichotomy between themselves--often relatively privileged students in their state's flagship university--and individuals directly impacted by the injustices of the carceral apparatus. Students found such complexities also mirrored in their own lives.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: This study was aimed at enhancing students' learning of software engineering methods. A collaboration between the Computer Science, Business Management, and Product Design programs was formed to work on actual projects with real clients. This interdisciplinary form of collaboration simulates the realities of a diverse Software Engineering team. Background: A collaborative approach implemented through projects has been the established pedagogy for introducing the Software Engineering course to undergraduate Computer Science students. The collaboration, however, is limited to collaboration among Computer Science students and their clients. This case study explored an enhancement to the collaborative approach to project development by integrating other related disciplines into the project development framework; hence, the Interdisciplinary Approach. Methodology: This study adopted the case method approach. An interdisciplinary service innovation activity was proposed to invite other disciplines in the learning process of the computer science students. The agile methodology Scrum was used as the software development approach during project development. Survey data were collected from the students to establish (a) their perception of the interdisciplinary approach to project development; (b) the factors that influenced success or failure of their team to deliver the project; and (c) the perceived skills or knowledge that they acquired from the interdisciplinary approach. Analysis of data followed a mixed method approach. Contribution: The study improved the current pedagogy for Software Engineering education by integrating other related disciplines into the software project development framework. Findings: Data collected showed that the students generally accepted the interdisciplinary approach to project development. Factors such as project relevance, teamwork, time and schedule, and administration support, among others, affect team performance towards project completion. In the case of the Computer Science students, results show that students have learned skills during the experience that, as literature reveal, can only be acquired or mastered in their future profession as software engineers. Recommendations for Practitioners: The active collaboration of the industry with the University and the involvement of the other related courses in teaching software engineering methods are critical to the development of the students, not only in learning the methodology but also as a working professional. Recommendation for Researchers: It is interesting to know and eventually understand the interactions between interdisciplinary team members in the conduct of Software Engineering practices while working on their projects. More specifically, what creative tensions arise and how do the interdisciplinary teams handle the discourse? Impact on Society: This study bridges the gap between how Software Engineering is taught in the university and how Software Engineering teams work in real life. Future Research: Future research is targeted at refining and elaborating the elements of the interdisciplinary framework presented in this paper towards an integrated course module for Software Engineering education.

AB  - Interdisciplinary inquiry is widely perceived to be essential for tackling the most pressing social and environmental issues we face (Brown, Harris, & Russell, 2010). Scholars from many different traditions have argued that the magnitude and complexity of such problems require the integration of perspectives and expertise from multiple disciplines to see "the whole" of the problem (Callahan, 2010; Kinzig, 2001, p. 709; Lubchenko, 1998). Federal funding agencies have sought to encourage both interdisciplinary research and interdisciplinary graduate training (Committee on Facilitating Interdisciplinary Research [COFIR], 2004); (National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2006); (National Science Foundation [NSF], 2011), and the strategic plans of universities across the United States have placed increased emphasis on interdisciplinary research and teaching (Borrego, Boden, & Newswander, 2014; Kezar & Elrod, 2012). In response, graduate training programs that seek to prepare students as interdisciplinary scholars have proliferated (Fitzgerald & Stronza, 2009; Klingenberg & Rothberg, 2010; McBride, Brewer, Bricker & Machura, 2011; Martin & Umberger, 2003; Vinhateiro, Sullivan, & McNally, 2012; and for a review: Clark et al., 2011). Graduate student interest in interdisciplinary training is strong, and the experiences they seek range from workshops and short-courses to full-fledged interdisciplinary degree granting programs. Faculty members often argue that interdisciplinary programs draw the "best and brightest" students (e.g. Buss 2003). Though it is difficult to find systematic analyses of the quality and quantity of applicants to interdisciplinary programs across universities, the authors write that their experiences at the University of Georgia support those arguments. The University of Georgia offers six doctoral programs that bring together faculty from different disciplinary units. These programs have a disproportionately high number of students who enter with outside fellowships or who have received university honorific awards. Cross-university data on student placement by program are similarly difficult to access, but there are indications that students who do interdisciplinary work--as part of a traditional department or in an interdisciplinary program-- do at least as well as their peers who conduct disciplinary research.

AB  - This article gives an account of creating and delivering a (trans)disciplinary writing-intensive course focused on translation and translingual writing. The course, offered in a comparative literature program at a Canadian university, was co-created by an applied linguist, a literature professor, and a curriculum theorist, and was inspired in part by the translingual approach to teaching and understanding writing and language in general. In this article, we first discuss the development of the course and its assignments. We then examine written work produced by multilingual students, reflecting on the development of their metalinguistic, disciplinary, and writing-related knowledge. We aim to show that a course like this, which uses translingual "content" as the basis for a writing-intensive course, can be beneficial for students' knowledge of language, literacy, and literature, and can encourage metalinguistic reflection that may allow student writers to recognize their linguistic repertoires as resources for academic writing in English.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to identify vocational teachers' experiences with interdisciplinary team teaching (ITT). Participants were five teachers from a science and technology-based vocational high school in Thailand. Qualitative data collection involved focus groups, interviews and observations. Findings were grouped into the following categories: teaching across disciplines; supportive and sharing relationships and roles; communication and decision-making; benefits; and challenges. Findings suggest that the interdisciplinary aspect may be achieved through engagement in project-based learning (PBL). The PBL approach can provide both a shared purpose and a framework and guidelines to support teachers' planning. Findings also point to the value of shared decision-making and leadership, and to the need for supportive relationships that take into consideration professional and personal issues. Implications relate to the need for open forms of communication that reflect trust, support and respect. Use of social media to support communication and collaboration should be accompanied by guidelines and rules established in advance by team members.

AB  - Purpose: Work-based placements are central to the university education of allied health and social work (AHSW) students. As a result of COVID-19, the clinical learning environment of students' work-based placements was dramatically altered resulting in numerous documented challenges. This inter-disciplinary study aimed to evaluate AHSW students' perceptions and experiences of completing a diverse range of work-based placements during COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: This study was a mixed-method inter-disciplinary study using an anonymous online survey consisting of multiple choice, Likert scale and free text questions. Mixed-methods design supported amalgamation of insights from positivism and interpretivism perspectives and enabled research questions to be answered with both breadth and depth. 436 students were invited to participate who were enrolled in five AHSW educational university programmes: speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, radiation therapy and social work. Data collected was analysed using both quantitative (descriptive and analytical statistics) and qualitative (thematic analysis) methods. Findings: 118 students participated (response rate: 27%) representing a range of AHSW disciplines who attended diverse placement settings. While there was extensive disruption in the learning environment leading to increased levels of stress and concern, a triad of individual and systemic supports helped to ensure positive work-based placement experiences and student success for the majority of AHSW students during COVID-19: (1) university preparation and communication; (2) placement site and supervisor support; and (3) students' resilience and capacity to adapt to a changed work-place environment. Originality/value: This inter-disciplinary study reports the work-based placement experiences from the professional education programmes of healthcare students during the COVID-19 pandemic, giving a unique view of their perspectives and learning during this unprecedented crisis.

AB  - A primary aim of science education is to teach students how to interpret and engage with scientific information. To do so effectively requires an adequate understanding of the nature of science (NOS)--in other words, what science is and how it works. There is a long history of evidence to suggest that many undergraduate students struggle to properly understand NOS. While the specific factors contributing to misinformed views on NOS may be difficult to tease apart, the way in which students learn about science at the undergraduate level is a significant contributor. We implemented a reflection activity in a unique first-year program at a large Canadian university in order to promote student learning of NOS. Through the students' reflections, we identified how certain pedagogical approaches, many of which deviate from traditional teaching methods used throughout undergraduate science education, can positively impact student comprehension of NOS. Our experiences support the use of reflective practices in promoting critical thinking and the development of more nuanced student views of NOS.

AB  - The paper analyzes the impact of interdisciplinary instruction on the perception, awareness, and knowledge about climate change of 102 Spanish pre-service primary teachers using a pre- and post-test design. Our findings demonstrate that pre- to post-test scores significantly increased in all the studied categorizations and that students' academic background influences score improvement. Data also reveal that there is a positive and significant correlation between teaching capability perception and knowledge, suggesting that knowledge instruction is crucial for teachers' confidence in climate change education. The study also confirms the opportunity to explore sustainable teacher education from an interdisciplinary perspective, carrying out congruent teaching from different approaches on a complex phenomenon to understand it in a holistic way.

AB  - We report on an experiment carried out among master's students in specialised translation involved in an authentic translation project at the University of Grenoble Alpes. With a view to designing an authentic translation environment for future translators, a collaborative and ergonomic dimension was integrated into translator training. Ergonomics has emerged as a new paradigm in applied translation studies and ergonomic factors have been shown to have an impact at physical, organisational and cognitive levels on how translators work. As a result, ergonomics was deployed through project-based learning and a collaboration was initiated between translator and ergonomics trainers. Second-year master's students were observed by ergonomists while carrying out a three-day translation project commissioned by NGOs. Students worked in a collaborative environment composed of learning labs and geared towards creativity and innovative pedagogy in addition to being equipped with ergonomics-related aspects. Data analysis aims at investigating the extent to which space was used to foster coordination in the translation activity and how work organisation developed between team members -- project managers, translators and reviewers -- and influenced each other's work. Group dynamics is further analysed through personality traits and opens onto perspectives promoting an interdisciplinary approach between translation and ergonomics.

AB  - Ecology involves learning the multiple processes that occur in an ecosystem in a non-linear manner. For students to understand the complexity of an ecosystem and the processes, an interdisciplinary teaching and learning strategy is essential. Crossing the four disciplines that constitute STEM education, characterizes STEM education as an interdisciplinary approach. This study prescribes Facebook incorporated STEM education to conduct the lessons on a dynamic ecosystem, and the effects are reported. Mixed method research encompassing experimental research and qualitative interviews conducted with From Four students (equivalent to grade 9) revealed that the new strategy, Facebook incorporated STEM education fostered students understanding of ecosystems. The paired sample t-test analysis indicated significant differences between the pre and post understanding scores. The qualitative interview analysis informed how Facebook incorporated STEM education resulted in students acquiring better understandings. The study entails an interdisciplinary strategy is essential for effective teaching of a complex process such as the ecosystem.

AB  - Teachers are searching for accessible, relevant, and engaging lessons for students as elementary classrooms grow more diverse and high-stakes testing constrict curricula and recess time. General music teachers may consider implementing lessons that blend popular culture with collaborative, interdisciplinary projects. Artist Keith Haring was inspired by 1980s hip-hop music and drew break dancing figures in much of his artwork. Both Haring's artwork and hip-hop culture have broad appeal and are accessible to students. The purpose of this article is to share an exploratory series of lessons that used hip-hop music and dance in conjunction with the artwork of Haring. The author provides a brief background on 1980s hip-hop music and break dancing and the artwork of Haring, then delves into the details of the collaborative art and music project completed with grades K-5. Tips for bringing popular culture into the general music classroom are offered.

AB  - By framing entrepreneurship courses in the context of interdisciplinary team projects, students build important work-related skills whether they pursue an entrepreneurial path or employment after graduation. However, the traditional classroom environment is not conducive to realistic interdepartmental interactions found in most corporations or startups. The authors describe a model for interdisciplinary collaboration between students in entrepreneurship and computer science engineering programs to cultivate the development of real software products. The authors outline the partnership and illustrate how sister courses covering lean startup and agile software development methodologies complement each other to foster realistic projects.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to describe faculty and graduate students' motivation and learning experiences in a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary graduate course focused on the nexus of food and nutritional security, hunger, and sustainability. Design/Methodology/Approach: A one-group pre-experimental case study design was used. Faculty and students completed questionnaires, which included rating scales and open-ended questions. Data were analyzed and triangulated into key findings. Findings: Results indicated that faculty were interested and engaged in the development of the interdisciplinary course, and students were engaged in interdisciplinary learning and developed communication and education skills through experiential place-based learning. Practical Implications: Faculty developed a common understanding of their different disciplinary perspectives that helped provide a more cohesive and complementary interdisciplinary learning experience for students. Students learned about global challenges while identifying similar challenges in their local communities through the experiential learning assignments. Theoretical Implications: The design of the interdisciplinary course helped students think critically and creatively to learn complex issues. Advances in technology and active learning support a flipped classroom model to engage students. Place-based learning combined with interdisciplinary classroom experiences connected students to local real-world contexts and provided students with practical applications of problem-solving, critical thinking, and systems thinking skills. Originality/Value: Graduate students conducted an asset and needs assessment, which connected them to professionals in the community. Students think food and nutritional security, hunger, and sustainability are global challenges and seldom notice food insecurity in their local communities.

AB  - The term 'clinical' is increasingly used to define the kind of teaching initial teacher education will produce. While affordances of this metaphor have been claimed, it has been less widely critiqued. As a teacher and a medical doctor, we bring our interdisciplinary understandings of curriculum studies and medicine to this analysis, to theorise what this discursive construct puts to work for education. In considering how 'clinical teaching' is used across the literatures of education and medicine, we find that claims made in relation to these affordances, such as novelty, and detachment from medical entailments, are flawed, and that instead, the word 'clinical' does political work as a hierarchical, gendered, normalising and de-professionalising force.

AB  - Design education has moved towards a collaborative practice where designers work in teams and with other disciplines to solve unstructured problems. Along with the cognitive skills involved in the execution of the design process, designers also need skills to work in teams, share information, negotiate common ground and reach consensus. Conversation is core to establishing successful collaborations and learning for students. In order to assess and facilitate collaboration skills, it will become necessary to understand what constitutes constructive and effective dialogue amongst students. The aim of this research is to compare expert versus novice interdisciplinary teams to understand how to better support teams to engage in constructive dialogue during educational design projects. Two cases were studied across different design domains during the problem definition, ideation and concept development phases of the design process. The cases involved a bio-medical fellowship project and an undergraduate product design project. The teams' conversations were recorded and qualitative content analysis was applied to reveal the cognitive processing and conversation activity that enabled the teams to progress during team collaborations. The findings show that during team interactions design teams alternate between four main cognitive processes, supported by a further six conversation activities to execute the design task. Experts were found to use these cognitive processes and conversation activities more effectively than novices. Recommendations are proposed that can guide design educators to support students during team interactions when solving design problems. The findings have implications for how team work is facilitated and assessed in education.

AB  - Building from a panel at the 2022 National Communication Association (NCA) annual convention, the present article seeks to ground communication studies/sciences as central to interdisciplinary conversations surrounding sexuality education and communication. Communication is integral to sexuality education, and topics of communication, sex, and sexuality education are researched across disciplines. Still, research on sexuality education within communication studies remains under-attended, and interdisciplinary sexuality education research remains siloed by academic discipline. Presenting a forum featuring both emerging and leading scholars in the field of communication researching sex(uality) education, the present article seeks to establish the academic discipline of communication as integral to research on sexuality education. To do so, we first discuss communication as an academic discipline and its advancements in sexuality education research. Next, communication scholars offer their expertise in sex(uality education) communication topics including family conversations, cultural influence, health inequities in education, and medicine. Collectively, these perspectives offer an understanding of current sexual health research in the field of communication, as well as next steps through direct application to conversations about sex, improvement to our medical and education systems, and community-based education and intervention. It is our hope that this article fosters a larger conversation about the importance of communication (studies/sciences) in sexuality education.

AB  - Doctoral students experience high rates of mental health distress and dropout; however, the mental health and wellness of engineering doctoral students is understudied. Studies of student persistence, wellness, and success often aggregate fields together, such as by studying all engineering students. Thus, little work has considered the experiences of biomedical engineering (BME) doctoral students, despite differences between doctoral BME research, course content, and career expectations compared with other engineering disciplines. In this qualitative interview case study, we explore stressors present in the BME graduate experience that are unique from engineering students in other disciplines. We analyzed a longitudinal interview study of doctoral engineering students across four timepoints within a single academic year, consisting of a subsample (nÂ =Â 6) of doctoral students in a BME discipline, among a larger sample of engineering doctoral students (NÂ =Â 55). BME students in the sample experienced some themes generated from a larger thematic analysis differently compared with other engineering disciplines. These differences are presented and discussed, grounded in a model of workplace stress. BME participants working in labs with biological samples expressed a lack of control over the timing and availability of materials for their research projects. BME participants also had more industry-focused career plans and described more commonly coming to BME graduate studies from other fields (e.g., another engineering major) and struggling with the scope and content of their introductory coursework. A common throughline for the stressors was the impact of the interdisciplinary nature of BME programs, to a greater extent compared with other engineering student experiences in our sample. We motivate changes for researchers, instructors, and policymakers which specifically target BME students and emphasize the importance of considering studies at various unit levels (university department level vs college level vs full institution) when considering interventions targeting student stress and wellness.

AB  - This article presents a model for Intercultural Teaching Competence (ITC) that instructors may use as a tool for reflection as they prepare to facilitate learning across cultures. Building on previous research on intercultural competence, culturally relevant teaching, intercultural trainer competencies, and student-centred approaches to teaching, the model identifies concrete facilitation techniques for instructors who would like to further develop their own teaching practice or mentor colleagues in effective teaching across cultures. The model consists of 20 instructor competencies grouped into three categories: foundational skills, facilitation skills, and curriculum development skills for intercultural learning. While intended as a tool to guide instructors in individual and group reflection on inclusive teaching practices, the ITC model may also be used by educational developers to guide feedback during classroom observations or while supporting curriculum internationalisation initiatives. Recommendations for use in faculty learning communities and workshops are included at the end of the article. The ITC model will benefit instructors in a variety of disciplines who teach in diverse and multidisciplinary classrooms, discuss global or social justice issues in their class, and those who seek to include intercultural and Indigenous perspectives in their curriculum.

AB  - Indicator 14: Post-School Outcomes are assessed each year by every school district in every state to evaluate outcomes for all students with disabilities, including learning disabilities, beyond secondary school. Data collection is mandated to focus on post-secondary education and employment status just after leaving school-age programs. Some states focus on the mandated areas of the directive, while others query additional areas of post-school adjustment. Data trends are used to update and improve State Performance Plans (SPPs) and are submitted to the U. S. Department of Education. There is wide variability in what areas of adjustment are measured and how they are measured. A content analysis is presented of state data collection protocols within the conceptual frameworks of life skills functioning. Recommendations pertaining to a larger sub-set of the data, students with learning disabilities, to improve data usage are included.

AB  - Interdisciplinary projects in the industry typically require collaboration between professionals from various fields. However, this relationship is not generally addressed in the training offered by university programs, which often ignore this interdisciplinary approach. This paper offers an example of interdisciplinary interaction through joint laboratory activities in the curricula of two very different degree programs, i.e., Multimedia Engineering and Teacher Training in Primary Education. The programs' students formed an interdisciplinary team of multimedia engineers and trainee teachers to develop a Web product for children's cognitive development. The complexity of the task required students to engage in close and strong interdisciplinary cooperation and communication; in turn, they benefited from the synergy offered by collaborative work. The results of this paper, presented from the perspective of the multimedia engineering students, demonstrate a significant increase in their academic performance compared to the control group. This paper shows that university studies can incorporate an interdisciplinary perspective to engineering education without the need to introduce a specific course on the topic, thus avoiding further demands on the curriculum schedule.

AB  - Robert Sternberg's (2017) Active Concerned Citizenship and Ethical Leadership (ACCEL) framework provides a helpful way to align gifted education with the complexities of 21st-century socioeconomic and cultural environments. The recommendation that we shift away from pseudoquantitative precision in conceptions of giftedness aligns with similar recommendations in other fields including political science, economics, and mathematics. The emphases on ethics and wisdom are reinforced by analyses of the need for more ethical awareness in societies. These analyses arise from research and theory in other fields, including ethical philosophy, political science, economics, history, sociology, and journalism. These transdisciplinary similarities are interpreted to be conceptual triangulation supporting the importance of Sternberg's model as a catalyst for the development of more holistic conceptions of giftedness and talent.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity is defined as communication and collaboration across academic disciplines. The instructional technology (IT) field has claimed to have an interdisciplinary nature influenced by neighboring fields such as psychology, communication, and management. However, it has been difficult to find outstanding evidence of the field's interdisciplinary research efforts, except with psychology. IT and neighboring fields including human performance technology, instructional design, learning sciences, human resource development, and human resource management share common goals of learning and performance in diverse contexts. These fields are converging in terms of underscoring the importance of people in improving organizational performance through learning, development, and innovations. In this context, the purpose of this study was to identify interdisciplinary research collaboration efforts in the field through a review of literature on the topic. Based on the review of the literature, I provided implications for research and practice.

AB  - This article discusses the use of ePortfolios in interdisciplinary online adult degree programs at two universities. Whereas one university uses the ePortfolio only in a capstone course, the other institution introduces the ePortfolio in an introductory course that focuses on goal setting and then has students add content to the ePortfolio in the final course of their program of study. Additionally, one institution implemented the ePortfolio for assessment purposes, while the other did not. The study of these cases explores the different approaches to ePortfolio use in two interdisciplinary adult degree programs, as well as the benefits of ePortfolio use within this student population.

AB  - Librarians are excellent research collaborators, although librarian participation is not usually considered, thereby making access to research funds difficult. The University of Michigan Library became involved in the university's novel funding program, MCubed, which supported innovative interdisciplinary research on campus, primarily by funding student assistants to work on research projects. This article discusses three different MCubed projects that all benefited from librarian involvement. These projects spanned across many areas from translational research to systematic reviews to digital humanities. Librarian roles ranged from mentoring and project management to literature searching.

AB  - With recent increased interest in and efforts to reform and revitalize general education curricula to make an educational experience more vital and germane, many institutions have become interested in incorporating interdisciplinary learning opportunities, or even in creating fully interdisciplinary programs. In order to address the growing need for interdisciplinary curricula work, the authors, as representatives of the Association for Interdisciplinary Studies (AIS), facilitated a workshop on Interdisciplinary General Education at the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) conference on General Education in February 2017. The purpose of the workshop was to describe how to employ interdisciplinary thinking into programs and courses. The overall lesson was to communicate that interdisciplinary thinking and practice should not only be widely employed within General Education, but also that it is quite feasible for instructors who are not immersed in the literature on interdisciplinarity, would be able to develop and teach interdisciplinary courses and curricula. In addition, attendees were introduce to resources available for interdisciplinary curriculum design on the AIS website. This article summarizes the events of the workshop and the concluding thoughts from the authors.

AB  - Teaching undergraduate science courses through the lens of local community issues has the potential to help students connect more strongly to the sciences and to the communities near the university. In considering the construction of such courses, it is clear that even community issues that have strong science cores--water quality, viral and bacterial disease vectors--are inherently multidisciplinary, with scientific and technological considerations in balance with the economic and social factors that inform public policy. The fundamental challenge is, then, to develop ways to teach complex and multidisciplinary community issues within the context of science courses. Here, we report on a pilot study of a course structure designed to address this challenge. Cohorts of students from different disciplines were paired, and a strategy was developed that required the students to work together to teach one another about a community issue from their discipline's perspective. This model was applied to cohorts of chemistry and interior architecture students studying local brownfield redevelopment efforts.

AB  - This article presents case study findings about undeclared student experiences in a two-and-a-half-year interdisciplinary learning-living program that integrates the arts, humanities, and social science disciplines. The study examined how the program helped students make informed decisions about academic majors and vocational choices. Participants were a cohort of juniors who had begun the program as first-year undeclared (non-major) students, and who were interviewed one month after program completion. Findings revealed the program developed students' recognition of curricular connections and thereby positioned undeclared students for increased academic and vocational clarity. Findings also revealed the program contributed to participants' overall student development resulting from engagement in a tight-knit, intellectual learning-living community.

AB  - Active learning activities offer opportunities for medical students to facilitate the retention of knowledge and develop soft skills. We aimed to create a guide for an interdisciplinary mock trial learning activity within the medical curriculum of the College of Medicine, Anhembi Morumbi University--Laureate International Universities, Sao Paulo, Brazil. We designed an "Animal Experimentation Mock Trial" in which students are coached to search for scientific, legal, and ethical arguments pro and contra animal experimentation in medical research. The mock trial is prepared and staged with student teams to play the 1) presiding judge, 2) the plaintiff's attorney and expert witnesses contra animal research, 3) the defense attorney and expert witnesses pro animal research, and 4) the jury. The plaintiff and defense teams made presentations, and between each presentation the jury put questions to presenters (cross-examination). The jury team gave two evaluation scores after the plaintiff's presentation and then after the defense presentation. The formal feedback for this active learning activity indicated that students expressed satisfaction with the teaching strategies employed in the course. The mock trial with the lesson plan provides a learning mean to exemplify the complex relationship between animal experimentation, medical evidence, ethics, and law/regulations. This mock trial helps medical students to develop their soft skills, such as the ability to collaborate and also to recognize the limits of their own knowledge, important for professional development. The importance of interdisciplinary discussions is demonstrated by increasing the awareness of the multidisciplinary aspect of animal research.

AB  - Lexical knowledge is complex, multidimensional, and difficult to pin down to a set of defined components. The development, organization, and use of lexical knowledge in the first and additional languages are studied in a number of neighbouring disciplines beyond second language acquisition and applied linguistics, including psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, computational linguistics, and language education. In this introduction, we highlight how the five articles in this special issue hone our understanding of different aspects of second language (L2) lexical knowledge, its acquisition, and use by adopting innovative research design, methods, and approaches to data collection and analysis from these distinct but related disciplines, affording new theoretical and empirical insights.

AB  - Product design pedagogical approaches require a specific mix of competences that demand multiplicity of perspectives, hybrid knowledge that exceeds professional field silos, and continuous problem reformulations. To do this, design studio education follows many traditions, among which is design critique. Design critique is believed to provide students with the ability to reframe design problems, but it can also lead to misunderstandings. The necessity of this approach is put into question by assessing the experiences of a group of students in an intensive course structured for interdisciplinary work, intercultural teams, and projects based on challenges from practice, where the critique was not part of the pedagogical program. The course was conducted over four consecutive weeks and supported a hands-on approach based on an interdisciplinary work between the areas of product design and occupational therapy, with the participation of Brazilian and Norwegian bachelor students and professors. Students responded to questionnaires prior to and at the end of the course that addressed their expectations of and experiences in the course. A qualitative analysis of the students' responses was carried out based on content analysis. The joint work with occupational therapy students and professionals, as well as the opportunity to develop projects that targeted demands from people with disabilities, were shown to be factors that contributed to students' engagement in the course and overall gain of knowledge. The experiences reported here indicate that the phenomenological approach to the design studio, which focuses on providing an immersive environment, deserves more attention from educators, and that design critique is not necessarily a crucial ingredient in design education.

AB  - Parramatta Marist High School is a school in Western Sydney, New South Wales, that has over 14 years of experience in project-based learning in Stages 4 and 5 (Years 7-10). Over this period, projects have been constantly developed, redeveloped and improved by teachers based on their experience and feedback from their colleagues and their students. Growing out of this feedback cycle, GeoSTEM (an integration of geography and STEM) was formed to utilise complementary skills and concepts from both subjects in order to develop projects that better engage and reflect student learning in the 21st Century. In 2019, the first GeoSTEM project titled "The Urban Mess" was delivered to Year 9. This project focused on issues of urbanisation, sustainability and design within a local context, through the lens of the Stage 5 Changing Places unit. Through computer-aided design and fabrication, local geographical issues were exposed and resolutions proposed with the final products utilising laser-cut overlay maps to represent the various solutions.

AB  - The critical shortage of school psychologists across the nation has been a long-standing issue, along with the need to diversify the profession. While recruitment efforts have attempted to attract culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) students into school psychology programs, novel practices integrating social justice advocacy and interdisciplinary collaborative training may aid in both recruitment and retention efforts. Broadly, graduate programs in education and psychology disciplines are ripe with opportunities to collaborate in a coordinated effort to meet the complex educational and mental health needs of diverse children and adolescents. The purpose of the manuscript is to (1) outline and address barriers relating to the critical shortage of CLD school psychologists, (2) promote integration of social justice advocacy and interdisciplinary collaborative training, and (3) provide strategies and recommendations to recruit and retain CLD students in graduate training programs.

AB  - The need to map the evolution of trends in any field of activity arises when a large amount of data is available on that activity, thus making impossible a manual exploration of the data in order to understand how the field or the activity is evolving. Topic and trend mapping is a mature field with hundreds of publications on approaches, methods and tools for data collection, analysis, feature extraction and reduction, clustering and visualisation tools and algorithms. Our study aims to map the evolution of topics published by the journal "Education for Information. Interdisciplinary Journal on Information Studies" (EFI henceforth) which has been in existence since 1983, in order to understand how this journal has evolved and how it is positioned with regard to the field of Library and Information Science to which it belongs. Our study is part of the body of work on topic detection and text mining. Our results showed that the journal displayed a remarkable stability in its editorial policy over more than three decades. With the arrival of its third Editor in Chief in 2018, a shift towards more technologically oriented topics and to specialties from other fields are perceptible such as health information, data science and digital humanities.

AB  - The aims of this study were to determine faculty's ability to accurately and reliably categorize exam questions using Bloom's Taxonomy, and if modified versions would improve the accuracy and reliability. Faculty experience and affiliation with a health sciences discipline were also considered. Faculty at one university were asked to categorize 30 sample exam questions using either Bloom's Taxonomy or one of two modified versions of Bloom's Taxonomy. Overall accuracy improved when a modified version of Bloom's Taxonomy was used. Collapsing the six categories of Bloom's into three (knowledge; comprehension and application; analysis, synthesis, and evaluation) showed higher levels of accuracy than when each category was collapsed with its neighbor. There was no difference between health science and nonhealth science faculty in accuracy. Overall interrater reliability was low regardless of experience or health science affiliation.

AB  - Many engineering faculty have limited skills and/or assessment tools to evaluate team dynamics in multidisciplinary team-based capstone courses. Rapidly deployable tools are needed here to provide proactive feedback to teams to facilitate deeper learning. Two surveys were developed based on industrial and organizational psychology theories around desired high performance industry characteristics. A case study experiment was conducted in an architectural engineering capstone. Here, these surveys were deployed in conjunction with traditional qualitative verbal feedback and technical assessments. Results presented here suggest that capstone teams exhibit high-functioning attributes of effective teams based on the course formulation. Team dynamics evolved as the course progressed naturally and with the help of faculty based on the survey results. Discussions in this paper detail survey development, implementation, and sampled trends to represent how to use and interpret the survey output. Furthermore, best practices for implementing these ideas in other courses is touched on. Evidence is presented to support the surveys as a tool and to show correlations between the results and other technical assignments.

AB  - Spatial reasoning plays a vital role in choice of and success in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers, yet the topic is scarce in grade school curricula. We conjecture that this absence may be due to limited knowledge of how spatial reasoning is discussed and engaged across STEM professions. This study aimed to address that gap by asking 19 professionals to comment on a video that documented children's progression through 5Â days of building and programming robots. Their written opinions on the skills relevant to their careers demonstrated by the children revealed that spatial thinking and design thinking are central to what they see.

AB  - Mindfulness and meditation programs, and their associated benefits for education, can be examined within three related disciplines: psychology, elementary education, and exceptional education. A review of psychology research provides evidence that meditation and mindfulness work to balance the often negative effects of students' social-emotional environments, stress, anxiety, and even poverty. Elementary education research documents positive outcomes of mindfulness meditation with elementary students. Finally, the discipline of exceptional education highlights the positive benefits of mindfulness and meditation programs on students with learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. Overall, the advantages as corroborated across disciplines encourage use of mindfulness and meditation exercises or schoolwide programs to achieve improved student behavior and academic benefits.

AB  - Literary criticism nowadays is essentially crossing the boundaries of disciplinarity and canonicity where literary theory has increasingly been shaped by overlapping concepts and branching out of theories as well as whipping out the limitations imposed by theory itself. The post-conditions of contemporaneity have imposed a view of reading and analysing the literary text that is dynamic, proliferated and in flux as well as resistant to monolithic critique and confined disciplines and professionalization. This outlook has increasingly made the notions of literary criticism, theoretical paradigms and canons not only artificial and irrelevant to our materialistic world, but, in many cases, "violent" to those whose life concerns exist in the margins of these paradigmatic notions. In this essay, I argue that those of us who aspire to an interdisciplinary and a metacritical analyses would be well served by importing inspirations from Edward Said's work, scholarship and life, particularly drawing on his "Worldliness," "Amateurism" and "Heteroglossia" (or heterotopia) as well as drawing examples from his negotiation with intellectual paradoxes and tensions informed by his positionality as a border crosser intellectual (or his exilic consciousness). Specifically, this article engages with Said as an author of a radically secular body of work marked by as comportment towards being, and as an example of an "amateur" critic who "speak[s] truth to power." It argues that Said instates a critically-interrogative scholarship as antidote to essentialist, politicised, determinist and hegemonic literary canons (whether those of texts or theory) which are paradigmatically informed by relations of power in academia. The paper argues that through the investment of his scholarship and personal life, Said rejects academic institutions and affiliations with their tendency towards doctrinaire assumptions of critical work. Further to this, Said's fascination of diversity, heterogeneity and his advocacy of the intellectual's detachment from the institution of specialised criticism mount up as a radical critique of specialisation and professionalism and denouncing them as being allied with ideological and cultural dogma.

AB  - In an increasingly globalised world there is need for professionals involved in providing services to children and families to be culturally competent. This pilot study explores the impact of attending a multidisciplinary professional development workshop based on the Six Principles of Culturally Competent Practice [Verdon, S. (2015a). "Embracing diversity, creating equality: Supporting the speech, language and communication of culturally and linguistically diverse children" (Unpublished doctoral thesis). Charles Sturt University, Bathurst, Australia] upon professionals' cultural competence. There were 52 participants who completed pre-workshop questionnaires and post-workshop evaluations. Of these, two participated in in-depth follow-up interviews one year later to discuss the ongoing impact of professional development upon their practice. Pre-workshop, major challenges identified for working with culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) families were cultural and language barriers, and working with interpreters. After completing the workshop, participants reported gaining knowledge about engaging in holistic practice, their personal cultural competence and the culture of families they worked with. Interviews conducted one year later revealed the workshop had an ongoing impact upon practice in four key areas: (1) knowing the family (2) organisational structures (3) collaborative practice and (4) the ongoing nature of cultural competence. This article discusses the complexities of teaching cultural competence, problematic issues in conceptualisation and the efficacy of such workshops in developing a critical consciousness among professionals to engage in culturally responsive practice with CALD families.

AB  - Agriculture, food, and/or natural resources (AFNR) content offers a tremendous context for interdisciplinary teaching and learning. Collaboration between AFNR and core content area educators has been recommended to increase interdisciplinarity in school-based AFNR Education; however, existing research lacks an empirical investigation of the relationship between interdisciplinary collaboration and outcomes associated with interdisciplinary teaching in school-based AFNR Education. Therefore, the current study explores the scope of collaboration between AFNR, leadership, mathematics, and science educators and the relationship between collaboration and interdisciplinary teaching in school-based AFNR Education. Findings indicate opportunities to initiate and strengthen interdisciplinary communities of practice through purposeful interactions, especially regarding length of interactions between AFNR and core content area educators. Recommendations for practitioners, teacher educators, and researchers are provided.

AB  - This manuscript offers a framework for encouraging faculty from diverse disciplines to consider and evaluate their teaching, scholarship, and service in interdisciplinary ways. This process integrates Repko's (2008) criteria for interdisciplinarians, Doran, Miller, and Cunningham's (1981) conceptualization of S.M.A.R.T. goals, and McCoy and Gardner's (2012) five key social structural components, in order to further cultivate faculty members' identities as interdisciplinarians. We outline a process aimed at facilitating interdisciplinary conversation among university faculty and present resulting examples of faculty members' specific action plans for their own interdisciplinarity within their teaching, research, and service activities. This framework provides a roadmap for faculty and institutions interested in purposefully and meaningfully facilitating interdisciplinarity across a variety of academic settings.

AB  - This paper intends to present an interdisciplinary project carried out in a School of Engineering, and to refer to its effects in the development of students' skills. This project's main goal was to present students with an intellectually demanding challenge which implied overcoming the disciplinary barriers thus integrating knowledge to solve the problems they were challenged with. After the project had been concluded, a study was carried out using a qualitative methodology by conducting two focus groups (n = 16). The main goal of this procedure was to get a better perception of (1) how students understood the project; (2) what kind of skills students considered to have developed throughout the project, and (3) the importance they have attributed to this kind of project. The results demonstrate that students are aware of the relevance of the project not only for their education process but also for the development of their skills. The results of the study also reveal that the students involved in the project have been capable of identifying the specific skills that the project work had intended to address and develop.

AB  - Advancing Healthy and Socially Just Schools and Communities is a four-course graduate certificate program collaboratively developed by an interdisciplinary team comprised of faculty from the fields of Social Work and Education at a Canadian university. The aim of this program is to facilitate systems-level change through enhancing the knowledge and skills of graduate students from disciplines such as social work, education, and nursing who work with youth in schools and communities. The ultimate goal of this systems-level change is promotion of healthy youth relationships and prevention of violence. The topics for the four courses in the program include the following: promoting healthy relationships and preventing interpersonal violence, recognizing and counteracting oppression and structural violence, addressing trauma and building resilience, and fostering advocacy and community in the context of social justice. The development and pedagogy of the certificate program are described, along with findings from a pilot study designed to examine the utility and feasibility of the initial certificate offering. Experiences with the program to date highlight the potential for improvements in graduate students' attitudes, beliefs, and confidence regarding what constitutes violence and their role in responding to it.

AB  - The ACRL Framework for Information Literacy presents opportunities for moving beyond 'one-shot' information literacy sessions and creating a more scaffolded and embedded approach for instruction. We collaborated with faculty at [institution name] to create Framework-inspired information literacy learning objectives for first-year and third-year science undergraduates and are continuously refining the objectives as the curriculum continues to evolve. This article describes our learning objective design and refinement process, challenges encountered, and ideas on how to create opportunities for embedding information literacy into a curriculum. We also share our full activity lesson plans and assessment tool.

AB  - The authors present a semester-long game to teach the role of economics in natural resources management. The game is framed within a fisheries context: multiple student fisheries harvest fish to maximize yield/profit, which is measured using a piecewise linear function. There are prizes for both the student and the group with the highest semester-long catch, which brings forth the social dilemma associated with dynamic stock externalities in fisheries. The game can be played in large classes, is robust to student attrition, and requires 5-10 minutes per class period. Given its features, it can be used to teach behavioral economic principles in resource management, incentives versus command-and-control regulations, role of cheap talk, social preferences, punishment, and community management as well as solutions such as aquaculture.

AB  - This study designs and implements interdisciplinary STEM instruction by adopting modelling-based physics programming, and explores its effectiveness on learning. A quasi-experimental study was conducted. The experimental group wrote programs to solve physics problems by following the modelling process, while the control group solved general problems without specific guidance. The findings show that the STEM group performed better on both programming and physics achievements, and had higher self-efficacy on modelling. The STEM group benefited from the modelling-based instruction and could formulate the problems to a more effective representation for problem solving (abstraction), and also could transfer the solution to more accurate code (coding), both of which contributed to programming ability. Through the modelling process for physics simulation, physics programming also improved students' understanding of difficult physics concepts.

AB  - Psychologists, in recent years, have been leading the way in conceptualising and assessing young people's wellbeing. In the UK, the highly influential annual Good Childhood report in particular has done much to establish which aspects of their lives that young people consider to be important for their wellbeing and identify areas of concern. Governments worldwide are taking notice of wellbeing supporting national and international assessment programmes. However, conceptually the field needs clarity and the contributions of different disciplinary perspectives still need to be fully realised, with even the key distinction between hedonic (feeling well) and eudaimonic (functioning well) aspects of wellbeing made by positive psychologists not being fully recognised in measurement programmes. If young people's wellbeing in education is to be enhanced, I will argue in this paper that first of all we need to conceptualise it more clearly and drawing on my own research from the UK and Kazakhstan, as well as other work, that this needs to be done with consideration to interdisciplinary and culturally-grounded perspectives.

AB  - In this article, I consider Klein's scholarship as a foundation to examine the realities of interdisciplinary practice in higher education institutions, including questions of who engages in interdisciplinary work, how interdisciplinary work is supported, and how interdisciplinary work is organized. In discussing each of these issues, I underscore elements of the higher education context, including funding, enrollment, and staffing. I identify areas that require future research regarding higher education and interdisciplinarity, specifically research engaging questions of inequality in access and outcomes and research examining educational delivery modalities such as hybrid and online learning and the effectiveness of interdisciplinary curricula and pedagogies in these environments.

AB  - The authors present a culturally responsive college access group to increase educational opportunity for historically targeted high school students. The program was designed for first generation high school students who self-report as having no plans for after high school. The program highlights the need for inter-disciplinary collaboration with counselors, administrators, educators, researchers, and university students, and faculty to foster a supportive school climate (Beesley, 2004). A description and evaluation of the program is presented in a sample of 400 participants from 30 different public schools across the San Francisco Bay Area. The presentation will include specific content and techniques for each session of the group. Implications for democratizing college access in publics schools will be discussed.

AB  - A need exists for impactful interdisciplinary collaborations between STEM and Education departments to build successful STEM teacher education programs. Within extant literature, few studies have examined the qualities that make STEM and Education collaborations possible for the purpose of STEM teacher preparation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the motivation, development and sustainability of collaborations between STEM and Education faculty and university supervisors to better enhance STEM teacher education programs. This study analyzes the dynamics between STEM and Education faculty and university supervisors at seven universities with Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Programs within the state of Texas. Through a qualitative multiple-case study research approach, we collected data through focus group interviews, archival information, and field notes. Our exploratory study yielded three main findings to include the following: (1) characteristics of impactful STEM-Education collaborations; (2) impact of STEM-Education collaborations; and (3) common STEM-Education collaboration constraints. Based on the findings from this study, implications for universities, institutional leaders, students, and the grant foundation are discussed.

AB  - The complexity of digital and online education is becoming increasingly evident in the context of research into networked learning/participation. Interdisciplinary research is often proposed as a way to address complex scientific problems and enable researchers to bring novel perspectives into a field other than their own. The degree to which research on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is interdisciplinary is unknown. We apply descriptive and inferential statistics to bibliometric data to investigate interdisciplinarity in MOOC research. Results show that MOOC research published in 2013-2015 was (a) mostly conducted by researchers affiliated with Education and Computer Science disciplines, (b) far from monolithic, (c) had a greater representation of authors from Computer Science than in the past, and (d) showed a trend toward being more interdisciplinary than MOOC research published in 2008-2012. Our results also suggest that empirical research on xMOOCs may be more interdisciplinary than research on cMOOCs. Greater interdisciplinarity in xMOOC research could reflect the burgeoning interest in the field, the general familiarity with the xMOOC pedagogical model, and the hype experienced by xMOOCs. Greater interdisciplinarity in the field may also provide researchers with rich opportunities to improve our understanding and practice of digital and online learning.

AB  - In this research, a survey method utilising questionnaires and focus group interviews was employed to determine correlations between students' learning styles and each of the presences in the CoI Framework across disciplines as well as students' blended learning experience. To this end, the linear regression model was the statistical approach used to explore the correlation between each of the presences and the learning styles after controlling for the disciplines. Consequently, a three-way cross-tab using Chi-square statistics was the statistical method used to discover the variations of the students' experience of blended learning under different disciplines and learning styles. A total of 12 lecturers and 377 students from three private institutions were involved in this study. The results show that among the four discipline categories, only the soft-applied has a significant effect on the linear regression model. In this particular discipline, the Kinesthetic variable alone has a significant effect on all the three presences in the CoI Framework. The R-squared values are rather small. Further investigation should be directed towards an inclusion of a larger number of postgraduate participants, more courses in the soft-pure and hard-pure categories, and the learning styles of lecturers.

AB  - Contemporary public management in Brazil is undergoing a great deal of transformation. From the year 2008 the Brazilian Federal government has been investing in policies and planned actions that aim to expand access to Higher Education. This paradigm shift was possible through the understanding that the agenda of public problems required trained professionals with appropriate skills, able to propose plans, programs and elaborate projects, fostering the evolution and consolidation of Brazilian democracy. The changes in contemporary Brazilian public management have permitted the debate amongst researchers in the Higher Education sphere, evolving to what is conventionally known as the Public Field. This field integrates views that deal with contemporary processes that aim to change public management either at the state or non-state level, in its various dimensions, seeking to innovate teaching and research in the area of public policy. This article aims to reflect on the specific academic issues related to Public Field Education in Brazil. It also aims to promote an epistemological understanding related to the intellectual diversity present in this area. It considers the assumption that a multidisciplinary approach, characteristic of field courses, generates new experiences and knowledge, making a difference in the formation toward a critical view of reality in which the students are part. In order to conduct the research, a comparative analysis of experiences developed in recent years was proposed. It is seen that the curricula must converge, aiming to educate the manager who understands this phenomenon and the needs of contemporary society, who is able to recognize and work with the rights of citizens, as well as be present in the relations between state and society, with responsibilities of integrating public policy programs, optimizing the use of public resources, being able to redesign programs and projects in order to monitor and evaluate public policies.

AB  - The main challenges facing a project based learning (PBL) facilitator in our institution is addressed here in team forming for multidisciplinary PBL subjects of diploma students in mechanical and civil engineering. These challenges include the type of projects, how to team up students, how to proceed with planning, how to swap planning outputs among teams, and how to proceed with implementation of a project. Having executed several multidisciplinary subjects over few years in our institution, a survey was conducted from the facilitators and students at the school of engineering to identify the main concerns of both facilitators and students in creating teams and maintaining teamwork to tackle a real life engineering problem. A questioner consist of 7 questions were distributed and the answers were collected from 10 facilitators and 60 students from both diploma programs. Analyzing the data collected from the survey, the ideal number of students in each team was identified as four students per team; two students from each discipline. Moreover, students believe that they can perform better if they are allowed to select their teammates rather than be grouped randomly by the facilitator. The preferences of students on selecting their teammates was based on the criteria of friendship, hardworking, flexibility in personal character, or being helpful. Moreover, the results of survey indicate that the social/cultural issues such as gender, religion, and ethnicity are also important in forming the teams.

AB  - When new academics begin university life, the support they receive in their departments can vary. For many their initial experiences of the new job can be daunting. In this article 10 new academics from a range of disciplines were involved in a community of practice, known as Catalyst, to support them finding their feet within the university. Catalyst is a special community of practice; it is structured, multidisciplinary, one semester long, meets fortnightly and has no restriction on numbers. It also includes peer mentoring, where the new academics meet in pairs or small groups between meetings to foster further support at a deeper, more personal level as they talk about critical aspects of beginning an academic path. In the process they learn more about each other and build strong professional friendships. In this article, the community of practice is evaluated through analysis of journal notes kept by the author, together with semi-structured interviews and a focus group by an independent researcher. In particular, working collaboratively away from their disciplines provided space to learn about institutional and departmental expectations, but more importantly the opportunity to discuss difficult issues that often arise for new academics in a supportive environment.

AB  - St. Lawrence University received a five-year Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to create the multidisciplinary Liberal Arts Science Scholars program (award #1458712), which makes a high quality science and mathematics education accessible to high achieving, Pell Grant eligible students by providing merit scholarships and specialized supports. The program's supports, which are not specific to any one discipline, are designed to combat three of the main barriers to STEM persistence: capacity, interest, and belonging. This paper describes the first year of the Liberal Arts Science Scholars program and provides preliminary evidence for the program's ability to serve as a model for improving the retention and academic success of low-income students in the natural, physical, and mathematical sciences. While the Liberal Arts Science Scholars Program was implemented at a small, private liberal arts university, the supports described could be adapted for use at any type of institution.

AB  - The challenges presented by the growing prevalence, burden, and unmet service needs of youth mental health problems are formidable. During the past decade, scholars and other stakeholders of the Missouri Prevention Center (MPC) have been using a prevention and implementation science approach to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate recommended practices in promoting youth mental health in real world contexts. The purpose of this article is to describe the multidisciplinary contributions of MPC to improve the social, emotional, and behavioral health of youth, locally and nationally. We briefly summarize MPC scholarship that has addressed the individual and social-contextual risk and protective factors of youth mental health at home, school, and community. The article concludes with a description of two large-scale community projects, funded by an innovative local sales tax, that represent the systematic application of MPC scholarship and outreach. Together these projects provide mental health screening for every youth in our county three times per year and a single point of entry into the mental health service system where any family in our county can access an evaluation and referral for their child at no cost to them. The projects serve as model demonstrations for how communities can address the challenges of youth mental health concerns through multidisciplinary collaborations.

How are findings/interpretations from discourse analysis validated? This paper proposes transdisciplinary convergence as a way to validate discourse analysis approaches to research. The argument is made that discourse analysis explicitly grounded in semiotics, systemic functional linguistics, and critical theory, offers a credible research methodology. The underlying assumptions, constructs, and techniques of analysis of these three theoretical disciplines can be drawn on to show convergence of data at multiple levels, validating interpretations from text analysis.

AB  - The National Early Childhood Technical Assistance Center (NECTAC) reported 348,604 children received services in the United States under Part C of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in 2009, representing 2.7% of the population (NECTAC, 2012). Early Intervention (EI), or Part C, is designed to provide services to families of children age birth to 3 who are either at risk for or have developmental delays or disabilities (IDEA, 2004). EI providers such as child development specialists, nurses, registered dietitians or nutritionists, physical therapists, occupational therapists (OT), social workers, and speech-language pathologists are members of EI teams enabling collaboration among members. EI teams can be defined by the degree of collaboration among team members. Transdisciplinary (TD) teams utilize extensive collaboration, requiring members to understand individual team roles, have knowledge of different disciplines, and a willingness to work together to provide EI services. Awareness among those working in EI programs or with EI programs is critical to improve services for young children and their families. This article offers a description of a TD model of service delivery, some basic information about team members, and suggestions for collaboration to build team unity.

AB  - The dialogue between knowledge, pedagogies and didactic resources gives meaning to learning. This learning when integrated in a transdisciplinary environment enhances the holistic development of the child. This study is part of the Master's Degree in Education of the 1st Cycle of Basic Education and Portuguese and History and Geography of Portugal in the 2nd Cycle of Basic Education, integrated in the IFITIC Project "Innovate with ICT in Initial Teacher Training to Promote Methodological Renewal in Pre-school Education and in the 1st Cycle of Basic Education". The purpose of this research is to verify the potential of the digital educational platform "Educaplay" in the 1st and 2nd Basic Education Cycles. In this sense, the qualitative methodology was used, of an interpretative and comprehensive nature, since the aim is to analyze the social, valuing the meaning of action and the role of the subjects in the social construction of reality. The data were collected by the participating observation practice and field notes, since they allow access to facts, situations and behaviors, difficult to be captured through the survey or interview. In the first stage the educational practice was understood through the integration of digital resources and in the second stage the facts and their impacts were analyzed and interpreted. The sample involved 73 children, 21 children attending 3rd grade and 52 children from two classes attending 6th grade at a school in the Porto region. The results show that this platform has promoted: a) the appropriation of contents in a transversal and interdisciplinary way and b) the development of skills, values and attitudes inherent to the profile of the XXI century student. Thus, the article presents the educational practices that have integrated tools of "Educaplay" by the voice of the narrator. It is hoped that this research can provide pointers for teachers and educators seeking to renew their educational practices of vertical and horizontal articulation.

AB  - Under the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, an interdisciplinary project about the brewing and analysis of traditional Chinese rice wine was performed at home by junior students of the chemistry major at Huanggang Normal University under the remote guidance of teachers during the spring lockdown semester of 2020. Students were exposed to the concepts of yeast metabolism, analytical testing, and sensory evaluation in terms of real project study and completed a series of hands-on activities at home using readily available materials, utensils, and self-made devices. In the spring semester of 2021, experiments were conducted in the general lab with other students in the same program to compare the results of the two groups of students. The results were that the "home" results were credible, the students were trained not only in laboratory skills but also in analytical and communication skills, and, significantly, the majority of students enjoyed the content and activities. This paper illustrates an effective experimental design procedure that can be conducted at home or in the laboratory in response to uncertain changes, such as a pandemic lockdown.

AB  - Environmental forensics is the application of knowledge from geosciences and chemistry in a legal setting, e.g., to determine the origin and consequences of contamination events. Teaching environmental forensics requires reactivating prior knowledge from different fields of natural sciences, filling knowledge gaps, and connecting pieces of scientific evidence to form logical chains of arguments. Here, we present a cooperative teaching format that successfully covers the challenges of interdisciplinary teaching while further developing learners' soft skills. Through role-playing in a mock trial of a famous hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] contamination case in California, learners choose to team with the town of Hinkley, as the plaintiff team, or with Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), the company accused of the contamination, as the defense team. After introductory sessions, the teams summarize facts, and build and present arguments to support their claims regarding the formation of the Cr(VI) plume, the impact on the population's health, and remediation efforts taken by PG&E. These arguments are delivered in front of their peers and instructors, acting as judges, in a mock trial. Here, we summarize different modalities that have been tested over the past 10 years regarding role assignment and team building. This teaching format has been shown to be successful in engaging learners with the scientific aspects of the case-based trial while helping them become critical about information they are confronted with, delivering arguments in structured ways, defending their points of view, and improving communication skills on a peer- and layperson-level.

AB  - In the years since the second Thatcher government (1983-87), and continuing until the present, universities in the UK have been subjected to a series of neoliberal reforms which have had a deleterious effect on academics' working conditions and on the kind of research they are required to produce. 1986 saw the introduction of regular sector wide audits of research and scholarly activity designed to make academics more 'productive' and the institutions in which they worked more 'competitive'. This article takes as the object of its investigation the Research Excellence Framework (REF), the most recent iteration of the UK government sponsored assessment exercise. It adopts a transdisciplinary approach which draws on political economy, social theory and critical discourse analysis. The analysis exposes the ways in which the Research Excellence Framework constructs an illusion of intellectual excellence and innovation whose true purpose is the neutralization of the university as a centre of independent knowledge creation and learning, and hence as a potential locus of intellectual opposition to the neoliberal hegemony. The article concludes by calling on academics to refuse the narrow model of research valorized by the REF and to reclaim the idea of the university as a public good.

AB  - Policy documents from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and UNESCO have stressed the need to prepare students for what has been termed a VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous) world. The COVID-19 pandemic is an extreme case of a VUCA event that grants the opportunity to examine whether special and inclusive education is fully prepared for these complex situations. "Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Special and Inclusive Education in a Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous (VUCA) World" provides insights and examples from scholars in different disciplines across different regions, contexts, and systems. These ideas will help to shape how special students, teachers, and all the managerial components as a whole, will need to adapt to sustain and maintain inclusion in education in the circumstances of a VUCA world.

AB  - Children's understanding of living and non-living concepts is usually interpreted by a child's degree of cognitive development. However, many studies with a different methodology include biological characteristics demonstrating that young children can distinguish between living and non-living. This research aims to examine the effect of the interdisciplinary and sensory-based education program prepared for preschool children on acquiring living and non-living concepts. A mixed method design was used, involving pre-test and post-test. Seventy-eight children, including 38 in the experimental group and 40 in the control group, participated. An education program was developed and applied to the experimental group for eight weeks. A designed questionnaire was used to collect data. According to the results, a significant difference (p < 0.05) existed between the pre-test and post-test of the experimental group scores of plant and non-living categories, but in the animal category, no significant difference (p > 0.05) was evident. In the scores of the human category, only five-year-old children's scores were found statistically significant (p < 0.05). The children with interdisciplinary sensory-based education explained the living and non-living things primarily through biological characteristics (growth, nutrition, and breathing). These differences were not observed in the control group expressions.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to share worked examples of skills profiling within the universal micro-credential framework, a novel approach designed to further the enablement of 21st century skills which are defined here as a generalized series of competencies gained by a learner that enable them to self-reflect, self-regulate and self-optimize their capabilities within highly emergent contexts. This approach improves interdisciplinary learning and assessment paths for computing education by providing personalized learning and assessment options and by enabling curricula to better accommodate both internal and external interdisciplinary content. Through these worked examples, this article addresses potential solutions to fundamental and persistent structural issues in today's learning-earning ecosystem. Most significant of these issues is what the authors refer to as a "capability-competency chasm," a term used to describe an enduring gap that creates problematic deficits for learners as they transition between education and employment. At the core of the universal micro-credential framework is skills profiling, which can leverage micro-credential pathways and badge catalogues, both within the context of computing education in particular and across higher education in general. Accounting for the complexity of implementing system-wide redesign in highly variable higher-education contexts, this article also briefly references the role of design patterns to enable such implementation. Collectively, these flexible credentialing innovations offer a globally innovative solution to systemic challenges, explaining both the importance of addressing such challenges and the opportunities arising from them.

AB  - In this methodological reflection, I describe the multidisciplinary hermeneutic process of philosophizing about teacher dissatisfaction. I discuss how philosophy serves as a starting point for interpretive work based on interviews with former teachers and readings of qualitative and quantitative research on teacher attrition and dissatisfaction. The result has been a project that enabled me to offer new descriptions of phenomena and to develop concepts that can be used to interpret the moral dimensions of teacher dissatisfaction. The fact that I return to language and concepts as my research outcomes is why, despite my multidisciplinary approach, I continue to describe my work as philosophical. I suggest that philosophical enquiry pursued through empirical research has the potential to inform larger empirical studies, serve as a "sensitizing instrument" for empirical analysis, and to open discursive spaces where common understandings limit interpretive possibilities.

AB  - Experience working in multidisciplinary teams is important both to prepare Computer Science (CS) students for industry and to improve their communication with teammates from disciplines other than their own. This article describes the evolution and results of collaborations among three courses: an undergraduate CS course about user interface design and implementation, an undergraduate Scientific and Technical Communication (STC) course about usability and instructions writing, and a graduate CS/Human Factors course about user-interface evaluation and usability testing. Students from all three courses work with scientists to complete the scientist-sponsored citizen science Android applications (apps). Students from the undergraduate CS and STC courses form multidisciplinary teams to design and implement apps, while the graduate students consult with the teams by evaluating and user-testing the apps. The collaboration's effectiveness was assessed using student surveys, interviews, and evaluations of student work. This article compares the collaboration within the teams and the coordination with the scientists across two years of activities in order to determine the effectiveness of course modifications. The article concludes with recommendations for improving the collaboration within teams and the coordination with clients in multidisciplinary course projects.

AB  - This article takes as its point of departure the many converging crises of sustainability and the responsibility of higher education institutions and faculty members to participate in mitigating these crises to any extent possible. The author characterizes sustainability education as transdisciplinary praxis, explores the institutional and interpersonal barriers to transdisciplinary faculty collaboration, and suggests rationales and strategies for overcoming these barriers. In order to lay a foundation for discussing transdisciplinary collaborations, the author also explores the concepts of sustainability, transdisciplinarity, and praxis. She concludes that, because disciplinary and other traditional power structures within higher education tend to inhibit transdisciplinary collaboration and engagement in sustainability praxis, such work is most likely to be successful when it meets with visionary sustainability leadership practiced by upper administration.

AB  - The aim of this participant observation was to understand the efficacy of a modified International Baccalaureate Primary Years Program for fourth-graders at a public school with a large percentage of language and socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Data collection over a five-month period concentrated on teaching interactions including audio-recorded time samplings and observations of the art and regular classroom instruction, and interviews (formal and informal) with students, teachers, and school principals in addition to photographs, classroom portfolios, and other artifacts. The analysis, coding, and triangulation of data aided in understanding the art specialist and classroom teachers' roles and contributions to the Primary Years Program. A cooperative school environment paved the way for student self-confidence and motivation for learning through (1) opportunities for student choice and decision-making and (2) collaborative, inquiry-based, transdisciplinary, project-based learning. Regardless of demographics, transdisciplinary learning through the arts challenged and motivated students to think and make decisions in collaboration with others, using and valuing the expertise of peers. Regardless of student ethnicity or socioeconomic status, learners felt empowered and enthusiastic about attending school and gained knowledge through inquiry and project-based opportunities. This progressive ideology and practice has the potential to benefit diverse learners in 21st century education.

Design/Methodology/Approach: Multiple-case method was used, and three completed transdisciplinary PhD research efforts undertaken at the Stellenbosch University were selected. They were coordinated through the TsamaHub, an inter-faculty platform at the University which organises educational modules for transdisciplinary research. Using actual research experiences and reflections of the three individual PhDs, the paper evaluates their work in terms of ontological, epistemological, methodological and methodical/methods aspects. Findings: The central challenge to individual PhD researchers is engagement with non-academic actors to enable joint problem formulation, analysis and transformation. To overcome this, the paper suggests that developing individual epistemic relationships to build "transdisciplinary epistemic communities" should be considered for inclusion as an intentional aspect of transdisciplinary research design. Research Limitations/Implications: "Transdisciplinary epistemic communities" is still a concept in its infancy and needs more work before it may be theoretically and practically useful. Practical Implications: Continuously guiding the individual transdisciplinary research process in a reflexive, recursive, transparent and equal manner is absolutely critical because transdisciplinary research cannot be done successfully if dominated by overly methods-driven approaches. Originality/Value: The discourse around transdisciplinary methodology has major implications for the design of individual PhD research. The paper provides recommendations to enhance the theory and practice of individual transdisciplinary PhD research.

AB  - The need to focus on a transdisciplinary approach in education for sustainable development (EDS) has been reflected in research and especially action research as a possible solution, which can open a new perspective for understanding and interpretation of the complex phenomenon of sustainability as well as for developing new open continuing education programmes by integrating research and learning activities in the context of open transdisciplinary research. The content structure of the article: (1) it describes the experience that has evolved at one faculty and its subordinate scientific institute and has been proposed to be used within the entire institution; (2) it generalises issues arising from the extensive experience, which in action research manifest themselves as issues relating to the appropriate perspective choice in terms of sustainability, approaches that in education make it possible to understand the sustainability phenomenon, as well as features that help identify sustainability at different levels. Well-known cases in the history of science, philosophy of science, and systems development research have been used to highlight the relationship among the dynamic interaction of complex problems that can systematically appear as sustainable or unsustainable. Therefore, the article provides insight into a specific relationship among science development, integration and Anthropocene phenomena with sustainability/non-sustainability phenomena and their interaction; (3) it offers the experience necessary for the creation of participatory action research ideas and research base to expand the cooperation of university and its graduates using a stakeholder approach and connecting it with a transdisciplinary research framework, which envisages an activity around the sustainability phenomenon and its deep relationship to the openness for the evolution of sustainability consciousness as concerns individuals and societies; (4) it describes the first three activities of the first phase of the undertaken action research, which allowed determining the participants' motivation to take part in the action research, identifying participants' attitude and understanding sustainability and Anthropocene phenomena, as well as establishing a strategic vision of open transdisciplinary framework benefits and opportunities through participatory action research to develop open evolutionary study programs for continuing education, which would extend and deepen the cooperation of university and its graduates for social innovation creation and achieving quality education for sustainable development by reorienting the society and education towards sustainability and sustainable development. The present article aims at establishing an open transdisciplinary research framework, which is necessary for undertaking action research, and outlining a strategic vision for developing continuing education programs in the participatory action research that will help reorient continuing education to sustainable development.

AB  - The focus of this paper is the design and development of an innovative project-based work-integrated learning (WIL) course that enables undergraduate students from all faculties to work in interdisciplinary teams with partner organisations from the public, private, and community sectors. Projects are co-designed with partners interested in students from multiple disciplines bringing insights to problems that might not otherwise be resourced by their organisation. These 'projects of consequence' are unstructured, ambiguous and complex, requiring student teams to synthesise their different disciplinary knowledge. Student learning is supported by course curriculum design that includes proven pedagogical practices such as: ongoing feedback from partners; students working in autonomous small teams; academic supervision of teamwork; learning support before and during project work; debriefing; providing a safe, supportive space to experiment with new ideas, embracing the prospect of failure and to develop resilience; all underpinned by reflection so as to process, understand and integrate students' experiences. The versatility of the course design was demonstrated by the rapid change from face-to-face delivery to an entirely online learning environment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The challenges and adaptations include changes to the way student teams worked, the additional support needed by students, and adjustment in the mode of interactions with partners.

AB  - In a three-year, practice-based, creative research project, the team designed a video game for undergraduate biology students that aimed to find the right balance between educational content and entertainment. The project involved 7 faculty members and 14 undergraduate students from biological science, design, computer science, and music. This nontraditional approach to research was attractive to students. Working on an interdisciplinary practice-based research project required strategies related to timeline, recruitment, funding, team management, and mentoring. Although this project was time-consuming and full of challenges, it created meaningful learning experiences not only for students but also for faculty members.

AB  - Purpose: Feeding challenges in children are common, at times reaching a severity that requires the placement and long-term use of enteral feedings. A significant barrier to advancing the oral eating of some tube-dependent children is the presence of oral aversion. Although some research exists regarding the treatment of tube-dependent children who are averse to food or the process of eating, specifically, there has yet to be an examination of children who are truly "orally" averse--resisting not just the presentation of food or liquid but also nonnutritive stimuli presented extra- or intra-orally. Method: Using a retrospective chart review, the current study aimed to examine the treatment outcomes of 18 feeding tube-dependent children with significant oral aversion (nine boys, nine girls; M[subscript age] = 46.7 months, SD = 20.0 months, range: 11.4-89.3 months) as compared to 29 tube-dependent, but nonorally averse, clinical controls. Children completed approximately 6-8 weeks of intensive interdisciplinary feeding treatment. Results: Analyses revealed significant improvements in all measured treatment outcomes for both patient groups, including children's rates of acceptance and maladaptive mealtime behavior. Significant reductions in tube use were also observed across both groups, with tube utilization decreasing, on average, by 76.2% for orally averse and by 64.3% for nonorally averse children by program discharge. Conclusion: Results demonstrate the therapeutic benefits of intensive interdisciplinary intervention for both groups of tube-dependent children, highlighting that orally averse children, believed to be an especially challenging subset of pediatric feeding patients, demonstrate similarly positive treatment responses. Interestingly, in this preliminary examination, orally averse children demonstrated significantly greater reductions in tube utilization following discharge when compared with their nonorally averse clinical peers.

AB  - This aims to determine the formation of primary school children's speech skills in interdisciplinary communication in learning environments in learning environments and verify the effectiveness of a methodology for the improvement of speech skills in interdisciplinary communication in learning environments in learning environments. The theoretical significance of the study allows clarifying knowledge on the issue of the formation of speech skills; practical significance lies in the presentation and testing of a set of productive exercises aimed at developing learners' speech skills in interdisciplinary communication in learning environments in learning environments. Experimental method was used in the study. There were two groups including experimental and control groups. The experimental study involved 113 third-grade primary school children. According to the developed diagnostic technique, the formation of speech skills in interdisciplinary communication in learning environments consists of three components: motivational, substantive and reflective. Based on these components, indicators and levels characterizing the formation of elementary schoolchildren's speech skills in interdisciplinary communication in learning environments in learning environments are distinguished. During the study, the results of a verifying, forming and control experiment were presented. According to the study, it can be revealed that it is necessary to pay attention to the development of meaningful speech, because it is for this indicator that most children are at a low level of formation. This study revealed that systematic work is needed to form primary school children's speech skills.
