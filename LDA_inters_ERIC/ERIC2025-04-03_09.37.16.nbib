AB  - Working inductively from classroom research and guided by a Bakhtinian view of language, the author proposes a discourse-based theory of interdisciplinary connections. The article includes examples of four discursive resources individuals draw on to make interdisciplinary connections--content, propositions, ways of knowing, and classroom genres--with special focus on genres.

AB  - This article describes cereal box design, an interdisciplinary graphics activity. The cereal box design activity is intriguing both for its simplicity and the resourcefulness that it can generate in young people. It lends itself to a variety of curriculums. It covers both consumerism and Design for the Environment (DfE) concepts broadly and in depth. The activity introduces a wide range of topics. They include graphic design; basic drawing; sketching and rendering; measurement of area, volume, and weight; technical presentation skills; oral and written reports; the technological design process; applied problem solving; marketing; consumer research; ecopackaging; environmental education; recycling; point-of-purchase displays; and considerations of form, function, and aesthetics. Teachers can easily adapt the activity to serve as an interdisciplinary project throughout the school. Art, math, science, family and consumer sciences, music, health, history, social studies, language arts, English, and computer education each has a logical piece of the puzzle to contribute. Students can have related real world experience through a field trip to a local grocery store. They can research packaging, products, and consumer activity within their own community. Finally--and perhaps best of all--students find this activity fun, rewarding, and interesting. (Contains 1 table and 8 online resources.)

AB  - The contents of the Greek magazine "Physicos Cosmos" include science popularization, teaching proposals, and issues of educational concern. The magazine is addressed to teachers of physics and, consequently, to grammar-school pupils/students. Its articles ranged, in general, from short texts taken from physical sciences to more specialized articles. During the period under consideration (1975-1977), i.e., after the fall (1974) of the military government (1967-1974) and the outset of the educational reform, the magazine's subjects changed, comprising interdisciplinary proposals in relation to the philosophy of physical and natural sciences, their history, their social usefulness, and their connections with non-scientific culture. Some new approaches concerned particularly school geography as a multidisciplinary field.

AB  - In placement decisions necessitated by PL 94-142, the multidimensional team approach may be hindered by group problems. The more structured nominal group technique (NGT) is suggested. NGT has six steps: silent, written generation of ideas; round robin reporting; group discussion for clarification; preliminary priority vote; discussion; and final vote. (GDC)

AB  - Individual trainees have various responses to the initial teacher training process, but there are some frequently occurring patterns that require explanation, understanding and attention. Drawing on the literature, a multi-disciplinary approach is developed to examine the beliefs, concerns and priorities of trainee teachers' thinking from social, cultural, physiological and psychological perspectives. The resulting discussion is illustrated by a consideration of how best to encourage trainee teachers to broaden their teaching repertoire. This analysis suggests that the implementation of personal educational belief is likely to be deferred by trainees because many trainee teachers do not have time in a one-year training course to reach the stage of testing their intentions in practice. This results in their beliefs surviving intact. In terms of developing a wider teaching repertoire for trainees, the analysis suggests that it would be appropriate to consider the trainee teacher's developing self-efficacy, their beliefs about the value of an extended repertoire, their beliefs about the effects of an extended repertoire and their subjective norm beliefs about the views of their mentors and pupils regarding the extended repertoire. To broaden the repertoire of trainee teachers will require mentors to seek out, support and praise the use of a wide repertoire by trainees. This will reduce cognitive dissonance and make use of reciprocal determinism to affect the trainee teacher's sense of self-efficacy, so that, in turn, trainees will be encouraged to value and develop an extended teaching repertoire. As well as offering this challenge, mentors would need to provide support as a positive role model, and try to reduce the trainee teacher's fear of failure. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - In response to changing federal priorities, much discussion has taken place recently about the need for graduate education programs to firmly embrace interdisciplinary research, or "interdisciplinary integration across related fields" (National Research Council, 2004, p. 6). The related fields usually are understood to be certain social and behavioral sciences. From the perspective of the humanities, the author challenges an emerging view, widely regarded as commonsensical, about the proper nature of interdisciplinarity in education and what  counts as good education research (Hostetler, 2005). He devotes particular attention to the problem of determining and distinguishing ends and means and the dangers of narrowness, and provides examples of the value of the humanities to education research.

AB  - Despite the increasing public demand for enhanced care of older patients and those with life-threatening illness, health professionals have had limited formal education in geriatrics and palliative care. Furthermore, formal education in interdisciplinary team training is limited. In order to remedy this situation, proactive interventions are being undertaken so that education and training in palliative care is being embedded within the training of physicians, nurses, social workers, as well as other associated health team members. This article discusses various educational approaches to interdisciplinary team-based geriatric and palliative care, highlighting the interdisciplinary didactic and clinical educational opportunities offered by an Interprofessional Palliative Care Fellowship Program, as well as an Associated Health Training Program at the Geriatrics Research, Education, and Clinical Center, Bronx Veteran's Medical Center. The article further describes the educational initiatives in palliative care offered through the Veteran's Integrated Service Network (VISN). Innovative educational strategies are discussed within the context of the existing literature on interdisciplinary health care team training. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - This study examines the impact of an interdisciplinary training program on knowledge and attitudes of learners from four health care programs: medicine, pharmacy, social work, and nursing. Sixty-two learners participated in a 4-day educational program (one day each week for 4 weeks) focusing on interdisciplinary geriatric care. After completing the program, learner scores improved on a knowledge test and two attitudinal subscales, and they reported a positive training experience. A short-term interdisciplinary educational intervention can have an impact on learners' knowledge of and attitudes toward older adults, and improve their understanding and confidence in participating in an interdisciplinary collaborative care team.

AB  - The new reader "Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction" is part of a series "designed for students who have typically completed an introductory course in philosophy and are coming to feminist philosophy for the first time". Why should music educators adopt this feminist introduction to gender and aesthetics when they can readily turn to more familiar scholarship by musicologists and music education scholars such as Jane Bowers, Wayne Bowman, Philip Brett, Marcia Citron, Elizabeth Gould, Roberta Lamb, Susan McClary, Carol Neuls-Bates, Patricia O'Toole, John Shepherd, Christopher Small, Ruth Solie, Judith Tick, and others? Having read the book, the author wants to answer that question by speaking to its promise as an interdisciplinary vehicle. Korsmeyer's text provides a starting point where students, academics, and professionals from different disciplines can compare and learn from each other's insights and, ultimately, develop pedagogical innovations that serve both co-curricular reform and positive social change. In this essay, the author first proposes how this might happen before turning her attention to two key themes in Korsmeyer's text--visual hegemony and venerable dualisms--and their significance in the context of music education. The author concludes with some brief suggestions for the next edition of the reader. (Contains 3 notes.)

AB  - This paper describes the details of a National Science Foundation multi-year educational project at the University of Oklahoma (OU). The goal of this comprehensive active-learning and hands-on laboratory program is to develop an interdisciplinary program, in which engineering, geoscience, and meteorology students participate, which forms a community of university scholars. The program is intended to generate a unique, interdisciplinary, research-oriented learning environment that will train future engineers and meteorologists in the full set of competencies needed to take raw radar data to detect weather and aircraft. The program involves new coursework and is oriented around other successful programs to ensure wide distribution by many students and scientists. Supported by the Division of Undergraduate at the NSF, the project began with a Phase II grant in the fall of 2004, which also recently received a Phase II grant to refine the project through 2010. In keeping with the global movement of electronic knowledge delivery via written, as well as visual media, several weblinks have been established for this paper.

AB  - According to Carl Sagan (1987), "Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge." Field studies and undergraduate research provide students with the best opportunities for "thinking" about science, while at the same time acquiring a body of knowledge. Natural History of Tropical Carbonate Ecosystems is a spring semester course cross-listed in biology, geology, and environmental studies, with a prerequisite of two semesters of introductory biology, geology, or environmental science. The purpose of the course is to provide from these three discipline areas an introduction to the unique ecology and geology of tropical-marine ecosystems with an emphasis on the Bahamas, including additional opportunities to investigate problems of human impact on tropical island marine and non-marine ecosystems and island karst hydrologic systems.

AB  - Collection development for interdisciplinary areas is more complex than for traditionally well-defined disciplines, so new evaluation methods are needed. This article identifies variables in interdisciplinary fields and presents a model of their typical information components. Traditional use-centered and materials-centered evaluation methods should be supplemented by subject analysis, service measurement, and electronic resource assessment. (LAM)

AB  - Examines implications of specific subject matter intervention by faculty members in economics and marketing on the choices made by students and the consequences of those choices in an online finance simulation. Findings, although mixed, suggest that interdisciplinary intervention in an online finance simulation has the potential to improve the quality of decisions made and overall student performance, especially when intervention material is new to the students.

Teaching at a historically Black university, the authors used one such database, the ING Gazelle Index, which measures the business confidence of small, fast growing African-American firms. Instructors reviewed student papers based on this Index and analyzed a postproject survey taken by the students. There are a variety of lesser known economic indices and other data sources that can be used in a similar  manner. The following are appended: (1) Economics Project Template Using Real Datasets for Interdisciplinary Business/Economics Projects: ING Gazelle Index; and (2) Information Systems (IS) Project Template Using Real Datasets for Interdisciplinary Business/Economics Projects: ING Gazelle Index.

AB  - An interdisciplinary approach to teaching physical education can contribute in many ways to the mission of the school. It can draw interest in physical education from administrators, parents, and community members, and can help legitimize the position of the physical educator on the faculty by showing colleagues in the classroom that physical education involves more than just games. In some states, such as North Carolina, an interdisciplinary  approach to physical education can help schools earn various levels of distinction based on overall school performance. In this article, the authors provide tips for adopting an interdisciplinary approach to physical education and making it the most beneficial. Tips discussed include: communicating with colleagues; collecting information on core subjects and plan lessons; and providing activity-based lessons that reinforce core subject matter.

AB  - Curricula, whether presented in public schools, private schools, home schools, enrichment programs, after-school programs, classes for the gifted, or the regular classroom, must withstand the scrutiny of the community, parents, teachers, and the students. Curricula that are not interesting have the potential to consume precious learning time and sap the energy and motivation of students.

AB  - Distance education online in gerontology in academic settings is designed to reflect content relevant to gerontology practices, academic standards, teaching strategies, and technology that embrace content delivery while enhancing learning. A balance with community services and needs for older adult populations, academic integrity, stakeholders, and resources, with an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary student-centered approach are important. Considering these factors and based on a needs assessment, this article describes a process model used to create an interdisciplinary gerontology education program for online delivery at Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU). The realities, pearls of wisdom, and lessons learned from creating and implementing the FGCU online interdisciplinary undergraduate gerontology education in the academic setting are also presented.

AB  - Interdisciplinary teaming in middle schools has increased dramatically over the past few decades (McEwin, Dickinson & Jensen, 2003); nevertheless, students have rarely been consulted as important sources of insight into this practice (Dickinson & Erb, 1997) of two or more teachers sharing the responsibility for instruction, curriculum, and assessment of a common group of students (NMSA, 1995). The purpose of this study was to describe and analyze young adolescents' perceptions of effective interdisciplinary teaming. Qualitative methods were employed to describe, analyze, and interpret the perceptions of 77 middle level students from three middle schools. A multi-genre approach was used to represent the findings, including analytic writing, student-produced photographs, narrative vignette, and poetic transcription. Findings indicated that students felt like trusted members of a community, viewing themselves as self-disciplined and self-directed learners. Students perceived themselves to be growing in confidence, independence, and tolerance, gaining leadership and collaborative skills, and belonging to a family. Data indicate that when schools are organized to support multi-year teams, and when students are invited to collaborate in team governance and learning, many students report positive personal growth.

AB  - This article makes the case that authentic music learning need not be sacrificed nor compromised in any way when the music teacher designs and teaches curricula and units of study that integrate music learning with learning in other academic subjects, including other fine and performing arts subjects. The author argues that music teachers may think they are losing instructional time in the service of other subjects when, in fact, if music teachers understand the cognitive connections and shared information among subjects, they have opportunities to enhance music learning in substantive and authentic ways. Some sample curricular designs are outlined in the article as examples of how learning among subjects can serve multiple subject areas, including music.

AB  - There is a growing interest in collaboration amongst teachers at all levels. One of the most intensive collaborative experiences is "team teaching," a course with one or more colleagues. The authors have been involved in team teaching for a combined total of 25 years. This study investigates the question of how colleagues from different disciplines can achieve an effective partnership in team teaching. Fourteen practicing team teachers were interviewed over a two-year period at a small English-medium liberal arts college in Japan. The interviews were all recorded on videotape and were transcribed for later content analysis. The content of the first set of interviews provided the main themes for a more in-depth exploration in the second interview set. Analyses of these interview transcripts revealed key elements for effective partnership in interdisciplinary team teaching. These elements are presented in the paper through the words of the team teachers recorded in the interviews. The paper concludes with some general reflections on how these key elements of effective partnership in team teaching relate to the wider teaching community. (Contains 1 figure and 2 tables.)

AB  - Teachers at universities are facing an increasing disparity in students' prior IT knowledge and, at the same time, experience a growing disengagement of the students with regard to involvement in study activities. As computer science teachers in a joint programme in computer science and business administration, we made a number of similar observations. We also noted increasing difficulties with mathematics and see a growing number of students with previous knowledge in computer science, while others have little or no expertise in this area. These observations cause problems and present a major challenge for teachers. To get a better understanding and as a prerequisite for reforming the programme we posed four research questions: What are the students' motives and expectations with regard to the chosen study programme? To what extent are the students engaged in non-academic work activities? What prior knowledge do the students have about IT and computer science? What off campus access do the students have to IT facilities? Our findings provide a number of interesting indications. The results regarding motives and expectations suggest that there ought to be a good basis for the students to improve their efforts in computer science. However, as the majority does not know what kind of work to carry out in the future, better information about the programme and relevant jobs should be provided. Concerning the students' disengagement and its possible relation to their external workload, no conclusions can be drawn and this issue has to be researched further. The same is true about the students' expertise in mathematics. The students' previous knowledge seems to be so comprehensive that it should be considered in the teaching and inform the whole curriculum design. As there are still a substantial number of students who arrive at the programme with no previous knowledge, it is however necessary to design a syllabus and organise the course programme to accommodate different types of students. The survey also shows that IT is a natural toolset for the students, which in the future should be used more deliberately for the education. The paper provides the opportunity for other faculty to reflect on the role their students' backgrounds and expectations may play in the classroom experience. A copy of the survey is included in the appendix as a guide for those interested in conducting a similar study of their own student population. (Contains 11 tables.)

AB  - The Dickinson School of Law of the Pennsylvania State University offers several specialized in-house legal clinics. This article focuses on the outreach services of the Elder Law and Consumer Protection Clinic and the Children's Advocacy Clinic. These programs provide opportunities for law students to obtain practical experience in a thoughtful and reflective environment and engage the students in community outreach and public policy advocacy. This article reviews the development of the two clinical programs as vital components of an engaged university and further suggests how interdisciplinary collaboration helps to guide their growth.

AB  - This paper describes the development of an innovative interprofessional doctorate in health and social care, within an academic framework designed explicitly to ensure that candidates must demonstrate qualities of cognitive application commensurate with doctoral study, yet must also meet the practice-focused outcomes of a professional doctorate. The degree requires students to attend highly interactive workshops in Stage 1 that encourage academic debate and "doctoral" development, in contrast to the "taught" modular elements of many other professional doctorates. Papers submitted during Stage 1 assume increasing levels of complex doctoral skills in developing a research proposal that undergoes the same rigorous evaluation required of PhD students in securing University Approval. The degree is awarded at the end of Stage 2 only after defence of a thesis in a viva voce examination that involves procedures and processes defined by the University for the award of PhD.

AB  - New career opportunities exist for family and consumer sciences (FCS)professionals as traditional formats for shopping service, and information transition to a virtual environment. The requisite competencies and skills necessary for effective online operations are identified. Interactions with industry personnel and supporting literature revealed six important concepts: e-merchandising strategies, consumer segmentation, design architecture, analytic aptitude, communication proficiency, and computer expertise. These competencies and related skills provided the framework for the development of an interdisciplinary undergraduate degree in e-merchandising. Recommendations for FCS program implementation are presented. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - Educators expect students to question, explain, hypothesize, and devise tests to determine validity concerning science and its applications. The traditional approach of presenting individual courses concentrating on single disciplines and ignoring linkages to other disciplines is abysmal. If we expect students to understand how science is related to the humanities, it is important to provide the links and bring the disciplines together in a coherent interdisciplinary course using Science, Technology, and Society together in a constructivist methodology. Science, Technology, and Society and constructivism recognize that science does not operate in a vacuum nor does student learning. Knowledge is continuing being assembled by learners and science learning must be taught in the scope of the human experience and understanding.

AB  - The primary objective of this study was to improve the educational success of children with sickle-cell disease (SCD) and cerebral infarcts. A prospective intervention trial was conducted; a multidisciplinary team was created to maximize educational resources for children with SCD and cerebral infarcts. Students were evaluated systematically before and after the intervention. A baseline evaluation was completed assessing the presence of an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), grade retention in school, and days absent from school in the year preceding the intervention. A post intervention assessment occurred 2 years later for these same measurements. At baseline, 74% (17 of 23) of the students were receiving IEPs. Two years later, 87% (20 of 23) students received IEPs (p = 0.34). Despite the intervention, the rate of children retained in their school grade increased from 0.6 per 100 years in school at baseline to 1.7 per 100 years, 95% CI (-3.86, 1.49). The school absenteeism rate did not significantly change after the intervention; the average days absent per student rose from 15.5 to 22.5, (p = 0.05). The multidisciplinary team effort alone was insufficient to decrease grade retention and absenteeism rate. Further support, from either the parents or school administration, is needed to increase education attainment of students with cerebral infarcts.

AB  - The Talacchanda project took place as an independent research-exhibition undertaking supported by the Glasgow School of Art. Over seventeen months an exploratory education programme was introduced at various levels of schools and higher education. The education programme sprang from a contemporary art exhibition and dance performance called Talaccahnda which was informed by ancient Indian thought on art and drama. The exhibition and performance took place in Glasgow's Tramway Project Room and Theatre in October 2002. It had been shown previously in the British Council Gallery in New Delhi in 2000, and later in 2001 at the artist run space Out of the Blue in Edinburgh. Thanks to Scottish Arts Council Lottery funding, Talacchanda Glasgow was accompanied by an education programme, which offered workshops and events in schools, at the gallery, through community groups as well as at GSA and Reid Kerr College, Paisley. By demonstrating connections between apparently disparate activities, the project aimed to serve as a catalyst for fresh thinking on inter-cultural and anti-racist education, and to strengthen connections between the community groups and institutions involved.

AB  - This paper describes our experience of managing a two-year research project that involved University staff from two different disciplines and three industry partners. It describes the benefits we gained from the involvement of multiple parties, such as the ability to call upon diverse expertise, the capacity to study a complex issue and the ability to make a direct contribution to industry practice. It also describes some of the difficulties such as managing across University structures, maintaining the collaborators' interest in the project, gaining approval from multiple ethics committees and managing the expectations of various stakeholders. The paper concludes with a number of recommendations for senior University staff and for researchers and points to ways universities could better facilitate involvement in these types of complex research projects.

AB  - This article evaluates the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary social work and law curriculum for domestic violence. A pretest-posttest control group design with both law and social work students indicates that the course effectively increased: (1) knowledge about domestic violence theory and practice and differential roles, duties, and privileges of lawyers and social workers, and (2) positive attitudes about interdisciplinary work; and reduced (3) myths and stereotypes about domestic violence. Implications for interdisciplinary teaching and domestic violence services are discussed. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - When a marketer teaches general ethics courses, widespread ontological shock can result on campus. A case for positive paradigm expansion of all involved persons in an interdisciplinary environment is made. Suggestions for specific interdisciplinary opportunities and applications are provided. A call for interdisciplinary efforts is made and supported. Teaching outside your field is always chancy but when your terminal degree is marketing and the courses outside the area of expertise you are asked to teach are general distribution courses in ethics, cross-listed as Philosophy, it might be more than chancy, it may be ridiculous according to the received view. Reactions from colleagues in the business school may (and did) range from puzzlement to high hilarity particularly if one has been successful in business "in the real world" as was the case in this instance. Other colleagues seem to experience ontological shock as if they have suddenly found themselves in an alternate universe where "up" is "down." This report is about doing the academically strange thing of teaching across the curriculum and enjoying it. But wait, there's more, and even greater heresy! This will urge others in professional schools, sciences and other disciplines to consider the idea; and then do it, for all-around "wins" for all involved.

AB  - Disability studies is an emerging field of inquiry that investigates the disability experience as a socially constructed phenomenon similar to issues of race, gender, and class. However, the literature of adult education shows that we are not making these same connections. Nor are we conducting a thorough investigation of how the manifestations of the disability experience affect and/or constrain the adult learning context. This article promotes the idea of an interdisciplinary relationship between adult education and disability studies as a way to investigate the disability experience within the adult learning context. An overview of adult education and disability is provided first, along with a review of the disability studies literature, its history, tenets, and critiques. Embedded within this discussion are suggested implications for adult education practice and theory. The author concludes her discussion with possible ideas for research that she argues will create new lines of inquiry within adult education.

AB  - This study considered the interrelationships among biological maturation and its physical correlates, social physique anxiety, and appearance-related physical self-perceptions in 113 adolescent female figure skaters participating in solo (n = 73) or partner contexts (n = 40). Participants were interviewed about their menarcheal status, underwent a battery of anthropometric measurements, and completed the Physical Self Description Questionnaire and the Social Physique Anxiety Scale. Menarcheal status was a stronger correlate of physical self-perceptions than age. A combination of biological and psychological characteristics accounted for 25% of the variance in appearance-related physical self-perceptions. Younger, premenarcheal, ectomorphic skaters reporting lower social physique anxiety were more satisfied with their body fat and sport competence but reported lower self-esteem, global physical self-concept, and appearance scores. Skating context did not predict physical self-perceptions. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Effective substance abuse prevention programs help students develop knowledge as well as psychosocial competencies that can help them resist or delay the initiation of alcohol, tobacco and other drug (ATOD) use. This paper describes the integration process used in a five-year project, Adoption of Drug Abuse Prevention Training (ADAPT), to study the effectiveness of two methods of drug prevention programming, based on Botvin's Life Skills Training (LST) program. Botvin's standard LST program was implemented in three middle/junior high schools, the integrated or infused delivery of LST (I-LST) was implemented in three similar middle/junior high schools, and both methods of delivery were compared with three matched schools that received no treatment. Rather than implementing the traditional LST program, teachers in the infused condition developed a set of prevention lessons each year from the standard LST curriculum constructs and delivered them within their standard subject areas. This infused or integrated approach provided increased dosages of consistent prevention messages from multiple sources within the school in conjunction with their regular subject matter. Strategies for diffusion and adoption of the infused LST model are discussed as well as the teacher training process, lesson implementation, and evaluation procedures. The participating teachers' experiences, recommendations and difficulties are presented, and a sample program infusion matrix is included. Outcome results indicate that neither standard LST nor an infused LST delivery method was found effective for the entire sample, although some encouraging results were found for the females in the study.

AB  - The education literature has increasingly called for collaboration between teachers as a way to enhance the quality of teaching. In the TESOL field, content-based language teaching and English for Specific Purposes approaches are being more widely adopted. These developments call for increased collaboration between language teachers and colleagues in the subject-area disciplines. This study investigates how interdisciplinary contact between language and content specialists might be viewed as a possible model for teacher development. By teacher development we mean the ability to make adjustments to one's teaching practices according to the demands of a curriculum, learner needs and the institution where a teacher works. For this study, fourteen practicing team teachers were interviewed over a twoyear period at an English-medium liberal arts college in Japan. The interviews were all recorded on video tape and were transcribed for later content analysis. Analyses of these interview transcripts generated a model for effective partnership in interdisciplinary team teaching. This model is presented in the paper through the words of the team teachers. The paper concludes by highlighting what the interviewees said were the elements of effective partnership in team teaching, as well as recommending what institutions and individual teachers can do to encourage effective partnership in team teaching.
