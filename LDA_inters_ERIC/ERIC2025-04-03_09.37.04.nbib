AB  - The current rapid development of economy and technology calls for the cultivation of interdisciplinary talents in universities. When faced with this challenge, language universities, as a specialized type, need to take a range of factors into consideration, among which language students' attitudes play a crucial role for further course design. This present study carried out a survey among students in the major language universities in China, and analyzed the results to identify students' attitudes to interdisciplinary education. Results show half of the students are positive about the implementation of interdisciplinary education, however they lack the knowledge about what interdisciplinary education is and how it is carried out. The problems are discussed and a series of suggestions are proposed in order to promote the interdisciplinary program in language universities efficiently and effectively.

AB  - This paper explores the idea of a formalized "critical space" in higher education, using elements of Habermas's theory of communicative action and ideas from Barnett, Englund, and Marginson. Inquiry in this hypothetical space would use knowledge generated in existing domains to engage in dialogue, debate, and development of proposals and programs for social change, with the ultimate objective of engagement in the public sphere.

AB  - This study, undertaken in the Northwest USA, explores how graduate students in an interdisciplinary social-ecological systems research course engaged with concepts of epistemic difference and Indigenous knowledge as part of a required module titled "Ways of Knowing" to engage social and ecological change in climate science. We describe how graduate students engaged with Indigenous ways of knowing and discussion of interdisciplinary equity across knowledge systems and methodologies. Analysis of student perspectives drawn from fieldnotes, student course work, and post-course interviews illuminates tensions in preparing interdisciplinary science researchers to navigate epistemic difference. Students embraced Indigenous ways of knowing as useful for conceptualizing complex tensions in social-ecological systems research, while simultaneously sidestepping deeply rooted issues of power and coloniality in research. We trace two primary ways Indigenous ways of knowing informed interdisciplinary processes in students' conceptualizations of social-ecological challenges: Science as more expansive: Reflexivity and interpersonal dilemmas; and Grappling with power and settler colonial discomfort. We argue that continued engagement in epistemic difference, particularly Indigenous knowledges, is necessary for cultivating scientific engagement in complex notions of knowledge equity in climate sciences involving Indigenous peoples/lands. Finding underscore how changes in graduate research training can expand research imaginaries, however, such expansions need to be systematic and multi-stranded to interrupt the deep-rooted marginalization of non-Western knowledges in scientific research.

AB  - The complexity of the world's current grand challenges demands interdisciplinary approaches. The education of future scientists must cross the silos of the traditional disciplines; however, there is still a strong reluctance to tear such walls down. Here, we describe an integrative chemical biology course focused on epigenetics that strives to bring research culture to chemistry and biology Master's students. The course, which has been successfully implemented for the past two years, combines three modules: lectures, discovery-based research lab, and science communication. Importantly, the outline of our course design could be easily adapted to different fields, improving the synergy between research and teaching in our universities.

AB  - There has been a worldwide interdisciplinary curriculum development. By examining several official interdisciplinary curriculum in Hong Kong, this paper argues that curriculum integration which incorporates learning about globalization and global citizenship has gradually developed since the late 1990s. By using cross-sectional focus group interviews with experienced teachers and a sample of students, the author identified benefits such as enhancing students' interdisciplinary knowledge and applying critical thinking. But limitations can be found in having a weak disciplinary knowledge and difficult to develop transferrable skills, which necessitates teacher training. This paper also discusses the recent Liberal Studies controversy and youth protests.

AB  - Purpose: This quasi-experimental study evaluated the effects on students' autonomous motivation and satisfaction from a program integrating physics concepts in physical education. Method: A total of 487 students (age 13 [plus or minus] 1) participated in the study. The participants were students participating in physical education classes divided into intervention (n = 183), comparison, and control condition (n = 150 and n = 154, respectively). Before the intervention and three times during its implementation, the students responded on measures of situational motivation with good construct validity. Results: The intervention increased the students' autonomous motivation and satisfaction in physical education and decreased the students' amotivation. Conclusion: An effective integration of physics concepts and physical activities can promote meaningful learning, a holistic education perspective, autonomous motivation, and wellness in physical education.

AB  - This research aims to explore the effectiveness of interdisciplinary education program based on multicultural education on the tolerance value, attitude and critical thinking skills of the fourth grade primary school students. Single group pre-posttest design has been used in the study. The research has been carried out with 30 fourth-grade students, at a primary school located within the district of Karakocan in Elazig during the 2015-2016 academic year. Among the participants, 15 are females and 15 are males. The research has employed Tolerance Attitude Scale developed by Kaptan-Yarar, tolerance value and critical thinking story tests and scoring rubrics. Descriptive statistics and dependent samples t-test have been used during data analysis. Research results have revealed a statistically significant difference between critical thinking scoring rubric, tolerance value scoring rubric and tolerance attitude scale pretest-posttest scores in favor of posttest. Based on these results, it can be said that the interdisciplinary curriculum developed based on multicultural education improves students' critical thinking skills, tolerance value and attitudes.

AB  - Successful research and teaching of discipline genres is based on collaboration among language and learning specialists with expertise in applied linguistics, and subject area specialists with expertise in the knowledge and communication practices of their disciplines. These interdisciplinary collaborations involve experts coming together around an area of shared interest in a community of practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991), where members are committed to building relationships to learn from each other, and in this process build new knowledge (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006). This paper aims to identify the kinds of knowledge building negotiations involving a team of discipline staff, academic literacy specialists, and e-learning specialists as they collaborate in the design of online learning materials to support students in writing the laboratory report genre in the discipline of physiology. The data consist of recordings of team members' spoken interactions, with or without other artefacts, such as storyboards, over a period of nine months as the design for the website evolved. Initial discourse analysis of transcripts, based on the metafunctions from Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) (Halliday, 1985a), is used to identify phases where the emphasis is on the negotiation of ideational, or content meanings, enabled by interpersonal and textual meanings. A sample of these phases is then analysed in detail using exchange structure (Martin, 1992) to identify possible genres which build new knowledge and embody it in the online resources.

AB  - To address the recent calls for integration between liberal arts education and the business curriculum, we designed the team-taught interdisciplinary course, How to Cell: Marketing Meets Microbiology. The course blended multiple introductory courses, focused on environmental issues involving microbiology, and addressed how they were being "marketed" to the public. It introduced students from business, science, and other majors to presumably unrelated topics. Our main objective was to help students gain a greater sense of awareness about the roles of business and science in environmental management activities.

AB  - The STEMITL project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between a Southeastern University's middle grades education department and local PDS partner school districts incorporating six full-day immersive projects for seventh-grade students. During the 2016-2017 academic year, seventh-grade students were brought to the university's newly constructed STEAM Center where middle grades practicum students implemented day-long interdisciplinary lessons co-designed by faculty and teacher candidates. Lessons incorporated social studies, science, mathematics, and literacy around a central theme of water pollution in China. The practicum student teachers (PSTs) fully executed the STEMITL curricula three times per semester allowing for hands-on application of lesson design and implementation as well as real-world teaching experience with integrated, interdisciplinary learning. Further, PSTs and middle school students collaborated with secondary school students and teachers in a partner school in Hong Kong via online communication, videos, and data sharing. Lessons learned are shared.

AB  - To illuminate barriers to collaboration, this study examines who participates in cross-boundary scholarly collaboration most often and which types of boundary crossing (disciplinary, institutional, role) are engaged in most often. The data of this study came from an interdisciplinary consortium with five partner institutions, including one Historically Black College and University (HBCU). The core disciplines involved in the consortium are life sciences, computer science and math and engineering. Through statistical analysis, we determined that members of the consortium engaged more in interdisciplinary research than inter-institutional research. Participation in all boundary crossing collaborations was greater at the HBCU and students and postdocs were less likely than academics to cross-institutional boundaries.

AB  - In higher education, despite disciplinary expertise and teaching experience, faculty who are asked to implement curriculum into new modalities, particularly ones that rely heavily on technology such as blended learning, may be intimidated and overwhelmed. However, instructors may be more willing to explore new modalities if they feel that support is available. Professional Learning Communities, or PLCs, support instructors embarking on teaching in new modalities and and using new technology to support and expand their instruction. The current study looks at how a PLC was utilized to support faculty who piloted a blended learning model of course instruction. Seven faculty members from different disciplines shared their perceptions of how PLC meetings affected their ability to teach in the blended learning modality. Various sources of qualitative data, including surveys, interviews, and meetings notes, were analyzed to see the ways in which the faculty members viewed and utilized the PLC. Faculty reported that the PLC provided support, new ideas, and enhanced teaching and learning outcomes. The interdisciplinary nature of this collaborative group was particularly helpful in allowing instructors to expand their pedagogical practices within this new modality. They also felt more comfortable in their own ability to teach in this modality after receiving feedback from their peers who were also teaching blended learning sections for the first time. This preliminary study provides support that PLCs can assist in shaping faculty skills and boost interdisciplinary collaboration when faculty adapt their teaching to a new pedagogical modality, such as blended.

AB  - This article invites a discussion about the inclusion of issues on gender and sexualities in the curriculum of five different interdisciplinary undergraduate courses that focus on the formation of educators (Arts, Languages, Mathematics and Computing, Humanistics and Nature Sciences) at Universidade Federal do Sul da Bahia, in Brazil. The analytical methodology is the autobiographic experience, based on the Benjaminian storyteller, and the results are constituted by this experience under analysis within a narrative organized in three moments: (1) the discussions within a group of professors of these courses about the inclusion of such issues in the curriculum; (2) the construction of study plans; and (3) the experiences in the classroom. The narrated process shows that the issues on gender and sexualities, from a scientific perspective (gender and queer studies, and feminisms) are incipient on these courses, unknown to the students, and a challenge to the school. In this sense, the experience influenced some change into the reality of these courses, by including specific topics in the curriculum that dialogue directly with the educational process.

AB  - Interest in interdisciplinary programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-related fields at the graduate-degree level is widespread across American higher education. Using longitudinal qualitative interviews, this article considers the early career experiences of scholars who hold an interdisciplinary PhD in neuroscience. The scholars were interviewed first as doctoral students and then 6 years later. The findings illustrate the challenges of marketability, professional development, and balancing personal and career demands for interdisciplinary PhD recipients in STEM-related fields.

AB  - The growing interest in the collaborative design education for innovation has mainly been concerned with students and learning outcomes. We know less about the collaboration between the tutors who teach interdisciplinary design courses. Addressing this gap, this article explores the effect of space on the interdisciplinary collaboration between faculty members from the fields of industrial design, architecture, engineering and business administration, who come together to design and conduct an extra-curricular educational activity, Interdisciplinary Design Studio (IDS) at METU. The empirical basis of this study comes from the interviews with the faculty members and the participant observation notes generated during the IDS meetings. The findings show that the effect of space on collaboration becomes evident over three issues, (1) the participation of tutors, (2) the commonality of their expectations from a design project, and (3) the interaction not only between students and tutors, but also among tutors as an interdisciplinary team.

AB  - Using data from economics and history courses taught across multiple semesters, the authors show that a triweekly meeting frequency improves student performance relative to a biweekly meeting frequency. There is evidence that this effect operates through two channels. First, there is an indirect effect that operates through attendance. While greater attendance improves course score, this effect is less in a triweekly course. Second, there is a direct positive effect to more frequent course meetings on student performance. These two effects combine to increase student performance by 3 to 9 percentage points when meeting triweekly instead of biweekly. While students perform better overall on a triweekly meeting schedule, there are more absences and less consistent attendance.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to analyse the interdisciplinary media literacy activities in terms of the views of primary school students. The study was conducted in the spring semester of the 2015-2016 academic year. The participants of the study were 90 fourth-grade students. The study's implementation process conducted in the courses of social studies, science and Turkish Language as an interdisciplinary approach. For the gains of each course, various materials were developed. In addition to these materials, various media products were also used. The data of the study were collected through student diaries and interviews conducted with 20 participants. These data were analysed through descriptive analysis. The findings of the study showed that interdisciplinary media literacy activities were influential in improving the media literacy skills of students in the courses of science, social studies and Turkish language and that these activities contributed to students in terms of different domains.

AB  - Our contribution maps the journey towards setting up a transdisciplinary, interprofessional collaboration between coaching practitioners and coaching researchers from the fields of Applied Linguistics and Applied Psychology. The goal of such a project is to build a community of interest around a common cause, i.e., a practically relevant, language-based coaching problem (in our case, questioning practices in executive coaching), and to collaboratively solve the problem on the basis of assembling and integrating the various epistemes. The purpose of our contribution in the form of a travel report is twofold: firstly, to theoretically and conceptually discuss the challenges and affordances of aligning perspectives and assembling epistemes for such a transdisciplinary research project; Secondly, to present the available epistemic bases and offer first empirical results from our applied linguistic research and our cooperation with Applied Psychology that served as the basis for conceptualising the project "Questioning Sequences in Coaching" (Graf, Spranz-Fogasy, & Künzli, 2020). We end this travel report by critically assessing the transdisciplinary character of the current project and by envisioning another kind of cooperation between coaching practice and coaching research as the future destination of our research journey.

AB  - There is a growing demand for degreed science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) professionals, but the production of degreed STEM students is not keeping pace. Problems exist at every juncture along the pipeline. Too few students choose to major in STEM disciplines. Many of those who do major in STEM drop out or change majors. Females and minorities remain underrepresented in STEM. The success rate of college students who are from low-income background or first-generation students is much lower than that of students who do not face such challenges. Some of those who successfully complete their degree need help in making the transition to the workforce after graduation. A program at Lamar University takes a multidisciplinary approach to addressing these problems. It is designed to recruit, retain and transition undergraduates to careers in STEM, focusing its efforts on five science disciplines and on these "at-risk" students. The program was supported by a 5-year grant from the National Science Foundation and is supported through August 31, 2016 by Lamar University and a grant from ExxonMobil. A formal assessment plan documents the program's success. The program received an award from the Texas Higher Education Board for its contributions towards Closing the Gaps in Higher Education in Texas. This paper describes the program's theoretical framework, research questions, methods, evaluation plan, and instruments. It presents an analysis of the results achieved using these methods and implications for improvements to the program resulting from lessons learned.

AB  - Providing college students with learning experiences that account for the interdisciplinary nature of most STEM professions has proven challenging. STEM educational practices typically follow a more scripted process designed to build important foundational skills. In contrast, most STEM professions are interdisciplinary and collaborative in nature. Thus, a gap in experience is created that needs to be addressed if we desire our students to be successful. One potential solution is to hold extra-curricular events, such as a hack day, to provide students with collaborative interdisciplinary learning experiences. We held two such hack day events and found that these events were a highly effective at increasing both the interest and interdisciplinary knowledge of undergraduates.

AB  - Critical thinking skills are widely considered to be important transferable skills gained from taking college-level economics courses that are also highly valued by employers. Yet, the literature on intentionally teaching critical thinking skills in undergraduate economics classes is still relatively sparse. The author of this article outlines an innovative approach to teaching critical thinking skills through class participation activities designed to promote critical reading of outside sources in an interdisciplinary climate economics course. The course goal is to equip students with the skills to articulate how economists contribute to the thinking on climate change and apply basic economics tools to explain and evaluate climate policy.

AB  - During a classroom-based study, Grade 4 students were provided with multiple opportunities to develop their visual meaning-making skills and competences, as well as their aesthetic understanding of and critical thinking about multimodal texts. Intentionally designed instruction during the research included a range of activities focused on specific elements of visual art and design. Student participants read and discussed, and wrote about selections of children's literature during Language Arts, Social Studies, and Science. "The Sea Book" was one of the books featured during an interdisciplinary unit on Ocean Literacy, a component of the overall case study research. Content analysis of the students' responses about the trade book revealed their capacity to engage in five synergistic visual reading skills. As well, data analysis revealed how the students perceived, described, and interpreted the use of color, visual point of view, typography, framing and line in Milner's artwork as fulfilling multiple, and often concomitant, meaning-making purposes. The findings demonstrated that instruction about how to read and understand visual representations can enhance students' knowledge and interpretation of content conveyed through multiple modes of representation, and develop students' capacity and agency for critically reading visual and multimodal texts.

AB  - An interdisciplinary course was designed to educate students about the important role of patents in the economy and society through the lens of chemical innovations. The course consisted of six units that covered a wide variety of topics including an overview of the patent system and the importance of patents in a knowledge economy, career options for chemistry students in the patent field, the process for getting a patent, how to read and understand chemical patents, developing a patentable idea, ethics and biotechnology patents, drug patents, and public policy issues. A diverse range of chemical innovations were analyzed, including fragrances, pharmaceuticals, nicotine chewing gum, hair dyes, toner compositions, vaping formulations, and pesticides. Suggestions and examples are provided for incorporating patents into existing chemistry courses to teach fundamental chemistry concepts, emphasize the real-world applications of chemistry, examine the role of chemistry in society, encourage entrepreneurial identification, and explore how chemistry is linked with many other contexts including law, business, ethics, and public policy.

AB  - Background: Although interdisciplinarity has been a subject of interest and debate for decades, few investigations of interdisciplinary education exist. Existing studies examine the effects of interdisciplinary experiences on students' development of generic cognitive skills but not the development of interdisciplinary competencies. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study sought to explore how engineering students' characteristics, college experiences, and engineering faculty beliefs relate to students' reports of interdisciplinary competence. Design/Method: The study used a nationally representative survey sample of 5,018 undergraduate students and 1,119 faculty members in 120 U.S. engineering programs at 31 institutions. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we investigated the relationships among students' curricular and co-curricular experiences and faculty beliefs regarding interdisciplinarity in engineering education on students' reports of interdisciplinary competence. Results: This study found that a curricular emphasis on interdisciplinary topics and skills, as well as co-curricular activities, specifically, participating in nonengineering clubs and organizations, study abroad, and humanitarian engineering projects, significantly and positively relate to engineering students' reports of interdisciplinary skills. Faculty members' beliefs regarding interdisciplinarity in engineering education moderated the relationships between particular co-curricular experiences and students' interdisciplinary skills, as well as between curricular emphasis and students' interdisciplinary skills. Conclusions: This study identified a small set of experiences that are related to students' reported development of interdisciplinary competence. The study points to the critical role of the curriculum in promoting interdisciplinary thinking and habits of mind, as well as the potential of co-curricular opportunities that bring engineering students together with nonmajors to build interdisciplinary competence.

AB  - This paper explores the interdisciplinary nature of studies in the field of lifelong learning participation. Until recently, participation studies have been presented in a rather fragmented way, often drawing on insights from separate disciplines such as sociology or psychology. The complex nature of lifelong learning participation, however, urges scholars to go beyond this disciplinary fragmentation and to advance knowledge in an integrative way, through the construction of new interdisciplinary theories and the adoption of interdisciplinary research approaches. This paper discusses a new integrative theory and outlines a range of methodological challenges of working in interdisciplinary teams on interdisciplinary projects. Examples include understanding each other's disciplinary background, the need to combine different insights from sociology, psychology, learning providers and governments' policy decisions in multilevel models and the desire to adopt both quantitative and qualitative research methods.

AB  - It is within the overlap of three gaps in the literature on feminist classrooms (lack of initiation, student representation, and evaluation) that the authors situate this paper. In conceptualizing this paper, they wanted not only to describe a context from which others can consider their own present or future offerings of feminist, interdisciplinary classrooms, but to do so from a primarily student-centered perspective and one that traced the ways that the instructor mounted the course. The aim of this article is not to prescribe a pedagogic method, but rather to model the type of thinking that shaped the authors' Becomings experience and to demonstrate the potential outcomes that can arise when each participant is empowered as an equal stakeholder in the learning dynamic. They sought to reflect on their entire learning process from the initiation of their cooperatively named Becomings course to its delivery and assessment.

AB  - On graduation, teacher candidates (TCs) are typically underprepared to teach science, particularly physical science, whereas physics graduates frequently lack training in teaching or effective communication. In response, we created two models for interdisciplinary peer learning where TCs were paired with either graduate or undergraduate physics students. In both models, physics students teach TCs content knowledge relevant to a given area of either classical or quantum physics, which TCs then use to design and implement a short lesson for K-5 students. Overall, both models were successful, with the two sets of students reporting benefits in each case. Affordances for TCs included increased confidence to teach physical science and an appreciation for collaboration with experts. Physics students described increased awareness of the complexities of communicating science to general audiences and stronger community with their classmates. Students from both groups cited insufficient project time as a constraint, whereas physics students found it challenging to align their project and coursework. In moving away from traditional lecture, these interdisciplinary collaborations also benefitted us as instructors, giving us new perspectives on teaching. In light of our findings we propose improvements to these proof-of-concept models to enable their future scale-up and replication in other disciplines.

AB  - This study explored senior secondary students' beliefs and experiences of learning an interdisciplinary curriculum, Liberal Studies, in Hong Kong. Through the analysis of focus-group interviews with 168 students, most of the students were found to enjoy or at least not resist interdisciplinary learning, and preferred to study real-world contemporary issues. More than half of the students, however, expressed their relative lack of confidence in interdisciplinary learning because of the difficulties they encountered in Independent Enquiry Studies and the public examination. The students were also found to have undertaken examination-oriented activities when the public examination approached. The study sheds light on the realization of interdisciplinary learning in secondary education in contexts where teacher-centred pedagogy and an accountability agenda remain influential.

AB  - Interest in progressive education ideas has often been accompanied by advocacy for greater use of interdisciplinary and holistic learning approaches, as these are considered beneficial in conceptual, curriculum, and pedagogical terms. The paper reviews the possibilities for progress on this basis and contextualises the paper around three concurrent watershed moments in Scottish education: the end of the five-year programme implementation phase of a Curriculum for Excellence; the half-century anniversary of comprehensive schooling (1965-2015); and the centennial anniversary of the publication of Democracy in Education by John Dewey. Following a brief outlining of the Scottish policy context, the paper analyses the influence of Dewey on conceptions of curriculum integration and interdisciplinary learning and their connections with curriculum planning, effective pedagogical practices, and whole school reforms. Analysis describes the areas of conceptual clarity required and reviews how exactly versions of interdisciplinary learning might operate in practice. It is argued that the learner-led ideals championed by Dewey can still provide guidance and traction to help ensure that policy and practice gains are more than modest and variable. However, progress is likely to be greatest if school organisational changes accompany alterations to the curriculum and pedagogical culture in schools.

AB  - Developing an online learning community can help to improve student success. This presents a challenge as the student cohort is often time-limited and shifting in composition before a module starts. The continued evaluation and development of an online preparatory website for the new, year one module S112 -- "Science: concepts and practice" is reported. Evaluation of the site in 2017-18 showed high levels of student satisfaction with the resources, though very little engagement with the asynchronous forum. Therefore, improvements before the October 2018 module start centred on increasing student engagement on the forum: Firstly, tutors moderating the forums were tasked with developing several optional scientific tasks for staged release to generate student discussion. Secondly, volunteer peer mentors from the 2017-18 presentation were recruited and trained as "student buddies" to provide non-academic advice and support. Student engagement increased markedly prior to the October 2018 module. The clearest emergent theme from tutors who moderated the forums was that students were seeking to establish a study community, rather than obtain subject-specific advice. Student response to the buddies was positive, with students more willing to ask questions of the buddies than of the tutor moderators. Data for S112 show that registrations at module start increased by 23.5% from 2017 to 2018, and early withdrawals (14 days after module start) dropped by 2%. Our results provide ideas for building online student engagement, particularly in scenarios where students may come and go, and have little available time: for example, bridging gaps in time or academic readiness, whether by blended or distance learning.

AB  - Innovation and entrepreneurship education develop rapidly in China, but the teaching varies considerably in quality. Therefore, it is very important to systematically construct an evaluation index system of innovation and entrepreneurship education. The specialty setting of comprehensive universities has the characteristics of interdisciplinary. The research selected the Shenzhen Campus of Jinan University as a case study. Based on literature research, the research constructed an evaluation index system of innovation and entrepreneurship education for undergraduate students majoring in interdisciplinary arts and sciences, which is composed of 4 primary indexes and 19 secondary indexes. In total, 234 respondents were surveyed and Importance-performance Analysis modelling was performed to analyze the innovation and entrepreneurship education situation of the research object. Results show that the most important evaluation index to be improved is the innovative service platform. The findings of this study would be of use to the development of innovation and entrepreneurship education in other similar universities.

AB  - Research addressing the effects of cohort size on student success in asynchronous online discussions is sparse. As such, the following study attempted to determine an optimal student cohort size to enhance success and engagement within online discussions in general education courses at a large post-secondary university consisting of predominately adult learners. Experimental courses split mandatory discussions into one, two, or three cohorts to maintain a discussion size of no more than ten students per cohort per week. The effects of cohort size on student grade-point-average (GPA), withdraw rate, fail rate, and progression rate was evaluated in addition to effects on student satisfaction as measured by end-of-course surveys (EoCS). Results showed no significant difference in either student success or student satisfaction between courses with one, two, or three online discussion cohorts. Future online education research should focuses on upper division courses where students might benefit from smaller group discussions.d

AB  - Background: Sustainable school buildings hold much promise to reducing operating costs, improve occupant well-being and, ultimately, teacher and student performance. However, there is a scarcity of evidence on the effects of sustainable school buildings on health and performance indicators. We sought to create a framework for a multidisciplinary research agenda that links school facilities, health, and educational outcomes. Methods: We conducted a non-systematic review of peer review publications, government documents, organizational documents, and school climate measurement instruments. Results: We found that studies on the impact of physical environmental factors (air, lighting, and thermal comfort) on health and occupant performance are largely independent of research on the social climate. The current literature precludes the formation of understanding the causal relation among school facilities, social climate, occupant health, and occupant performance. Conclusions: Given the average age of current school facilities in the United States, construction of new school facilities or retrofits of older facilities will be a major infrastructure investment for many municipalities over the next several decades. Multidisciplinary research that seeks to understand the impact of sustainable design on the health and performance of occupants will need to include both an environmental science and social science perspective to inform best practices and quantification of benefits that go beyond general measures of costs savings from energy efficiencies.

AB  - The transdisciplinary literature review is an opportunity to situate the inquirer in an ecology of ideas. This article explores how we might approach this process from a perspective of complexity, and addresses some of the key challenges and opportunities. Four main dimensions are considered: (a) inquiry-based rather than discipline-based; (b) integrating rather than eliminating the inquirer from the inquiry; (c) meta-paradigmatic rather than intra-paradigmatic; and (d) applying systems and complex thought rather than reductive/disjunctive thinking.

AB  - There is a call for more transdisciplinary (TD) research, from academia, society, and funding agencies. Consequently, the field of TD research is searching for ways of proving the value and providing evidence to support the effectiveness of such research. The main challenge for evaluating TD research is attribution, that is how to link societal change to the TD research process. However, little attention has been paid to the relationship between the quality of the research process and the effects and impacts that are being evaluated. Building upon earlier attempts at evaluating TD research, this article tests three key aspects of effective sustainability research: its relevance, credibility, and legitimacy. To explore the link between the quality of process and societal effects, we analyze and compare outputs, outcomes, and impact of five TD projects. Overall, our analysis shows that while relevance, credibility, and legitimacy gave important insights regarding the links between process and impacts, they are not adequate for evaluating TD research impact. Process qualities such as practitioner motivation and perceived importance of the project, together with breadth of perspectives, the openness/flexibility of participants, and in-depth exchanges of expertise and knowledge, contributed to producing internally relevant, credible, and legitimate results. However, we also saw a need to develop the relevance, credibility, and legitimacy framework, in relation to the external dynamics of the project process, heterogeneous stakeholder groups, and the credibility of practice-based knowledge, which together with institutional factors and the political context significantly shape the possibility of impact.

AB  - This article reports an undergraduate software engineering project in which, over a period of 2 years, four student teams from different cohorts developed a note-taking app for four academic clients at the students' own university. We investigated how projects involving internal clients can give students the benefits of engaging in real software development while also giving them experience of a student-staff collaboration that has its own benefits for students, academics, and the university more broadly. As the university involved is a Sino-Foreign university located in China, where most students are Chinese and most teaching staff are not, this 'student as co-producer' approach interacts with another feature of the project: cultural distance. Based on analysis of notes, reports, interviews, and focus groups, we recommend that students should be provided with communicative strategies for dealing with academics as clients; universities should develop policies on ownership of student-staff collaborations; and projects should include a formalised handover process. This article can serve as guidance for educators considering a 'students as co-producers' approach for software development projects.

AB  - This study focused on the socially-constructed meanings, implications, and institutional factors that influence the extent to which faculty members engage in collaborative teaching at a research university. Drawing upon theoretical foundations of interdisciplinarity and collaborative teaching and in-depth findings from faculty focus groups, we illustrate the various models of collaborative teaching currently in use by faculty and the structural conditions governing these teaching experiences. Findings suggest that while collaborative teaching experiences are emerging as teaching innovation and are potentially beneficial to students, they are institutionally challenging and often incongruent to the dominant culture of the research university.

AB  - This research aims to determine science student teachers' views and conceptions of the interdisciplinary sexual health education course. Also, the current study inferiorly purposes to eliminate their misconceptions after the course. Data were obtained from in-class student products, course evaluation forms and course field notes. Within a qualitative methodology, they were descriptively evaluated and analyzed. The science student teachers under investigation stated that the interdisciplinary sexual health education course was very effective at freely talking about sexuality. Further, they depicted that they were able to easily get more accurate, reliable and memorable information from primary sources by asking the specialists/experts during the course. Overall, it can be concluded that the course remedied their misconceptions of the sexuality.

AB  - In this article we discuss an interdisciplinary and collaborative four-year project, Taking Race Live, that explored lived experiences of race among students enrolled at an ethnically diverse university in England. Utilizing qualitative methods to evaluate the project each year, we draw on students' voices to address their experiences of race, partnering with interdisciplinary peers and learning about each other. Framing the discussion are the concepts of 'liveness' and 'public sociology' proposed by sociologists to bring sociological knowledge alive. Attention is given to how this was done through engaging with the arts and embodied practices found within drama, dance and music.

AB  - Contribution: This paper analyzes reflective thinking within organizational structures in higher education and draws parallels between the challenges faced by educators developing interdisciplinary courses and their students working in ill-structured projects. Background: Interdisciplinarity as a learning goal is prevalent across engineering education literature. However, without organizational support structures to guide faculty members in developing interdisciplinary courses, interdisciplinarity as a student learning outcome is difficult to sustain. There is a need to evolve existing organizational structures faculty navigate when creating interdisciplinary courses, so that competing organizational systems do not stifle interdisciplinarity. Moreover, educators' effort in developing interdisciplinary courses is mirrored in the uncertain processes in which instructors engage students. Research Questions: In settings of interdisciplinary curriculum design and implementation, how do interdisciplinary faculty collaborations parallel that of their student design teams? How do organizational structures affect interdisciplinary faculty teams designing courses that span disciplines? Methodology: The study used a qualitative case, bound by three required courses in a new interdisciplinary undergraduate minor. Data was collected via interviews, class observations, and student reflection assignments. Analysis was guided by the conceptual frameworks of King and Kitchener's reflective judgment model and strange and banning's conceptualization of campus learning environments. Findings: Both educators and students develop through the discomfort with uncertainty--a prevalent theme in complex problem-solving. Forms of summative assessment pose an added challenge for both groups as they negotiate organizational structures. Lastly, discipline-specific expectations and ways of valuing knowledge contribute to uncertainty through the interactions among groups.

AB  - This study aimed to understand doctoral candidates' and supervisors' positive and negative experiences of undertaking a doctorate in a structured interdisciplinary research training environment. Interviews were held with 16 candidates and eight supervisors involved in an interdisciplinary research centre. Most candidates were undertaking a disciplinary focussed doctorate while being active participants in the centre's doctoral education program. Our findings highlighted three themes that influence positive or negative experiences: the design of the interdisciplinary environment; the critical role of communication; and the qualities of candidates and supervisors deemed important to work effectively in such an environment. We conclude with suggestions that might help develop an effective interdisciplinary research environment.

AB  - This study examines students' reflections on how concepts covered in a marketing course are applied to the broader liberal arts curriculum. The objective was to demonstrate when given a chance with an Interdisciplinary Reflection Assignment, students can articulate interdisciplinary relevance. The study collected sample data from six classes over three years. The assignment embodies the areas of metacognition, reflection, and integration of interdisciplinary knowledge. A content analysis approach was utilized to review both quantitative and qualitative data. Students' comments are categorized as follows: 32 in "Humanities & Fine Arts"; 31 in "Natural Sciences & Mathematics"; 93 in "Social Sciences & History"; 6 in "Professional Studies" (College, 2019). The assignment results strongly suggest that, when asked, students can articulate the integration of a business marketing course with other liberal arts subject areas. Thus, demonstrating business has a legitimate place in the liberal arts curriculum. This study contributes to education literature by providing a specific pedagogical example that can be easily replicated by other educators at other higher education institutions. The assignment offers added value to enhance student learning and appreciation of how marketing concepts integrate with other academic disciplines.

AB  - An interdisciplinary and pluralistic approach to teaching and learning has been proposed as one solution to the lack of a consensus definition of sustainable development (SD). For teachers, such an approach requires an awareness of the interconnections among different dimensions of SD and their underlying value-based assumptions. In this article, we investigate whether higher education teachers' conceptions of SD are consistent with these aims. We present the results of our interviews with five university teachers who are experienced in interdisciplinary SD in Finland. Our findings show that despite the teachers' rich conceptions of cultural sustainability, including a variety of topics, concepts and value questions, their understanding of economic sustainability is rather limited and sketchy. We suggest that universities support the teachers' social and peer learning based on reflections on unclear concepts and emerging SD ideas.

AB  - Attention to childhood trauma and the need for trauma-informed care has contributed to the emerging discourse in schools related to teaching practices, school climate, and the delivery of trauma-related in-service and preservice teacher education. However, though trauma-informed systems of care include schools, empirical work informing trauma-informed teaching and teacher education that is reflected back to those audiences is less established. This interdisciplinary overview and synthesis of literature examined interventions used in schools to determine the dominant framework used for promoting and practicing trauma-informed care in schools and the effectiveness of school-based supports for trauma-affected youth to identify implications for changing teaching practice. While multiple disciplines conduct research using different methodologies examining trauma-informed practices in schools, educators are underexamined in this work. Additionally, education researchers began engaging in research on trauma-informed practices in schools more recently, and as such, research emanating from education researchers comprises a small portion of this review. Drawing across the work, we offer recommendations for a more robust, interdisciplinary research agenda with the intentional purpose to change teacher practice.

AB  - The growing emergent field of interdisciplinary research provides opportunities for discussing and attempting to understand interdisciplinarity at a deeper pedagogical level. The author, having completed a PhD in the field of an interdisciplinary art and design practice, presents an analysis of its methodology to contribute to the discussion. Through incidentally applying the method of Bourdieu's notion of reflexivity onto the practice, a clearer understanding of the approaches undertaken in the practice was experienced. This supported navigating between spectrums of approaches and identifying dichotomic knowledges applied in the practice, which the author terms 'conscious bridging'. In support of the proposed notion of conscious bridging, the author adds further evidential observations of teams participating in interdisciplinary projects and taking into analysis the processes of varied approaches specific to their discipline. This article presents strategies to consider, adopt and apply in an interdisciplinary art and design practice in order to assist the quality and efficiency of research outcomes.

AB  - Theologian Paul J. Griffiths has argued that thinking about Christian learning "must begin from thinking about the liturgy." This comparison between learning and liturgy invites reflection upon the nature and ends of Christian higher education, particularly how pedagogy might be informed by liturgy. This interdisciplinary symposium considers this very connection, proposing that the space of the classroom, the activities of teaching and learning, and the aims of Christian higher education are contiguous with the liturgical life of the Church. Four short reflections from the fields of composition, theology, ethics, and history offer four approaches to the relationship between liturgy and learning, demonstrating that the "liturgical" habits of these various disciplines cooperate in moral formation.

AB  - Currently, education places a focus on teamwork, with empathy playing an important role in the coherence of teammates embark on project based learning (PBL). It is often difficult to persuade students to reach an agreement when they are working in groups. Enhancing empathy may reduce arguments and conflict during teamwork Creating interactive learning environments (ILEs) has been recognized as a major approach to improving students' ability to express the empathy necessary to enhance teamwork and acquire heterogeneous competencies. In this study, Taiwanese junior high school students were placed into teams to brainstorm and devise innovative ideas and complete team projects. Students were instructed to shoot a film on bullying. The project was intended to improve their abilities in perspective taking, affective response, emotional regulation, self/other awareness, empathy, and competence. Study results suggest that peer learning incorporating PBL and ILE can significantly increase students' empathy and functional competence acquisition. Results also show empathy is a key mediator between peer learning and competence acquisition.

AB  - Pigments are light-absorbing substances that are abundant in nature, serving roles in coloration, camouflage, mate/pollinator attraction and photosynthesis among higher life forms. Among microbial organisms, pigments can also be found in a wide range of phyla. While some of these pigments function in photosynthesis, namely among algae and some bacteria, the great majority of microbial pigments play entirely different roles. The exploratory study presented here will stimulate students to think about the cost and benefit of a heritable trait (pigment production) of microscopic organisms and its effects on survival in a competitive and hostile environment. Exploring and understanding the roles these pigments play allows for a number of cross-disciplinary learning opportunities that combine physics, chemistry, biology and even art, and can be set up as an inquiry-based learning module suitable for small-group and active learning experiences.

AB  - One of the great challenges interdisciplinary programs face is fguring out how to get students to engage subject matter in a truly integrative way. To accomplish integration, students do not need to become experts in multiple felds, but they do need to understand how multiple modes of thinking, theoretical lenses, and content knowledge can be integrated so as to be applicable to real world issues. To complicate matters further, to become truly critical, analytical thinkers, students also need to integrate interrogation of their own processing strategies, attitudes, and biases into the interdisciplinary process. This combination of theoretical knowledge, content knowledge, and critical self-refection is diffcult for interdisciplinary students to do and equally diffcult for instructors to teach them to do. One invaluable tool to aid in this challenge is a curriculum based on a critical pedagogical approach that explicitly focuses on metacognitive development. The objective of this article is to aid interdisciplinary educators in developing the integrative thinking and reasoning processes of their interdisciplinary students by reviewing the metacognition literature and by demonstrating the value of specifc pedagogical practices that explicitly and critically engage students in metacognitive capacity building.

AB  - Scholars trained and credentialed in disciplines have a vast array of response options when challenged to engage with others from other disciplinary backgrounds. By considering the ways in which disciplines are like cultures and putting acculturation theory squarely into the domain of interdisciplinary studies, this article takes a new look at these variations. My aim is to undertake a systematic exploration of adjustment processes of the individual disciplinary scholar involved in interdisciplinary work. I discern two fundamental adjustment responses that characterize interdisciplinary engagement: disciplinary maintenance and participation in another discipline. The context for this research is international business (IB) studies, a discipline in which scholars come regularly into contact with research from diverse disciplinary backgrounds. I use a study of scholars from two adjacent subject areas--East Asian studies and economic geography--to explore the many ways scholars make themselves familiar with IB specific repertoire. Consistent with the well-established acculturation modes, my exploration suggests that interdisciplinarity of those in these fields can take on the form of assimilation, integration, separation, and marginalization. I find that scholars' academic background has differential effects on the outcomes of interdisciplinary engagement.

AB  - Higher education is based on a disciplinary system and science-specific educational programmes, but multi/interdisciplinarity (MD/ID) knowledge, working methods and collaboration are becoming common in the workplace with complex tasks and digital work environments. This article will provide an insight into these issues by presenting a study of the organisation of work in the high-tech metals industry, studying firms whose production is based on specialised technology, i.e. in the convergence of industrial branches. Given that knowledge of many disciplinary fields and methods are prerequisites, this convergence suggests a MD/ID work organisation to cope with the specialised technological infrastructure. The aim of these case studies is to examine how MD and ID are actualised in the organisation of work sites in the converged metals industry. The data consist of interviews collected from firms and expert organisations.

AB  - How do cultural heritage scientists and art conservators identify pigments and other painting media in a decorated object or painting, preferably without taking samples that could potentially damage the artwork? A major emphasis in the characterization, authentication, and conservation of works of art and cultural heritage objects is the use of multifaceted, noninvasive analytical methods whenever and wherever possible. In recent years, the development of portable, hand-held, noninvasive spectrometers and the widespread availability of standard spectroscopic databases that allow for the comparison and identification of newly acquired spectra have assisted scientists and conservators in this endeavor. According to their Web site, the Cultural Heritage Science Open-Source (CHSOS) "is a private practice service specialized in on-site examination and documentation of works of art with technical photography and analytical techniques that also provides related training and consulting for private professionals and institutions. CHSOS clients are art collectors, museums, and private professionals, such as conservators, art historians, and art appraisers." Fortunately, for chemistry educators interested in the spectroscopic characterization and identification of pigments, CHSOS has provided freely available, readily downloadable spectroscopic data for 81 historical and 66 modern pigments using five spectroscopic methods capable of noninvasive analysis (diffuse UV-vis-NIR reflectance, X-ray fluorescence, Raman, near-infrared, and Fourier transform infrared). This article describes the construction and features of three Vernier Software Logger "Pro" databases that incorporate the CHSOS spectroscopic data from historical pigments and presents four classroom activities that allow students to utilize the databases to develop and apply their knowledge of spectroscopy to identify pigments.

AB  - What pedagogical strategies support students from a refugee background connecting to the natural world? What would these strategies look like for fifteen students participating in a language intensive New Arrivals Program (NAP)? These questions were the focus of a small collaborative project set up to investigate the impact of pedagogical initiatives on building educational and cultural connections, and enhancing educational achievement in science in refugee students. This article focuses on the events and outcomes of an interdisciplinary unit of work based around a newly established school garden. Science, mathematics, English and visual arts are the key learning areas covered. The study involves one gardener, a volunteer community artist and three science and mathematics teacher education academics.

AB  - Our work investigates students' perception of collaborative expertise and the role of inquiry-based learning in the context of team-based entrepreneurship education. Specifically, we examine students' perception of communication, division of work, shared goals, team conflicts and leadership in their respective teams. In addition, we look at the role that experts play in constructing students' understanding and learning when engaging in entrepreneurial ventures. To that purpose we extracted the types of sources that teams used to validate their hypotheses about revenue streams, customer relationships, or value propositions. We are using a mixed-method approach to data collection through peer-reviews, business model canvases, and status reports. This paper reports results from a study implemented in a graduate-level entrepreneurship course with a focus on sustainability and energy. Results of the peer-reviews indicate that composite scores increased between the midpoint and the end of the course. Although, female students received higher evaluations than male students, these differences were not statistically significant. The status reports and business model canvases revealed that teams utilize a range of first-hand and public sources such as expert interviews, publications and self-generated calculations to construct their business models. Finally, we found that teams engaged with experts from a variety of fields and job functions, ranging from fellow students to managers.

AB  - The primary purpose is the implementation of the interdisciplinary approach to understanding and the construction of integrative models of understanding literary texts. The interdisciplinary methodological paradigm of studying text understanding, based on the principles of various sciences facilitating the identification of the text understanding essence (cognitive, anthropocentric, dialogue, interdisciplinary principles) is rationalized and described. Methods of various sciences are used in complex: the hermeneutic method (hermeneutic philosophy, hermeneutic psychology), the pragmatic understanding method (pragmatics), the cognitive analysis, the inference method (cognitive linguistics), the discourse analysis method (discourse linguistics) and the modelling method. A literary text understanding integrative model is offered which can be applied during the analysis of various types of texts and their interpretation. The research proves that the interdisciplinary approach facilitates the development of an integrative multilevel model of text understanding, on each level of which, knowledge required to ensure understanding is characterized and disciplines are indicated.

AB  - In this article we discuss interdisciplinary teaching and research in Latin America through the lens of Mexican perspectives, in particular the experiences at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The history of these experiences goes back to the creation of the frst interdisciplinary education programs in Mexico in the 1970s and the foundation of the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in the Sciences and Humanities in 1986 at the UNAM. With this Center's contributions as the framework, we examine objectives and instruments of academic policy in our country in order to understand how methods of evaluation work. We study not only the ways of academic interdisciplinarity but also the main theoretical and epistemological focuses in university environments. From this analysis of Mexican experience, we obtain important information that can be useful in the process of integrating knowledge amongst other countries of Latin America.

AB  - We define and describe the academic studio model for interdisciplinary, undergraduate, project-oriented education. This model brings faculty, students, and community partners together to investigate an openended academic question, and their collaboration yields an original product that represents their inquiry. The academic studio integrates agile software development practice, project-oriented pedagogy, and sociocultural cognition theories. Scrum provides the framework in which self-organizing, cross-functional teams define their methodology, and Scrum practices facilitate assessment of student learning outcomes. This model emerged from design-based research across six studio instances, each of which investigated the relationship of fun, games, and learning through the development of educational video games. Formal and informal analysis of these instances gives rise to several themes, including the importance of a formalized process to encourage learning and productivity, the critical role of an expert faculty mentor, the need to combine academic and industrial practice to manage the inherent challenges of collaborative software development, and the unique characteristics of learning outcomes arising from this model. We conclude that the academic studio model is beneficial to student learning and faculty development, and we encourage the adoption, adaptation, and evaluation of the model.

AB  - Recently there have been calls to expandSTEM education to include the arts and design, transforming STEM into STEAM in the K-20 classroom (Maeda, 2013). Like STEM, STEAM education stresses making connections between disciplines that were previously perceived as disparate. This has been conceptualized in different ways, such as: focusing on the creative design process that is fundamental to engineering and art (Bequette & Bequette, 2012); emphasizing the role of creative and synthetic thinking to enhance student interest and learning in science and mathematics; and showing the value in exploring the science and mathematics that underpin different artistic techniques (Wynn & Harris, 2012). In this article, the authors describe how a collaboration between art education, engineering, and landscape architecture led them to conceptualize STEAM as a social practice that reflects concerns for community engagement and ecological sustainability.

AB  - Existing studies show the value of using visual expression as a means of teaching children to understand and create music. This study aspires to point out an additional valuable aspect, namely, the influence composing via visual expression--whereby children transform their own drawings--may have on children's subsequent compositional processes. This is an area which is, as yet, largely unexplored. The article will examine this within a context in which children compose individually at the keyboard. With the aid of some examples taken from actual teaching practice, the author shows how children--consciously or intuitively and in a more complex and sophisticated manner--transpose their playing strategies from "visual composing" to a primarily musical context or a context incorporating new, non-musical references.

AB  - In a year-long undergraduate research program, life science majors were paired with majors in the other STEM disciplines of computer science, engineering, mathematics and physical sciences, to work on interdisciplinary life science projects. Typical teams had one undergraduate in a life science and one from another STEM discipline, along with faculty and graduate student mentors from each of those disciplines. In a survey at the end of the program, undergraduates indicated their career plans: 74% staying in STEM, 26% moving to non-STEM, with most of the latter in healthcare. In the summer phase, the average and range of the total number of interactions between undergraduates and all of their mentors was about the same for students in both career groups. However, students differed in whether they tended to interact more frequently with mentors in their own discipline, or to interact with closer to equal frequency with mentors in both disciplines. Binary logistic regression analysis showed this differential frequency of interaction with mentors by discipline to be predictive of students' career decisions, with students in the non-STEM career group interacting much more within their own discipline and the students in the STEM career group tending to interact almost as frequently with mentors in both disciplines. Analysis also showed that, compared to students who planned on non-STEM careers, those who planned on STEM careers self-reported lower ease of communication with team members but higher ratings for their program experience. Consistent with national data, the student's area of study was predictive: 56% of the life science and 91% of the other STEM majors planned for STEM careers. However, inconsistent with the predominance of men in the STEM workforce, in our program where there were almost equal numbers of men and women in both the life sciences and other STEM fields, there was no gender difference in career choice: 72% of the men and 76% of the women indicated their intention to pursue careers in STEM.

AB  - In this study, we analyze the two-phase bottom-up procedure applied by the Future and Emerging Technologies Program (FET-Open) at the Research Executive Agency (REA) of the European Commission (EC), for the evaluation of highly interdisciplinary, multi-beneficiary research proposals which request funding. In the first phase, remote experts assess the proposals and draft comments addressing the pre-defined (by FET-Open) evaluation criteria. In the second phase, a new set of additional experts (of more general expertise and different from the remote ones), after cross reading the proposals and their remote evaluation reports, they convene in an on-site panel where they discuss the proposals. They complete the evaluation by reinforcing per proposal and per criterion one or another assessment, as assigned remotely during the first phase. We analyze the level of the inter-rater agreement among the remote experts and we identify its relative correlation with the funded proposals resulted after the end of the evaluation. Our study also provides comparative figures of the evolution of the proposals' scores during the two phases of the evaluation process. Finally, by carrying out an appropriate quantitative and qualitative analysis of all scores from the seven past cut-offs, we elaborate on the significant contribution of the panel (the second phase of the evaluation) in identifying and promoting the best proposals for funding.

AB  - : Current research on self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching indicates shortcomings in facing recent teaching challenges in secondary education and corresponding valid instruments. Thus, we designed the Self-Efficacy Beliefs of Interdisciplinary Science Teaching (SElf-ST) instrument based on a pedagogical content knowledge model for science teaching. We ensured the factorial validity of ten factors. To bring construct validity down to a round figure, we examined convergent and divergent validity in this paper. For answering the overall research question regarding arguments for the convergent and divergent validity of the interpretation of the SElf-ST instrument's test values (and related hypotheses), we analyzed data of pre-service, trainee, and in-service biology, chemistry, and physics teachers (n = 590) in a cross-sectional study. While the strong latent correlations of the ten SElf-ST factors with self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching in primary education (r = 0.40 - 0.63, p < 0.01) indicate convergent validity, the rather weak correlations with self-efficacy beliefs of general teaching (r = 0.17 - 0.54, p < 0.01), self-rated content knowledge in science (r = 0.13 - 0.40, p < 0.01), and perceived stress (r = -0.13 - -0.19, p < 0.01) support different divergent validity intensities. Thus, assumed relations within the nomological net surrounding the self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching construct were confirmed for secondary education. In sum, we shed light on a rarely explored aspect of construct validity in science education research regarding self-efficacy beliefs. Doing so, we gained strong arguments that the SElf-ST instrument's test values can serve as indicators of self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching in secondary education.

AB  - Socially engaged students cross all disciplines. Today's complex and rapidly changing environment poses new challenges for practitioners, students, and educators working within and alongside post-secondary institutions. This research explores how business and social work students interpret and perceive the world's greatest challenges. Eighty-four students participated in the mixed methods study wherein a workshop was delivered to two social innovation and two social work classes. The workshops provided a forum for students to explore their perspectives on the world's greatest challenges individually and as part of a group. Differences and similarities are reported regarding student perspectives of the world in which they live. The results reinforce a change in student mindset requiring significant shifts in the development and delivery of social impact curriculum and pedagogy related to creating shared value, social innovation, and changemaking.

AB  - This study deals with solving the current problem of pedagogy of high school -- consolidation of theoretical and practical approaches to ensure the quality of professional training of law students. According to the author, the introduction of simulation modelling technologies in training courses allows enhancing interdisciplinarity in teaching, which is an important way of meeting the dynamic needs of students in close connection of theoretical and practical blocks of professional training of future specialists. The experience of the American Bar Association on the future of legal education has suggested the idea of applying mock-court as interdisciplinary models. Experimental application of mock-court was tested in the courses "Criminal Law" and "Civil Law", which are part of the block of special disciplines of the educational and professional training program in specialty 081 "Law". Mathematical data processing and STATA software were used to analyse the results obtained and to objectively consider the dynamics of changes in personality-organizational, operational-activity, cognitive-competence, personality-motivational, information-technological, linguistic-communicative components. The study showed the effectiveness of the use of mock-court on the development of all components of the readiness of law students for professional socialization. The authors concluded that the application of mock-court in the professional training of future lawyers contributes to feedback increasing students' educational motivation and allows monitoring of changes in student development. This model can be applied to enhance interdisciplinarity in the teaching of other courses of the block of special subjects of professional training of lawyers.

AB  - An interdisciplinary course called "The Chemistry of Poisons" was created, featuring organic chemistry, biology, pharmacology, and toxicology content. This exploratory chemistry elective course was created by an instructor with a background in synthetic organic chemistry and a teaching assistant with a background in pharmacy practice. "The Chemistry of Poisons" features an interdisciplinary, student-centered approach to learning that provides a foundation for future academic initiatives to deliver chemical, pharmacological, and humanistic content in a manner that is both enjoyable for students and demonstrably facilitates knowledge and application level learning. Student course feedback and a retrospective survey were used to gauge student-perceived learning achievement. Survey results and feedback were consistent with knowledge and application level learning of course content and preference for interdisciplinary course design. These results warrant further development and study of interdisciplinary strategies for chemical education.

AB  - In late 2013, Canada's national newspaper reported that the implementation of Ontario's "differentiation policy framework" was the province's "boldest step yet to compel universities and colleges to make hard choices about how they spend their resources...a draft policy designed to stretch limited provincial dollars by narrowing some schools' missions" (Bradshaw 2013, para. two). As part of this controversial reform agenda, the province's Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities required each of its 44 post-secondary educational (PSE) institutions to submit a Strategic Mandate Agreement in response to a set of priority objectives outlined under this rubric of "differentiation" aimed at avoiding duplication and waste of public resources (Government of Ontario 2013; Brock University 2013). Within the authors' own university's agreement, the central organizing principle was chosen as "transdisciplinarity." Under "Areas of Institutional Strength" the university pledged to focus its resources "on transdisciplinary community-based research with five new transdisciplinary hubs (Brock University and Ontario Ministry of Training, College and Universities 2014, 7). In response to these developments, this article presents a secondary analysis from a large, qualitative dataset collected during a two-year critical ethnography (Mitchell and Moore 2015). The study focused on transdisciplinarity as an organizing principle for educational reform and for researching sustainability science partnerships. The purpose was to investigate how this 21st century paradigm was being understood and deployed by key stakeholders.

AB  - Art integration is a rich and complex approach to teaching and learning that not only aligns with new initiatives in education that prioritize conceptual and procedural skills but could also contribute to education's transformation. Framing art integration as a transdisciplinary field with a distinct conceptual framework, epistemology, and practices provides a full account of art integration that practitioners and advocates alike may find useful for conceptualizing the field, promoting it in education, and developing it further. Moreover, viewing art integration through the lenses of Systems Theory and the New Sciences reveals its potential as a pedagogy of fusion and flow that could transform teaching and learning across the curriculum. One form of art integration, Art Research Integration (ARI), is presented here to illustrate the qualities of a transdisciplinary, Systems Thinking/New Sciences vision of art integration.

AB  - In the context of the evolving Internet, a balance between technological advances and meaning change is crucial to develop innovative and breakthrough "connected electronics" that enable the Internet of Things. Designers and technologists are key enablers of this process respectively, ensuring adequate users' needs and technology development, inside the evolving context of social environment and human relations. Smart electronic product design must be a truly interdisciplinary process, in which technologists are aware of how much their decisions impact the user-product relationship and designers understand the full potential and associated limitations of technology involved. Shared knowledge and communication are essential in this scenario, but, due to their technological limitations, designers are often excluded from high-level decision processes. In this paper, we address the design of constructivist tools and associated strategy to enhance the technological literacy of designers, as a strong foundation for knowledge-based dialogue between these realms. We demonstrate its effectiveness in a long-term multidisciplinary Project-Based Learning application with Design and Electronics students. We present the cases from 2 years' experimentation (with the first year as control group) that demonstrate improvement in the quality of teamwork; in learning results; improved performance of the students reflected in the quality of the projects developed; and positive teachers' and students' evaluations. We conclude that the use of the proposed tool not only provides the designer an active voice in the process of designing smart electronics, but also promotes an effective common language between these two worlds.

AB  - In this article, we analyse how and if participation affects the learning experiences of pupils. Our research questions are: (1) What constituted positive learning experiences for pupils in a multidisciplinary learning module? (2) How do the methods used in this study give pupils an opportunity to express negative emotions and participate in developing learning experiences?. The data of this practitioner research consists of 80 photographs, 23 picture books and 23 interviews. The positive experiences of the project were social interaction, autonomy of peer groups and sense of capability and competence which relate to social participation. The picture book-interview method revealed pupils' negative experiences that related to learning how to work in a group and perform the tasks at hand.

AB  - The aim of the paper is the presentation of an interdisciplinary topic that allows applying content knowledge in physics, mathematics and biology in real life environment. Students use to play games and view crime scenes but in common they have little knowledge about the science used during crime scene investigation. In this paper the science background of blood spatter analysis is presented--the physics of non-Newtonian fluids, the biology of blood and mathematics--the measurement and calculation of the angle of inpact, the relationship between height and spatter diameter. This topic was choosen according to the analysis of interviews with secondary and high school learners realized at four schools in Moravia, Czech Republic. The topic can be taught at secondary schools so as at a higher level at high schools. Hands-on activities are included. The teaching strategy supports group work. The appropriateness and reasonableness of the topic was checked in the real teaching process and the activities have had a positive feedback.

AB  - Global carbon cycling describes the movement of carbon through atmosphere, biosphere, geosphere, and hydrosphere; it lies at the heart of climate change and sustainability. To understand the global carbon cycle, students will require "interdisciplinary knowledge." While standards documents in science education have long promoted interdisciplinary understanding, our current science education system is still oriented toward single-discipline-based learning. Furthermore, there is limited work on interdisciplinary assessment. This article presents the validated Interdisciplinary Science Assessment of Carbon Cycling (ISACC), and reports empirical results of a study of high school and undergraduate students, including an analysis of the relationship between interdisciplinary items and disciplinary items. Many-faceted Rasch analysis produced detailed information about the relative difficulty of items and estimates of ability levels of students. One-way ANCOVA was used to analyze differences among three grade levels: high school, college Freshman-Sophomore, college Junior-Senior, with number of science courses as a covariate. Findings indicated significantly higher levels of interdisciplinary understanding among the Freshman-Sophomore group compared to high school students. There was no statistically significant difference between Freshman-Sophomore group and Junior-Senior group. Items assessing interdisciplinary understanding were more difficult than items assessing disciplinary understanding of global carbon cycling; however, interdisciplinary and disciplinary understanding were strongly correlated. This study highlights the importance of interdisciplinary understanding in learning carbon cycling and discusses its potential impacts on science curriculum and teaching practices.

AB  - Museum partnerships can involve significant tensions, especially when these collaborations reach across institutions to blend disciplines such as art and mathematics. Rather than simply being obstacles to overcome, we suggest that tensions arising in multi-institutional, cross-disciplinary collaborations can be highly generative for collaborators, sparking new approaches to practice and catalyzing professional growth. To support this idea, we describe an interdisciplinary professional development program for museum practitioners focused on developing innovative programs and exhibits integrating Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics (STEAM). We discuss the design of this STEAM Professional Learning Laboratory in terms of a shared-facilitation model and relate that model to specific tensions that arose in this collaboration. Based on evaluation data, we summarize key characteristics of the Lab that supported successful collaboration and interdisciplinary learning. We share learning outcomes we documented for art and science museum professionals who participated in the Lab. We conclude with considerations for others in the field engaging in similar efforts. A bibliography is included.

AB  - The Parallel Curriculum Model (PCM) lends itself to considering curriculum development from different angles. It begins with a solid Core Curriculum and can then be extended through the Curriculum of Connections, Practice, and Identity. This article showcases a way of thinking about the creation of a PCM unit by providing examples from an Antarctic research expedition. The Curriculum of Connections is showcased through the practices of science and engineering and crosscutting concepts. The Curriculum of Practice is elaborated on through vignettes detailing collaborative activities on the ship. Finally, a special focus is placed on the Curriculum of Identity through profiles of people working on the ship who followed both traditional and nontraditional routes to their current careers.

AB  - This paper discusses researcher identity, positioning, and reflexivity as they relate to the experience of a researcher on an interprofessional research project. The project collected video recordings of students and healthcare professionals in university and clinical settings. During the process of data collection, 'conversations' emerged between the researcher and participants. They occurred before and after recordings took place and outside of the planned methods of data collection. These unaccounted-for-encounters between the researcher and participant produced a negotiated understanding of who each other were and how it related to the research process. But dichotomous notions of insider and outsider identity seemed too fixed to examine the social construction of knowledge produced in these encounters. This paper examines the methodological reflections on those unaccounted-for-encounters, which emerged as instances of participant focussed reflexivity. It aims to demonstrate how positioning can offer a more refined means with which to highlight the processes and practices which participants and researchers undertake in interaction. These researcher-participant encounters were sites of knowledge construction transversing professional and educational territories and transient opportunities for negotiated intersubjectivity. As such, they highlight the role that positioning can play in not only individual methodological matters but for multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, or transdisciplinary research teams.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an interdisciplinary program of Greek folk dance music and sociology on 8th grade Middle school student satisfaction and anxiety level. To evaluate students' anxiety and satisfaction the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 and Duda and Nicholls' Satisfaction questionnaire were used respectively. The reliability analysis showed that indicators of internal cohesion of subscales in both instruments were at satisfactory levels. The results showed that the experimental group enhanced significantly the levels of satisfaction, and self-confidence and decreased significantly the levels of somatic and cognitive anxiety. The satisfaction of students was positively related to self-confidence and negatively related to cognitive anxiety. The improvement observed in the experimental group concerned both boys and girls. In conclusion, we can say that an interdisciplinary program of traditional Greek dance reduces the rates of somatic and cognitive anxiety while simultaneously increasing students' satisfaction and self-confidence.

AB  - Contextualized by efforts to support arts integration in one of the largest school districts in the United States, this qualitative study examines the experiences of educators as they participate in various arts-centred forms of professional development. Drawing on the work of, the tenets of arts-centered learning, the authors use Mediated Discourse Analysis and Teachers' Life Histories to account for the social, personal and political processes and activity involved in making meaning and shaping dispositions towards teaching in and through the arts. Findings reveal how arts-centred programming can promote growth in educators' confidence creating curriculum in the arts and collaborating with artists and other teachers, but suggest that embodied practices within interdisciplinary teams and continued coaching are key as educators prepare for guiding students through interdisciplinary inquiry and implementing arts-centred programming. Three fields of emergence for learning within this study include (1) Enactment of Artist-As-Teacher & Teacher-As-Artist (2) Multimodal Inquiry via Group Art-Making; and (3) Collaborative Curriculum Design. These fields of emergence are considered as interdisciplinary traversals, representing educators' movements across disciplinary boundaries and between associated identities.

AB  - This case addresses the critical topic in education of developing students' skills and capabilities associated with enterprise-level business intelligence systems and associated internal control concerns. The experiences of using a business intelligence,task-based activity in an interdisciplinary curriculum model are presented and discussed. Pedagogically, the task-based activity enhances perceived learning for both accounting and IS disciplines indomain (internal controls and IS development), communication (comprehension and creation), and critical thinking skills. Additionally, students appreciate the realism and active learning associated with the task-based activity delivered in an interdisciplinary curriculum model. The design of the task-based activity as a teaching resource allows other instructors, based on their requirements, to develop a lesson plan around using the activity as written, or focusing on the any of the many aspects of controls or technology presented.

AB  - The authors examine the possibilities and challenges of integrating writing instruction into an interdisciplinary general education curriculum. The authors analyze the results of a 2017--18 academic research project that explored how students perceive themselves as writers, and how both students and faculty perceive the role of written communication in students' lives at the university and beyond. The research focused on the experiences and perceptions of Freshman Inquiry (FRINQ) students at Portland State University, as well as the perception of faculty who teach across the institution. The results speak to the importance of faculty feedback and indicate that many students associate feedback with becoming stronger writers. The findings also indicate that faculty and students hold slightly different perceptions of the role of writing; whereas the majority of FRINQ students connected writing skills to academic and career success, faculty were more likely to frame the role of writing in broader terms, emphasizing the need for students to be able to effectively express their ideas.

AB  - This paper provides a conceptual analysis and methodology to improve the Next Generation Science Standards' focus on interdisciplinary connections. The paper identifies a plethora of connections across Disciplinary Core Ideas that are neglected by the NGSS. In addition, it presents a methodology to generate "educative" curriculum materials. The specific case of middle school global warming (MS.ESS3.D) is developed. Curriculum and assessment resources are presented and evaluated. It is expected that the approach exemplified in this paper will be useful for teachers and curriculum developers when designing lessons and teaching interdisciplinary science topics.

AB  - In order to design two distinct engineering qualification levels for an existing University of Technology programme, empirical evidence based on the current diploma is necessary to illuminate the nature of and the relationship between the "contextual" and "conceptual" elements underpinning a multidisciplinary engineering curriculum. The increasing focus on contextual application could result in decreasing opportunities to develop the conceptual disciplinary grasp required for a dynamic, emerging region at the forefront of technological innovation. Using the theoretical tools of Bernstein and Maton to analyse final year student practice, the research addresses the question of how multidisciplinary knowledge is integrated by students, and what this reveals about the nature of such knowledge. The paper presents a conceptualisation of multidisciplinary knowledge integration practices as a dynamic process along two axes simultaneously, shifting between different forms and levels of conceptual and contextual knowledge.

AB  - Undergraduate research experiences benefit students' scientific skills, and recent trends in undergraduate research and education include focusing on interdisciplinary projects and on place-based learning. Here we describe a semester-long pilot interdisciplinary undergraduate research program focused on local aquatic ecosystems, discuss perceived benefits of this research approach, and show how this program's structure could be modified for use at other undergraduate institutions. The program included nine undergraduate students and five faculty from multiple scientific disciplines (geography, virology, ecology, vertebrate and invertebrate zoology) and involved approximately half a day of research per student per week and weekly hour-long lab meetings of the entire group, followed by end-of-semester poster presentations to the university. Student self-assessment data indicated that the program improved students' perceptions of their scientific ability, as well as their comfort level at performing scientific skills. We suggest that bringing together faculty from multiple disciplines with projects focused on the same local ecosystem is a valuable technique for providing undergraduate students with not only hands-on research experience, but also with (1) exposure to a diversity of research areas and methods and (2) a better understanding of the ecosystems in and around their campus.

AB  - Over many years of research, a decline in interest over the school years is repeatedly described. To address this decline, the value of content or a specific subject should be promoted. To increase content relevance, task value interventions can be conducted which are related to the theory of subjective task values by Wigfield & Eccles (2020). These values consist of intrinsic, attainment, and utility value. Due to its constructivist character, interdisciplinary interventions may meet preconditions to promote interest and could initiate situational interest and influence subject-specific values (e.g., utility value). The present study investigates whether and to what extent interdisciplinary interventions in biology and physical education influence the development of interest. A total of 73 students (mean age = 17.7 years) from four secondary schools took part in a one-day interdisciplinary intervention called "learning through movement," which combined physical education and biology. The intervention was accompanied by a modified quantitative questionnaire based on predescribed subjective task values. Mixed ANOVAs with repeated measures showed that the interdisciplinary intervention positively influenced situational intrinsic and utility values for both physical education and biology. By examining potential interaction effects, it was found that students with a low initial situational interest were positively affected by the intervention. Our study supports the notion that interdisciplinary interventions have an impact on subjective task values in biology and physical education and therefore have the potential to influence interest development, especially for lower interested students.

AB  - Today, the number of researches about STEM education, which is brought to the forefront by innovative interdisciplinary approaches, has been increasing over the years and each research is carried out in different areas, regions for different purposes. When these studies are examined, it is thought that the studies can be gathered under certain headings and themes and a broad perspective about the studies can be presented. We reached 186 works in the framework of STEM and other innovative approaches worldwide, except for Turkey. 48 of these studies from 21 different countries, written in 4 different languages, were selected between 2009-2019. These studies were evaluated in 9 different themes and 24 sub-concepts. These studies include all partners (students, teachers, parents and others) of the education system. The impact of innovative interdisciplinary practices on students' academic achievement, scientific process skills and career awareness is positive. Gender is an important factor in perception and attitudes. In-school and out-of-school activities are effective in acquiring 21st century skills. Education partner's attitude towards innovative interdisciplinary approaches is positive. In some studies, limitations such as physical space, time and cost disrupted the realization of activities and sometimes it was a negative situation that the teachers did not have the necessary training formation and felt inadequate for these activities. Existing curricula, which are shaped within the framework of knowledge-based examination system, were also seen as another limiting factor. At the end of the research, suggestions were made to all partners of the education system for the research and applications to be carried out in innovative interdisciplinary fields.

AB  - Engineers and Architects require effective communication and interdisciplinary team working to be successful throughout their career which, is often overlooked during formal undergraduate education. The purpose of this paper is to disseminate the novel design and evaluation of a module on communication and interdisciplinary team working in the combined teaching of undergraduate Engineering and Architecture students. An Interdisciplinary Problem-Based Learning (IPBL) approach is used and the theoretical construct for this work is the application of dialogical theory to the shared habitus between engineers and architects. The constructivist theory of learning was employed in the design and delivery of this module. It is an action research pedagogical intervention to support the improvement in the teaching and learning of communications and teamwork between architects and engineers. Feedback shows students identified improvement in their communication and teamwork skills at the end of the module.

AB  - Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a vibrational spectroscopic technique useful in chemical, pharmaceutical, and forensic sciences. It is essential to identify chemicals for reasons spanning from scientific research and academic practices to quality control in companies. However, in some university degrees, graduate students do not get the proficiency to optimize the experimental parameters to obtain the best IR spectra; to correlate the IR spectral bands with the molecular vibrations (chemical elucidation); to have some criteria for any substance identification (especially relevant in quality control to recognize counterfeit); and to apply chemometrics for comparing, visualizing, and classifying the IR spectra. This work presents an experimental laboratory practice for an introductory teaching of the IR instrumental conditions in the identification of substances based on visual spectra comparison and statistical analysis and matching. Then, the selected IR conditions are applied to different commercial drugs, in the solid state or in solution, mostly composed of acetaminophen. Finally, the students apply chemometrics analysis to the IR data. This practice was designed for the training in a chemistry subject for undergraduate students of the chemistry, pharmacy, or forensics degrees, among others related to science, medical, food, or technological sciences.

AB  - The Polaris Project, a National Science Foundation-funded program at the Woodwell Climate Research Center, aims to comprehensively address minority participation in climate and Arctic science research. The project implemented design principles to recruit, motivate, and retain African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans or Alaskan Natives, and women through immersive, field research experiences. The project included undergraduate and graduate students from environmental science, ecology, hydrology, biology, forestry, and geology. Ninety-five percent of participants identified as African American, Hispanic, Native American or Alaskan Native, and/or female. Critical participant outcomes included development of interdisciplinary research projects, involvement in self-efficacy and advocacy experiences, and increased awareness and discussion of Arctic research careers. All outcomes contributed to the Polaris Project's role as a model climate science research program.

AB  - Universities are recognizing the need to prepare graduates to think conceptually and have the ability to take on complex, real-world problems. Strategies to assess conceptual knowledge are limited and often require more time and effort to complete than is accessible for most undergraduate courses. Card sorting is a very broad technique for understanding how people group concepts, but in higher education has typically been used to show a student's development towards expert-like thinking in a discipline as a whole. However, it typically does not give much insight into how we should change our teaching. In this paper, using the novel setting of two terms of a first-year, earth and ocean science lab that uses problem-based learning (PBL), we show how one can generate a card sort that is built using course learning goals and then use the analysis to make actionable improvements to course instruction. Using a card sort designed so that the expert sort corresponds to learning goals supported by the lab activities, we found that in both offerings of the course students generally moved towards expert-like sorting with a reduction in novice-like sorting. A striking feature stood out in both terms of the course, with one question scoring significantly lower than any other expert pairings, despite a change in the wording of that question between terms. This suggests that our course materials do not promote this specific conceptual connection that we had expected and gives us a clear place to look for issues in our course material. In a broader context, our results suggest that tailoring card sort questions to material at a course level, rather than at the discipline level, can provide a manageable, routine assessment of conceptual knowledge in students, while also providing feedback on the quality of course materials.

AB  - A curricular approach to supporting low-income STEM Scholars is outlined and initial associations with retention, social and cultural capital, perception of science, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations are examined. Details are provided for the curricular support program based on interdisciplinary research, service learning, and an explicit examination of the interpretation of science based on culture and social location. We show that Scholars had increased retention and graduation within STEM majors compared to a control group. Further, Scholars self-report in surveys and interviews increased social and cultural capital, motivation, and related outcomes that they attribute to the interdisciplinary coursework that comprises the bulk of the program.

AB  - In this research, it was aimed to examine the effects of interdisciplinary science activities on 5th grade students' creative problem-solving skills and 21st century skills. The study group consisted of 50 5th grade students, 26 girls and 24 boys, were studying at a public school in Ankara, Çankaya district in the 2018-2019 academic year. The Creative Problem Solving Attribute Inventory and the 21st Century Skills Tests were applied to the students before and after the application. The obtained data were analyzed using a statistical program. The "Dependent Groups t-Test" and "Cohen's d" test, which are parametric tests, were used in the analysis of the Creative Problem Solving Attribute Inventory and the 21st Century Skills Test. In line with the evaluations made, it was concluded that interdisciplinary science activities positively affected students' creative problem solving skills and 21st century skills. Suggestions were made based on the findings.

AB  - This case study analyzes engagement during situated learning students engaged in the Global Game Jam, a three-day game development event. The themes identified as indicators of engagement for thematic analysis during this research were from the National Center for Educational Statistics' (NCES) National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE). The situated learning experiences provided to 30 college students, over three years, afforded them opportunities that otherwise had not existed in the curriculum. While the initiative was hosted in the Department of Computer Science, students from many disciplines were involved, The engagement with the local business incubator created opportunities for students to work with companies, sell their software, and connect with entrepreneurs as mentors. Finally, this case study exemplifies how faculty can leverage the power of activities to scaffold learning and engage learners in computer science, with the community, and with other disciplines through interdisciplinary teamwork. Of the nine indicators for engagement considered from the NSSE, reflections from students indicated that all students experienced at least five. This two-day event provided an opportunity for the university to build experiences of student engagement with students with minimal cost. The design of this problem-based simulation situated learning experience may build engagement for students outside of computer science and engineering disciplines.

AB  - Communication and collaboration are key science competencies that support sharing of scientific knowledge with experts and non-experts alike. On the one hand, they facilitate interdisciplinary conversations between students, educators, and researchers, while on the other they improve public awareness, enable informed choices, and impact policy decisions. Herein, we describe an interdisciplinary undergraduate course focused on using data from various bioinformatics data resources to explore the molecular underpinnings of diabetes mellitus (Types 1 and 2) and introducing students to science communication. Building on course materials and original student-generated artifacts, a series of collaborative activities engaged students, educators, researchers, healthcare professionals and community members in exploring, learning about, and discussing the molecular bases of diabetes. These collaborations generated novel educational materials and approaches to learning and presenting complex ideas about major global health challenges in formats accessible to diverse audiences.

AB  - Foundation Years (FY) have proliferated within UK Higher Education in recent years, and their benefits and successes have been well documented (e.g. the enhancement of opportunities for underrepresented students, second-chance education, skills and confidence enhancement, and a pipeline into STEM. However, when managed centrally, their implementation can be a contentious site of interdisciplinary unease and 'mutual suspicion' and as much as a fruitful avenue for innovative collaboration. One of the key issues is the question of how to embed academic skills/literacies development within a meaningful, 'integrated', interdisciplinary context effectively whilst utilising expertise from both academic departments and learning development/skills teams, and thus navigating disparate disciplinary agendas, communities of practice and strategic priorities. This paper reports on how this complex terrain was navigated at Royal Holloway, University of London, to successfully embed academic skills (using Universal Design for Learning pedagogy) into an academically authentic, inclusive, interdisciplinary 'Global Perspectives and Academic Practice' unit that facilitated student integration into academic departments. Whilst we report on how the programme led to higher than sector average attainment, retention and progression (the EE described it as a 'TEF Gold offering'), we critically analyse the challenges of embedding and aligning such provision within the communities of practice of a research-intensive institution. Throughout, we suggest ways forward at both practical and strategic levels to ensure the immense potential of integrated academic literacies development within FYs can be realised.

AB  - This article analyses the use of peer and self-assessment in oral presentations as complementary tools to assessment by the professor. The analysis is based on a study conducted at the University of Girona (Spain) in seven different degree subjects and fields of knowledge. We designed and implemented two instruments to measure students' peer and self-assessment, and a rubric to guide the assessment process. Results were compared with the marks awarded by the professor. In contrast with studies by other authors, which show a high correlation between these different assessment systems, our study revealed significant deviations. Applying peer and self-assessment to oral presentation activities also demonstrates their formative value above and beyond their summative usefulness.

AB  - The introduction of a multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) was analysed through a retrospective empirical study. The question of using it as a valuable tool to reinforce inter-professional development was made. The data was collected from 60 forth year Chiropractic students, who were at the end of their education and who were practicing their discipline under supervision. They were chosen because they fulfilled the World Health Organisation's criteria, as they had formed their professional identity. Data was collected via two-stage feedback interviews and was analysed qualitatively. Kirkpatrick's hierarchy was then used. Findings were grouped in the hierarchy's categories and analysed in a quantitative manner. It was found that the majority of the interviewees' opinions supported the MDM as an educational tool and a number of them believed that cognitive learning was achieved, influencing their behaviour. They supported that it helped them understand other professionals. In addition, they transferred and applied knowledge and practices to their professional environment, improving their collaboration with other health-workers, potentially improving the quality of their service.

AB  - Quality of healthcare delivery is dependent on collaboration between professional disciplines. Integrating opportunities for interprofessional learning in health science education programs prepares future clinicians to function as effective members of a multi-disciplinary care team. This study aimed to create a modified team-based learning (TBL) environment utilizing ultrasound technology during an interprofessional learning activity to enhance musculoskeletal anatomy knowledge of first year medical (MD) and physical therapy (PT) students. An ultrasound demonstration of structures of the upper limb was incorporated into the gross anatomy courses for first-year MD (n = 53) and PT (n = 28) students. Immediately before the learning experience, all students took an individual readiness assurance test (iRAT) based on clinical concepts regarding the assigned study material. Students observed while a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician demonstrated the use of ultrasound as a diagnostic and procedural tool for the shoulder and elbow. Following the demonstration, students worked within interprofessional teams (n = 14 teams, 5--6 students per team) to review the related anatomy on dissected specimens. At the end of the session, students worked within interprofessional teams to complete a collaborative clinical case-based multiple choice post-test. Team scores were compared to the mean individual score within each team with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Students scored higher on the collaborative post-test (95.2 ±10.2%) than on the iRAT (66.1 ± 13.9% for MD students and 76.2 ±14.2% for PT students, P < 0.0001). Results suggest that this interprofessional team activity facilitated an improved understanding and clinical application of anatomy.

AB  - Background: Systemic approaches can be useful in working with people with learning disabilities and their network. The evidence base for these approaches within the field of learning disabilities, however, is currently limited. Materials and Methods: This article presents part of a service evaluation of systemic consultations in a Community Learning Disability Service (CLDS). Two multidisciplinary team professionals were interviewed about what they found helpful and unhelpful in their experiences of attending systemic consultations. Interview data were analysed via applying thematic analysis principles. Results: Five main themes were elicited: differing expectations, enabling for the client, positive techniques, uncertainty regarding "forum" ("forum" meaning the collective of all of the individuals meet, which could include the professionals, lead therapist, reflecting team, etc.) composition and strengthening the network. Conclusions: Systemic consultations provided some positive and valuable experiences along with important caveats. Considerations for clinical practice are therefore discussed. Continued evaluation of systemic consultations within CLDSs is recommended.

AB  - Students who engage in undergraduate research experiences acquire many benefits, including an understanding of how scientific knowledge is constructed, recognition that knowledge can be complex and uncertain, and the habit of viewing knowledge critically. This paper describes a first-year two-course sequence that provides multidisciplinary opportunities for international science students to engage in the research process and present at a student-led research conference. We describe course goals and structure, and discuss whether the goals were attained using instructor reflections, student performance, and student survey data. We also evaluate the impact of changes to the curriculum between Year 1 and Year 2. In both years, we found that students engaged meaningfully with the research process and began to understand how scientific knowledge is created. We also found that a modular model with front-end support worked better for instructors as compared to a continuous individualized project mentorship model. This modular approach involved structured pre- and post-class assignments within discipline-specific themes containing examples of the research process embedded into the discipline. These discipline-specific modules were followed by modules covering broader research process themes. We encourage instructors who are thinking of delivering a similar research-based course for first-year students to provide support via example research questions and other example templates for student submissions.

AB  - This article examines a physics course for pre-service primary teachers in which physics, crafts and drama were taught together by connecting the standpoints of crafts and drama. The study was carried out by three university educators from these disciplines during an advanced optional course for student-teachers at the University of Helsinki in Finland. This article discusses the impact of the multidisciplinary teaching approach on the participants' learning outcomes. First, the article explains the multidisciplinary teaching model, an educational energy game that the student-teachers designed as part of the course. Second, it describes the learning that emerged from the student-teachers' learning process, including (1) learning skills, (2) new pedagogic thinking and (3) a change of attitude towards integrative teaching. Finally, the analysis shows the strength of sociocultural animation, which is traced through a path of becoming animated.

AB  - In order to be well-educated citizens in the 21st century, children need to learn computing in school. However, implementing computing education in schools faces several practical problems, such as a lack of computing teachers and time in an already overloaded curriculum. A solution may be a multidisciplinary approach, integrating computing education within other subjects in the curriculum. The present study proposes an instructional unit for computing education in social studies classes, with students learning basic computing concepts, including computational thinking, by programming history related games using Scratch. The instructional unit is developed following an instructional design approach and is applied and evaluated through a pilot case study in four classes (5th and 7th grade) with a total of 105 students at a school in (omitted for submission). Results provide a first indication that the instructional unit enables the learning of basic computing concepts (specifically programming) in an efficient, effective and entertaining way increasing also the interest and motivation of students to learn computing.

AB  - The aim of this research was to examine the effects of a new platform for raising the pre-service chemistry and geography teachers' awareness of cooperation possibilities associated with the planning relevant interdisciplinary lesson. The research featured the participation of 16 students of the Faculty of Chemistry and 28 students of the Faculty of Geography of Belgrade University. Two workshops were conducted within the research. During the first workshop the participants worked in small groups on the tasks which served to strengthen their awareness on the relevant science education. The second workshop comprised the jointly planning the interdisciplinary lessons in groups with members of the pre-service teachers of both subjects. The participants' lesson plans contain goals that can be classified as those relevant for the individual and those relevant for society. Half of the lesson plans contained formulations of goals that can be assessed as relevant for certain professions. The activities planned for the attainment of the stated goals support an interdisciplinary approach, encompass the concepts envisaged by the chemistry and geography curricula, and the activities specific to these two subjects.

AB  - We describe how faculty and staff used improvement science design Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles and engaged in interdisciplinary conversations in an effort to improve students' performance in introductory mathematics courses. This initiative started with College Algebra a course with a large enrollment of students that had a high failure rate. We engaged in PDSA cycles over a period of 4 years. From 2011-2015, we used data from student assessment scores, course evaluations, lab surveys, and instructors' observations to inform decisions to transform introductory mathematics courses. The transformative efforts positively enhanced students' performance. Furthermore, to reflect on our PDSA cycles and the broader implications of institutionalized change to mathematics courses, we engaged in frequent interdisciplinary conversations to discuss complexities and challenges. These meetings provided an opportunity to build a common vision about the nature and delivery of the mathematics taught to better serve students The themes of the conversations were on curriculum, assessment, instruction, the complexities of the change process, cultivating a growth mindset, and the need to engage in research in general education mathematics courses. Therefore, in this article we provide insights as to how interdisciplinary conversations were used to implement evidence-based teaching practices and also pedagogical approaches that can be used to facilitate students learning.

AB  - Art and technology have always been very tightly intertwined, presenting strong influences on each other. On the other hand, technological evolution led to today's digital media landscape, elaborating mediated communication tools, thus providing new creative means of expression (i.e., new-media art). Rich-media interaction can expedite the whole process into an augmented schooling experience though art cannot be easily enclosed in classical teaching procedures. The current work focuses on the deployment of a modern-art web-guide, aiming at enhancing traditional approaches with machine-assisted blended-learning. In this perspective, "machine" has a two-folded goal: to offer highly-interdisciplinary multimedia services for both in-class demonstration and self-training support, and to crowdsource users' feedback, as to train artificial intelligence systems on painting movements semantics. The paper presents the implementation of the "Istoriart" website through the main phases of Analysis, Design, Development, and Evaluation, while also answering typical questions regarding its impact on the targeted audience. Hence, elaborating on this constructive case study, initial hypotheses on the multidisciplinary usefulness, and contribution of the new digital services are put into test and verified.

AB  - This article provides a case study of student experiences working as part of an interdisciplinary research team. A team of graduate-level students from social work, civil engineering, and computer science collaborated on the design of a mobile device application that captures data regarding how transportation disadvantage affects the lived experiences of community-dwelling older adults and single parents experiencing homelessness with dependent children. An online survey (N=5) was used to assess student experiences on the team. Findings from this case study have important implications for engaging students in interdisciplinary applied research, including challenging them to expand their knowledge base beyond the traditional confines of their disciplines, encouraging critical and creative thinking skills, and harnessing technology for the greater social good.

AB  - The evolution of resistance to antibiotics provides a timely and relevant topic for teaching undergraduate students evolutionary biology. Here, we present a module incorporating modified sequencing data from eight antibiotic resistant pathogen outbreaks in hospital settings with bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses. This module uses whole genome sequencing data from hospital outbreaks investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide examples of antibiotic resistance spread. Students work in groups to analyze outbreak data to identify the bacterial species and antibiotic resistance genes, to infer a phylogenetic tree examining relatedness among isolates, and to determine a possible source of the outbreak. Students then compile their results in individual reports and provide recommendations for preventing the further spread of antibiotic resistant organisms. In addition to providing genomic outbreak data, we include a teaching concepts guide discussing three integral components of the module: how evolutionary biology concepts of natural selection and competition impact antibiotic resistance; outbreak investigation information to aid in phylogenetic analysis and creation of recommendations; and instructions for the bioinformatics protocol. Completion of this module provides students an opportunity to think critically about the evolution of resistance, practice bioinformatics techniques, and relate evolutionary biology to current events.

AB  - The paper discusses how a teaching approach, "interdisciplinary design and invention pedagogy," affected primary school student teachers' learning outcomes through the craft design process in pre-service teacher education. This study applies developmental work research (Engeström in J Educ Work 14(1):133-156, 2001; Engeström in Yhteiskehittely ja vaihdon vyöhykkeet tutkijoiden ja elinkeinoelämän välillä 2013; Galison in Image & logic: a material culture of microphysics. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1997; Gorman in Trading zones, interactional expertise and interdisciplinary collaboration 2005) that aims to develop educators' work involved here. To support a craft-designing process and making innovative artefacts, two disciplines--natural science (physics) and drama--as examples of interdisciplinarity were invited to contribute to the craft process. The craft course on 'smart textiles' was carried out in the spring of 2014 and 2015 at the University of Helsinki in pre-service primary teacher education. The aim of the crafts course was to get student teachers familiar with different dimensions of crafts (textile, design and technology), inquiry-based designing and an interdisciplinary teaching approach to be used in a primary school context. The craft task included working in small groups and designing smart textiles. Student teachers documented their designing and implementation processes through photos and videos using applications such as iMovie or Movie maker. In addition, participants wrote comprehensions of their projects in learning diaries. The data consist of student teachers' learning diaries (N = 17) and prototypes (N = 17), which are analysed by qualitative content analysis. As results, first, the paper presents some innovative artefacts that student teachers created. Second, it describes the learning that emerged in pedagogical thinking of student teachers related to the interdisciplinary designing process, including (1) four interdisciplinary contexts, (2) new pedagogic thinking and (3) change of attitude towards integrative teaching.

AB  - This study examined interdisciplinary vocational educator teams to identify differences in their team learning behaviours and examined whether their team affective reactions could explain these differences. We used a mixed-methods approach comprising a survey of 117 interdisciplinary work teams with 604 members and a qualitative analysis of our observations of the meetings of six of these teams. The team-level cluster analysis to identify differences in team learning behaviours revealed three clusters that differed significantly (p = 0.00) regarding nearly all team learning behaviours. We named these clusters according to their patterns in team learning behaviours: 'very active all-round teams', 'active all-round teams' and 'active teams with high knowledge sharing'. These differences in team learning behaviours could be explained by significant differences in team affective reactions (p < 0.05). Each cluster was represented by two teams whose team meetings (five per team) were audio- and videotaped. The overall findings of this study indicate that team affective reactions are related to team learning behaviours. The results of the qualitative analysis of the observation data provide additional information that not only positive but also negative team affective reactions can stimulate the engagement in team learning behaviours.

AB  - Contribution: This paper demonstrates curricular modules that incorporate engineering model-based approaches, including concepts related to circuits, systems, modeling, electrophysiology, programming, and software tutorials that enhance learning in undergraduate neuroscience courses. These modules can also be integrated into other neuroscience courses. Background: Educators in biological and physical sciences urge incorporation of computation and engineering approaches into biology. Model-based approaches can provide insights into neural function; prior studies show these are increasingly being used in research in biology. Reports about their integration in undergraduate neuroscience curricula, however, are scarce. There is also a lack of suitable courses to satisfy engineering students' interest in the challenges in the growing area of neural sciences. Intended Outcomes: (1) Improved student learning in interdisciplinary neuroscience; (2) enhanced teaching by neuroscience faculty; (3) research preparation of undergraduates; and 4) increased interdisciplinary interactions. Application Design: An interdisciplinary undergraduate neuroscience course that incorporates computation and model-based approaches and has both software- and wet-lab components, was designed and co-taught by colleges of engineering and arts and science. Findings: Model-based content improved learning in neuroscience for three distinct groups: 1) undergraduates; 2) Ph.D. students; and 3) post-doctoral researchers and faculty. Moreover, the importance of the content and the utility of the software in enhancing student learning was rated highly by all these groups, suggesting a critical role for engineering in shaping the neuroscience curriculum. The model for cross-training also helped facilitate interdisciplinary research collaborations.

AB  - Children and youth in schools are subject to the effects of the larger culture's attitudes and values related to body size. When negatively biased, these attitudes and values can have detrimental effects and thus emerge as relevant to educational and psychological consultants. Drawing on the nascent field of Fat Studies with its focus on the cultural meanings attached to large bodies, we identify direct implications of fat phobia for school-age children and youth. Via a brief case example, an initial review of literature, and several examples of health-positive programming, we describe the social justice implications of fat phobia for consultants in school and community settings. In this consideration of the role of consultants for addressing fat bias and supporting health, we also suggest the merit of applied interdisciplinarity as a strong ground for consultation research and practice. The academic area of Fat Studies provides illustration of the integration of disciplinary perspectives (e.g., sociology, anthropology, biology, psychology). Educational and psychological consultation is ideally situated for systematically engaging such interdisciplinarity in support of practical outcomes that are healthy, sustainable, and socially just.

AB  - Universities are increasingly recognising the need to broaden the experience and understanding of their students beyond a single disciplinary approach, to produce graduates more capable of solving the problems of a multidisciplinary world. At the University of Tasmania, a "breadth unit" programme is underway with the dual purpose of evidencing student experience in graduate attributes and developing transdisciplinary approaches for interpreting the complex challenges (or "wicked problems") of the real world. All breadth units are developed by lecturers working in teams across multiple faculties, all units must be capable of being studied off campus, and several have on-campus options (meeting the University's requirement for blended learning). Breadth units are being built into student study plans, with most students required to study at least two units as part of their undergraduate degree. The initiative, which commenced in 2013, uncovered challenges in administrative and academic systems that might have been predictable, but were often surprisingly intractable. Administrative systems have had to adapt to university study moving out of faculty silos. One-year-on reviews of units following their introduction capture the delivery experience (from lecturer and student perspectives) and provide vital feedback on learning design for quality improvement. Teaching teams now confront how best to sustain the blended approach as enrolment numbers increase. This paper raises some of the issues to be tackled and suggests indicators for the success of this initiative.

AB  - To be successful, junior faculty must properly manage their time in the face of expanding responsibilities. One such responsibility is supervising undergraduate research projects. Student research projects (either single or multi-student) can be undertaken as a full-time summer experience, or as a part-time academic year commitment. With many potential undergraduate research formats, and with different types of students, junior faculty may find challenges in forming their research group, establishing a structure that promotes student productivity, picking an appropriate project, or in effectively mentoring their students. This article draws from the authors' experiences to help junior faculty navigate these complexities so that all parties reap the benefits of undergraduate research in interdisciplinary mathematical disciplines.

AB  - Since spring 2012, the author has taught a 300-level Theatre and Human Rights class in the University of New Mexico Honors College. One of the centerpieces of honors education is careful research and thorough analysis of what is taught and why it is taught. In creating the honors class Theatre and Human Rights, the author explored how she would teach the course and the various components best suited to teaching this topic. After first considering the topic of human rights and its relevance to theatre in an honors context, she then considered the value of interdisciplinary teaching in such a course and what its impact could be on helping students understand human rights, specifically through the study of Athol Fugard's 1982 play "'Master Harold' . . . and the Boys." Considering the topic of theatre and human rights, its background, pedagogy, and philosophy may provide an example of the kind of work that goes into making honors education a distinct segment of higher education in North America today. In this article, the author discusses why a theatre course is one of the best approaches to discussing human rights and interdisciplinary teaching.

AB  - We investigated how learning outcomes of students majoring in interdisciplinary fields differ from those of students in discipline-based majors. We found that students in interdisciplinary majors report less change in Critical Thinking and Need For Cognition than their peers in disciplinary majors, but no difference in change in Positive Attitude Toward Literacy. Students' gains in Critical Thinking and Need For Cognition do not vary by the characteristics of the interdisciplinary major, but some program characteristics influence modest changes in Positive Attitudes Toward Literacy. Future research should address selection effects, develop measures of interdisciplinary learning, and further explore curricular and instructional patterns in interdisciplinary programs.

AB  - Taking the establishment of structured doctoral programmes in Germany as an example, this paper focuses on how knowledge production in certain academic fields reshapes their doctoral education in a widely changing policy context. Based on case studies of eight graduate schools in three research fields, namely economics, life sciences, and literature--cultural studies, this paper illustrates the different components of structured doctoral programmes in the above three fields, and analyses the heterogeneity in the motivation and pathways of doctoral education reform. This paper concludes that the structured doctoral programmes in Germany manifest several characteristics of the new mode of knowledge production. However, these characteristics have very different implications for different academic fields, which should be taken into consideration when making relevant policies.

AB  - In order to increase student commitment from the beginning of students' university careers, the Technische Universität Darmstadt has introduced interdisciplinary study projects involving first-year students from the engineering, natural, social and history, economics and/or human sciences departments. The didactic concept includes sophisticated task design, individual responsibility and a differentiated support system. Using a self-determination theory framework, this study examined the effects of the projects based on survey findings from two projects with more than 1000 students. The results showed that the projects were successful in fulfilling students' basic psychological needs and in promoting students' academic engagement. Basic psychological needs were found to be significant predictors of academic engagement. These findings suggest that interdisciplinary study projects can potentially contribute to improving higher education as they fulfil students' basic psychological needs for competence, relatedness and autonomy and enhance students' academic engagement.

AB  - Integrating engineering and technology concepts into K-12 science and math curricula through engineering design project-based learning has been found to increase students' interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), however preparing teachers to shift to interdisciplinary teaching remains a significant challenge. Primarily teachers need to develop both skills and attitudes toward interdisciplinary teaching. In doing so, professional development (PD) is considered a key component in helping teachers through this transformation process. In an educational environment of accountability, measuring the effects of PD programs on teacher behaviors and capacity is essential but often elusive. The current study describes the change in attitudes to interdisciplinary teaching of 29 self-selected middle and high school teachers who participated a PD workshop and in delivering a 12-15 week interdisciplinary teaching and design problem unit that spanned multiple STEM subjects. This quasi-experimental pilot study implemented a single group pretest-posttest design using survey methods to collect data from the participants at two intervals; at the time of the PD workshop and at the completion of the teaching unit that emphasized a long-term engineering design problem. The goals of this research are to (1) assess the changes in attitudes to interdisciplinary teaching, attitudes to teamwork, teaching satisfaction, and resistance to change, (2) explore relationships among these changes, (3) and describe the variation in these changes across teachers' gender, school level, discipline taught, and education level.

AB  - The Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS) at the University of Birmingham in England, launched in 1964, highlights contested issues of knowledge production in relation to the disciplines in modern universities. It constitutes a fascinating example of the social formation of configurations of knowledge that can be subjected to historical analysis such as those conducted for example by Richard Selleck, Geoff Sherington and other recent historians of education. It enacted an explicit ideal of interdisciplinarity in its approach to research, teaching and social practices, unlike for example educational studies which in the same period generally held to a weaker model of multidisciplinarity. Archival documents and interviews with some of those who were participants or witnesses of its development shed light on CCCS's approach to interdisciplinarity in action. This generated significant works such as "Unpopular education: schooling and social democracy in England since 1944" and a collegial style of teaching and research, but also led to isolation, political vulnerability and its eventual closure in 2002.

AB  - Transfer of learning, the application of learning to different contexts over time, is important to all learning for development. As 21st century skills specifically aim to be "generic," there is an assumption that they can be transferred from context to context. We investigate the process of transfer in problem solving, with specific focus on mathematical problem solving tasks. Problem solving is highly valued in 21st century workplaces, where mathematical skills are also considered to be foundational in STEM and of paramount importance. This study examines the transfer of first semester mathematics learning to problem solving in second semester physics at university. We report on: (1) university students' (n = 10) "think-aloud" accounts of the process of transfer; and (2) students' (n = 10) and academics' (n = 8) perspectives on transfer processes and problem solving. Think-aloud accounts show students' recursive use of interpretation, integration, planning and execution thinking processes and highlight the meta-cognitive strategies used in transfer. Academics' and students' perspectives on transfer show disparities. Understanding these perspectives is important to current initiatives to integrate and optimise 21st century learning within universities. We argue that renewed attention on the concept of transfer is needed if the generic aims of 21st century skills are to be understood and promoted.

AB  - In this article we examine students' learning experiences within a new team-taught general education course designed to explore the big idea of "What does it mean to be human?" from multiple disciplinary perspectives. Semi-structured interviews with students provide insight on how learners are experiencing this new instructional model and its implications for interdisciplinary learning. Our conversations with students reveal that students affirm the value of interdisciplinary education and perceive this collaborative and co-instructed model as beneficial to their learning. This new curricular approach, while not without its challenges, was found to have positive implications for bolstering learner interest, fostering perspective-taking behaviors, and creating a classroom environment in which students perceive their intellectual contributions as valued.

AB  - The ability to work with people from different disciplinary is a skill for workplace and it is an important skill for teachers too. This study helps gain a better understanding of how engaging in interdisciplinary design teams impacts student teachers' self-efficacy through the use of collaborative concept maps. A statistically significant positive change was reported in pre-service teachers' pre and post study self-efficacy in interdisciplinary design teams. Qualitative data shows that using collaborative concept map in interdisciplinary design teams strengthened pre-service' teachers understanding of interdisciplinary team teaching and broadened their pedagogical awareness for future teaching. The findings enhance our understanding of how teacher education programs could use interdisciplinary project teams to prepare future teachers.

AB  - An interactive, field-based course on the environmental aspects of natural water was developed as part of STEM initiatives at a comprehensive university in the United States. The project is funded by the National Science Foundation. The course is focused on two fundamental student skills, such as hydrologic field procedures and analytical methods. For field procedures, an area watershed was delineated as a natural laboratory and integrated into the course curriculum by designing creek-side learning activities. For analytical methods, instrumental setup and analysis for water and soil samples were designed to cover core concepts in hydrology. The primary goal of the course is to portray water's important role in the natural environment. Exercises are written in an interdisciplinary setting making sure that students can identify real-life environmental problems and offer realistic solutions to them. By taking part in this project, students gained new knowledge on stream gauging, groundwater simulations, ion chemistry, GIS applications, bio-pollutants, wastewater treatment, hydrologic systems, and sampling protocol. Students also gained important skills in handling state-of-the-art equipment, including ion chromatograph, spectrophotometer, sediment analyzer, data-logger, and well purging systems. Outcomes assessment indicates that students who took the new course are more efficient in data collection, compilation, and interpretation associated with the availability, movement, and impairment of natural water. They are able to think more critically about the aquatic environment and the interrelationships among its components. Overall, the students view this course as one that has improved their learning in water sciences. Hands-on activities were very useful to critically think about natural processes that impact the water environment. They better understood how field and laboratory research data are used to implement water policies.

AB  - This paper offers lessons learned from a partnership between the Texas A&M School of Innovation (I-School) and the Texas A&M Educational Technology program. Taking on the I-School as a "client," online graduate students in an Advanced Instructional Design course spent a semester designing the first of a set of online educational modules aimed to educate inventors, especially those emerging from research institutions, about the process of obtaining funding from outside sources for commercializing their technologies. Key elements of authentic learning experiences include a "real-world relevant project," "collaboration," "meaningful reflection," and a "polished product" (Herrington et al. "Australian Journal of Educational Technology," 19(1), 57-71. 2003). The design of the asynchronous course is discussed in terms of how it reflects these elements of authentic learning experiences. In addition, the experience of participating in this client-based authentic learning experience within an asynchronous, online course is discussed from the instructor, student, and client perspectives.

AB  - This paper proposes the theoretical context for a course development framework to address the specific needs and challenges of teaching and learning in interdisciplinary studies (IDS). User-centred design (UCD) principles are used for this development process. Traditional course development frameworks provide a helpful guide in terms of setting out the steps necessary for successful course development. While these steps will inform the course development framework being proposed here, several alterations will be made. The unique demands of teaching and learning in IDS require skill development necessary for doing advanced interdisciplinary work and eschews linearity. The key feature of this framework is the inclusion of intentional iterative phases throughout course delivery that will allow for adaptation based on the incorporation of feedback in a variety of forms: self, instructor, peer, stakeholder (e.g., from service-learning supervisors), and cognitive skills assessment tools. The adaptive nature of this framework should meet the demands of the growing area of IDS.

AB  - Purpose: New ways of teaching have been under consideration over the last decade. Thus, this study aims to examine the effects of an interdisciplinary educational approach integrating physical education and mathematics on light and moderate-vigorous physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior, and learning subtraction. Method: Forty-six first-grade students (M[subscript age] = 76.98 ± 3.74 months) wore an accelerometer for 4 weeks to measure their PA levels. For 3 weeks, one group (n = 23) attended their physical education and mathematic lessons separately according to the traditional curriculum development (i.e., regular classroom lessons), and the other group (n = 23) was taught through an integrated curriculum based on an interdisciplinary approach integrating physical education and mathematics where the curricular time devoted to these subjects was unified. Results: Several "t"-test analyses revealed significant between-group differences in all variables following the curricular interventions. Students from the interdisciplinary group reached higher levels of light PA, t(44) = -10.095, p < 0.001, d = 2.97; moderate-vigorous PA, t(44) = -7.950, p < 0.001, d = 2.35; and spent less time in sedentary behavior, t(44) = 13.549, p < 0.001, d = 4.01, than students who attended regular classroom lessons. Moreover, the students from the interdisciplinary group achieved higher scores in subtraction learning, t(44) = -4.06, p < 0.001, d = 1.20. Discussion/Conclusion: The integration of PA into learning environments such as mathematics might help to develop tools that improve mathematical learnings (i.e., subtraction). Likewise, this kind of interdisciplinary approach may contribute to increase the children's PA levels during the school day.

AB  - Building upon paradigms of language and languaging practices as "local" phenomena (Canagarajah, 2013; Pennycook, 2010, Pietikäinen & Kelly-Holmes, 2013), this paper narrates a teacher's experience in an undergraduate seminar in applied language studies as an exploration in transdisciplinarity-as-localization. Taught by the author in 2012-2013, the seminar was intended as an introduction to the politics of societal multilingualism as visible in the linguistic landscape of public texts. As such, it relied upon its own geographic and institutional locality, as well as the diverse conceptual moorings and methodologies of linguistic landscape research (e.g., Blommaert, 2013; Shohamy & Gorter, 2009; Trumper-Hecht, 2010) in order to lead students in interpreting the significance of East Asian languages in the San Francisco Bay Area. However, as the paper endeavors to show, the course's own curriculum--and with it, the locus of teacherly authority--was forced to de-localize as the implementation of curricular ideals in practice revealed heterogeneous and expansive orders of meaning.

AB  - There has been much recent discussion about student engagement in higher education, and in the last few years a number of authors have undertaken extensive international research on the topic, which has been summarized in a number of literature reviews. However, to date, there has been relatively little in-depth exploration of student engagement in problem-based learning (PBL) or the impact of different forms of engagement on distinct forms of PBL. Drawing on a number of studies over the last 15 years, this paper argues that student engagement in PBL can be troublesome as both a concept and a practice. It also suggests there are 4 transdisciplinary threshold concepts that have an impact on student engagement with PBL: liminality, scaffolding, pedagogical content knowledge, and pedagogical stance. The paper argues that by acknowledging these transdisciplinary threshold concepts and working with them, facilitators will be able to enhance student learning in PBL across disciplines, contexts, and diverse forms of PBL.

AB  - The aim of this article is to present a case study in the field of ESD for in-service teachers training conducted in a Swiss primary school. A Discursive Community of Interdisciplinary Practices (DCIP) has been created including researchers, teachers, and a pedagogical advisor in the context of ESD, focusing on the topic of chocolate. In this article, we discuss how the DCIP helped teachers to develop competencies in the field of ESD. Furthermore, we see how teacher training could lead to a transformation of teachers' practices, moving from a normative education to a more reflexive one. We present the collaborative research and its theoretical context. The analysis of focus group discussions evidenced an evolution of ESD teachers' points of view. The analysis of the teachers' comments highlights the potential of the methods implemented to help teachers to enter into the process of conceptualizing knowledge in terms of ESD.

AB  - When students are introduced to the study of diversity and social justice, it is usually from sociological and psychological perspectives. The scholars and activists featured in this anthology reject this approach as too limiting, insisting that we adopt a view that is both transdisciplinary and multiperspectival. Their essays focus on the components of diversity, social justice, and inclusive excellence, not just within the United States but in other parts of the world. They examine diversity in the contexts of culture, race, class, gender, learned ability and dis/ability, religion, sexual orientation, and citizenship, and explore how these concepts and identities interrelate. The result is a book that will provide readers with a better theoretical understanding of diversity studies and will enable them to see and think critically about oppression and how systems of oppression may be challenged.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research is a popular mode of knowledge production that becomes intensively promoted by research centers all across the globe. Despite the facilitation of interdisciplinary research, however, scholars working in these centers are 'disciplined.' Career promotions, funding decisions and scientific publishing are based on peer-review procedures that tend to favor monodisciplinary research. This paper builds on a qualitative study with scholars in interdisciplinary research centers in Germany and asks how scholars cope with these monodisciplinary demands. After deriving a conceptual framework, the study identifies four coping strategies: disciplinary innovation, strategic compliance, niche-seeking, and field creation. Each of these strategies is characterized by a different degree of openness to knowledge bases of other disciplines and a different degree of proactivity towards monodisciplinary demands from the scientific field. The results illuminate how research agendas become disciplined despite interdisciplinary motivation and organizational support of interdisciplinary research.

AB  - The interdisciplinary aspect of natural disasters requires their correlation with more than one discipline and orientation for understanding and teaching the inevitable nature of disasters. This study aimed to design a teacher training program called the Interdisciplinary Disaster Education Program (IDEP) and reveal its effect on improving teachers' natural disaster literacy. Furthermore, teachers' opinions about program were examined. The mixed-method design was used in the study. The study participants consisted of 36 teachers (science, classroom, and social studies teachers) working on different subjects. Data were obtained using the Natural Disaster Literacy Scale and the survey for the IDEP. The data collected from the scale were analyzed using two-way mixed ANOVA. The qualitative data collected from the survey were subjected to content analysis. The results indicated that the IDEP statistically improved teachers' natural disaster literacy. Moreover, the survey results highlighted that different instructional activities (experiments, modeling, workshops, rock/soil analysis, coding, augmented reality, and STEM applications, etc.) related to natural disasters contributed to a lot of professional and personal knowledge of teachers, particularly disaster management.

AB  - A new project-based laboratory (PJBL) was developed for general chemistry students to tackle the steps involved in chemical water quality analysis using an accessible, real-world hydrologic system (the lakes of the Lower Grand Coulee, Washington). This PJBL was developed in a joint general chemistry and environmental geology course by a chemist-geologist teaching team, and it emphasized an interdisciplinary approach for a more complete understanding of the geochemistry of the lake system. Students worked through the project following industry protocols for sample collection in the field, chemical laboratory determination of dissolved solids, alkalinity, and dissolved metals, and interpretation of the results within the unique geological context of the lakes. Foundational concepts in solution chemistry, such as solubility product, pH, and alkalinity, were essential in the discussion of the lake water trends and broader geologic processes. In particular, students could relate chemical weathering of basaltic bedrock to the measured lake water constituents and could observe how the groundwater- and evaporation-controlled fluxes of water in the closed basin produced a downstream increase in alkalinity and dissolved load. Collectively, the steps involved in the project meet the essential criteria (as defined by other authors) for a complete chemistry PJBL. This PJBL can be readily adapted to a wide range of groundwater or surface water systems and can be framed in a more or less interdisciplinary context. Many students, without prompting and on confidential evaluations, rated this as the most valuable learning experience in the year-long academic coursework.

AB  - Current efforts to promote STEAM (STEM + Arts) education focus predominantly on how partnering with the arts provides a range of benefits to STEM students. Here we take a different approach and focus on what art and art education students stand to gain from collaborating with STEM students. Drawing on a variety of student field texts, we present three visual-verbal, constructed narratives of art education students who, in the context of a transdisciplinary design studio, were challenged to experiment with collaborative forms of creative thinking. Their stories point to STEAM as an opportunity for art students to question the notion of the "lone artist," reflect upon the tension between product and process, and expand disciplinary-based understandings of creative thinking. These potential benefits align with contemporary visual arts practices that strive to move beyond the individual and embrace dialogue, collaborative action, and interdisciplinarity as vital aspects of the creative process.

AB  - This paper concerns transdisciplinarity as an educational and research strategy in technological higher education. The starting point of the article will be a synthetic analysis of the nature and demands faced by the university in our complex world, and the models of knowledge that could be activated, developed, and operationalised within it. Emerging traits in transdisciplinary processes are presented, as well as some of their impacts and effects on people, communities and the university. Also described are the challenges and difficulties that can arise in the implementation of transdisciplinarity in polytechnic universities and some strategies to face them. Finally the paper ends with a reflection regarding the link between some of humanity's problems faced from a transdisciplinary perspective and some values pointing towards the building of a world of harmony and awareness.

AB  - The advances in interdisciplinary studies are driving universities to utilize their available resources to efficiently enable development processes and provide increasing examples of research while gradually allocating the disciplines' resources. Ultimately, this trend asks universities to provide a platform of integrated disciplines, along with solid management to support the full-life cycle of interdisciplinary studies in fulfillment with internal policy and external regulations. To achieve this, we believe that this trend matches with business scholars to make a meaningful effort to show that their research thinking is interdisciplinary in nature. The key question is how business scholars, as professionals, provide the most value from academic disciplines in interdisciplinary research to solve real-life problems. Answering this question is accomplished in this study by using theoretical analysis to explore the concepts, benefits and uses of the existing knowledge base in interdisciplinary research as an innovative approach that links the business related-disciplines, people, and places involved to allocate universities' resources effectively.

AB  - In response to the current demands and trends within education, the disciplines as one of the core long-standing organizing structures within knowledge production and transmission are questioning and shifting what and how they teach. Universities are increasingly offering interdisciplinary subjects and programmes as an alternative to or alongside disciplinary subjects. This paper investigates the underlying themes and principles that inform curriculum debate around the value of the disciplines and interdisciplinarity in Australia when compared to the views and practices of academics. A focus on the knowledge that is included in discipline-based and interdisciplinary curricula reveals interdisciplinary knowledge to be more weakly classified and framed than discipline-based knowledge. This has consequences for the depth of interdisciplinary knowledge and requires the consideration of the structure and place of interdisciplinary curricula in university education.

AB  - This article provides an introduction to the literature on interdisciplinary research. It then draws lessons from that literature for the field of adapted physical activity. It is argued that adapted physical activity should be a self-consciously interdisciplinary field. It should insist that research be performed according to recognized interdisciplinary and disciplinary methodologies. Each section of the article addresses an important aspect of the literature on interdisciplinary research and closes with a recommendation for adapted physical activity.

AB  - As the global population grows, concern for a food shortage may be looming. As the next generations of agricultural and natural resource leaders are prepared to address this challenge, input throughout multiple disciplines is required to solve this dilemma. Undergraduates must be prepared to engage in problem solving and entrepreneurial thinking if our society hopes to conquer this shortage. Opportunities to engage in interdisciplinary education can offer learning experiences focused on bridging research and policy, exploring real world problems, and developing solutions for socio-environmental issues. As interdisciplinary education in academia gains momentum, exploration is needed to understand the factors and influences affecting student attitude towards enrollment in interdisciplinary courses. This research examined the relationships between undergraduate goal orientation and attitude towards participation in interdisciplinary education specifically addressing, "How do we sustainably feed nine billion people by 2050?" Data was collected from a convenience sample of undergraduates who responded to Vandewalle's (1997) goal orientation and a researcher-developed instrument. Findings indicated undergraduates were most interested in nutrition followed by human disease management and water issues and least interested in economic concerns and plant disease management issues. Learning goal orientation and performance goal orientation--prove were found to influence attitude toward interdisciplinary education.

AB  - How, when and what kind of learning takes place are key questions in all educational environments. School graduates are expected to have reached a development level whereby they have, among many fundamental skills, the ability to think critically, to plan their studies and their future, and to integrate knowledge across disciplines. However, it is challenging to develop these skills in schools. Following existing curricula, disciplines are often taught separately and by different teachers, making it difficult for students to connect knowledge studied and learned from one discipline to that of another discipline. The Next Generation Science Standards on teaching and learning natural science in the United States point out important crosscutting concepts in science education (NGSS, 2013). In Estonia, similar trends are leading to an emphasis on the need to further develop scientific literacy skills and interdisciplinary learning in students. The changing environment around us must be reflected in changes in our school system. In this paper, we report on research that intends to answer the questions: (a) "How much do Estonian students develop an interdisciplinary understanding of science throughout their high school education?", and (b) "Is their thinking more interdisciplinary after two years of studies in an Estonian high school?" Additionally, we analyzed the results based on the type of school the students attended, and we examined the use concept mapping to assess interdisciplinary learning. This research is part of an overall study that involved students from 44 Estonian high schools taking a science test similar to the three-dimensional Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) test (hereafter called PISA-like multidimensional test) as well as constructing concept maps, while in 10th and 12th grade. In this paper, we report on the analysis of the results for 182 of the students, concentrating on the analysis of the concept maps they constructed. The results suggest that there were changes in the students' interdisciplinary knowledge, but these were small and varied depending on the students' school type. They also suggest that changes may be needed in the Estonian educational system to increase the students' level of interdisciplinary understanding of science.

AB  - Anorexia nervosa is a complex behavioral disorder with the highest risk of death of any psychological disorder. Between 15% and 20% of those suffering from anorexia die from complications that are attributed either directly or indirectly to self-starvation. Heritability for anorexia is around 0.5, meaning about 50% of the risk for anorexia is attributable to genetics and the other 50% is attributable to environmental factors. Sufferers may be as young as 5 years old and as old as 80. Some with anorexia recover completely and some struggle with it for a lifetime. Average recovery time is between 3 and 7 years. This directed case study uses a progressive disclosure model to expose students to the multiple facets of anorexia. The case follows Megi, a teenage girl who has recovered from anorexia. The case has been taught in advanced general psychology and genetics classes. It could be readily adapted for general biology, abnormal psychology, counseling, or nutrition. It is helpful for students to have prior knowledge about the theme of nature-nurture as well as familiarity with the basic concepts of scientific thinking including hypothesis formulation and the determination of cause and effect.

AB  - Many colleagues who have become active in AIS have experienced that their membership has entailed friendships with like-minded people, thanks to Bill Newell's creation of a welcoming atmosphere from which both individuals and the organization have benefitted. Musing upon the words behind the acronym AIS, and anticipating its historic first conference outside North America -- in Amsterdam in 2019 (see http://www.aisconference2019.nl ) -- what follows is a brief reflection upon friendship and interdisciplinary studies and the ways that Bill has connected the two.

AB  - Undergraduate students often lack opportunities to comprehend, present, and produce scientific literature as part of their regular curriculum. In courses that have already been already developed, students either analyzed a few journal articles and/or studied disciplinary content typically with the assistance of a textbook. In this study, I have developed a course that primarily relies on scientific literature to introduce interdisciplinary science in the intersection of biology and physics. Here, students not only learned content knowledge through literature, but also how to thoroughly analyze about 20 journal articles published in top-tier journals in the field. Students demonstrate their understanding of the content matter through weekly assignments, oral presentations, and a written review article.

AB  - This article describes a new type of team training that involves undergraduate students of medicine, students from the Aalto University (industrial engineering and management, architecture, information networks, collaborative and industrial design and bioinformation technology) and specialized home care nurses. During the course, the students learned interdisciplinary teamwork and created innovations in the care of older people. The 18 participants formed six microteams (three persons in each team: one specialized nurse, one medical student and one from Aalto University). The course consisted of two seminars and 3 full days of home visits to older people's homes. Participants were encouraged to make one innovation in each home visit that would improve the older person's well-being or streamline the processes of home care. During the course, the participants promptly formed tight teams. They valued the know-how of the other team members and learned openly from each other. They also created a number of practical innovations in home care which they presented to executives of older people's care in a final seminar. The course received very good feedback from the students. This course is an encouraging example of how gerontological interdisciplinary team training may be successfully applied. The article describes both the learning outcomes and the innovations the students produced during their home visits. It also discusses the learning theories behind effective interdisciplinary team learning.

AB  - Harnessing scholarship focused on literacy and poverty, in this article we aim to complicate the common understanding of the digital divide. First, we argue that the dominant literature on the digital divide misses broader connections between technological exclusion and broader forms of economic and social exclusion. Accordingly, and following recent qualitative research on the digital divide, we believe future scholarship must examine the complicated relationships between poverty, inequality, and the digital divide and we look to poverty scholarship to understand the complicated and shifting nature of poverty. Finally, we make the case that scholars and practitioners focused on digital literacy programs should pay attention to historical and critical scholarship on education and its role in mediating poverty and fostering social mobility, as it serves digital divide and broadband adoption scholars to understand the ways education processes can either reproduce or set the stage to alter entrenched social realities.

AB  - This study was carried out within the framework of a pedagogical project. It compares the results obtained from the application of two different didactic models for learning and practicing musical composition in a Secondary Education class: the traditional teacher centred method (designated as the control group, CG), and an interdisciplinary model based on a holistic style (designated as the experimental group, EG). Both methodologies focused on identical musical composition content, but latter applied an open ended interdisciplinary approach, based on synchronised learning in several subjects. A quasi-experimental design was used in this research. Pre- and post-test questionnaires were applied to measure the progress in composing skills in both groups. The questions focused on various tasks with verbal and figurative content to evaluate the progress of the student's ability to explore sound parameters, their knowledge and acquisition of musical elements and the improvement of flexible understanding the students developed during the process. Data were analyzed by means of standardised quantitative tests and by qualitative triangulation. Analysis of this data provided evidence that students were able to obtain meaningful understanding by connecting the Music contents with other school subjects and their own personal realities. The integrative qualities of the experience fostered the self-sufficiency and self-confidence and fostered by the student's creativity and motivation. Moreover, interdisciplinary learning led to an improvement in critical thinking skills.

AB  - The purpose of this interdisciplinary educational experience was to explore dynamic interaction between student dancers and graduate physical therapy students in a structured learning environment regarding prevention of dance injuries. A second aim was to determine the utility of a self-report outcome measure and the Functional Movement Screen (FMS). Dance injuries were evaluated at baseline, the end of the fall semester, and during the spring semester using the Self-Estimated Functional Inability Scale (SEFIS) and the FMS. A Pilates-based intervention was provided by an expert in dance during the fall semester; weekly interactions occurred between dance and physical therapy students with qualitative responses collected. Results showed the Pilates-based protocol was feasible for dancers' training and resulted in no injuries. The FMS showed little change over the 12-week intervention, but the SEFIS showed improvement throughout the three timed measures. The interaction and educational component showed positive experiences between students in both disciplines.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to better understand what helps and hinders the engagement of students in a project-based learning (PjBL) approach as the sole mode of teaching and learning for the entire first year of a Bachelor of Applied Management. Design/methodology/approach: This study takes an action research approach by investigating the perceptions of students of an interdisciplinary PjBL programme, and then taking action and responding to the students. Students were asked to share their experiences through a series of surveys spanning the first two years of the programme's introduction. Findings: Results indicate that there were significant challenges associated with the introduction of a PjBL programme. Students expressed both their positive and negative experiences in relation to working in groups, the way the programme and projects were designed and how the programme was communicated and integrated. The comments and suggestions students made led to a number of recommendations to further improve student engagement and learning outcomes. Research limitations/implications: The research was conducted at a state-funded tertiary provider located in New Zealand and may not necessarily be applied to other geographical regions or cultures. Practical implications: The results and recommendations have value for international education in business providers that are interested to introduce or further develop an interdisciplinary PjBL approach. Social implications: Further understanding of how students may be further engaged has value for a variety of different contexts where engagement and motivation feature as a desired outcome. Originality/value: This research study contributes to the understanding of how PjBL can be implemented to increase student motivation and engagement, and the insights provided practical suggestions for similar programmes of an interdisciplinary nature.

AB  - While the literature concerning doctoral students has looked at institutional setup and socialisation of students within higher education structures and across disciplinary boundaries, so far, little attention has been given to the socialisation of PhD students in the intersections between strategic interdisciplinary research projects and monodisciplinary institutional structures, which is the aim of this article. The study is based on interviews with 32 PhD students and principal investigators affiliated with five research projects in the Excellence Programme for Interdisciplinary Research at University of Copenhagen, Denmark. In analysing this empirical material, the analytical concept of the 'implied student' has worked as a sensitising concept, highlighting the expectations of PhD students, principal investigators, the institutions, the educational system, and the encounter between them. In the interviews, the PhD students emphasise the conundrum of having to fit into a confined disciplinary role, while simultaneously being expected to cross boundaries and deliver on predefined goals in the interdisciplinary research projects. The findings show that students cope with these expectations by limiting the scope for improvisation and experimentation; in other words, suppressing what MacLure points towards as education's 'other'. This calls for greater attention to be paid to the accumulation of expectations heaped upon such PhD students and how this affects the education of the future generation of researchers.

AB  - Tomorrow's agricultural workforce will face challenges in the form of complex problems that transcend disciplinary boundaries, including food security. Addressing these complex issues requires professionals to work within and across disciplines in ways that may not have been required in previous generations. Teaching using an interdisciplinary approach may be one approach to helping students develop the skills needed to address these problems. The purpose of this study was to explore student reactions to being taught with an interdisciplinary teaching method in a secondary agricultural education context. Overall, students reacted favorably to this interdisciplinary teaching approach. Several student characteristics contributed to their reactions. Multiple aspects of the facilitation process also impacted student reactions, as did specific features of the interdisciplinary approach. The interdisciplinary teaching approach produced several learning outcomes beyond the technical concepts, including gaining new perspectives and critical thinking. Recommendations for teachers and recommendations for additional research are provided.

AB  - James Madison University faculty team-teach an interdisciplinary mathematical modeling course for mathematics and biology students. We have used two different project-based approaches to emphasize the mathematical concepts taught in class, while also exposing students to new areas of mathematics not formally covered in class. The first method allows students to select projects based on their individual interests, which provided the class with an exposure to the breadth of applications of mathematical modeling to biology. The second method allows students to select projects that are focused around one common biological theme, which encouraged a remarkable cohesion among the whole class. These strategies could be extended to various applications-based mathematics courses. We present our observations and make recommendations for project-based courses using both methods.

AB  - This research compares the industry readiness, product development skill level, and overall knowledge gains of students taking an undergraduate research course (treatment) to those who did not (control). This 2-semester Applied Interdisciplinary Product Development (AIPD) course for sophomores brought together interdisciplinary teams of food science, nutrition, and packaging science students in a hands-on setting to create healthy food products for children, complete with retail packaging. A Subject Knowledge Assessment (SKA) was used to evaluate the mean percent difference value (MPDV) of food science, nutrition, packaging science, and general product development knowledge gained through the course. SKA results indicated that the MPDV were significantly different (a = 0.05) between the treatment and comparison groups in the overall score and in every subject area score except packaging science. Data from an Exit Questionnaire (EQ) was used for evaluation of attitudes pertaining to product development knowledge and skills, department engagement, and pedagogy. EQ results indicated that mean scores between the treatment and comparison groups were significantly different (a = 0.05) in 7 of the 9 statements on product development knowledge and skills, both statements pertaining to pedagogy, and the statement pertaining to department engagement. Overall, the research project was considered a successful intervention for educating sophomores at the University. Overall, the research project was considered a successful intervention for educating sophomores in the Food, Nutrition and Packaging Science department at Clemson University. The student-lead teams were held to a greater degree of accountability for their success in terms of education gleaned and value of experience gained as metric for the University and other IFT Accredited programs.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report on the Multidisciplinary Sustainability Education Project (MSEP) as a framework using sustainability-themed education modules to introduce students to the need for multidisciplinary approaches to solving twenty-first-century problems while retaining traditional course strengths and content. Design/methodology/approach: The MSEP uses sustainability-themed education models and a multidisciplinary approach to link courses across disciplines. Modules are identified by an overarching question with activities designed to address the overarching question from course-specific perspectives, resulting in students writing short technical reports summarizing their results. Students then read and evaluate technical reports from other classes, and complete a summary activity designed to connect perspectives from different disciplines. Findings: The multi-method assessment identified no loss or gain in discipline-specific learning; increased understanding about the characteristics of twenty-first-century problems, in particular those related to sustainability; and increased students' favorable perceptions of introductory calculus. Assessment of increased understanding of how different disciplines can work together to understand complex problems was difficult to measure due to limitations of a project-developed assessment instrument. Originality/value: This paper contributes to undergraduate sustainability education by describing a framework for connecting courses using sustainability-themed modules. By implementing an asynchronous manner where courses use materials from the project Web site and contribute materials to the Web site after implementing a module, it is easy to incorporate a module into existing courses, any educational institution's existing structure and across institutions. The framework's flexible design allows new courses from any discipline to connect to a module, allowing for multidisciplinary connections to grow over time.

AB  - Empathy and interdisciplinarity are both concepts that are current and relevant--across professions, in research, and in academia. This paper describes a large, interdisciplinary, project-based assignment, the Empathy Project, which allows students to delve into and increase comfort and skill with interdisciplinary thinking and collaborative learning, while improving the core college skills of written and oral communication, ethical and quantitative reasoning, and critical thinking. As I revised the assignment based on student feedback and results, I found that group conferences and time in class to work collaboratively were beneficial. Additionally, building increased scaffolding into the assignment, including greater student and group accountability, helped students develop and maintain self-direction. Students reported that the project was interesting and challenging and appreciated the opportunity to work with other students, to create something entirely different, and to be able to bring creativity into their projects.

AB  - College and university teaching involves almost universally and hegemonically the large group lecture format. This ubiquitous learning and teaching space has, however, long been criticized for the production of passive learning in which the "sage on the stage" transmits, and students receive passively. This article reports on and evaluates a longitudinal multidisciplinary controlled experiment in which students were exposed to imagery and non-redundant text-narrative to assess the presence or absence of active learning principles. The trial found that students exposed to MML experienced 40-80% greater levels of active learning practices over those exposed to narrative and text. Given the physiological (cognitive) nature of MML predictions, the implications of the research impact upon all disciplines where lectures are a means of knowledge-sharing practices in Higher Education.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the experiences of tertiary students learning oral presentation skills in a range of online and blended learning contexts across diverse disciplines. Design/methodology/approach: The research was designed as a "federation" of trials of diverse online oral communications assessment tasks (OOCATs). Tasks were set in ten courses offered across all five faculties at University of Newcastle, Australia. The authors collected and analysed data about students' experiences of tasks they completed through an anonymous online survey. Findings: Students' engagement with the task was extremely positive but also highly varied. This diversity of student experience can inform teaching, and in doing so, can support student equity. By understanding what students think hinders or facilitates their learning, and which students have these experiences, instructors are able to make adjustments to their teaching which address both real and perceived issues. Student experience in this study highlighted five very clear themes in relation to the student experience of undertaking online oral communications tasks which all benefit from nuanced responses by the instructor: relevance; capacity; technology; time; and support. Practical implications: Using well-designed OOCATs that diverge from more traditional written assessments can help students successfully engage with course content and develop oral communication skills. The student experience can be used to inform teaching by catering for different student learning styles and experience. Student centred approaches such as this allows instructors to reflect upon the assumptions they hold about their students and how they learn. This understanding can help inform adjustments to teaching approaches to support improved student experience of learning oral communications tasks. Originality/value: The importance of learning oral communication skills in tertiary education is widely acknowledged internationally, however, there is limited research on how to teach these skills online in a way that is student centred. This research makes a contribution toward addressing that gap.

AB  - Background: Individuals who have autism spectrum disorders (ASD) commonly experience social anxiety (SA). Disentangling SA symptoms from core ASD characteristics is complex, partly due to diagnostic overshadowing and co-occurring alexithymia. Causal and maintaining mechanisms for SA in ASD are underexplored, but it is feasible that there is an ASD specificity to the clinical presentation, with implications for the development of targeted treatments. Methods: Five focus groups were conducted with multidisciplinary professionals to investigate their perspectives about, and approaches to, working with individuals with ASD and SA. Data were analysed thematically. Results: Data analysis revealed two overarching themes: conceptualizing SA in ASD and service provision. Our results suggest that adaptations to service provision are pertinent, so as to accommodate inherent impairments that can mediate assessment and intervention. Conclusions: Future studies should establish how aspects of the care pathway can be improved for individuals with ASD and SA.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to contribute to the body of knowledge on processes by which students develop interdisciplinary understanding of contents, as well as to suggest technology-enhanced means for supporting them in these processes in the context of higher education. In doing so, we suggest a rethinking of three traditional practices that tend to characterise typical higher education instruction: (1) compartmentalisation of disciplines; (2) traditional pedagogy; and (3) traditional hierarchies based on levels of expertise. Our high-level conjecture was that meaningful dialogue with peers and experts supports both the deepening of ideas in one knowledge domain and the formation of connections between ideas from several domains, both of which are required for the development of interdisciplinary understanding. We developed the "Boundary Breaking for Interdisciplinary Learning" (BBIL) model, which harnesses technology to break boundaries between disciplines, learners and organisational levels of hierarchy. Findings indicate that 36 undergraduate students who participated in an interdisciplinary online course that implemented the BBIL model have significantly improved their interdisciplinary understanding of the course contents. This study illustrates how innovative use of available, free and low-cost technology can produce a "positive disruption" in higher education instruction.

AB  - Students entering health sciences programs may face challenges on their road to successful completion and possible entry to medical school in the area of preparedness in quantitative skills. At our institution, faculty analyzed evidence of these challenges including performance on the ACT Math Test, an in-house math placement test and quantitative tasks for physics and chemistry courses. The authors have used the ARCS (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, Satisfaction) conceptual framework developed by John M. Keller to examine a collaborative effort by our faculty from mathematics, chemistry and physics to design and deliver an interdisciplinary quantitative curriculum in the first 2 years. Preliminary results show high levels of attention, an improvement in student perceptions regarding the relevance of math to science, significant improvements to student confidence in their ability to learn and apply algebra, and reasons for student satisfaction. Faculty reflections indicate that this was a significant and rewarding effort.

AB  - Background: It is well established that valproate, and its valproic acid, sodium valproate, and valproate semisodium forms is a highly teratogenic drug and evidence suggests that use in pregnancy leads to physical birth defects in 10% of children born compared with a background rate of 2% to 3%. Congenital malformations associated with valproate are predominantly neural tube defects, clefting abnormalities, cardiovascular defects, genitourinary defects in males, and musculoskeletal defects. There is also increased risk of developmental delays and this includes delays in walking, talking, poor language skills, memory problems, and low intellectual ability in approximately 30 to 40% children born to mothers taking valproate. Furthermore, developing foetuses, if exposed to valproate in-utero, are at increased risk of autistic spectrum disorder (approximately three-fold), and also more likely to develop symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Subsequently valproate preparations prescribed to treat epilepsy are now contraindicated in pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment. In addition, valproate preparations prescribed for bipolar disorder have an absolute contraindication in pregnancy. Implications for practice: In order for valproate containing medicines to be prescribed for women of child bearing potential a risk acknowledgment form must be completed annually. For people without capacity to consent the form may be completed by a relative or other appropriate person. However, for people with intellectual disabilities, even with capacity, healthcare professionals need to ensure that the information on the form is accessible in order that they can understand it. They may not choose to give consent for a third party to complete the form on their behalf. Often intellectual disability nurses have a pivotal role, on behalf of the interdisciplinary team (IDT), in identifying women of child bearing potential who are currently prescribed valproate. Notwithstanding the IDT also has a role in engaging with patients during discussions to ensure they understand the conditions of prescribing. It is important that the IDT understand their role in patient engagement to facilitate shared decision making. Therefore, for women with intellectual disabilities with capacity, consent to treatment must be 'informed', and all risks will need to be communicated to the woman, exploring alternatives in order to comply with the Montgomery Judgement. Specialist intellectual disability nurses have a pivotal role in discussing appropriate contraceptive advice, and sign-posting women to local services. Conclusion: Valproate preparations prescribed to treat epilepsy are contraindicated in pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment; in addition, valproate preparations prescribed for bipolar disorder have an absolute contraindication in pregnancy. It is imperative that specialist intellectual disability services are able to advise the wider primary health care team on best practice. Additionally, those with prescribing responsibilities, and particularly specialist intellectual disability epilepsy nurses, along with the wider IDT, must be aware of these new regulations.

AB  - This article provides new insights into the consequences of university-industry collaboration for the content and conduct of academic research by analysing the Swedish research funding programme for the so-called 'materials consortia', in place between 1990 and 2000. Using secondary sources, the analysis highlights the causality in university-industry collaboration and the impact of such collaboration on the academic research environments involved. While the funding programme was clearly aimed at influencing the conduct of academic research, impacts are seen mostly in content. Also, collaborative activities with long-term positive outcomes grew organically rather than top-down, with mutual trust and recognition at the operational level of great importance. The policy implications include the realization that the durability of efforts, from funders as well as at the operational level, is key to achieving deeper added value in university-industry collaborations. The article contributes to a deepened and broadened understanding of the multidimensionality of university-industry collaborations and their effects on research.

AB  - Interdisciplinary teaching in STEM is often seen as a collaboration of different subjects teaching a common theme. This view undermines successful interdisciplinary approaches that can be deployed in a single class. Two examples of interdisciplinary math lessons, using pie charts and bar charts respectively, will be used to demonstrate how this can be realized. The potential for deeper integration among the subjects involved will also be analyzed.

AB  - Interdisciplinary science teaching is an issue in various countries. One example in Europe is Germany, especially regarding comprehensive schools. At the same time, German teacher education is primarily subject-specific. An examination of data on self-efficacy beliefs is helpful for understanding the qualifications of teachers for interdisciplinary science. Previous measurement instruments for teaching biology, chemistry, physics, and science lack a literature-based, theory-based, or curricular-valid measurement or a systematic obstacle to overcome. Thus, to meet these requirements, this research developed a draft for a new instrument to measure self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching (SElf-ST). As the theoretical base, the instrument operationalizes a model of pedagogical content knowledge for teaching science and adapts it to self-efficacy beliefs. In a cross-sectional study (N = 114 pre-service and trainee teachers), a ten-factor-solution for self-efficacy beliefs resulted from an exploratory factor analysis (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin-criterion = 0.858, [alpha] = 0.70-0.86). Nine factors are linked to the theoretical model. An additional tenth factor emerged: Teaching Ethically Relevant Issues. Nine factors show low and medium correlations with teaching experience. Eight factors show at least low correlations with self-rated content knowledge in no less than one of the three subjects. In general, science-specific factors show rather low or medium correlations, and generic factors (e.g., Applying Media, and Applying Methods of Evaluation) show low or no correlations. This result is in accordance with the context specificity of self-efficacy beliefs. These results meet most of the research expectations and provide initial indications of the concurrent, curricular, and divergent validity of the SElf-ST instrument. The paper argues for the development of a new, theory-based instrument to measure self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching.

AB  - In addition to the studies conducted regarding STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematic), which is a new approach in education and attract attention worldwide, researches also concentrated on the effectiveness of the partnership of this interdisciplinary approach with other disciplines. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of an education carried out with an E-STEM activity on the environmental awareness of students and their opinions on E-STEM disciplines. In the study, a holistic multi-state pattern was used among the case study patterns. Data obtained from semi-structured interview and activity plans were analyzed using content analysis. There were 18 participants in the study conducted at a centralized public school in a province located in western Black Sea Region of Turkey, who were at 6th grade in the 2017-2018 Academic Year. The E-STEM activity prepared within the scope of the application was implemented for a total of 6 course hours for three weeks. At the end of the study, in the light of the information obtained from the participants who provide opinions on STEM disciplines, environmental awareness sub-dimensions and E-STEM, it was determined that the application had positive effects. Participants made positive statements about the environment, especially on recycling, and the use of the different disciplines together. Based on this research, it was suggested that it would be useful to develop studies on E-STEM.

AB  - The insufficiency of teachers who teach integrative science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses is a major challenge facing science education today. Many teachers lack adequate expertise to combine disciplines and choose effective instructional approaches. This study examines how and to what extent teachers might succeed in teaching an innovative STEM program about a sound, waves and communication systems course in an information and communication technology-based environment. This research adopted a qualitative method to understand better the experience of three teachers who taught the course for the first time. Data collection tools included documenting mentoring meetings, observing in the classrooms and interviewing the teachers. The data were transcribed and analyzed using the content analysis method. The findings show that the teachers had only partial knowledge and, initially, even misconceptions about sound. However, their technological pedagogic content knowledge improved significantly due to the researcher's gradual but continual guidance. Four major factors contributed to the teachers' professional development: (a) dealing with innovative contents, (b) using different (advanced) teaching methods, (c) predesigning the instructional course materials and (d) offering the researcher-mentor's developmental supervision.

AB  - Studying language evolution has become resurgent in modern scientific research. In this revival field, approaches from a number of disciplines other than linguistics, including   (paleo)anthropology and archaeology, animal behaviors, genetics, neuroscience, computer simulation, and psychological experimentation, have been adopted, and a wide scope of topics have been examined in one way or another, covering not only world languages, but also human behaviors, brains and cultural products, as well as nonhuman primates and other species remote to humans. In this paper, together with a survey of recent findings based on these many approaches, we evaluate how this multidisciplinary perspective yields important insights into a comprehensive understanding of language, its evolution, and human cognition.

AB  - New curricular orientations in the secondary schools of many Western countries invite teachers of STEM school subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) to integrate these school subjects (Czerniak, 2008). In Quebec, such interdisciplinarity is not a mere recommendation, but an official component of the curriculum (a prescription). Teachers are expected to integrate the school subjects composing the STEM subjects, and to integrate this area with other school subjects. While this interdisciplinary orientation is laudable, it is important to discover how teachers whose training is disciplinary understand this mandated interdisciplinarity and apply it in their teaching practices. Based on a survey of 245 secondary school teachers, this study shows that the interdisciplinarity practiced and described by these teachers is a superficial one and is based on links that do not enable an integration of the contributions of the subjects concerned in order to solve complex problems or achieve unified knowledge (Klein, 1985, 1990; Lenoir & Klein, 2010). These links mainly involve theme-based approaches, the contextualization of subject knowledge (relationship with life outside the school), or the mobilization, in a given school subject, of prior learning acquired in another school subject. These means of understanding and implementing interdisciplinarity can be attributed to teacher education and to the organizational context and the curricular structure of the schools. This article suggests recommendations to help overcome obstacles to understanding and implementing full interdisciplinarity as highlighted by the study in question. Moreover, it also suggests that comparative studies, along with the sharing of training experiences among teachers in different countries, might shed important light on this issue. These comparative studies would make it possible to identify the best ways to train teachers to be able to implement more-than-merely­- superficial interdisciplinary practices in their classrooms. Moreover, the analytical framework and methodology used herein, as well as the results obtained, are not limited to STEM subjects but also apply to all other school subjects. Therefore, such studies as the study we report on here should be of interest to all actors (practitioners and researchers alike) concerned with interdisciplinarity in school programs at any level anywhere in the world.

AB  - Although interdisciplinary approaches to education are found throughout the West, interdisciplinarity is not everywhere conceived and implemented the same way. Adopting a socio-historical perspective, this article presents two conceptions of interdisciplinarity in primary and middle school education (though the conceptions are apparent at other levels, also), one Anglo-Saxon and American, based on the notion of curriculum, the other French and European, based on the notion of didactics. The Anglo-Saxon and American conception promotes a functional, pragmatic and utilitarian reading of interdisciplinarity that translates, in education, into a greater focus on pedagogical methods in order to promote learning processes and to address societal problems, questions, and phenomena related to the real world. The Francophone European conception for its part puts greater emphasis on the question of epistemology, on the theoretical question of the meaning of interrelationships between disciplines, and hence on the acquisition of disciplinary knowledge. To conclude, we will bring attention to the greater complementarity observed between these two approaches in education today, in the context of globalization, universalization (on economic, social, cultural, and political levels), and internationalization of exchanges. Indeed, these two approaches effectively combine the operational modes of interdisciplinary work (the "how") with the aims pursued (the ''why") and the cognitive contents (the ''what").

AB  - In light of the growing agreement on the critical impact that materials can have on teaching and learning, classroom-based research on materials use in natural educational contexts has become increasingly urgent. This study aims to explore language teachers' use of instructional materials in classroom settings. Drawing on the analysis of materials, interviews, and lesson observations from cases of three Chinese English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers and their six students, this study identified six interactive processes of materials use, based on which teachers' pedagogical reasoning that enabled each process of materials use was unpacked. Through the theoretical lens of Keller and Keller's anthropology of knowledge and Wartofsky's categorization of artifacts, this article unraveled the relationship between teacher knowledge and practice in materials use and disentangled the multilayered roles of curriculum materials. The findings not only contribute to the conceptualization of materials use in language education but also suggest effective ways of enhancing the inservice professional development through materials use and development in natural educational contexts.

AB  - This article presents a series of theater games with clear connections to conducting and rehearsing music ensembles, explaining both how to play them and how young conductors will benefit from the experience. These games are published in Viola Spolin's seminal text Improvisation for the Theater, which presents a series of exercises that foster communication, creativity, immediacy, and spontaneity. Many games also focus on creating and communicating character through physical movement and posture, awareness of the body in space, and manipulation of "space objects," which are imaginary props made real in the mind of the observer through understanding of shared human experiences. Theater games are effectively experienced in short periods of time, intended for players of all ability and experience levels, and encourage immediate emotive communication, making them highly effective for young conductors and easily incorporated into undergraduate and graduate conducting classes.

AB  - This article reports on an interdisciplinary project that conducted a series of systematic reviews of academic research about the use of pornography and sexual health. Academics from a variety of disciplines were involved; half of the team had a background in humanities and the other half a background in psychology. While working closely together, they realized that they disagreed on many different matters, such as how to ask questions, how to use definitions, what count as data, what counts as a good outcome in research, how to structure an academic article, and how to use other academics' work. This article reports on the team members' use of reflective practice to analyze their responses to these disagreements and suggests that such disagreements can be seen as positive and productive in interdisciplinary research as they may facilitate collaboration among those representing different disciplines.

AB  - In a world of burgeoning societal issues, future scientists must be equipped to work interdisciplinarily to address real-world problems. To train undergraduate students toward this end, practitioners must also have quality assessment tools to measure students' ability to think within an interdisciplinary system. There is, however, a dearth of instruments that accurately measure this competency. Using a theoretically and empirically based model, we developed an instrument, the Interdisciplinary Science Rubric (IDSR), to measure undergraduate students' interdisciplinary science thinking. An essay assignment was administered to 102 students across five courses at three different institutions. Students' work was scored with the newly developed rubric. Evidence of construct validity was established through novice and expert response processes via semistructured, think-aloud interviews with 29 students and four instructors to ensure the constructs and criteria within the instrument were operating as intended. Interrater reliability of essay scores was collected with the instructors of record ([kappa] = 0.67). An expert panel of discipline-based education researchers (n = 11) were consulted to further refine the scoring metric of the rubric. Results indicate that the IDSR produces valid data to measure undergraduate students' ability to think interdisciplinarily in science.

AB  - One often overlooked challenge of undergraduate research (UR) is access to information. Growing student diversity, including first-generation students, and increasing calls for a better-trained workforce suggest that higher education should be providing more support for UR. The authors propose that higher education needs cost-effective, impactful ways to advance UR initiatives. At Towson University, an interdisciplinary Undergraduate Research Club was created to foster a culture of peer-mentored undergraduate research. The authors review the creation of this club; explain goals, activities, and structure; and provide supporting data for activities, including the fund-raising activity Research Grams. This model offers a valuable, replicable, low-cost tool to advance accessible, student-centered undergraduate research initiatives.

AB  - In our technology driven world today, it is extremely important to increase the science literacy of our non-science majors. At Stockton University, this goal is attempted to be accomplished through our General Studies courses. This paper describes a lab-based course in the General Studies curriculum, 'The Science of Ice Cream'. At Stockton University, General Studies courses are interdisciplinary courses, designed for all students in four areas of study: general arts and humanities (GAH), general interdisciplinary skills and topics (GEN), general integration and synthesis (GIS), general natural sciences and mathematics (GNM), and general social and behavioral sciences (GSS). The GNM courses are designed to meet four main goals: to examine the broad concerns of science, to explore the nature of scientific process and practice, to provide students with an understanding of mathematics and the natural sciences, to acquire appreciation for how scientific knowledge of the physical and natural world is attained and evaluated. The topic of ice cream was chosen because it provides a rich environment, full of practical applications of thermodynamics and fluid dynamics, as well as general concepts in physics, biology, food science, and chemistry. Since this course is designed for both science and non-science majors, it provides a platform to discuss applications of concepts learned in introductory physics. It is sometimes difficult to get non-science majors excited about science, but the laboratory exercises, where the students use the concepts learned in lecture to make ice cream, provide the students with interesting and approachable examples of the physical concepts.

AB  - We propose that linguists and political scientists develop an interdisciplinary and ethical research strategy for studying the relationships between language endangerment and political conflict. A leading cause of language endangerment is political violence driven by outside actors who expropriate land, extract resources, and displace individuals, many of whom reside in communities that speak endangered languages. Most language documentation projects, however, do not address the political landscape that causes the conflict, whether it is history, language policy, conflict over natural resources and ethno-religious identities, or absent and coopted governmental institutions experienced by the communities in question. At the same time, political scientists have developed models to explain and predict the political conflict and violence that threaten entire communities and can also explain why indigenous communities are particularly at risk of being harmed by this type of violence. We suggest that an interdisciplinary strategy that combines some of the large N data analysis strengths of political science with the qualitative, community-driven research of linguists can best help scholars understand the determinants of language loss; conduct such research ethically, and help utilize the fruits of this research to support and empower endangered language communities.

AB  - Existing tensions within and between the discourses permeating doctoral candidature are being exacerbated by those of interdisciplinarity and industry collaboration. Drawing on the author's experience as a doctoral candidate within a cooperative research centre, this article interrogates the conflicting and challenging pressures placed on candidates and their supervisors in interdisciplinary and industry collaborative environments in the humanities, arts and social sciences. The article questions the common assumption that "more (disciplines) is better" to address complex social, economic and environmental problems. It highlights the ways in which interdisciplinary and industry-led projects can inadvertently silo the doctoral candidate and the problem to be "solved" within dominant ontological, epistemological and political frameworks. The article calls on supervisors and candidates to adopt the role of negotiators and translators in complex research relationships. It concludes that in some cases, discipline-specific, independent research may provide the novel and innovative answers required to address "real-world" problems.

AB  - With the current rise of China as a political, cultural, and economic superpower, Chinese as a foreign and second language has gained popularity worldwide. Finland is also responding to this global wave, as is reflected by the increasing number of Chinese courses in formal and informal settings in the Nordic country. Yet not all actors involved in the promotion of Chinese seem to experience instruction in the language in the same way. This study investigates how Chinese teachers of the Chinese language, who represent the majority of the "workforce" for instruction in this language in Finland, perceive Chinese language education and their role in it. We argue that there is a need for a paradigm shift in evaluating the teachers' experiences. Specifically, we support a move away from perspectives that see culture as static and identity as singular. Using the "analysis of multivoicedness," which was developed from dialogism (Aveling, Gillespie, & Cornish, 2014), the authors of this article identify a number of positions assumed/taken up by the teachers and others in their discourses. Finally, we propose a critical intercultural approach to Chinese teacher education or professional development based on transdisciplinarity, which relies on problem-solving that recognizes an important triad: e"ducational contexts--teachers' experiences--society" (McGregor & Volckmann, 2011).

AB  - Success in undergraduate biology courses relies upon a firm grounding in chemical principles. We sought to raise students' awareness of the connection between these two disciplines and to improve their understanding of each by carrying out a pilot project that integrated the curricula of Principles of Chemistry II (CHEM1212K) and Principles of Biology I (BIOL1107K) during the Fall 2016 semester. The study involved two course pairs: one section of each course delivered in the traditional non-integrated manner and a second pair of sections that were integrated across the chemistry and biology disciplines in both the scope and sequence of the content delivery. Both integrated and non-integrated sections were taught by the same instructors, who have expertise in both chemistry and biology to ensure a full understanding of both courses' content. Attitudinal surveys administered at the beginning and end of the semester showed that students in the integrated BIOL/CHEM section of our pilot study appreciated the delivery of an integrated curriculum and improved their awareness of the connections between the two disciplines. End-of-course assessments of topic mastery demonstrated improvements in the integrated students' capacity to understand and apply both biology and chemistry topics compared to students in the non-integrated sections.

AB  - Nowadays, the rapid spread of the interdisciplinary approach contributes to the development of disciplines and scientific developments in many ways. Therefore, how the interdisciplinary approach is addressed in the studies carried out is important in terms of guiding other studies. For this purpose, an attempt to determine how 155 doctorate theses which were written in science departments at a university located in Turkey's south between 2010-2016 addressed the study discipline, subject of study and interdisciplinary approach process was made in this study. Furthermore, the opinions of instructors working in these departments on the interdisciplinary approach were also examined. As a result of the study, it was seen that 140 theses were written with the disciplinary approach, 15 theses were written with the interdisciplinary approach, and they were also associated with economics, sociology, psychology and geography among social science disciplines. The facts that the concept of interdisciplinary is not exactly known and that the necessary conditions for studying have not been provided, the lack of time, the presence of gaps in disciplines and failure to ensure the adequate cooperation are important reasons for the limited number of studies carried out with the interdisciplinary approach. Therefore, it is important to promote interdisciplinary studies and to provide suitable conditions for studying.

AB  - Despite its popularity in education studies literature, interdisciplinary science education is mostly considered outside the multitude of social forces that drive education reform. This has contributed to a mythologizing of interdisciplinary science education and lead to assumptions about the necessity of its intervention into science education practice. This research constructs a critical analysis of interdisciplinary science education by exploring a philosophical understanding of the relations between scientific disciplines, investigating discourse about interdisciplinarity in science education policy literature, and provides socioeconomic context for this reform movement. In particular, Louis Althusser's theory of ideology as material force, his conception of the spontaneous philosophy of scientists, and his theses on the ideological nature of interdisciplinary science are foundational to this critique. Althusser's contributions allow for critical reflection on interdisciplinarity and the effects of promoting it throughout scientific enterprise. Viewing interdisciplinary science education through this critical lens allows for demarcating the ideological narratives of reformist discourse from the intended outcomes of reform. This investigation elucidates the intervention of interdisciplinarity as an ideological force governing the reproduction of scientific labor, with intended downstream socioeconomic effects, such as shifting science labor from the public sector to private industry to accommodate for austerity. The conclusions of this analysis advocate for historical materialist methodologies in science education research and critical education studies, while emphasizing the role of ideology in socioeconomic reproduction.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining importance in education owing to its rapid development. This study addresses the importance of interdisciplinary education between technology and the humanities. The use of films as a teaching resource is suitable for interdisciplinary education because films represent creative forecasts and predictions on future human society, helping the public realize what could occur in the future. By utilizing films in instruction, students can be trained to understand the three key functions of IoT and acquire the ability to develop creative applications of IoT. An IoT teaching model using the films "Minority Report" (2002), "Big Hero 6" (2014), "Iron Man 3" (2013), "Her" (2013), and "Transcendence" (2014), all of which depict various applications of IoT that could be helpful in the teaching of the functions and concepts of IoT, is suggested; an interdisciplinary class is carried out for 15 weeks following the model. The effectiveness of the class is measured using quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis, and reflection journals. The findings show that students developed interdisciplinary capacity through education using films.

AB  - This article presents a model for a short-term interdisciplinary study abroad program designed specifically to foster intercultural competence. It provides a description of a one-month interdisciplinary General Education Summer Abroad Program in Valencia, Spain, that attempts to sensitize students to cultural differences, to engage students to a higher degree in historical inquiry, and to develop Spanish language skills by weaving together three General Education requirements (history, intermediate Spanish, and an English advanced writing seminar) in an immersion setting. It also presents data demonstrating that participants showed improvement in their Spanish language-speaking abilities and exhibited high levels of cognitive and affective engagement. The data also suggest that participants generally performed favorably in comparison to student cohorts who completed similar General Education courses on-campus, especially in terms of the engagement levels of students with grade point averages <3.0 on a 4-point scale. The article also emphasizes that one cannot assume that cultural immersion will, on its own, lead to intercultural competence; it describes how this program fosters intercultural transformation and Spanish language skills growth among students through specific activities that require students to interact with Spaniards in a variety of contexts. It concludes with a discussion of further possibilities for research regarding the potential role of interdisciplinary study and university core curriculum courses in the development of intercultural competence.

AB  - Introduction: Despite the high prevalence of mental health issues for young people with intellectual disability (ID), young people with ID can struggle to receive the mental health support they need. The aim of this study was to examine a new community-based, clinical mental health service for young people (12-25 years) with co-occurring ID and mental illness, and to explore the outcomes for young people and experiences of families who received service from the new program. Methods: Two studies were conducted using qualitative and quantitative research methods. First, using the Health of the Nations Outcome Scales (HoNOS), a quantitative longitudinal study was conducted to measure any changes in young people's behavioral and social issues, mental health, and levels of impairment, from the being accepted to the service till the completion of care (n = 23). A second study involved qualitative interviews with parents/carers who attended the service (n = 10) that were analyzed to look for emerging themes in parents'/carers' experience of the service. Results: Results of study 1 indicated that young people's behavioral issues and social problems decreased from the time of admission to their completion of carer. Further, results of Study 2 revealed that parents/carers considered the mental health and behavior of their child had improved from being in the program. Parents also valued the person-centered, multidisciplinary, co-ordinated approach of the service, and viewed the new program as an improvement on previous services they had experienced. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary support for the efficacy of the new program and suggests future specialist dual disability services may look to a family-focused, multidisciplinary approach that includes assessment, treatment, and management as an effective treatment model.

AB  - Games are a proven tool for learning at all ages and in many contexts. They increase the attractiveness of learning processes through arousing interest and enhancing motivation, and aid with the development of social skills. Educational games provide teachers with different approaches to teaching. 'The Game of the Sea' is an interdisciplinary board game, specifically designed to teach its players about the marine environment, regardless of their age. Through its 68 sections, coloured according to particular topics and organised as a fish shape, players encounter a wide range of questions and activities. Through playing this game, players acquire a broad knowledge of science, the marine environment and its importance, and literature. The game uses an interdisciplinary approach with question cards on a variety of topics (including maths, physics, biology, chemistry, art, etc.). A total of 222 players (111 children, aged 11-15, and 111 adults, aged 18-72) tested the game. These players were enrolled in different formal and non-formal educational contexts and had different educational backgrounds. For a qualitative analysis of game sessions (participant observation), researchers acted as game moderators and, while doing so, made subtle observations of players playing the game. On top of this, the value of the game, as a didactic tool, was evaluated with a test that players took before and after the game. After playing the game, knowledge of the marine environment, increased in both children and adults, with a slightly higher increase in children. Therefore, 'The Game of the Sea' is suitable for teaching all ages about the marine environment. Further, this game can impart to its players the importance of the marine environment and the importance of protecting this environment.

AB  - This article examines the emerging literature on the need for a synergy between neuroscience and educational sciences, identifying several differences in approach and methods that hinder the connecting processes between these two disciplines. From this review a transdisciplinary framework is presented which is based on the systemic and lifelong property of plasticity. The notion of plasticity is a framing concept that enables to connect disciplines because it illuminates the understanding of the learning processes. The new framework for the understanding and research in neuro-education is based on a systemic and functional architecture organised in three dimensions of plasticity (autonomy--vulnerability--resilience) and at least three systemic levels (genes, experience and the nervous system). We conclude that the concept of plasticity contributes to enlarging our understanding of the educational diversity of learners in their experiential contexts, combined with special attention to human agency and the capacity to making choices and effect changes.

AB  - ePortfolio integrates technology with a student's academic course work and have increasingly become an integral part of higher education curriculum. They allow students to showcase their academic work in a fresh way on a digital platform. Traditionally, however, ePortfolio is implemented from a single discipline approach. This project aimed to combine two similar courses within a learning community setting where students compiled their course work onto their individual ePortfolios. By engaging in a multi-disciplinary approach, students reported a better understanding of the other discipline and felt a better sense of academic preparation (i.e. real life experience) for graduation and transfer to four-year colleges.

AB  - Glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) is the most widely used herbicide on earth. A simple assay to quantify glyphosate concentrations in environmental samples was developed as part of an interdisciplinary effort linking introductory laboratory courses in chemistry, biology, and microbiology. In this 3 h laboratory experiment, students used UV-vis spectroscopy to quantify glyphosate in prepared unknowns and supernatants from glyphosate-treated soil samples. Regression analysis indicated that the assay is linear up to 20.0 ppm, making it particularly useful for detection of low levels of glyphosate in environmental samples. The assay can be used to quantify the activity of glyphosate-degrading soil microorganisms by comparing glyphosate levels between autoclaved and nonautoclaved soil slurries.

AB  - Social media permeates the daily lives of millennials, as they use it constantly for a variety of reasons. A significant contributing factor is the availability of social media through smartphones and mobile apps. This kind of immersive and complex media environment calls for a literacy pedagogy that prepares students to understand, engage with, and adapt to social media that are inevitably going to remain a part of their lives. Research into digital literacy/literacies has sought to address the development of tools and methods to aid college students in becoming more situated and adept digital citizens. This article extends the conceptualization and application of digital media literacy through the inclusion of a critical, multimodal, and interdisciplinary pedagogical approach. The paper illustrates that critical digital literacy drawing upon multimodal and interdisciplinary analysis is imperative in preparing students to manage the predominance of social media in their lives.

AB  - This article places William Newell's work on interdisciplinary studies (IDS) within the larger landscape of definitions, theories, and practices of interdisciplinarity. It begins by benchmarking three of his major contributions to the field of interdisciplinary studies read in the context of expanding literature on related topics: specifically his efforts to make integration the foundation of process-based best practices, to establish a theoretical framework grounded in complexity, and to professionalize the field of IDS. It then examines two challenges to AIS today that Newell alerted members to in a 2013 reflection on the state of the field -- transdisciplinarity and team science -- followed by added insights from two areas -- policy sciences and interprofessionalism. The article closes by reflecting on current conflicting priorities, renewed debate on the relationship of disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity, and efforts to explore intersections of multiple organizations vested in inter- and transdisciplinarity today.

AB  - A co-lab in Cyborg Arts was conducted at Parsons/New School University, a leading design school in New York City, over the course of sixteen weeks. This paper discusses the use of Bruno Latour's Actor Network Theory (ANT) (Latour, 2007) in facilitating creative collaboration solutions. Previously, an open call had been placed in targeted venues such as Art and Education, as well as a number of technology user groups in the New York City area to solicit ideas and participants. With the assistance of the Cyborg Foundation three teams were chosen to build prototypes of a new cyborg sense: Team Glass, Team Radiation, and Team Haptics. Team Glass strove to make a cyborg sense detecting the rhythm of changes in the sun's solar flares. Team Radiation made a sense that distinguished between, and alerted the user to different types of organic and inorganic radiation in the environment. Team Haptics used the team leader's own body as a site environment to correct a medical problem by developing a new cyborg sense. Students from Parsons chose which team to work with. Experts and guests either visited the co-lab in person, or used Skype to converse with the participants throughout the course of the semester. Registered Parsons students stayed committed to the lab in order to receive a grade. Other participants had various reasons to remain involved, such as learning new skills, seeing their ideas realized, or stepping outside of their core discipline. The major conduits of communication for the teams outside of lab time were the web-based Slack application that logged a history of their thoughts and interactions, as well as a private student Tumblr to document their progress. This paper discusses how an ANT analysis of practice based learning led to incremental breakthroughs such as starting, stopping, abandoning, and resuming developing these sensing techniques. This resulted in proof of concept artworks, and showcased new aspects of cyborg art.

AB  - Assignment design provides a potential niche for librarians to fill in improving research assignments and in providing opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration on teaching, but this can be difficult work to claim as librarians. In the 2016-2017 academic year, a team of three librarians at Utah State University, a mid-size research university, piloted an assignment design workshop for faculty. Based on a model developed by the National Institute for Learning Outcomes Assessment (NILOA), our workshop's core component was a structured, librarian-facilitated small group discussion among three to four faculty members from a range of academic departments. Interdisciplinary conversation about teaching research skills thrived in these discussions (called "charrettes"), with librarians uniquely positioned to encourage knowledge sharing in service of student learning and success. This article presents three iterations of our workshops as a case study in information literacy intervention outside traditional classroom instruction sessions, extending and redefining the role of the academic librarian as a partner in teaching and learning.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze bullying behaviors from an interdisciplinary perspective: legal, psychological and pedagogical. From a legal point of view, the Romanian legislative framework on respect for children's rights has undergone a number of changes in recent years with the accession of Romania to the European Union in 2007. International legislation on respect for children's rights requires countries that have ratified these provisions to ensure that they are respected and to take measures to ensure that they are not prejudiced. Aggressiveness in students is a predictor of antisocial behaviors in adolescence and adulthood. The psychological perspective of bullying refers to the consequences of this type of behavior. Students involved in aggression are at increased risk of developing a range of psychosomatic symptoms, involvement in delinquency, alcohol and drug abuse, absenteeism. The consequences of these behaviors on the victims are associated with anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. Through the pedagogical approach to bullying, we focus on the role of teachers in addressing the issue of aggressive behavior in students. The perceived gravity and teacher's response to bullies and victims of bullying are important indicators to be taken into account in making a successful intervention.

AB  - This article theorises the process of adapting my research on intercultural communication for public performance in collaboration with a theatre company. I frame the collaboration as taking place within a hospitable institutional space, and then consider what it means to enact hospitality interpersonally, given Derrida's understanding that the condition of its possibility is at the same time the condition of its impossibility. I suggest that the enactment of hospitality can be understood through the application of an intercultural theoretical framework based on Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of outsideness, and that this framework can be applied to both the collaboration with the theatre company and to the purposes of public engagement with research. I conclude with a consideration of the relationship between hospitality and hope, and a call to move towards a 'condition of possibility' for working as academics, for public engagement, and for living.

AB  - Two post-secondary instructors and one K-12 Learning Commons teacher describe how interdisciplinary units of study were designed by undergraduate pre-service teachers and by in-service teachers in a junior high school. The interdisciplinary units focused on two or more disciplines and aimed to engage student learners in understanding a complex issue. Using a collaborative action research approach and through ongoing dialogue, the three educators worked together throughout the year to improve processes for supporting teachers in designing interdisciplinary units of study. Findings suggest teachers experience common challenges when working on interdisciplinary design teams regardless of the extent of their teaching experiences.
