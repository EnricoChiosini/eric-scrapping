AB  - This article is inspired by a recent call for the establishment of "alliances for inter- and transdisciplinarity" issued by Julie Thompson Klein (2021) in this journal. Previously, in 2016, "Issues in Interdisciplinary Studies" published a Special Section devoted to Latin American experiences in interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity. The concept of "regionalism" was elaborated as a means to orient collaborative practices based on mutual learning and cooperation. Using this concept as an inspiration, this article explores the works of a network of Latin American researchers and practitioners called "Nodo de Estudios sobre Interdisciplina y Transdisciplina" (Nodo ESIT). The aim of this collective, created in 2018, is to promote, connect, and strengthen inter- and transdisciplinary teaching and research in different countries within the region. The Nodo ESIT offers a shared virtual space for exchange and collaboration among societal and scientific actors from different fields (i.e., academia, social organizations, decision makers, and the private sector). It represents seven countries in Latin America, and integrates participants from some European countries, who are working in the region. Drawing from the concept of regionalism and expanding Klein's (2021) description of the similarities and differences among five international organizations, we elaborate on our network's opportunities and the challenges it has faced in the Latin American context. Two questions guide this work: (1) How can inter- and transdisciplinarity be supported and enhanced in marginalized contexts? and (2) What are the best practices already implemented to foster inter- and transdisciplinarity in Latin America? We present the Nodo ESIT as an exemplary case of regionalism for inter- and transdisciplinarity in Latin America. We conclude by identifying three lessons learned and strengths achieved from this initiative thanks to a special constellation of actors, contexts, and actions.

AB  - For some professionally, vocationally, or technically oriented careers, curricula delivered in higher education establishments may focus on teaching material related to a single discipline. By contrast, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary teaching(MITT) results in improved affective and cognitive learning and critical thinking, offering learners/students the opportunity to obtain a broad general knowledge base. Chemistry is a discipline that sits at the interface of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine(STEMM) subjects (and those aligned with or informed by STEMM subjects). This article discusses the significant potential of inclusion of chemistry in MITT activities in higher education and the real-world importance in personal, organizational, national, and global contexts. It outlines the development and implementation challenges attributed to legacy higher education infrastructures (that call for creative visionary leadership with strong and supportive management and administrative functions), and curriculum design that ensures inclusivity and collaboration and is pitched and balanced appropriately. It concludes with future possibilities, notably highlighting that chemistry, as a discipline, underpins industries that have multibillion dollar turnovers and employ millions of people across the world.

AB  - Prompted by William Newell's 2013 call for the Association of Interdisciplinary Studies (AIS) to consider whether to rethink its mission in light of other organizations' interests, this article begins by reflecting on similarities and differences among five of the founding organizations of a recently formed Global Alliance for Inter- and Transdisciplinarity. In chronological order of their own founding dates they are AIS, the Network of Transdisciplinary Research, the Integration and Implementation Sciences network, the International Network for the Science of Team Science, and the Center for Interdisciplinarity at Michigan State University. Descriptions of the five in Part I account for their emergence, communication venues, keywords of representation, website features, and prominent outputs. Given the centrality of integration in both inter- and trans-disciplinarity, it also describes their stances on this prominent topic. Part II reflects on implications of the current heterogeneity of the core concepts, focusing initially on generalizations including distinctions between Zurich and Nicolescuian approaches to transdisciplinarity followed by the premise of distinct Franco and U.S. traditions of the field of nanomedicine. It then draws further insights from case studies of institutionalizing interdisciplinarity across Europe, Russia and the South Caucuses, Africa, Latin and North America, Australia, and Asia. After commenting on signs of change in AIS, discussion turns to historical precedents for prioritizing problem solving, followed by future horizons for both inter- and trans-disciplinarity with emphasis on implications of their heterogeneity and overlaps with other prominent concepts such as Convergence and Mode 2 Knowledge Production. The closing section presents final reflections for answering Newell's challenge for AIS members to consider expanding its definition of interdisciplinary studies and conception of integrative process in light of other organizations' interests.

AB  - Employers increasingly desire new graduates to work across boundaries, in teams, and with developed soft skills, especially in public affairs. Likewise, students increasingly seek academic experiences for learning, practicing, and honing transferable, competency-based skills. This suggests instructors should explore alternative pedagogy engaging problem definition and transdisciplinary teamwork. We describe institutional drivers and barriers to collaborative transdisciplinarity in undergraduate teaching and the structure and processes involved in developing a co-taught studio-based capstone involving public affairs students and varied other unrelated majors. We describe the structure through which the "SuperStudio" (1) combines topic concentrations with a shared policy context allowing students to apply disciplinary knowledge to define transdisciplinary problems and (2) fosters collaborative teaching and strategic exploration of overarching issues like problem framing, equity, and effective communication. We then offer lessons learned regarding the drivers and barriers to such efforts, and advice from institutional decision-makers on designing such courses at other institutions.

AB  - This paper documents a case study examining collaborative transdisciplinary (TD) and interdisciplinary (ID) graduate programmes at the University of British Columbia (a large, public, research-intensive university in Canada) -- serving as a model for other universities globally. TD and ID programmes in higher education can ultimately create a new generation of researchers who are capable of contending with complex problems by equipping them with a broad range of research competencies and expertise. This study used open-ended surveys and semi-structured focus groups and interviews to understand how students, faculty members, and programme coordinators experienced these programmes, focusing on specific competencies (e.g. values, knowledge, interpersonal skills). We then highlighted how programmes may be preparing students to engage in collaborative applied research (i.e., TD and ID) in real-world contexts. Our findings suggest that "breadth" programmes exposed students to a wide range of disciplinary perspectives, while "depth" programmes focused on a specific research problem in fewer disciplines. TD and ID co-supervision and thesis committee membership emerged as rich avenues for students to receive mentorship from faculty members. Lastly, respondents wanted more applied research and opportunities to connect with potential employers outside academia.

AB  - Based on the observation that the Bologna process and inter-university competition pave the way for new study programs that often combine or transcend traditional academic disciplines, this paper investigates the position that the "Framework for qualifications of the European Higher Education Area" (QF EHEA) takes in relation to disciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary modes of organizing higher education and research. A framework for understanding and identifying disciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches is developed and applied in an analysis of the QF EHEA document. It is concluded that the document reflects ideas characteristic of transdisciplinary approaches to knowledge production and higher education.

AB  - Nowadays, research in second language acquisition (SLA) is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary while many technical frontiers and research hotspots have emerged. Many studies focus on interdisciplinary topics, but few in-depth studies have been conducted on interdisciplinarity. This study examined the interdisciplinarity of SLA and the interdisciplinary development process using a bibliometrics approach. The study has found that the SLA discipline has played roles as both the provider and recipient of knowledge in the development of interdisciplines. In the first case, SLA theories and methods flow into the research areas of "life sciences" and "technology" to form interdisciplinary studies with brain research, neurology, cognition, computer technology, and engineering, making SLA a provider of knowledge In the second case, SLA research receives knowledge from areas of arts and humanities and social sciences as well as from interdisciplinary studies within its own discipline, making SLA a receiver of knowledge. The new insights into the interdisciplinarity of SLA provided in this study are helpful for our deeper understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of the SLA discipline.

AB  - Among strategies that campus leaders and research administrators employ to spur interdisciplinary research in U.S. higher education, one of the costliest--and increasingly popular--is designated interdisciplinary research spaces and buildings. Yet while interdisciplinary research buildings, often focused on the sciences, stand as significant investments and concrete manifestations of institutional interdisciplinary commitment, empirical research thus far has shed little light on who leads them, the challenges these leaders face, and buildings' broader aims and effectiveness. Using interviews with 26 leaders of and documents related to interdisciplinary research buildings at ten U.S. higher education R1 institutions, this qualitative multi-site case study begins to fill this gap. In probing key issues attending interdisciplinary buildings as a growing tool for research administration and development, this study describes various types of interdisciplinary building leaders; details novel challenges, lessons learned and suggested leadership practices; and explores how leaders already do (and future scholarship might) conceptualize and gauge building effectiveness. In doing so, this work provides novel and timely contributions to the current practice of leading interdisciplinary research efforts and grounds future directions for research.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, many youth felt disconnected from on-the-ground engagement with their peers, their communities, and the wider society. School closures also impeded progress in some students' abilities to write, speak, and express themselves through various media. A team of interdisciplinary and intergenerational faculty and undergraduate students from Merrimack College in Massachusetts sought to investigate and redress these challenges by building young people's interest in engaged citizenship along with their writing, speaking, and team-building skills through a civic engagement program with middle school students, facilitated in collaboration with the local YMCA. In designing and delivering the program, we took an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach that centers the voices of youth in both research and action. Drawing on our team members' disciplines of biology, criminology, education, health sciences, history, human development, and political science, we developed a conceptual framework to co-create a civic engagement curriculum for BIPOC and multilingual youth in a neighboring community that is currently ranked as having the lowest per capita income in Massachusetts. We made a point of incorporating the views of our youngest team members, our students, and also those of the middle school youth we hoped to serve. A focus group that we conducted with the undergraduate students after the first iteration of the program was completed revealed that their understanding of civic engagement and desire and capacity to pursue it were positively impacted as a result of the interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary, and intergenerational collaboration that we describe below.

AB  - New communication technologies are changing the way we work and communicate with people around the world. Given this reality, students in Higher Education (HE) worldwide need to develop knowledge in their area of study as well as attitudes and values that will enable them to be responsible and ethical global citizens in the workforce they will soon enter, regardless of the degree. Different institutional and country-specific requirements are important factors when developing an international Virtual Exchange (VE) program. Digital learning environments such as ProGlobe -- Promoting the Global Exchange of Ideas on Sustainable Goals, Practices, and Cultural Diversity -- offer a platform for collaborating with diverse students around the world to share and reflect on ideas on sustainable practices. Students work together virtually on a joint interdisciplinary project that aims to create knowledge and foster cultural diversity. This project was successfully integrated into each country's course syllabus through a common global theme; sustainability. The focus of this paper is to present multi-disciplinary perspectives on the opportunities and challenges in implementing a VE project in HE. Furthermore, it will present the challenges that country coordinators dealt with when planning and implementing their project. Given the disparity found in each course syllabus, project coordinators uniquely handled the project goal, approach, and assessment for their specific course and program. Not only did the students and faculty gain valuable insight into different aspects of collaboration when working in interdisciplinary HE projects, they also reflected on their own impact on the environment and learned to listen to how people in different countries deal with environmental issues. This approach provided students with meaningful intercultural experiences that helped them link ideas and concepts about a global issue through the lens of their own discipline as well as other disciplines worldwide.

AB  - Background: For engineers who aim to address sustainability challenges, participating in transdisciplinary teams is key. Yet developing transdisciplinary knowledge, including systems thinking, metacognition, and empathic thinking, is not well supported in traditional engineering programs. Purpose: The extent to which selected learning activities in the introduction to engineering courses support student development of systems thinking, metacognition, and empathic thinking is investigated. Design/Method: Focus group discussions with instructional teams and student interviews are examined to elucidate how course activities improved student transdisciplinary knowledge. Threshold concepts frame the qualitative analysis of the collected data. Implications for teaching and learning are discussed. Findings: Results suggest the investigated learning activities support student development of transdisciplinary knowledge as indicated by changes in systems thinking, metacognition, and empathic thinking. Where prior quantitative exploratory studies revealed little change in transdisciplinary knowledge indicators pre- and post-course, deeper qualitative analysis uncovers students manifested improvements in transdisciplinary knowledge indicators as narrated by the students themselves and as observed by instructors and teaching assistants. Conclusions: Integrating transdisciplinary knowledge development into engineering programs, starting with appropriate learning activities in first-year engineering courses, may provide new pathways for transforming curricula aimed at educating the 21st-century engineer.

AB  - American higher education relies on a taxonomy of knowledge stemming from Puritan ways of thinking and knowing--a disciplinary classification system that sorts "questions asked" and "answers possible" into epistemic categories. This paper interrogates the notion of disciplinarity to better understand the arbitrariness of epistemic divisions and the harm that these decisions cause . The author explores transdisciplinarity as an emerging concept in honors education, one which rejects boundaries and explores problems through multiple, competing perspectives. Transdisciplinary pedagogical approaches offer honors educators a mechanism for pivoting teaching and learning away from outdated assumptions of honors as elitist, giving honors students a liberating way to conceptualize and approach inquiry. The result reimagines students and the academy in a way that subverts the boundaries and assumptions posed by modern disciplinary logic and encourages applied and integrative ways of knowing and being.

AB  - Curriculum integration from a STEAM transdisciplinary perspective represents a profound challenge. This study delves into a transdisciplinary approach to primary education and the role of the arts through two STEAM projects in a programme for gifted students in Madrid (Spain). Participants include 111 students from eight groups (11-12 years old), five teachers and four external professionals. The teachers fulfill the dual role of both teacher and researcher, using participant and non-participant observation, video recordings, interviews and classroom journals and questionnaires. All the findings have been triangulated and coded by means of Activity Theory, using Atlas.ti8 software and statistical analysis. The results show the significance of learning and the creation of meaningful experiences as being related to a high degree of motivation and satisfaction, and to the integration of diverse areas in a participatory process in which the arts play a disciplinary and integrating role. A transdisciplinary STEAM approach is presented that could be paradigmatic for the field of primary education. [Translation from Spanish by Jennifer Martin.]

AB  - In this paper, I look over the past 20 years of articles in this journal in light of some potential directions for the future. In particular, I examine the way in which some of the local specificities of a Canadian journal relate to more global issues of educational research; I consider the relation between mathematics, science and technology as reflected in the published articles; and, I look at how different paradigms of research have been represented over time, particularly in relation to the mathematics education articles.

AB  - This article considers the conception of transdisciplinarity as a knowledge distinct from disciplinary knowledge modes and especially drawing a distinction with interdisciplinarity. Such critical analysis assists in the recognition of the importance and value of transdisciplinarity within the ecology of knowledge in the complex systems of university education. Using emergence as a framework, the paper explores how emergent properties are generated and assist in problem solving, creating an ethos for the university and how a transdisciplinary currere can be settled in such a space.

AB  - In this paper I argue for a necessary -- and possible -- paradigmatic shift in early childhood scholarship that embraces multiplicity, diversity, ambiguity, uncertainty and shared situated knowledge creation in response to a profoundly changed global context. The contours of the new paradigm are already emerging as three interconnected "fields of tension": First, the increasing recognition, by some international actors, of the complexity and systemic characteristic of early childhood education -- contradicted by the persistent promotion of decontextualised approaches by others including OECD. Second, a blurring of boundaries between the Global South and North, in the context of rising inequality within countries. Third, the inability of dominant theories of early childhood education, grounded in disciplinary traditions from outside the field, to conceptualise present experiences and future directions. In conclusion I argue for the need and possibility of a "trans-discipline of early childhood" with profound implications for comparative work in the field.

AB  - The responses of higher education (HE) institutions towards the climate crisis and escalating social inequalities have been researched from either 'top-down' (i.e. institutionally-led) or 'bottom-up' (i.e. student-led) perspectives. As scholars call for enhanced insight into the space between these two poles, this paper provides an autoethnographical account of a 'bottom-up' network led by doctoral students -- Researchers 4 Sustainability (R4S) -- initiated within a UK university to contest 'top-down' structures by way of disciplinary silos. Likening disciplines to communicative subsystems, we draw on a social constructivist perspective of dialogue to demonstrate how three forms of dialogue -- exploring, explaining and expanding -- support not just the transcending of disciplinary boundaries, but crucially, institutional hierarchies, in the creation of sustainability knowledge. Herein, we introduce a framework against which to organise student-led dialogues relative to their inter- and/or trans-disciplinary orientations and offer recommendations for theory and practice.

AB  - The literature on interdisciplinary teaching has tended to stress undergraduate teaching. As interdisciplinary graduate teaching becomes increasingly common, we need to reflect on what graduate students need to know. This article discusses key ideas that all interdisciplinary graduate programs should communicate. In particular, we need to teach graduate students how to do interdisciplinary research. Students should also be prepared for interdisciplinary careers. Since there has been relatively little written about interdisciplinary graduate education, this article is necessarily exploratory, and intended to encourage a conversation.

AB  - Purpose: University research institutes were established in Malaysian Universities to facilitate research activities that do not fit into discipline-oriented departments, including the multi- and inter-disciplinary research that goes beyond the single-disciplinary boundary. This paper aims to report on a case study of one university research institute established in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), known as the institute for environment and development (LESTARI). LESTARI conducts multi-disciplinary research that emphasises research and capacity building on issues related to sustainable development. The aims of this paper are to examine the research evolution undergone at LESTARI, and to ascertain its contribution towards sustainable development goals (SDGs). Design/methodology/approach: LESTARI was established two years after the Rio Conference held in 1992, with the aims of promoting sustainable development through research and capacity building. This paper uses a qualitative approach to evaluate the research evolution of LESTARI, and a quantitative analysis to ascertain LESTARI's contribution to SDGs. Findings: After almost 30 years of establishment, LESTARI has moved from multi-disciplinary research to inter-disciplinary research. Although the transition was based on respective research areas (e.g. chemicals management and geopark), the research maturity of LESTARI is shown in its transformation from conventional to translational research. LESTARI has proven its capability to conduct multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research, and the research outputs are also contributing to the SDGs. Practical implications: The LESTARI case study has shown that as long as a research institute has a firm and clear research direction, regardless of how it is evaluated and monitored (e.g. evaluated by SDGs), the research institute remains relevant in the context of its establishment. Social implications: The findings from this paper serve to set LESTARI as an example for other university research institutes, whether in Malaysia or in other countries. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this contribution is the first that discusses the transition from multi-disciplinary research to inter-disciplinary research, as well as the contribution to SDGs, among university research institutes in Malaysia.

AB  - Contribution: Team-based learning (TBL) with a transdisciplinary (TD) approach is applied in one introductory programming course with different cohorts. The approach reduces the failure rate in the course. In addition, the approach helped students understand the application of programming to different engineering professional areas. Background: Programming courses in engineering develop abilities required for professional practice, such as applying concepts to solve complex problems using critical thinking analysis. However, a considerable body of research shows that these courses have significant failure rates because students perceive a high complexity in the topics. Different studies show the effectiveness of using active learning methods such as TBL to improve student performance and perception of the course. Nonetheless, there are few studies regarding active learning with TD in programming courses. Intended Outcomes: The use of TBL with a TD approach can improve student performance through teamwork and discussions including different perspectives. Application Design: The method creates teams of students from different programs and assigns real-life problems related to diverse engineering disciplines. Findings: TBL with TD allows for improving student performance and decreases failure rates. Additionally, a survey shows that students favor the methodology and are committed to developing different activities that integrate several areas of knowledge. Furthermore, the method allows students to visualize the usefulness of the course concepts in their professional field. The students also favor the dynamics of the class and the teamwork.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity has been touted as a means to recruit more racially and gender-diverse students to computing. In this explanatory sequential mixed-methods study, we investigated demographic characteristics among a sample of undergraduate students pursuing interdisciplinary computing major and minor combinations at 15 institutions in the United States who completed a survey at the end of their introductory course. Descriptive analyses of responses to this survey of introductory computing students revealed that enrollment in interdisciplinary major and minor combinations was limited and did not appear to disproportionately attract women or Black/African American, Latine, Indigenous, and/or Multiracial students. We then conducted a directed content analysis of departmental websites to examine the language and policies that may have precluded or encouraged students to pursue interdisciplinary computing major and minor combinations. Findings revealed that departmental offerings of such programs were limited, and, among those that did offer such programs, communication about their goals and requirements was often lacking. Implications for research and practice, especially as they pertain to efforts to broaden participation in computing, are discussed.

AB  - Teacher education standards are designed to guide the preparation of pre-service teachers to acquire knowledge and develop skills required for delivering high-quality educational experiences to all learners. Analysing how critical thinking (CT) is positioned in educator preparation standards is an initial step towards understanding the conceptualisation and operationalisation of CT in teacher education. In this study, a team of researchers analysed U.S. educator preparation standards across multiple disciplines and learner populations through a crosswalk standards database for the presence of CT, gaps in the standards, and relation among standards. Results indicate that most CT-related standards focus on preparing teachers to perform strategies that promote CT for students. Less prevalent, or missing, are standards that prepare teachers with essential knowledge of the role of CT in the classroom, using assessment to monitor CT, or the role of planning to provide CT learning experiences. Implications for these gaps are discussed.

AB  - This article intervenes in the persistent hierarchy of epistemological worth that produces scientific knowledge as meaningful, and knowledge from arts or humanities as marginal, or illustrative. The specific trans-disciplinary project we discuss brings together environmental social sciences with performance-based Forum Theatre methods to explore 'value' as understood in communities in Tabasco and Chiapas, Mexico in relation to Payment for Ecosystem Services. Trans-disciplinary collaborations that seek to incorporate 'novel' methods to engage participants differently might better reflect the dynamic, emergent, and often shifting nature of beliefs, attitudes and values.

AB  - Problems framed as societal challenges have provided fresh impetus for transdisciplinary research. In response, funders have started programmes aimed at increasing transdisciplinary research capacity. However, current programme evaluations do not adequately measure the skills and characteristics of individuals and collectives doing this research. Addressing this gap, we propose a systematic framework for evaluating transdisciplinary research based on the Capability Approach, a set of concepts designed to assess practices, institutions, and people based on public values. The framework is operationalized through a mixed-method procedure which evaluates capabilities as they are valued and experienced by researchers themselves. The procedure is tested on a portfolio of 'pump-priming' research projects in the UK. We find these projects are sites of capability development in three ways: through convening cognitive capabilities required for academic practice; cultivating informal tacit capabilities; and maintaining often unacknowledged backstage capabilities over durations that extend beyond the lifetime of individual projects. Directing greater attention to these different modes of capability development in transdisciplinary research programmes may be useful formatively in identifying areas for ongoing project support, and also in steering research system capacity towards societal needs.

AB  - The paper argues that the different dimensions of collaboration - intercultural, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary--contribute to mutual understanding and empathy. Their intersection fosters self-reflection and reveals shortcomings, blind spots, and prejudices about other cultures, disciplines, and social groups. The course aimed to overcome technology-driven design practices that tend to (re)produce stereotypes or social exclusions--often unconsciously. To make students aware of such problems, we introduced them to Feminist Science and Technology Studies, which show how dimensions such as age, class, and gender affect socio-technological participation. Moreover, we introduced user-centered and participatory design methods (contextual interviews, scenario-based design, design forecasting) that the teams had to adapt to pandemic conditions to conduct participatory research and propose design scenarios. The empirical course evaluation by the students indicates that the pedagogical concept, which we conceptualized as an extended version of a 'Third Space', allowed for intercultural, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary learning experiences and improved collective student and team performance, transcending culturally- and disciplinary-specific situatedness. In our analysis, we reflect on the power of the different forms of collaborations and their contribution to teaching future researchers, designers, and engineers how to engage with another's point of view. We consider this ability a prerequisite for acting responsibly in a globalized digital world. Results from the study are contextualized in current debates on internationalization and digitalization in the educational sciences and translated into recommendations for practitioners.

AB  - Although transdisciplinarity has taken hold in many areas, it is still a concept in its early stages of development in Latin America. We see an emergent opportunity to contribute to the current discussion on transdisciplinarity and its institutionalization at universities. Our specific interest in this paper is to disentangle the conditions under which transdisciplinarity is developed in Latin American contexts and how it can be better implemented within those contexts. Our study focuses on the context of "Latin American Public Universities." We examine the following research questions: (1) How is transdisciplinarity conceptualized in university policy and what are the conditions for its institutionalization? (2) What lessons can be drawn more broadly from the role of university policy in the process of institutionalizing transdisciplinarity? To address these questions, we take the Universidad de Chile as a case study and apply a qualitative methodology of content analysis of university policy documents in the period 2006-2021. Grounded on empirical data, we elaborate on the concept of "situated transdisciplinarity" that emerges from the interplay between practices and policy at the Universidad de Chile and serves as a tool for future institutionalizing processes. We conclude that the concept of "situated transdisciplinarity" can orient transdisciplinary research policy, by problematizing discourses and perceptions.

AB  - While interdisciplinarity is not a new concept, the political and discursive mobilisation of interdisciplinarity is. Since the 1990s, this movement has intensified, and this has affected central funding bodies so that interdisciplinarity is now a de facto requirement in successful grant application. As a result, the literature is ripe with definitions, taxonomies, discussions and other attempts to grasp and define the concept of interdisciplinarity. In this paper, we explore how strategic demands for interdisciplinarity meet, interact with and change local research practices and results of higher education and research. Our aim is to question and trace the consequences of applying the slippery and difficult term interdisciplinarity in research. The paper is based on ethnographic fieldwork in a Danish interdisciplinary research programme, where we observed and analysed practices of writing, publishing, collaboration and educational development in five different research projects. We show how the call for interdisciplinarity was mobilised in a way that rendered the incentives and motives behind the programme unclear. Furthermore, we argue that the absence of clear definitions and assessment criteria produced a dominant, all-inclusive, but vague, configuration of interdisciplinarity that affected the research outcome, and ultimately, promoted and reproduced the existing monodisciplinary research and power structures.

AB  - This essay aims to advance the debate on the conceptualization of interdisciplinarity in mathematics education by presenting the idea of the border as a dynamic semiotic cross-cultural space. We refer to three theories, that originate in different research fields and use specific languages: De Luca Picione and Valsiner's idea of the border as a metaphor, Lotman's idea of the semiosphere, and Habermas's construct of rationality. An interdisciplinary activity with high school students based on Ceva's theorem is analysed to show how the complementarity of these theories can provide a key to characterize interdisciplinarity in mathematics education as semiotic mediation among different cultures and as a comparison among rationalities. We conclude with possible developments to shed light on the educational potential of interdisciplinary activities in emerging fields.

AB  - In this paper we discuss the types of knowledge used by six middle school students as they engaged with a debugging task designed to integrate ideas from computer science, mathematics and science. Our findings show that the computational thinking practice of debugging is a rich source of opportunities to integrate these different disciplines. The analysis illustrates how the types of knowledge the students did and did not use at each step of the debugging process were related to their ability to succeed at each step. Our work contributes to theory and practice by uncovering implications for studying debugging through two refined frameworks and for designing debugging tasks to support transdisciplinary learning.

AB  - Empowering students and scholars to effectively address complex societal challenges frequently entails embracing unconventional pathways to foster transdisciplinary (TD) education. This empowerment is further facilitated by collaborative efforts supported by the TD experience. This paper examines one such initiative: a student-centered, experimental design of a TD doctoral pilot program for environmental sustainability at the University of British Columbia, a large, research-intensive public university in Canada. In this study, we documented shifts in participants' development and assessed the impact of TD collaboration conditions on the educational design process. The findings indicate that engaging in collaborative TD experiences yields substantial pedagogical benefits, introducing novel opportunities for design and experimentation. This TD space appears to offer conducive conditions for students and faculty to more effectively navigate adaptive and innovative contexts within higher education. Pedagogical experimentation of this nature provides insights that are challenging to derive from theoretical speculation alone, offering potential pathways for today's learners and educators as they confront complex societal challenges.

AB  - Even though research exists on interdisciplinary education and interdisciplinary skills, the term "interdisciplinary" is ambiguous. Currently, studies on how different internal stakeholders in an education setting define and conceptualise interdisciplinarity are lacking. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to define and conceptualise interdisciplinarity in higher education. This is investigated by focus group interviews with 29 internal stakeholders representing students, teachers, and program managers at an interdisciplinary master's program. The conclusion provides a definition of interdisciplinarity; The integration of people possessing different competencies (knowledge, background, and skills) acting upon an identified need, challenge or opportunity that requires a holistic approach founded in synergies and thereby creating new knowledge. Interdisciplinary learning is mainly conceptualised to take place in open-ended and research-like innovation projects.

AB  - Education in the twenty-first century is characterized by narratives of global connectivity. Opportunities offered by digital technologies, connectivity through mobile platforms, and social media, reinforced by changing expectations of students and parents, have put pressure on universities to reimagine global learning and flexible delivery contained in a modern higher degree. The higher education sector has sought to address these developments in a number of ways: through intensified student exchange and recruitment, the establishment of off-shore campuses, an expanding online delivery presence, and by increasing flexibility of delivery for on-campus students. While each of the current options taken up by universities addresses different aspects of these trends in the sector, all have inherent problems and imbalances in their approach. In this paper we reflect on the effectiveness of the current trends in international education and propose that the innovative "Portal Pedagogy" approach outlined here makes a significant contribution to higher education. The pedagogy connects geographically distant students through technology and curriculum to create a student-centred community of inquiry neither bound by disciplines nor countries. Bringing together cross-disciplinary interaction, student-driven learning, and technological solutions to pedagogical and logistical challenges, Portal Pedagogy offers a hybrid model that seeks to go beyond the limitations of online delivery and student exchange programmes in order to offer a flexible, meaningful, and globalized learning experience.

AB  - While the scholarship of interdisciplinarity has grown prolifically in the last thirty years, the discourse primarily frames interdisciplinarity as an instrumental research construct. In this article, I will argue that this framework should be expanded to consider how interdisciplinary engagement can support education for democracy. The article will begin by giving an account of the role that interdisciplinarity can play in the context of democratic education. I will then argue that a lesser-theorized form of interdisciplinarity called "critical interdisciplinarity" is uniquely situated to advance democratic aims in higher education. Finally, through the lens of a curricular project conducted on my campus, I will show how critical interdisciplinarity may be deployed to advance democratic aims in higher education. Ultimately, I will make a case for the significance of critical interdisciplinarity as a central form of democratic engagement in university life and call for the expansion of its discussion in the interdisciplinary literature.

AB  - Although literacy research has traditionally focused on content area and disciplinary literacies, in this study we argue for the importance of transdisciplinarity. We employed a participatory action research design to examine pre-service teachers' (PST) planning of a transdisciplinary math and music lesson to understand how conceptual framing of pedagogy and instructional practice can be shifted from content literacies to transdisciplinarity. Our area of inquiry focused on how PSTs' understanding of transdisciplinarity shifted as they planned, taught, and reflected on instruction and how these shifts were supported by others. We documented evidence of how the lesson progressed from disciplinary thinking to interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and transdisciplinary thinking throughout the planning process. We also documented how the process of planning, teaching, coaching, and reflecting provided PSTs with an opportunity to better understand the connections between transdisciplinarity and pedagogy.

AB  - The Literacy Design Collaborative (LDC) was created to support teachers in implementing college and career readiness standards. Teachers work collaboratively with coaches to further develop their expertise and design standards-driven, literacy-rich writing assignments within their existing curriculum across all content areas. Findings from multiple sources reveal positive results for the LDC intervention. Participants across all groups reported positive attitudes toward LDC and perceived a positive impact on student outcomes. Additionally, analysis of student outcomes confirmed participants' positive views. We found LDC had statistically significant effects on Cohort 2 middle school students' English language arts (ELA) performance, with an effect size of .15 for students receiving LDC instruction in all three core content areas: ELA, science, and social studies/history.

AB  - The concept of interdisciplinarity has been the focus of much reflection, but studies on the implementation of interdisciplinarity in secondary schools remain rare. This literature review aims to provide a state of the art empirical studies of interdisciplinarity in secondary schools. This systematic review, based on PRISMA standards, includes a descriptive analysis and a thematic analysis using inductive and deductive methods. Studies were identified using the following databases, Web of Science (WOS), Taylor & Francis (T&F), ERIC, and Science Direct (SD). A total of 40 studies were selected and analyzed to: (1) provide an overview of interdisciplinary practices in secondary schools; (2) highlight the effects of interdisciplinary practices on teachers and students; and (3) identify the conditions that favor the construction of interdisciplinary sequences. The results of this review show that few interdisciplinary practices are used in secondary schools and that even fewer achieve a real integration of disciplines. Interdisciplinary approaches seem to have positive effects on both students and teachers (promoting learning and, interest, developing interpersonal skills and encouraging professional development) when it is possible to overcome the many obstacles they face and to implement them in favorable conditions, such as those featuring a strong conceptual link between disciplines or complementarity between disciplinary and interdisciplinary moments.

AB  - The number of interdisciplinary courses being developed in higher education across different countries is increasing. The people responsible for developing and enacting interdisciplinary courses can have significant design and teaching autonomy, but little is known about how they understand interdisciplinarity. This study uses phenomenographic interviews to address the question: how do interdisciplinary course leaders understand interdisciplinarity? This includes exploration of the relationships between different understandings of interdisciplinarity. Findings from interviews with 23 interdisciplinary course leaders reveal understandings of interdisciplinarity expressed in relation to (A) definitions, (B) knowledge spaces, and (C) situated knowledge work practices. Understandings were multiple and heterogeneous; they varied between participants and more importantly participants each expressed understandings belonging to multiple categories. Findings show that academics' views about what interdisciplinarity means are rarely exclusively aligned with normative definitions, but instead are marked by individuals' construction of meaning through processes of acquisition, sense-making and situational judgment. The study's findings could be used in future educational design and planning work to elicit and discuss different stakeholder understandings of interdisciplinarity.

AB  - Work-integrated learning (WIL) is widely used to connect students with the world of work and authentic industry practices. WIL research and practice is primarily focused on the benefits to students and universities, whilst the value of WIL to partner organisations remains relatively underexplored. This study takes an industry, government and community partner-centric perspective to examine learning in partner organisations stimulated through engagement with transdisciplinary WIL. A case study of a transdisciplinary, innovation-focused project-based WIL subject at one Australian university is interrogated through the theoretical lenses of practice theory and mutual learning. Fifteen interviews with stakeholders in partner organisations are analysed against the three dimensions of practice articulated by Kemmis et al. (2014): sayings, doings and relatings. The analysis shows that through engagement with university-led transdisciplinary WIL partners were able to advance their learning projects, disrupt and reconfigure organisational practices, and legitimise experimentation within their organisations. The study builds the case for conceptualising WIL engagement as a professional learning opportunity for partner organisations, in addition to the well-documented benefits to students and universities.

AB  - Increasing career demands and expanding role expectations in a hyperconnected world batter higher education professionals, much like a tsunami of crashing waves toss a dingy at sea. To overcome the onslaught, professors are all but mandated to proactively build personal brands that deliver value propositions tightly aligning skills, expertise, and values of respective professionals, sub-units, and the institutions within which they operate, blurring and broadening branding boundaries. Long task lists, scarce time, and frazzled professionals, beckon for mechanisms that scale effort and activity to deliver results and efficiency. This article proposes a framework supporting adoption of transdisciplinary networking as one such effective scaling method. By hosting such events, colleges scaffold a variety of salutary effects that align with faculty development across teaching, research, and service areas.

AB  - Chile implemented a new national quality assurance system for its higher education institutions in 2006 that included a set of policies and procedures for graduate education. Ten years after its implementation, this study looks at the perceived alignments and misalignments between the national accreditation goals and the graduate programs' visions of improvement. By using the concept of loosely coupled systems, we studied eight science and technology master's and doctoral programs at four research-oriented Chilean universities. In total, we conducted 26 interviews, visited all campus sites, and analyzed related documents. The results indicate that the national accreditation system improved academic quality across programs by strengthening the influence of university central administrations and raising faculty productivity standards. In particular, the accreditation meant a push for internationalization, which was welcomed at all institutional levels. However, after a decade, the accreditation system seems misaligned with programs' new improvement efforts, such as the promotion of multidisciplinary work. To some extent, accreditation standards, based on strong disciplinary orientations, penalize a diverse student body and curricular innovation and do not consider the challenges of publishing multidisciplinary research.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to explore interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary interactions around sustainability, focusing on the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs). By using the city as an informal learning space, it presents a case study to raise SDG awareness, promote interdisciplinarity, foster critical thinking and empower students. Design/methodology/approach: Using qualitative content analysis, this study explores students' interdisciplinary engagements. The research centers on student-created Logbooks, combining field data for analysis via open coding. Findings: The informal setting facilitates transdisciplinary interaction and enriches interdisciplinary skills while retaining individuals' disciplinary tendencies. Research limitations/implications: Factors like local geographical conditions and participant numbers could lead to minor variations in future course applications. Although initial problem topics and discussions are confined to local urban geography, they might diversify during implementation. Practical implications: The Logbook serves as a guide for local urban issues and embodies interdisciplinary outcomes. It can be enhanced with maps and problem zoning. Social implications: Demonstrates effective SDG integration into higher education. Originality/value: This study spotlights interdisciplinary learning within an unconventional context -- urbanism -- bridging student gaps. Supported by a paradigm shift from sustainability to unsustainability, it underscores the significance of critical engagement with SDGs.

AB  - While a trans-disciplinary approach has been suggested within school science learning to facilitate the role of science education for societal development, lacking is a conceptualisation with respect to what trans-disciplinarity is, why it is needed, and how it can potentially be implemented in the classroom. In seeking to address this limitation, this study undertakes a systematically literature review of research articles published between 2011 and 2022, within the scope of trans-disciplinarity at school level science education. The five key transdisciplinary attributes are identified as -- complexity, liberation, inclusion, transcendence beyond education and reflection, leading to the identification of 12 key dimensions of trans-disciplinarity. Based on this finding, a model is put forward with respect to implementing trans-disciplinarity within school level science teaching-learning, incorporating all identified dimensions as an approach towards addressing wicked problems within the society. The significance of this study lies on the conceptualisation of trans-disciplinarity in a holistic sense, so as to address a wider societal development through school science education.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed significant growth of interest in science-art integration in schools as an approach to creative teaching and learning. This conceptual turn in education implies profound institutional and philosophical changes. Central to this turn has been the development of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math (STEAM) education. In this article, we detail a progression from an existing model of pedagogical principles and educational objectives in science education within a global STEAM education environment, Global Science Opera, towards shared pedagogical principles and educational objectives in both science and arts education within that same environment. In this work, we rely on a transdisciplinary approach towards the integrated disciplines and the educators who teach them. We outline the need for the new, integrated approach to be validated in other, empirical, contexts in order to establish its capacity in the field of creativity in education, and specifically in global STEAM environments in order to ensure its relevance to teaching and learning of a kind which strengthen students' knowledge, abilities and democratic and inclusive values. We propose the Janus metaphor for the new approach as it represents the possibility of having a double perspective of a single focus of attention. We conclude by pointing at limitations of discipline integration in which pedagogical principles in science education are not in harmony with the pedagogical principles in arts education.

AB  - Universities have increasingly been subjected to policy- and industry demands to produce multi- and interdisciplinary knowledge. This paper explores the extent to which different higher education policy instruments are used to promote interdisciplinarity in teaching and research at universities in the German higher education system comparing them across different federal states. Based on a manifest content analysis of higher education laws and performance agreements with universities in the 16 German states, we were able to distinguish between three types of states: Those a) with a general use of policy instruments aimed at all universities in a state, whereas considerable differences could be observed with regard to the degree of coercion (enabling versus prescriptive provisions) and scope (teaching or research), b) a directed use of policy instrument, targeting specific universities, and c) a hybrid use of policy instruments using both general and directed elements. This paper provides a novel mapping of the promotion of interdisciplinarity in German higher education policies through a variety of policy instruments and hereby contributes to the extant literature on interdisciplinarity in higher education.

AB  - In many sectors and in many respects, interdisciplinarity has made progress in recent decades, but less so when it comes to evaluating interdisciplinary work. Challenges remain, especially regarding what counts as 'good' interdisciplinarity. While previous reviews describe broad trends contributing to these challenges, high-level observations are less suited to: (1) pinpointing underlying sources of persistent evaluative issues, (2) capturing less frequent counterexamples and emerging trends, and (3) providing practical guidance for moving the field forward. This article presents a novel approach for excavating and analyzing assessment designs within and across a wide range of published studies. It is the first study to structure its review of interdisciplinary evaluation around the basics of evaluation theory, creating a simplified model of assessment design choices called an "assessment pathway." It further stands alone as an extensive systematic review of the interdisciplinary literature uniquely placed within the context of evaluation, encompassing 20 years, 142 studies, 1,006 assessment pathways, and 19,114 data points. Results show that while interdisciplinary assessments to date excel at variation, only 12% of identified pathways contain the minimum elements required to reach an evaluative judgment. Increased attention to evaluation theory can catalyze progress and provide structure and shared language to a highly varied domain. Readers can visually explore the full dataset online and download it from Harvard's Dataverse.

AB  - This article provides an appraisal of collaborative conceptual modelling (CCM) as a tool for research translation. First developed by Newell and Proust (2012), CCM draws on the tools and frameworks of systems thinking as a way of addressing transdisciplinary problems. We applied CCM in two separate workshops - one discussing 'Digital Cities', and the other on 'Energy Futures'. The aim was to assess the value and limitations of CCM in an applied setting, as well as its value in producing transdisciplinary research outcomes. We found that CCM is a valuable tool for researchers interested in addressing complex or 'wicked' problems. At the same time, it has its own challenges. These barriers include recruiting workshop participants who are not researchers; assisting workshop participants in developing a truly collaborative approach; and training participants in how to draw some of the main CCM tools (particularly causal loop diagrams). Future research will explore how to address these challenges, and apply CCM in a contested space.

AB  - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education garnered significant attention in recent years and has emerged as a key field of research globally. The goal of this article is to offer a critical review of how STEM education and its transdisciplinarity were defined and/or positioned in empirical studies published during the early formulation of the field. In particular, we sought to identify how these studies conceptualise learners and learning and portray the underlying assumptions in light of the macrosystemic discourses that often serve as ideological forces in shaping research and practice of STEM education. We examined 154 peer-reviewed articles published between January 2007 and March 2018 and analysed them along several emergent dimensions: their geospatial focus, focal disciplinary areas, methodological and theoretical assumptions, and major findings. Grounded in a critical transdisciplinary perspective, we used critical discourse analysis to identify how macrosystemic and institutionalised forces -- overtly and implicitly -- shape what counts as STEM education research, including its goals and conceptualisations of learners and learning. Our analysis highlights the need for aesthetic expansion and diversification of STEM education research by challenging the disciplinary hegemonies and calls for reorienting the focus away from human capital discourse.

AB  - The present study sheds light on transdisciplinary education through the application of a scoping literature review, as a lack of a comprehensive synthesis in this area is evident. Thus, the overview frames and outlines the scattered research that has been fulfilled until now in this field. As a result, within transdisciplinary education, medical and adolescent themes form the main scopes, while within sustainable transdisciplinary education, pedagogical design, socio-efficiency, and philosophy are the major themes. Furthermore, the present study contributes to the understanding of transdisciplinary education by highlighting the avenues for future research. Consequently, the translation of transdisciplinary teaching practices to comparable languages and an increase of transparency in the application and reporting of the transdisciplinary design steps are suggested.

AB  - Background: Historically, the research and treatment of self-injury has been disciplinarily siloed. As a result, the behaviour is understood and treated differently among individuals with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities. We explore the potential for an interdisciplinary research and practice agenda in self-injury. Method: We conducted 10 focus groups with experts in self-injury and analysed discussions that resulted from the question: "What is the role of interdisciplinarity in the study and treatment of self-injury?" Results: Through a reflexive thematic analysis we came up with actionable and positively-oriented themes: Interdisciplinarity at the Individual Level, Context of Needed Systems-Level Change, Highlighting Workforce Support, Strategic Use of Implementation and Dissemination Science, and The Pursuit of Integration. Each theme includes several subthemes that describe specific strategies. Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach is not only possible but worthwhile and would be particularly beneficial to supporting individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities engaging in self-injurious behaviour.

AB  - Integrated STEAM instruction continues to be a major focus of K-12 education. In effort to better understand STEAM education, we reviewed existing frameworks for implementing integrated STEAM in classrooms. We found that existing frameworks largely focused on the lens of the teacher, thus leaving the student perspective of STEAM learning experiences out of conversations centered on both research and practice. The purpose of this theoretical paper is to center STEAM education on students' rights, obligations, and duties within integrated STEAM instruction as a way to refine understanding of students' positions in STEAM learning experiences. We use theoretical considerations and evidence to explore new ways for transdisciplinary STEAM to be conceptualized from a student perspective. We conclude with considerations and implications for future STEAM education research.

AB  - This paper presents three case studies of educators pioneering transdisciplinary project work within a UK College-Based Higher Education Institution, focusing on Education Studies, Counselling, and Fine Art. Through the CollaborArt Blackburn initiative, educators facilitated gallery visits, encounter spaces, and collaborative creation opportunities for students across these disciplines. These case studies highlight the educators' roles in fostering a transdisciplinary approach that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries, emphasising experiential learning and collaborative engagement. The narratives illustrate the transformative impact of integrating diverse perspectives and methodologies, enriching both educators' and students' understanding and practice. The paper argues for the intrinsic value of educators' insights and expertise in initiating and sustaining transdisciplinary projects, encouraging peers to embrace innovative approaches in their pedagogical practices. This work contributes to the discourse on transdisciplinary education, advocating for its potential to create dynamic, inclusive, and holistic learning environments.

AB  - Purpose: In collaboration with their home cities, universities increasingly develop courses in which students investigate urban sustainability challenges. This paper aims to understand how far-reaching the collaboration with urban stakeholders in these courses is and what students are meant to learn from the transdisciplinary pedagogies. Design/methodology/approach: This research is designed as a qualitative multiple-case study into the intentions of transdisciplinary courses in which universities collaborate with their home cities: Delft University of Technology in Delft and Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions in Amsterdam. The study compares the written intentions of eight courses in course descriptions with the ideal intentions that teachers describe in interviews. Findings: First, seven of the eight investigated courses were designed for urban stakeholders to participate at a distance or as a client but rarely was a course intended to lead to a collaborative partnership between the city and students. Second, the metacognitive learning objectives, such as learning to deal with biases and values of others or getting to know one's strengths and weaknesses in collaboration, were often absent in the course descriptions. Learning objectives relating to metacognition are at the heart of transdisciplinary work, yet when they remain implicit in the learning objectives, they are difficult to teach. Originality/value: This paper presents insight into the levels of participation intended in transdisciplinary courses. Furthermore, it shows the (mis)alignment between intended learning objectives in course descriptions and teachers' ideals. Understanding both the current state of transdisciplinarity in sustainability courses and what teachers envision is vital for the next steps in the development of transdisciplinary education.

AB  - Research has promoted transdisciplinarity as a complementary management educational perspective to prepare future decision-makers in addressing today's increasingly complex global socio-economic and environmental challenges, and in conducting business in a sustainable and responsible way. We explore the practical applicability of the concept of transdisciplinarity to management education. We extend the theoretical discourse to the concretization of transdisciplinary ideas and propositions for business school curricula. We show that a transdisciplinary teaching approach confronts students at levels with different modes of thinking, imagining and feeling, and provides them with critical self-reflections, creativity, different frames of references, and an openness and confidence to conduct business in a sustainable and responsible way.

AB  - Today, the integrative STEM initiative, which is at the center of the current paradigm shift in education, includes attempts to blend science, mathematics and engineering with technology education. Common considerations provide an opportunity to better define the role of technology within the framework of STEM education, but this has not yet been fully realized. Therefore, a lack of definition/role of technology in STEM education is quite noticeable and there exist different perspectives regarding this issue. This theoretical study explains the basic principles regarding the transdisciplinary role of the technology that is defined with certain limits, while discussing different ideas about the integration of science and technology in STEM education in the last 30 years in order to present a different perspective on the role of technology in STEM education.

AB  - Purpose: There is pressure to transform graduate education in ways that better prepare and socialize students for academic careers that require entrepreneurial activities and/or professional pathways outside of academia. The inclusion of entrepreneurial learning in graduate curricula and programs is one strategy for responding to such calls. Yet, there lacks an understanding of how graduate students outside of the business fields make sense of entrepreneurial content relevant to their academic interests and career aspirations. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore entrepreneurial sensemaking by non-business graduate students enrolled in a transdisciplinary entrepreneurship course. Design/methodology/approach: A single case study design was used to explore how seven nonbusiness graduate students in a transdisciplinary entrepreneurial leadership course made sense of entrepreneurial content relevant to their academic interests and career aspirations. Data were collected through direct observations, semi-structured interviews and the administration of an entrepreneurial leadership proclivity assessment tool. Findings: Through experiential learning intentionally centering entrepreneurship, graduate students acquire entrepreneurial knowledge in ways that enhance their agency and sense of empowerment without diluting or overriding their academic and/or professional intentions. Practical implications: Sensemaking is framed as a pedagogical resource for fostering the integration of entrepreneurial content in transdisciplinary graduate courses and experiences in ways that align with and support the academic interests and career aspirations of individual students. Originality/value: A novel entrepreneurial sensemaking approach to the integration of entrepreneurial content with transdisciplinary curricula that is directly responsive to calls for graduate education transformation is introduced.

AB  - In this article, two transnational scholars of English studies engage in a collaborative autoethnography to illustrate the generative potential of translingualism as a scholarly common ground for writing studies and the history of English language studies. The argument hinges on the notion that translingualism's open-endedness to, and welcoming of, students' and instructors' linguistic diversity can make it a disciplinary pathway for transnational scholars to use their diverse World Englishes in writing classrooms. Based on case studies of their autobiographical narratives of professional development, experiences teaching in college writing classrooms, and engagement with translingual scholarship, the article shows how (a) translingualism works as a gateway (i.e., point of entry) into writing studies for scholars who are World Englishes users and (b) histories of the English language mediate this disciplinary socialization. Three major themes that emerge from a comparative analysis of the materials and that relate to the authors' distinct approaches to writing, underlying motivations for linguistic and academic pursuits, and disciplinary orientations are discussed.

AB  - Transdisciplinary research (TDR) is conceptualized as not only providing societal effects but also benefiting academia. However, recent literature on the evaluation of TDR has focused almost entirely on the societal effects of TDR. A discussion of the scientific effects of TDR is needed to do justice to the potential of this research mode. To date, little empirical research has focused on the effects of TDR on science. Our explorative study addresses this gap. The empirical basis are qualitative interviews with scientists engaged in transdisciplinary research and anchored in three sub-disciplines: environmental sociology, sustainable chemistry, and participatory health research. We identify as main effects of the transdisciplinary research mode: changes in the understanding of scientific problems, changes in the quality of scientific insights, and the promotion of a reflexive turn in science.

AB  - The honors college at a large land-grant research university developed transdisciplinary courses to provide undergraduate opportunities for small, student-centered classes and collaborative problem engagement in a global context. In these courses, students engage principles of competency-based education and inquiry-based learning combined with instruction in transdisciplinarity and decision-making tied to the college mission statement and course learning outcomes. As an observational study, we surveyed 91 honors students from 12 transdisciplinary courses over three semesters, asking five-point Likert scale questions and open-ended perspective questions at the beginning and end of each semester. Participants predominantly identified as White (74%), male (57%), senior-level students (67%), and represent 34 majors. Findings emphasize outcomes of lasting faculty relationships and opportunities to explore interests outside students' majors, which respondents report influencing their academic development. Students also report areas for curricular improvement in developing research skills and engaging problem-focused experiences. We describe new offerings made to address findings.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a new era where applied learning has to go virtual. This hastened the need for students to be equipped with virtual skillsets, including the ability to manage 3-D augmented reality tools for future work. This paper introduces the virtual art platform as a means to prepare students for the new world, which requires a multidisciplinary approach to solving problems and digital skills to work within the virtual environment. The paper will examine the multidisciplinary practice and perspectives involved in setting up the virtual art gallery, introduce features of Virtual Art Gallery platforms and finally consider the potential benefits of using these platforms for the student's professional careers.

AB  - Sound mathematical knowledge is an essential ingredient for student success in many disciplines, and quality mathematics support is crucial to that success. How that support is delivered is often the key to student engagement, satisfaction and positive outcomes. Many students require sound mathematical knowledge to engage in their discipline activities. Since lack of mathematical skill is a barrier to student retention, progression and self-efficacy, the onus is on the university to provide quality support. This paper describes the expansion of a cross-disciplinary model of mathematics support that has grown to include a suite of programmes that accommodate diverse needs. A previous study evaluated the model's delivery in 2010-2012 for Chemistry, Physics, Biology and Statistics. Since then, not only have these programmes continued to run and expand, new ones have been implemented for further disciplines. After 17 bi-annual iterations, it is timely to investigate the extension of the original model and evaluate whether it continues to address the original objectives. Our findings reveal a high proportion of students who engage in a Maths Skills programme report increased mathematics confidence and skill, and subject pass rates of those who engage are almost always higher than the pass rates of those who do not.

AB  - This paper discusses the relationship between multidisciplinarity and research performance in the academic context. The paper explains how scholars' scientific performance is affected by the multidisciplinarity of the network of colleagues with whom they conduct their research. Furthermore, this paper explores the potential moderating role of academics' social capital, assuming that relational dynamics can mitigate the potential problems associated with disciplinary diversity. To build the proposed model, the paper draws on previous literature on diversity and social capital. The resulting hypotheses are tested through a quantitative study developed on the basis of a sample of scholars in the field of management. Information about multidisciplinarity and research performance was extracted from the Scopus database, while social capital variables were measured through social network analysis techniques. Econometric estimations were used to test the proposed relationships. The findings suggest that the effect of multidisciplinarity and researchers' performance can be depicted as an inverted U-shaped relationship, so an optimal intermediate level of diversity can be found. Estimations also show that relational, cognitive and structural social capital moderates this curvilinear relationship, making it possible to achieve higher research performance at higher levels of multidisciplinarity.

AB  - This article explores the evolution and expansion of experiential learning theory (ELT) within the context of contemporary adult education, emphasizing the integration of technology, interdisciplinarity, and cultural responsiveness. Although Kolb's foundational model has been instrumental in linking theoretical knowledge with practical application, its limitations--particularly in addressing the complexities of modern learning environments--are critically examined. The authors advocate for an expanded ELT framework incorporating interdisciplinary approaches to enrich adult learning experiences. By integrating digital tools, considering socio-political contexts, and fostering collaboration, the article proposes a more inclusive and adaptable model that better aligns with the diverse needs of today's adult learners. This reconceptualization aims to enhance the relevance and efficacy of ELT, ensuring it remains a vital tool for personal, professional, and societal development in a rapidly changing world.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity has the potential to lead to more innovation and advances in knowledge than are possible from a single discipline. Yet, little is known about interdisciplinary collaborations and the perceptions of those involved. This quantitative study investigated the perceptions of U.S. faculty, staff, postdocs, and graduate students involved in education and science/engineering collaborations. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted for two modified scales, Collaboration Perceptions (CP; n = 117; 17 items; [alpha] = 0.923) and Interdisciplinarity Perceptions (IP; n = 119; 11 items; [alpha] = 0.852). Participants' perceptions of collaboration and interdisciplinarity were strongly positive and did not significantly differ based on demographic factors (e.g., gender, discipline, role). Perceptions were influenced by collectivist orientation; the high collectivism group had significantly more positive perceptions of collaboration and interdisciplinarity, and collectivist orientation was positively and significantly correlated with CP and IP scores. Implications and recommendations for interdisciplinary collaborations will be discussed. [Note: The volume number (9) shown on the PDF is incorrect. The correct volume number is 10.]

AB  - Characterized by specific and rigid boundaries of institutional practices and expectations in the academy, student writing is a synergistic literacy practice where students are required to construct generically diverse texts by yoking concepts with appropriate linguistic resources. This empirical study involving 196 first-year ESL students at a university in Sri Lanka explores why conceptual incongruities occur in argumentative essays constructed by them, and how they defend their arguments. We analyzed all their timed essays and noticed that 72 out of them contained conceptual incongruities. By "conceptual incongruities, we refer to instances where students" conceptualization process is not aligned or coherent with the essay topic. For our analysis of student texts, we have introduced two social cognitive perspectives: untutored competencies and tutored competencies. The former includes inherited, social, and ideological identities emerging from societal epistemologies whereas disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity constitute the latter. This empirical research demonstrates how students' conceptualization process is mediated by a labyrinthine repertoire of knowledge premised in students' untutored competencies and tutored competencies, signaling deviations from their essay topic.

AB  - In this theoretical essay, we find inspiration in Lotman's semiotics, in Morìn's sociology of education, the studies of cultural psychology and psychoanalysis of Valsiner and De Luca Picione, and other cultural stimuli coming from the didactics of mathematics. The notion of boundary and liminality was developed and discussed to grasp a relationship between some psychological processes and some transformative aspects of educational processes. Our idea is that an interdisciplinarity education could help orient disciplinary resources towards common educational goals and acquire the skills necessary for each student to be a citizen of the glocal community.

AB  - Over the past decade, transdisciplinary research has been faced with increasing demands by research policy and funding bodies to make its contribution to dealing with complex societal problems more transparent. In the literature, there is a range of methodological attempts to trace and describe the effects of transdisciplinary research, but these are characterized by inconsistent definitions regarding the scope and different forms of effects. This article aims to systematize the proposed categories and introduces a heuristic that can be used as a tool to sensitize researchers to intended effects ex ante and throughout the research process, as well as to reflect on the achieved effects ex post. The heuristic includes the temporal and spatial dimension of occurring effects (first-, second- and third-order) and characterizes possible forms of effects. It is validated and differentiated based on a multi-method empirical study involving 16 completed transdisciplinary research projects in different thematic areas. We propose a differentiation of frequently used categories, such as 'learning effects', and operationalize second- and third-order effects with the aim of ensuring a more consistent use of terminology in the transdisciplinary research community. We also specify methodical steps for a facilitated self-reflective application of the tool ex ante, supporting the research process, or ex post.

AB  - This article examines transdisciplinarity in developmental education and Basic Writing in the context of externally-driven developmental education reforms. We report on a pilot study survey of 143 developmental educators regarding their professional identity, engagement, and resilience. Respondents identified professional roles and interactions with colleagues as central to conceptualizations of their practice and community. Respondents reported maintaining professional resilience through connections with students, colleagues, and their sense of agency. Despite the importance respondents placed upon connections with practitioners and their recognition of the transdisciplinary nature of their work as professionals, findings indicate limited awareness of the transdisciplinary nature of the community of developmental educators. Implications are discussed for widening developmental educators' community of practice to connect practitioners from diverse fields, professions, and institutional contexts. Future directions are discussed for developing teacher-scholars' types and levels of resilience for the purpose of exercising a voice in national debates about developmental education reform.

AB  - This article begins with the proposition that inter- and transdisciplinarity offer an important methodological grounding for collaborative HE research addressing complex agendas such as HE internationalization. Internationalization acts as a figure for the 'troubled' nature of higher education; hence we begin with the larger problem, discussing the current crises of disciplinary knowledge as the background question. We set out a framework for understanding and conceptualizing inter- and transdisciplinarity as a meta-theoretical approach that problematizes reductive and disciplinary approaches, in favour of research and analytical strategies which can work with, and across, differences. To work further through and operationalize different possibilities offered by inter-and transdisciplinary approaches to HE internationalizations, we discuss the use of tools such as social cartography to do 'bridging work' across different disciplinary and theoretical backgrounds and contexts. A non-formal practitioner-collaborator project is discussed to highlight emergent dimensions of collaboration that might otherwise be overlooked. Inter- and transdisciplinarity are not pre-specified specialized 'methods' but, rather, are orientations that may take reductive, convergent, divergent or emergent pathways. Inter- and transdisciplinarity can perhaps be best treated as a problematizing and open-ended methodological approach that foregrounds plurality and contestation, orienting research frameworks towards inclusiveness, tensions, unpredictability and complexity.

AB  - From its beginnings, computer-assisted language learning (CALL) has been widely seen as an enterprise that draws on inputs from multiple disciplines. Scholars tracking the development of such enterprises in other domains have developed generally accepted terminology distinguishing concepts of multidisciplinarity, interdisciplinarity, and transdisciplinarity along a continuum from lesser to greater integration, coherence, and synthesis. We begin with an overview of the three preceding concepts with particular attention to interdisciplinarity in contemporary CALL. We then explore the notion of transdisciplinarity as an emerging theme in applied linguistics, arguably the field most closely related to CALL. In the following section, we look at theoretical options that are less connected to single disciplinary positions and represent the interdisciplinary state of the field and its movement toward transdisciplinarity. We expand on the basic notion of CALL as a potential transdisciplinary field and provide a descriptive framework of transdisciplinary types. The final section offers a model for visualizing transdisciplinarity for CALL with accompanying examples, arguing for a set of common transdisciplinary notions and a lingua franca for CALL stakeholders from a range of disciplines to use when communicating. We conclude that the future of the field lies in a much stronger transdisciplinary orientation than is currently the case and call upon our colleagues to pursue the concept.

AB  - The article seeks to answer the question "Can ecopedagogy mitigate the impact of unsustainable education?" The aim of the article is a phenomenological and hermeneutical reflection on some issues relevant to ecopedagogy at the beginning of the Anthropocene era, when education policy, its governance, the transformation of the holistic approach into a "more holistic" one and the biological origins and deep cosmological roots of the human species have started to diminish. These and other wicked problems have been used in a reflexive participatory action research setting, which was initiated in 2000 for the development of a teacher program and a reflexive ecopedagogy course. The study adopts a "holistic evolutionary-ecological" perspective. Through this perspective, the indivisibility of the evolutionary-ecological phenomenon is highlighted, which opens, highlights and "fuses" the natural cosmic relation of human beings to the environment and society in the pursuit of "humanity's goals." The evolutionary-ecological framework of the phenomenon is considered in the context of the emergence and understanding of a transdisciplinary approach. "Two types of transdisciplinary platforms" developed within the evolutionary-ecological phenomenon are examined. Through the origins of these platforms, educators are offered the opportunity to discover the relation between the transdisciplinary approach and the evolutionary-ecological phenomenon in pedagogy and "the emergence of ideas or emergent recursion" in complex evolutionary-ecological processes at different levels, which is enacted through the teacher as living learning aimed at a noble humanity.

AB  - We conducted a case study on the implementation of an adult mentoring program designed to connect land-grant university graduate students who participated in a transdisciplinary and multi-institutional research project with industry professionals for the purpose of exposing students to industry practices. Seven mentees and six mentors participated in the study. We employed the theory of planned behavior to inform findings regarding participants' behavioral, normative, and control beliefs surrounding professional performance and goal attainment. Program outcomes were positive for student career development, for example expanding graduate students' professional networks and sharing research findings with industry professionals. However, the COVID-19 pandemic hindered the mentoring program's success by adding stress and travel restrictions that prevented full engagement in the program by all parties. Recommendations for improving the program's success include providing participants with better support mechanisms for initiating mentoring relationships and encouraging mentees to develop coping mechanisms when faced with cognitive overload and communication apprehension.

AB  - The formation of environmental literacy in the education system through education for sustainable development (EfSD) experiences many obstacles. The aim of the research is to analyze the impact of interdisciplinary science learning for interdisciplinary oriented education for sustainable development to improve interdisciplinary thinking and environmental literacy of prospective teachers. The experimental method with a quasi-experimental pretest posttest group design was used in this study. The data collection technique used is an environmental literacy questionnaire and an interdisciplinary thinking test. Data analysis technique used independent t test. The results obtained were that the science interdisciplinary learning effective in improving interdisciplinary thinking performance and environmental literacy. The performance of students' interdisciplinary thinking affects environmental literacy of students. The university forms student teacher candidates who have the ability to think interdisciplinary so that they can manage science learning in an interdisciplinary and environmentally literate manner. The implication of this research is the importance of fostering interdisciplinary thinking and environmental literacy at all levels of education.

AB  - Background: Constructing shared understanding of complex interdisciplinary problems is one of the most challenging aspects of interdisciplinary teamwork. How this process unfolds is under-researched, making it esoteric and difficult to scaffold. This paper aims to provide an articulated and nuanced account of what is involved in student teams' construction of shared understanding of complex interdisciplinary problems. Methods: The study combines the theoretical lens of epistemic games with an ecological analytical perspective. Drawing on the analysis of ethnographic cases, it explores how four graduate student teams construct shared understanding of complex problems during interdisciplinary projects. Findings: Construction of shared understanding is a multifaceted and dynamic process that extends over the entire problem-solving activity. It relies on epistemic moves that explicate and juxtapose different perspectives and connect abstract ideas with knowledge grounded in students' experiences and contexts. The pursuits students engage in, when creating shared understanding, reveal epistemic differences related to formulation of the interdisciplinary problem and what constitutes trustworthy knowledge. Contribution: The paper contributes to the literature on the nature of students' construction of shared understanding of complex interdisciplinary problems revealing critical recurrent moves. It also extends earlier conceptualizations of epistemic games as primarily discourse games and demonstrates that they are profoundly multimodal and distributed.

AB  - This paper explores the student experience of multidisciplinarity within the undergraduate Geography curriculum. It considers the drivers that have underpinned this development before considering the findings of research into student experiences in two universities in the south of England. The results suggest that most students view this development positively and recognize a number of advantages that it brings, citing expanded opportunities for learning, working with people from other disciplines, expansion of perspectives and perceived benefits to employability. However, for a minority this development is more problematic. The research points here to issues with specialist knowledge and disciplinary pedagogies, social issues within the classroom and class organization and some reservations regarding groupwork. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations.

AB  - The movement from STEM to STEAM, with its emphasis on real-world applications, promises to meet the changing needs of a globally connected world. However, the potential of transdisciplinarity to inspire and deepen our understanding of who we are and how we make sense of a world in turmoil remains undertheorized. This article makes a case for repositioning STEAM education as democratized enactments of transdisciplinary education, where arts and sciences are not separate or even separable endeavors. Drawing upon posthumanist theorizing, three projects will exemplify transdisciplinarity across music, mathematics, and science education. Transgressing and transcending disciplinary boundaries, and attending to both human and nonhuman perspectives, we invite a rethink of the work of schools, going beyond democratizing creativity to fully enact posthumanist transdisciplinarity.

AB  - Skills in interdisciplinary collaboration are required to address many complex problems facing society. As such, interdisciplinarity is a critical competency for students to develop. However, teachers' effectiveness in teaching interdisciplinarity is often hindered by silo structures within university faculties. To address this in the Experts in Teamwork (EiT) programme, a MSc in a Norwegian university that develops students' interdisciplinary teamwork skills through projects that address real-world challenges, a community of practice (CoP) evolved among teachers from different EiT classes. Over 20 months, CoP members participated in digital and in-person discussions, lecture exchanges, student and professional conferences, and coevaluation of student work, with an aim of better understanding interdisciplinarity and approaches for teaching it to students. The success of the CoP in achieving these aims was evaluated through a series of focus groups consisting of members of the CoP. The CoP achieved some success in fostering pedagogical conversations that were transformative for participants' understanding of interdisciplinarity in their practice. Participants reported that CoP participation influenced their interactions with students, ultimately helping students to develop a better understanding of interdisciplinarity. However, participants reported limitations in the CoP as a professional development resource, citing its newness and the required time commitment. Participants felt that these issues could be addressed via greater institutional support.

AB  - Against an increasingly compartmentalized educational landscape, we have heard urgent calls for new modes of teaching and learning. In this light, educators from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds turned to transdisciplinarity and the arts for a possible response. The educational initiatives being developed and the related literature are situated across a wide range of themes, disciplines, and methodologies. The fragmented nature of the academic discussion inhibits our capacity to think through the implications of mobilizing the concept of transdisciplinarity within the arts and education. This study addresses the lack of an overview by conducting a systematic review of the literature characterized by a triangular interest in higher education, transdisciplinarity, and the arts. The documents under review amount to 458 unique scientific papers. In our results, we present a metaphorical scale -- moving from buzzwords to a theoretically delineated usage -- to make sense of the use and conceptualization of transdisciplinarity and we introduce three main ways how the arts are part of transdisciplinary educational compositions. In bringing together literature on education, the arts, and transdisciplinarity, we shed light on relevant similarities between thinking and doing that too often operates in isolation. As such, we aim to facilitate opportunities for mutual learning and present an improved vantage point from which to consider how decisions regarding particular conceptualizations and positionalities feed into our artistic and educational practices.

AB  - There is much anecdotal evidence of the benefits of fieldwork, but a small amount of research has been carried out on the value of fieldwork for student learning. Existing studies have focused on analysing fieldwork in mostly disciplinary and national contexts and the effects of interdisciplinary fieldwork on student learning have not been fully analysed. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing empirical evidence of the impact interdisciplinarity and internationality have on student learning while carrying out fieldwork. The case study consists of three field courses in Portugal in which biology, geography and geology students from Germany and Portugal took part. Based on a group interview with twelve students, their experiences, perceived learning outcomes and overall success of the fieldwork are evaluated. The results support the initial assumptions that interdisciplinary and international fieldwork adds value above and beyond the traditional field experience, and has a positive effect on the learning experience of the students. The students agree they have learned to better define their own study field and the interconnections with other disciplines. They also reported improved communication skills and methodological abilities and now feel better prepared to meet academic challenges and careers beyond campus.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity in the classroom is predominantly championed around a need to address pressing social problems by integrating knowledge from diverse disciplines. But can interdisciplinary teaching take shape without the usual problem-solving frame? And are there new methods/mediums through which to explore interdisciplinarity? These questions have led to new and promising developments related to podcasting, active learning, and interdisciplinarity in the classroom. Through the lens of Travelling Concepts, we reflect on our experiences in the making and using of the podcast series -- Travelling Concepts on Air -- to better understand interdisciplinarity. We show the value of students not only listening to podcasts as a supplementary means of learning, but also creating podcasts as a form of active learning.

AB  - Higher education has increasingly been called upon to develop interdisciplinary programs -- particularly in STEM fields -- that prepare students to address multi-faceted, real world problems. While the tensions between disciplinary cultures and interdisciplinary programs have been previously studied, relatively little is known about the experiences of students in interdisciplinary programs. In this grounded theory study, we interviewed 45 STEM students and alumnx from an interdisciplinary program at a public research institution to examine how individuals understand and integrate interdisciplinary perspectives into their academic pathways. Our findings demonstrate that participants moved through stages of interdisciplinarity regarding choice, navigation, and integration.

AB  - There has long been a disconnect between the labour market for translators and translator education. Most research on this disconnect focuses on either industry or education in isolation, leaving the problem unsolved. To address this gap, this study examines both industrial and educational perspectives on transdisciplinarity in translators' domain competence through an epistemological lens. Three types of data are collected: translation-related job ads, curriculum plans of Master of Translation and Interpretation (MTI) programmes, and semi-structured interviews with teachers-cum-translators. The findings, derived from data mining and textometric analyses of targeted job ads together with content analyses of both curriculum plans and interviews, show a shared epistemological understanding in industry and education of new forms of knowledge pertaining to domain-specific translation tasks. Alongside this shared understanding, we highlight misalignment between market needs for and training on knowledge about cross-boundary collaborations, and we explore the transdisciplinary domain competence required to cope with a complex-market reality using a common language shared with stakeholders. The implications for a transdisciplinary approach to translator education are also discussed.

AB  - Transdisciplinary learning--where students develop and apply knowledge from multiple disciplines to solve open-ended problems--is necessary to prepare students for the most pressing real-world problems. Because transdisciplinary education often requires reimagining the content and design of undergraduate science courses, it can be a challenge for instructors to envision how such work might take place. In this article, we share an example of an undergraduate course developed at the intersection of animal sensory biology and robotics engineering. Students in the course developed knowledge from both disciplines to design a robot that could mimic the sensory behaviors of some animals to achieve a predetermined task. We share examples of students' work in the course and evidence of how students' perceptions of science and engineering changed throughout their participation in the course. Additionally, we describe how we adapted a hybrid model of collaboration that made it feasible for students to work together on an open-ended project requiring access to robotics equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This course can serve as a model for instructors working to incorporate more interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary perspectives into existing science courses.

AB  - Intersecting pressures within higher education ask geographers to be ever-more applied, global, community-engaged, field-based, and sustainable. Particularly within the liberal arts education systems, we navigate these pressures for both students seeking geography degrees and those completing their general education. While aspirational if often economically driven, these goals are in some ways contradictory. How can a course be both field and community based? How can a program deliver global "and" sustainable experiences? Where is the balance between applied practice and critical theory? Focusing beyond these high-level questions, while nevertheless engaging with them, we question the very possibility of drawing upon the legacy of community-based field research to offer a study away experience to students that not only teaches sustainable tourism, but practices it. Using autoethnographic fieldnotes and student surveys, we ask how field-based programs may show significant curricular application both within and beyond geography. We do so via a case study of our Amtrak Tourism: Trains, Cities, and Sustainability domestic faculty-led study away program which seeks to simultaneously practice and teach multiple forms of place-based sustainable-tourism. Our findings point towards the significance of slow tourism and dwelling as key components necessary in navigating both the pedagogical and touristic paradoxes programs such as our face.

AB  - In response to the need for graduates to tackle global, complex problems, higher education is increasing attention towards approaches that cross the boundaries of disciplinary thinking. However, while students can benefit from learning across disciplines, employability practitioners can also benefit. Transdisciplinary approaches can prompt practitioners to rethink career education, take charge of their professional development, and redefine their identity as borderless, ever-evolving transdisciplinary employability practitioners. Within this provocation, a transdisciplinary approach to learning is introduced and questions pertinent to the seven habits of a transdisciplinary mind are posed, intended to provoke converging perspectives on employability. By refocusing practitioners' employability perspectives, higher education can enhance its capacity for career-led learning and transform the identities of those working within it.

AB  - Over the past decade, the arts' potential role in advancing mainstream transdisciplinary curriculum models, like STEM, has been more overtly recognized, both within arts and STEM communities. In this study, we explored STEAM curricula centered around data visualization, a transdisciplinary practice commonly utilized in design and STEM fields and increasingly practiced in contemporary art. Through addressing the research question "What opportunities and challenges for learning does arts-based data visualization provide Grade 4-8 students?," this study highlights the value of transdisciplinary curriculum models that incorporate the arts for fostering K-12 students' learning. However, the findings related to student engagement and teacher perceptions also raised some important questions. Which classroom contexts are most conducive to such inquiry? And, which contexts and conditions will avoid reinforcing the disciplinary hegemony that marginalizes the arts, a crucial, yet increasingly underappreciated, system of inquiry and knowledge needed for navigating life in the twenty-first century?

AB  - The knowledge of historically marginalized learners, including racially and linguistically minoritized learners, tends to be obscured in institutionalized learning contexts and by the dominant discourse of "learning loss," which was reinforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on critical ethnography and the methodology of shared walks, this article highlights intergenerational ways of knowing embodied and emplaced in the context of traditional farming sustained and mobilized by a Syrian refugee family. We illustrate what children were indeed learning in the land of refuge during the pandemic, with their family, beyond narrowly defined in-school learning. We conceptualize the recentering of intergenerational ways of knowing, often overlooked in colonial institutionalized learning spaces, as "transdisciplinary" acts for disrupting the hegemonic disciplinary formation of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

AB  - Relationships between students and external partners in work-integrated learning can vary and power dynamics, hierarchies and student agency have been under explored in research to date. Integrated research involving work-integrated learning, students as partners and transdisciplinarity presents an opportunity to enrich each of these fields. This paper presents the results of a case study of transdisciplinary project-based work-integrated learning in Australia. Our results highlight that reciprocity and the valuing of student knowledge are key elements in breaking down traditional power dynamics and enabling student agency, in line with the transdisciplinary principle of mutual learning. Participants who valued these elements in their relationship were less likely to frame the relationship in hierarchical terms and were more open to learning from one another. By empowering students to draw on their expertise and reframe challenges while also preparing partners for this kind of relationship, all parties can be positioned as learners within work-integrated learning.

AB  - In this paper, we propose novel transdisciplinary STEAM practices to enable students and teachers to model architecture using technology. Architectural modelling can foster students' mathematical knowledge and computational thinking while connecting them to other disciplines such as culture and history. Our study focuses on enabling architectural, cultural, and historical diversity in educational practices. Moreover, the study tries to foster participants' modelling skills and innovative technology use as augmented reality and 3D printing. Thus, this paper will describe three case studies from Austria, Libya, and Indonesia and how these STEAM practices were used in different ways to allow participants to express their diversities through modelling diverse architectural constructions cross-culturally. We followed a qualitative data analysis approach for the participants' interviews, questionnaires and artefacts including architectural modelling, disciplines connections and lesson plans. The data analysis resulted in emerging themes emphasizing STEAM practices' possibilities to connect architecture to culture and history and highlighting the participants' cultural diversities in each of the three case studies.

AB  - The NEP 2020 is the chief education policy of the twenty-first century, paving the way for a change from the 34-year-old National Policy on Education that was implemented in 1986. The initial pillars of NEP 2020 are Access, Equity, Quality, Affordability, and Accountability. It aims to transmute India into a flourishing information society and universal knowledge giant by making both school and college education more holistic, flexible, and multidisciplinary that will suit the 21st century and onward needs. It focuses on bringing out the individualistic and excellent capabilities of each child. A cursory glimpse of the policy causes apprehension with its attractive headlines and phrases. There is no doubt that this is an outstanding document with astonishing educational ideas, presented with a range of recommendations; some unique, some reiterated, and others reclaimed from earlier policy declarations. Terminologies and matter-of-fact imagination in the policy document seem to divert the attention of people and institutions away from the actual education world. As an investigator meticulously examines the policy's contents, one becomes more aware of the gap between key policy ideas and the present reality of education in India. This brief doctrine analysis aims to explore and exemplify some of the crucial thoughts of NEP 2020, which attempts to be holistic and multidisciplinary education. The present study has been undertaken keeping the following research questions in mind: Do we find any strong theories related to the multidisciplinary approach? What are the challenges of NEP 2020 with respect to holistic and multidisciplinary education? The present theoretical views are extremely useful for teacher educators, educational policymakers, and teachers.

AB  - This study investigated sixth-grade students' development of multidisciplinary models involving the integration of mathematics, science, and statistics, together with shared STEM practices. Mathematics and science featured a reciprocal relationship within the real-world context of tsunami inundation. Experimenting with water tubs comprising "landmasses" and "shore slopes" of varying angles, students explored how varying the slope of the shoreline affects the inundation distance. Given that organising and structuring data are essential to the creation of models as systems of representation, students' modelling revealed a basic understanding of key statistical concepts and processes, including variation and covariation, and an ability to identify trends both within and across data sets. Students were able to apply their learning in recommending ways of minimising the impact of a real-world tsunami, demonstrating how such an investigation can facilitate understanding of natural phenomena. The overall findings indicate how elementary-grade students can successfully engage in independent multidisciplinary modelling within integrated STEM investigations and develop important conceptual understandings in the process.

AB  - International research is already booming, and global problems like climate change have sparked interdisciplinary initiatives involving academics from many nations, disciplines, and tongues. Integrating the research team, the supervisors, and the doctoral students present several challenges, such as multicultural issues; integrating a good team depends on the supervision style and type of postgraduate students and how to supervise students to conduct quality research. This article examines supervisory approaches, and the challenges and rewards supervisors face while supervising diverse projects. The lectures from the Graduate Studies in Supervision course were examined, along with a literature study. Two senior supervisors from the International Business School (JIBS) and the School of Engineering at Jönköping University participated in small-scale research and observed two supervisory sessions, where were discussions and supervisor reflections. Observations, talks, and the findings of a survey based on Lee's research were compared to determine the supervisory style. The failure to define the scope and writing of the publication when a journal article is rejected after 1-2 years, which affects the trust of the student and the supervisor and the time plan in a multidisciplinary project, are just a few of the challenges that emerged during postgraduate supervision. Discovering our teaching and supervision style may help guide our students in a multidisciplinary environment. [For the full proceedings, see ED652228.]

AB  - Contemporary society of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) increasingly requires the education system (i.e., the school) to train competent, creative and proactive professionals who will be able to solve real life problems. If society is to achieve this, some key paradigm changes must occur in education. The school must first prepare a competence-based curriculum and, secondly, school practice should move away from subject-based teaching, towards an interdisciplinary STEM teaching approach. Obviously, to support this, modern learning environments and ICT solutions and tools have to be used. However, since the interdisciplinary STEM approach has already been implemented and integrated, it can be said that a new, integrated science discipline (STEM) has already emerged, together with a transdisciplinary approach to STEM learning and teaching. In the present research, a concrete case of designing, developing and producing a solar chimney was used to demonstrate an integrated approach to learning and teaching, while emphasizing especially the advantages of such an interdisciplinary (transdisciplinary) approach to teaching Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematic content. The empirical research shows that such an approach produces incomparably better results, especially on higher cognitive levels, in comparison to traditional approaches to learning and teaching.

AB  - Systems-level approaches are required for addressing the world's major challenges at the food-energy-water nexus. Taking on complex issues, such as rising food insecurity, malnutrition, and food waste, concomitant with unprecedented levels of stress on environmental systems, will necessitate that future scholars and decision makers be prepared through transdisciplinary student training. However, in higher education, students tend to be siloed within their discipline. In this study, we present a case for the development of transdisciplinary graduate student training based on an inter-institutional and fully remote group of graduate students who assembled during the COVID-19 pandemic to address the issue of food waste. We use our wide-ranging disciplinary backgrounds, high-performance transdisciplinary team training, and stakeholder feedback to develop and conduct a weeklong social media campaign to share educational resources for reducing household food waste. This work offers valuable lessons learned through the student's lens to those seeking to create or improve future transdisciplinary training methods for tackling food waste and other global grand challenges. Key insights from this process include the importance of accountability and open communication when conducting collaborative teamwork, the utility of various mobile and online tools for effectively facilitating remote group work, and the vital role of transdisciplinarity in devising creative solutions.

AB  - International field trips provide opportunities for interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary learning experiences which can be transformative. Whilst these projects are becoming popular with increasing focus on internationalisation of the curriculum, tackling global challenges and encouraging student mobility, there is scant literature on the critical pedagogical approaches which support the design and delivery of transformative learning experiences. The study described herewith examined the transformative pedagogies used to facilitate learning during interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary field trips and placements. Objectives of the study included (1) evaluating the impact of two projects related to student interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary field trips; (2) identifying best practice of teaching and learning design; and (3) providing recommendations for future higher education (HE) arrangements. The findings show that transformative learning experiences must be carefully integrated into the design of international field trips, setting up pivotal learning moments and suitable challenges which enhance reflexivity, shared learning and problem-solving.

AB  - Autistic children commonly experience mealtime difficulties; however, it is unknown what makes an effective transdisciplinary mealtime service for autistic children. This study used a realist evaluation framework to explore caregivers' and therapists' perceptions of the contexts, mechanisms and associated outcomes of a transdisciplinary mealtime management service for autistic children. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six caregivers of autistic children engaged in a transdisciplinary mealtime service and 10 therapists providing the service, with interview data analysed using a realist evaluation approach. Four-context (child factors, family factors, therapist factors and institutional parameters), three-mechanism (transdisciplinary collaboration, child-centred approach and managing caregiver expectations) and two-outcome (impact on the child and impact on the caregiver) themes were identified. Findings highlighted that transdisciplinary collaboration, a child- and family-centred approach and managing caregiver expectations are key mechanisms providing a foundation for the development of evidence-based mealtime services for autistic children.

AB  - In this design case, we describe our design process that resulted in recommendations for a four-year undergraduate curriculum in transdisciplinary studies. The case is centered on a fast-paced, two-week design "sprint" undertaken by the two authors, which involved consolidating and synthesizing program evaluation data and course designs from the three previous years of a novel undergraduate transdisciplinary degree program, creating design blueprints that outlined program-level objectives, and identifying recommendations for future course-level design. In the process of completing these hand-off materials for the incoming team of instructors, we had to work through substantial ambiguity, balancing the needs of identified learner personas, the capabilities of existing instructional team members, and the end goal of producing students that had a flexible, personal transdisciplinary identity. This case describes the design activities we used, the instances of failure that precipitated our design sprint, the instructional and institutional constraints we faced, the blueprints for future instructional design we created on the course and program level, and the ultimate failure of the degree program we sought to support.

AB  - Using a transdisciplinary approach, this paper shows how creativity studies and game design research can complement each other and open new research avenues. In order to study the role of creativity in game designers' practice, we first touch on the epistemological foundations of creativity studies and game design research. After presenting these disciplines' epistemological underpinnings, we conduct a qualitative content analysis of game design literature, using Vlad Petre Glaveanu's "creativity paradigms" as our analytical framework. According to these paradigms, the results show that creative game designers are still largely depicted in the literature as either geniuses or skillful individuals, while cultural and social aspects of creativity are overlooked despite their importance in current game design practice. All in all, an epistemological reflection is necessary to bridge the gap between creativity studies and game design studies. We conclude that a pragmatist approach is a promising avenue to bring forward a comprehensive view of creativity in game design practice. Finally, in order to establish theories suited for a wide array of disciplines, this paper also advocates for more transdisciplinarity in creativity research.

AB  - This article explores a transdisciplinary, collaborative, curriculum design project to promote institutional belonging as a driver of student engagement, and to equip graduates with the fluency to work across disciplines. It demonstrates a facilitated method, to construct learning outcomes that break with typical subject-based knowledge and associated hierarchies of expertise. After considering a small number of precedents, the authors use curriculum models to inform a design specification. Following the formation of a multidisciplinary design team, a development tool (Lego® Serious Play®) was selected for a design workshop. A qualitative analysis of the workshop transcript was then used to inform the learning outcomes for a common module to be taken by all first-year undergraduates. Finally, the article considers how the process provided a framework for collaborative design that has been implemented in further projects, and led to the creation of a growing community of practice. The project provides insights for others embarking on collaborative curriculum design initiatives, especially where transdisciplinary learning is an objective.

AB  - Transdisciplinary-based learning (TDBL) is a need of teachers in teaching where its existence offers for solutions to solve teaching and learning problems in class. In this case, the presence of TDBL in Aqidah Akhlak subject means integrating Islamic teaching into science as knowledge in a holistic way. Thus, this study aims to propose a new way of teaching by developing the learning materials for the Aqidah Akhlak subject which is integrated into TDBL. Plomp's model of research and development design is used in this research which typically includes five stages including problem analysis, design, realization, implementation, and evaluation. The result from expert validation both for student and teacher books is considered in the eligible category, highly eligible for field trial assessment, and practical category for the practical assessment. Students' performance on Aqidah Akhlak subject is dominated by moderate level rather than high one. T-test proved that the use of TDBL Aqidah Akhlak learning materials effective to be utilized in class. Through the result of the study, it can be concluded that the proposed product of TDBL Aqidah Akhlak learning materials can be used both for students and teachers. Discussion and research implications are discussed further in this study.

AB  - Transcending disciplinary boundaries is becoming increasingly important for devising solutions to the world's most pressing issues, such as climate change and food insecurity. Institutions of higher education often present challenges to teaching students how to work and innovate on transdisciplinary teams. We first define transdisciplinarity and like concepts, using these to review databases of three major funding agencies (CIHR, NSERC, and SSHRC) for awards given to inter- and transdisciplinary programs across ten fiscal years beginning 2005-2006 and ending 2014-2015 to identify trends in funding as an indicator of skill need. We then search for programs offering transdisciplinary learning opportunities at Canadian universities accounting for 71% of all students. Though the proportion of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary funded research grants has risen considerably, we found only a few examples of interdisciplinary learning opportunities for students in post-secondary education programs. Generally, while students were able to take a range of courses, instruction remained discipline-specific. Specifically, Canadian undergraduates lack an in-program, experiential, transdisciplinary learning opportunity. We propose a framework (ICON) as a solution to fill this gap. Using senior independent study courses, which often have built-in curricular flexibility, students can participate with ICON while still obtaining credit towards their degrees. We conclude that transdisciplinary education opportunities are an essential part of the undergraduate experience and should be recognized across degree programs.

AB  - This article investigates multidisciplinary teaching practices through models of General Didactics. Multidisciplinary education is gaining interest on international and national levels through policy reforms. Research on multidisciplinary teaching practices is often descriptive and there is a lack of theories to support teachers. General Didactics on the other hand builds on a long tradition of models and concepts (e.g., content, aims, and methods) relevant for the autonomous teacher who reflects on how to structure and execute the teaching practice. The didactic models of Wolfgang Klafki and Wolfgang Schulz were used when analysing two cases of multidisciplinary teaching in two Finnish primary schools. The question addressed is in what ways General Didactic principles, as defined by Klafki and Schulz, can be identified in the multidisciplinary teaching practices. The method of study is comparative, thematic analysis. The article suggests a theoretically and empirically informed didactic model for multidisciplinary teaching. Identified framing factors (school culture, collaboration, curricula) and shaping factors (subjects, competences, values and aims of education, student needs and interests, contemporary issues, methods) are included in the model for multidisciplinary teaching. The model may support teachers in planning and reflecting on multidisciplinary teaching. To strenghten its validity, the model needs to be empirically tested in different educational contexts.

AB  - Transdisciplinary collaboration has become one of the most important agendas in the field of Applied Linguistics and professional communication. Investigation into transdisciplinary collaboration has been conducted at the interface of both fields through knowledge transformation and multimethod action research. In Japan, however, investigation into transdisciplinary collaboration or transdisciplinarity still holds great potential for development. As the first step to investigate transdisciplinary collaboration, the author conducted in-depth interviews with eight Japanese business professionals who are also engaged in academic collaboration. The purpose of this study is to understand the challenges and opportunities they are currently facing in transdisciplinary collaboration and to identify shared goals that both applied linguists (academics) and business professionals can explore by focusing on shared language and knowledge transformation in business practice. The whole interview data were analysed using the Modified Grounded Theory Approach (M-GTA) (Kinoshita, 2003), in which nine basic concepts were obtained in the Open Coding Stage. These were then categorised into four larger groups in the Selective Coding Stage: (1) the current barriers for transdisciplinarity; (2) integration of theory and practice; (3) sensitivity to common ground; and (4) contribution to Japanese society. After presenting these concepts, the construction of shared language as a theme of collaboration is highlighted in the Discussion section.

AB  - Contribution: This study provides evidence for the benefit of short online courses for the transdisciplinary competence development of graduate students. It shows the significant challenges students face while learning, and provides instructional recommendations to improve students' learning quality and professionalism. Background: Developing wearable and collaborative robots require industry collaboration and transdisciplinary competence. Industry's involvement in long-term programs is becoming infeasible, and the nature of transdisciplinary learning has not been explored to inform instructional practices. Intended Outcomes: This study aimed to provide instructional recommendations based on an in-depth examination of a diverse group of graduate students' learning and teamwork experiences as well as outcomes in a 5-day online transdisciplinary course. Application Design: Thirty-one graduate students of engineering, industrial design, and health fields from four countries participated in online mixed-discipline instructional sessions and teams to address a real industry challenge. A mixed-methods approach was used to examine students' experiences and learning outcomes based on a competence measure, session participation data, student journal entries, team progress reports, team elaboration visuals, and final team presentations. Findings: Students' knowledge of industrial design, medical considerations, ethics and standards, effective teamwork, and self-regulated learning were increased. Students' high motivation helped them deal with the challenges involved. Daily student journals, team reports, and visual elaboration tools were found to be beneficial for determining the challenges and learning quality. The observed student progress within five days is promising, making it worthwhile to further explore the benefits of short online courses for increasing graduates' readiness and establishing university-industry collaborations in education.

AB  - This comment builds on the example of chat generative pretrained transformer (ChatGPT) to discuss the implications of generative AI on industry and higher education, underlining the need for more transdisciplinary digital literacy education. The release of ChatGPT has generated significant academic and professional interest and instigated a vibrant discussion on the opportunities offered and challenges posed by powerful and readily accessible generative AI reshaping teaching and learning at universities. ChatGPT has reignited an age-old debate on the impact of disruptive technologies on occupations and the labor market, but recent discussions have paid little attention to how university offerings may need to adapt. We strive to open this discussion arguing that while recent GPT technology has, indeed, made more conceivable the substitution of many tasks of white-collar and knowledge workers, and suggested an acceleration of the labor market shift towards technology-centric occupations, it has simultaneously made a stronger-than-ever case for transdisciplinary competences. Consequently, we emphasize the need to foster more transdisciplinary digital literacy in universities with curricula that provide breadth of knowledge and flexibility of mind, bridging humanities with STEM disciplines. Digital humanities education is in a unique position to promote the responsible use of generative AI, while encouraging critical reflection on its socio-cultural embeddedness.

AB  - The reason for the interest in the use of learning technologies that protect health in education is not to harm the physical and psychological health of learners in the process of training and education. After the creation of new types of innovative educational institutions, the knowledge load of learners increases, the increasing learning load can disrupt the normal development of students' central nervous system, vision, musculoskeletal system. This seriously harms the health of students. Only 5-15% of school leavers are healthy. To partially eliminate this problem, the project "Healthy Education-Healthy Nation" is being implemented in Azerbaijan to develop education. During the implementation of the project, its goals were expanded psycho-pedagogically in a local school. The goal was to develop students' thinking while maintaining their health. To achieve this goal, changes were made in the learning process: (1) The purpose of training was replaced by the purpose of learning; (2) Active training was replaced by constructive learning; (3) The structure of the knowledge of programs is based on a complete and fuzzy model; and (4) Tasks that ensure the operational development of student thinking, price criteria were created to measure the level of development. The article reflected the work done within the project. [For the full proceedings, see ED626585.]

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to develop an improved and harmonized approach to interdisciplinarity in education for sustainable development (ESD) within higher education institutions (HEIs), focusing on maximizing the mobilization of students from all academic disciplines. An attempt is made to reconcile varying strategies for the implementation of interdisciplinary ESD content in HEIs, studying the relative merit and benefit of those strategies and crafting a new approach to combining them, where possible. Design/methodology/approach: This work relies on a robust review and analysis of existing literature proposals on the implementation of ESD in HEIs to elaborate an integrated approach to interdisciplinarity. Specifically, a scoping literature review is applied, analyzing the existing approaches to ESD in HEIs as well as the challenges observed in their implementation. Using this theoretical framework, this paper evaluates the compatibility and efficiency of the approaches currently implemented. Based on this analysis, an integrative approach is outlined, building upon and combining existing proposals. Findings: Building on existing literature, this study identifies two main trends for interdisciplinarity in ESD in HEIs: integration into existing disciplinary curricula and new, stand-alone ESD curricula. This paper suggests adopting the two approaches simultaneously, to reach students from all academic disciplines, especially those with minimal exposure to ESD through their own discipline. Furthermore, this paper stresses that these dual curricula strategies should be combined with further interdisciplinary research initiatives as well as extensive leveraging of technology and e-learning. Originality/value: This study bridges the gap between diverging visions for ESD in HEIs, harmonizing strategies from the literature to outline a new, multilateral strategy. Furthermore, it extensively studies the need for increased engagement into ESD of students from underrepresented disciplines, including the humanities. This engagement has been little addressed in the literature, rendering the proposed approach original insofar as it outlines the ways to improve current approaches to ESD in HEIs.

AB  - This paper makes a theoretical contribution to the discussion of interdisciplinary knowledge in curriculum and research. As a challenge to much of the Mode 2 thesis concerned only with the importance of knowledge being socially relevant, this paper demonstrates how a Bernsteinian approach to interdisciplinarity relates to the internal configurations underpinning interdisciplinary knowledge. Inspired by explorations of Bernsteinian communities, this paper sets out to conceptualize the socio-epistemic constraints under which powerful disciplinary boundary crossing occurs. The major claim is that the boundaries between disciplines and between them and the field of practice, are essential for boundary crossing. The interdisciplinary efforts do not necessarily involve diminishing disciplinary boundaries, but they are vulnerable to external weakening when there is little connection to the disciplinary core that provides stable internal norms. This paper adds to the discussion by suggesting alternatives to interdisciplinary integration, which do not require a background intellectual consilience between disciplines. It presents an appeal for a form of interdisciplinarity that is pursued to a practical end within refining disciplinary conceptual models, without invoking exaggerated claims for 'relevance', and with no need for a more complex edifice for crossing the established borders between disciplines.

AB  - Developing as a scholar is a critical aspect of graduate school. In this article, we use an autoethnographic approach to explore our experiences in a newly redeveloped interdisciplinary graduate course. The course was designed to emphasize interdisciplinary scholarship and to encourage students' awareness of their own developing epistemological, ontological, and axiological commitments. In this paper, we identify themes that arose from the final class paper, in which the students/researchers reflected on our development as emerging scholars. Through this course we developed an understanding of the value of interdisciplinarity, the cultural embeddedness of knowledge, and our own responsibilities as researchers in relation to social structures of power and marginalization. Our analyses of our experiences suggests that reflections on our own positionality and axiology are important for developing our identities as emerging scholars and that becoming a scholar may be more about the process than an end goal. We conclude with a discussion of how our learning in this course may be relevant for other instructors and emerging scholars.

AB  - Interdisciplinary in an increasingly popular term in educational settings. Analysis of the term reveals two meanings, a characteristic of an individual (i.e., interdisciplinary thinking) and a characteristic of a group (i.e., interdisciplinary collaborations). This paper serves to delineate those two meanings while building a conceptual model of the relationship between interdisciplinary thinking and collaboration wherein the two are mutually reinforcing educational experiences. In addition to modeling the two interdisciplinary outcomes, transitionary processes are described. The first transitionary process, transfer of interdisciplinarity, encourages learner transition from interdisciplinary thinking to participating in interdisciplinary collaborations, including a focus on working in teams, appreciation for diversity, understanding the problem or phenomenon, and awareness of individual expertise. The second transitionary process, experiential interdisciplinarity, attends to the individual knowledge constructed from interdisciplinary collaborations and includes learning through reflection, managing cognitive disequilibrium, and operationalizing diverse ideas. The resultant model provides a cyclical process for engaging learners in building interdisciplinary thinking and interdisciplinary collaboration skills. Recommendations are made for the application of the model in research and educational efforts to increase the interdisciplinarity of agriculture, food, and natural resources education.

AB  - Policy-makers and provincial governments have a responsibility to prioritise equity, diversity, inclusion and accessibility (EDIA) with approaches that leverage both intersectionality and transdisciplinarity, especially when looking at literacies research. Supported by a federally funded knowledge synthesis grant that surveyed the scope of EDIA in Canadian schools, this article focuses on youth marginalisation to address literacies learning. The authors address five concepts from a three-phase literature review to examine inclusive practices that respect, acknowledge and address EDIA in K-12 education. Across reviewed studies, there is an underlying trajectory outlining methodological challenges in implementing EDIA practices. We advance anti-racist and abolitionist approaches by addressing five areas: (1) making learning more accessible by adopting culturally responsive pedagogy informed by local cultures, languages and values; (2) pursuing sustainable professional development in culturally inclusive teaching practices; (3) creating safer school environments that nurture community-driven relationships between parents, students and their teachers; (4) reforming educational policies to concretely address structural racism, discrimination and misrepresentation of socially marginalised students by disrupting what is conceptualised and accepted as ideal culturally responsive pedagogy; and (5) prioritising community perspectives and input curriculum decisions to support underrepresented students. Ultimately, this article echoes this issue's orientations as it explores transdisciplinary practices composing an evolving understanding of literacies.

AB  - What should science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM) education look like? In the context of educational policy, the STEAM conversation has intensified and spread across the United States and some other counties (Eger, 2015; Yakman & Lee, 2012). This article advocates an arts-integrated approach to STEAM education and discusses the potential of this approach for opening up a transdisciplinary space. This space will therefore be capable of fostering an "innovated" society. Here, the author suggests that teachers can create a transdisciplinary space in their own STEAM lessons by designing assignments that engage with multiple disciplines and thereby nourish students' ability in transferring learning in multiple disciplines.

AB  - Contribution: A multidisciplinary computational framework to support undergraduate engineering education is introduced. It is posed as an open-source tool that students can use to understand and apply computational methods commonly required in engineering problems. Background: This framework development is motivated by past experiences of teaching courses as segregated disciplines within an aerospace engineering curriculum. Reviewing pedagogical approaches shows that current university practices do not adequately emphasize or demonstrate the importance of interdisciplinary relationships. This framework is also motivated by the apparent need for engineering graduates to study these relationships by learning computational engineering via programming, in which proficiency is becoming increasingly important for their future careers. Intended Outcomes: 1) To effectively teach multidisciplinary engineering concepts to students via the integration of cross-disciplinary content from various courses and 2) To improve computational and programming literacy among undergraduate students in engineering studies. Application Design: A multidisciplinary design optimization approach is adopted to develop a framework called Multidisciplinary Aircraft Design Education (MADE), which provides functionalities for studying engineering disciplines within a computational programming environment. MADE makes the related course contents more accessible and intuitive to students by using reactive computational notebooks in lectures, tutorials, and assignments. Findings: MADE is assessed based on the learning outcomes and feedback from undergraduate students of two courses within an aerospace engineering curriculum. These assessments indicate an improved understanding of multidisciplinary concepts and their applications via computational programming, as reflected in the positive responses from the students.

AB  - This paper provides a multidisciplinary methodological review and guidance for using a theory of change in education -- an approach, process, and product focused on visually diagramming and narratively discussing how an initiative or set of activities works to generate change, for whom, and under what circumstances and assumptions. Drawing on a critical conceptual framework and established yet disparate research and guidance published in multiple disciplines, the review delineates foundational considerations for educational researchers, evaluators, and/or practitioners, from planning for the process to developing and using a theory of change. The review also discusses future directions for research on and applications of this approach for educational issues and contexts.

AB  - The new transdisciplinary nature of industrial product design should be appropriately addressed by post-secondary institutions and engineering schools in their curricula to ensure high quality of engineering design education and its applicability to industrial demands. To achieve this, a new transdisciplinary teaching methodology is required. This paper presents the results of a pilot trial of a new transdisciplinary teaching approach to engineering design education based on Bloom's Taxonomy and a comparative analysis of the cognitive game task performed by both professors and fours groups of students to investigate the differences in their design thinking. The approach included the knowledge component in the form of a lecture, a cognitive game task developed to map the design thinking of engineers, and administration of a modified sample design problem. The knowledge components consisted of a guest lecture on transdisciplinary engineering design and disciplinary differences. The cognitive task involved the formation of design activities and their placement along a general design process. The modification of the sample design problem involved the application of action verbs of Bloom's Taxonomy to create guiding steps to guide students' thinking while solving the problem. The results revealed a strong relation between engineering design activity and cognitive mental activity in both students and professors. The course instructors who piloted the new approach provided positive feedback finding it to be a "useful element" for the introduction of transdisciplinarity as well as for students' reflection on their design thinking. In addition, the application of Bloom's Taxonomy in design problems suggested potential improvements in students' performance on design tasks. The results of this study are applicable for the development of engineering design courses and transdisciplinary projects.

AB  - In recent times, there has been a surge of impact-oriented, transdisciplinary research programmes and projects integrating multiple disciplines, types of knowledge and practices. An essential element often mentioned in the literature to improve the performance of these programmes and support impact delivery is continuous reflection and learning via evaluation. We argue that because a standard format for organizing transdisciplinary research does not exist, tailor-made evaluation approaches designed around the specificities of each programme are needed. The existing evaluation literature provides useful building blocks that can be integrated and adapted to specific transdisciplinary research contexts. In this article, we develop the valorization cycle and apply it to evaluate a transdisciplinary research programme in the water sector. The building blocks of our approach are: understanding of valorization as a cyclical process; theory of change as a logic model to structure the evaluation; productive interactions as a process indicator articulated in learning outcomes (cognitive, relational, and strategic); and impact pathways as narratives to explain impact dynamics. Our framework is based both on research evaluation and learning literature and on our personal experience in the evaluation of transdisciplinary research. The evaluation of the programme showed how the valorization cycle can point to different learning outcomes across the research process that are conducive to impact, and provided useful insights to the programme managers to adjust the programme. The principle of tailoring an evaluation approach to the specificities of the programme evaluated using building blocks from the literature will be applicable in other transdisciplinary contexts too.

AB  - Objective: To optimize healthcare for gender-diverse students at a large, public university's Student Health and Wellness (SHW) Center. Methods: SHW professionals from medicine, gynecology, health promotion, counseling, psychiatry, and disability services developed a multidisciplinary gender-diverse care team (GDCT) in 2016. The GDCT's team-based design was created to support a diverse student body and provide extra resources to a vulnerable population, ensuring students engage fully in the University. Results: The GDCT has assisted approximately 93 unique students, in-person or by phone with clinical or supportive care. The number of students presenting with questions pertaining to transgender and gender-diverse health care has increased since 2016. Conclusions: Having a comprehensive, multidisciplinary GDCT available within a university SHW provides transgender and gender-diverse students with access to a safe, inclusive, and resource-rich environment to seek care and serves as a potential model for other college health centers.

AB  - In education, a multidisciplinary approach is needed in order to address many of today's multifaceted challenges. Though multidisciplinary educational approaches have been shown to have benefits on learning, many studies show that teachers often struggle to implement multidisciplinary education, partially due to lack of time and planning. To overcome the challenges related to implementation, a clear format to plan multidisciplinary education is called for. This article presents a tool named the Planning Canvas to guide teachers in the planning process. Lending from business development, project management and educational theory and practice, the Planning Canvas was created to help teachers and school principals plan multidisciplinary education in a structured manor, using guiding questions. The Canvas was tested among a small cohort of experienced teachers and results show that the tool helped the teachers conceptualise and plan multidisciplinary education more effectively. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - In response to the urgent need for teachers to be better equipped with strategies for responding to students who suffer the effects of complex trauma (CT), this inter-disciplinary study investigated the lived experiences of professionals (social workers, psychologists, criminal justice workers and community workers) working with school students with CT in out-of-school contexts. The aim of this study was to formulate strategic approaches from the expertise of out-of-school professionals and specialists that might be adapted for use within pre-service teacher education programs to better prepare the next generation of teachers with the skills needed for working with trauma-affected students. Using a phenomenological methodology and working through an ecological-psychosocial theoretical lens, this qualitative study found three key categories of understandings and skills used as a common approach amongst specialists working with students suffering the effects of CT: an applied understanding of child development, a capacity to read and adjust classroom environment and climate; and underpinning theoretical knowledge of the effects of trauma on young people's behaviour.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research is gathering increasing support from sustainability scholars, however, there is little dialogue between scholarship on interdisciplinarity and interdisciplinary environmental science education. The aim of this paper is to take stock of the insights of studies of interdisciplinary research to inform environmental research and education. We take as our case study a research centre in Spain, which created an interdisciplinary PhD programme on climate change. The analysis is based on 18 interviews with PhD students and supervisors. We focus on: (1) the need to train experts while redefining expertise outside of disciplinary boundaries; (2) the practical and institutional challenges of interdisciplinarity in the context of PhD training; and (3) the challenges of assessing the quality across disciplines. Our results show that conflicts with institutional requirements lead to a tendency to abandon interdisciplinary aspects and to the training of experts narrowly centred on the specific problem they analyse.

AB  - It is no surprise that concern for the future is on the rise. Several catastrophes obscure our future(s) imaginary, such as climate change, a global pandemic, racial inequality, and political polarization. Students are feeling a disconnect between what they learn in classrooms and the futures that populate their media platforms. Futures literacies provides one proposed pedagogical intervention that takes up future(s) possibility as a context for inquiry across the disciplines. Building upon and extending from the discipline of futures studies, which involves inquiry into possible, probable, and preferable futures through social and technological advancements, futures literacies refers to the ways we perceive, sense, enact, envision, and create the future in the present. In this interdisciplinary review, we synthesize research that investigates the ways humans engage with future potentiality, moving toward an expansive model of futures literacies and mapping generative connections between literacy research and other discourses including futures studies scholarship.

AB  - Problem- and project-based learning (PBL) is often highlighted as a valuable approach for addressing the need for interdisciplinarity in engineering education. However, studies indicate that applied projects in engineering education tend to be limited to a single discipline. This article presents a new project typology which can be applied in engineering education. The typology is based on an action research study in a systemic PBL environment. The model presented has two dimensions: a) the complexity of teams, ranging from single team to networks of teams, and b) the complexity of interdisciplinarity, ranging from disciplinary projects to broad interdisciplinary projects. This results in the identification of six different project types. This typology can be used as a conceptual framework for interdisciplinary learning throughout engineering education. The project types embrace both single-team projects and larger projects consisting of multiple teams working together on complex problems.

AB  - This paper reports on the design of a multimodal metalanguage developed by teacher education researchers to support pre-service teachers' understandings of critical literacy and critical health literacies in a changing communication landscape. The design of metalanguage constitutes the first stage of an ongoing transdisciplinary project, Multiliteracies Across Teaching Areas (MATA), which aims to design and implement cohesive disciplinary multiliteracies pedagogies across teaching areas of an initial teacher education (ITE) programme. The focus on metalanguage design is motivated by concerns shared by critical literacy scholars and scholars in health literacy to balance deconstruction of texts with actionable response through the 'deep moral grammar of narrative' Kindenberg and Freebody ("Australian Journal of Language and Literacy, 44"(2), 90-99, 2021). Such concerns also align with recent World Health Organisation calls for the use of solution-oriented literacies to empower communities. These sociocultural understandings of critical literacy and Kindenberg and Freebody's ("Australian Journal of Language and Literacy, 44"(2), 90-99, 2021) call to balance 'the analytical' and the narrative' in critical literacy practice provide the starting point for designing metalanguage for transdisciplinary research in Health and Physical Education (HPE) and English. We firstly review relevant models of the critical informing both subject areas to establish synergous understandings and then analyse expectations of critical practice in descriptions and elaborations of the HPE and English curricula. We provide an overview of the semiotic resources available for transdisciplinary conversations within the English curriculum with clarifying 'bridging' terminology informed by social semiotic descriptions. Through close analysis of four representative texts selected for critical literacy practice by English and HPE teacher educators in the MATA project, we demonstrate how such metalanguage was shared to build understandings of both critical analysis and actionable response. Along with analytical features to build and analyse issues according to disciplinary criteria, we show how stories are used to build rapport with their diverse audiences and to motivate their peers to take positive health action.

AB  - This paper reports a design and implementation of a STEM enrichment programme infused with affective elements designed for Hong Kong students. Specifically, it features a design-thinking approach to develop solutions to a self-selected problem addressing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Around 30 upper primary school (grades 5 to 6) and 20 lower secondary students (grades 7 to 10) enrolled in the study. Considering empathy as a core value of the design-thinking process and aligned with affective dimensions of thinking and learning, we investigate students' design-thinking development and STEM learning processes while highlighting empathy map as a pedagogical tool. We discuss the implications and insights of offering humanistic perspectives on STEM curricular design, especially for K-12 students. Our results showed that students at different age range were able to use empathy maps to devise designs effectively, despite their varying degrees of empathy. Furthermore, we conceptualize empathy maps as a pedagogical tool that creates physical boundaries in design thinking, making students' mental transitions across design stages more explicit. This study contributes to a better understanding of the educational potentials of design-thinking enhanced classrooms, with the results informing theoretical and practical advice on the integration of the empathy map in innovation-oriented projects.

AB  - Self-determination consists of essential skills for students with disabilities because it gives individuals the power to make decisions based on their own needs and desires. Self-determination includes areas such as choice-making, goal setting, and self-directed learning. Music therapy is a service that can be used to enhance self-determination for students within the educational setting. Through intentional collaboration, music therapists and special educators can bring together their expertise to promote self-determination in students with disabilities. As members of students' Individualized Educational Programs (IEPs), both professionals are working towards the common interest of fulfilling individuals' goals and needs. The authors of this manuscript outline and describe a three-step process for collaboration between music therapists and special educators to promote self-determination among students while also providing a vignette to demonstrate this practice.

AB  - The new degree in the Global Digital Humanities has been launched by the Faculty of Humanities and Education at Mondragon University on its new urban campus of Bilbao AS Fabrik. In a time of increasing urbanisation, universities must reflect on their relationship to surrounding cities and regions and develop ways to incorporate the urban and regional setting in their educational offerings. This BA shows the value of a transdisciplinary Action Research approach in facing complex social challenges and contributing to innovative social transformations in the city and region. The new campus also marks the beginning of an internal university process to develop mutual knowledge and greater permeability between different degree programmes in pursuit of a new organisational culture and practice that moves beyond narrow disciplinary models.

AB  - Sustainability transitions need professionals with specific skills and attitudes that students often do not develop in their regular chemistry education. To foster sustainability change-maker competencies, we suggest augmenting higher education curricula, e.g., chemical degree programs, with transdisciplinary challenge-based learning combined with design thinking. The Da Vinci Project at Utrecht University (UU) in The Netherlands explores this approach, aiming to cultivate the undergraduates' sustainability change-maker competencies. After five years of experience, we reflected on the students' learning outcomes in this UU honors program. We conclude that transdisciplinary challenge-based education combined with design thinking provides unique opportunities for students to develop valuable skills and attitudes for navigating sustainability transitions, including the transition toward sustainable chemistry. These involve collaboration, communication, creative thinking, integrative problem-solving, stakeholder engagement, openness, empathy, the ability to deal with uncertainty and complexity, self-awareness, critical reflection, courage, and perseverance.

AB  - Transition from high school to higher education poses a significant challenge for students, particularly in chemistry, where students' prior laboratory experience is varied. Traditional laboratory education, focusing on chemical knowledge, scientific methodology, and practical skills, does not focus on the development of translational skills and establishing a proper level of self-efficacy, critical for students' success as future scientists. To address this problem, we developed the Chemical Kitchen, a transdisciplinary simulation utilizing the parallels between professional gastronomy and chemistry laboratory practices. By engaging students in creative food experiments that mimic chemistry experiments, the course aims to enhance practical skills in a less intimidating environment. We evaluated the impact of the Chemical Kitchen on students' self-efficacy through pre- and postcourse surveys. We found a significant adjustment in students' self-efficacy: those with initially lower self-efficacy experienced increases, while those with initially higher self-efficacy saw decreases, showing a "leveling of the playing field" among first-year chemistry students. Qualitative feedback highlighted the course's success in providing a fun, engaging, and meaningful learning experience, underscoring the importance of innovative teaching methods in enhancing practical skills and confidence. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the Chemical Kitchen in establishing students' self-efficacy and practical and transferable skills, offering a novel approach to laboratory education that could be beneficial across various scientific disciplines. Future research is encouraged to explore the long-term effects of such interventions on students' engagement with science and their overall development as learners.

AB  - In modern higher education, nurturing successful interdisciplinary collaboration is both an institutional priority and a grand organizational and cultural challenge. Recent scholarship describes the many and varied challenges inherent in the enactment of interdisciplinarity; it also explores how these challenges can be mitigated to spur successful interdisciplinary engagement. While much attention has been focused on interdisciplinary scholarship and pedagogy, might interdisciplinary service collaborations also play a role? This qualitative case study probes a particular type of interdisciplinary collaboration--a cross-disciplinary committee convened to hire interdisciplinary faculty members. Using interview and observational data to uncover the lived experiences of committee members across campus at one U.S.-based R1 institution, this study explores service-work as a potential site of positive experience and successful interdisciplinary collaboration. Illuminated by the Shared Cognitive-Emotional-Interactive (SCEI) platform for interdisciplinary research collaboration by Boix Mansilla et al. (2016), findings reveal myriad positive outcomes tied to faculty's service participation, probe the multifaceted reasons that faculty choose to participate, and explore how they experience this work. Analysis also uncovers limited cognitive yet significant emotional and interactive markers of and factors that facilitate a successful interdisciplinary collaborative process. Evidence of these markers and factors serves to "reframe" interdisciplinary service as an instance of successful interdisciplinary collaboration, a site of faculty learning and a context that fosters campus connections among faculty. In uncovering these benefits of interdisciplinary collaborative service, this work suggests ways in which it may serve as a missing link to build and strengthen an interdisciplinary campus community.

AB  - The role of interdisciplinarity in achieving authentic and transformative learning outcomes is both contested and complex. At the same time, traditional disciplinary ways of being, doing and knowing have been further tested by the impact of COVID-19 on students, schools and communities. In Tasmania, already experiencing amongst the lowest levels of educational attainment in Australia, the educational implications of COVID-19 have been polarising. Preliminary reports have employed interdisciplinary perspectives to understand how the situation is unfolding. Extremes of privilege and poverty have intensified, with accentuated disadvantage experienced by already vulnerable groups, whilst ingenuity, adaptability and innovation have flourished elsewhere. The spectrum and range of this polarisation yield compelling evidence for the inadequate address of complex societal problems through singular disciplines or institutions. This article explores storied data generated from the intersections of interdisciplinary strategy enacted across three settings: education, creative industries and community-based arts practice. The data derive from two Tasmanian case studies where interdisciplinary collaboration between the education sector, creative industries and community is well established. In subsequent discussion, the multidisciplinary authorship team make and offer meaning from participatory lived experiences of pursuing social justice outcomes prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. From this, we posit how lived experiences of interdisciplinarity impact social justice enterprise in times of increasingly complex socio-economic challenge. In addressing these concerns, we elucidate the role interdisciplinarity plays in both enabling and inhibiting social justice imperatives shared across education, creative industry and community-based arts practice immediately prior to and during a global pandemic. In so doing, we elicit the ways interdisciplinary practices, partnerships and priorities recalibrate in response to global challenges.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity is widely considered necessary to solving many contemporary problems, and new funding structures and instruments have been created to encourage interdisciplinary research at universities. In this article, we study a small technical university specializing in green technology which implemented a strategy aimed at promoting and developing interdisciplinary collaboration. It did so by reallocating its internal research funds for at least five years to "research platforms" that required researchers from at least two of the three schools within the university to participate. Using data from semi-structured interviews from researchers in three of these platforms, we identify specific tensions that the strategy has generated in this case: (1) in the allocation of platform resources; (2) in the division of labor and disciplinary relations; and (3) in choices over scientific output and academic careers. We further show how the particular platform format exacerbates the identified tensions in our case. We suggest that certain features of the current platform policy incentivize shallow interdisciplinary interactions, highlighting potential limits on the value of attempting to push for interdisciplinarity through internal funding.

AB  - At the university level, writing groups have shown to be useful to teach and learn research writing as well as to advance academic-scientific publication and to discover collaboration opportunities among members from different disciplinary fields. At the same time, peer review, an important practice in the academic sphere, is learned within the groups through mutual peer feedback. A key feature of a writing group's formation and progress is connected to how it is organised. One of the variables that seems to influence a group is interdisciplinarity. Nevertheless, the impact of the greater or lesser disciplinary distance in a group's functioning has not been analysed in depth to determine its advantages or disadvantages. This article analyses interdisciplinarity of writing groups in two Latin American countries. In Argentina, the writing groups were formed by master's and doctoral students in the process of writing their thesis, while the writing groups in Ecuador were formed by early career academics and experienced research professors. The analysis of interview and group session transcriptions of the groups in both countries indicates that disciplinary distance mainly presents advantages if the distance is not too great, if there is, as one member put it, a 'close distance.' In this sense, research writing becomes, it seems, a meeting point for members, facilitating enriching exchanges.

AB  - Undergraduate students often have a choice about the modality in which they complete a particular course (in-person or online), and their decisions can be more complex than scholarship suggests. Most studies of modality choice have relied exclusively on closed-form, quantitative surveys; and this approach has denied students the opportunity to correct or complicate researchers' assumptions about their decision-making. We present findings from one of the largest and most comprehensive studies yet conducted on undergraduates' choice of course modality, which provided students with the opportunity to explain their choices in their own words. Our data reveal complexities of undergraduates' modality choice not mentioned previously in the literature, and open new avenues for research. They also have implications for course design during the period of COVID-19, by identifying features of in-person courses that instructors may wish to replicate in their emergency remote teaching for in-person students suddenly forced online.

AB  - Introduction: The scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) should promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and social justice for the next generation of psychologists. Statement of the Problem: I worry that the SoTL propagates an exclusionary field that becomes increasingly irrelevant in our diverse society given that graduate curricula largely exclude scholarship on structural inequality. Literature Review: I detail the process of graduate curricular changes in my current department, with a focus on my new required graduate course, Diversity, Systems, and Inequality. I utilize scholarship from law, sociology, philosophy, women and gender studies, education, and psychology. Teaching Implications: I provide the structure and content of the course--including syllabi and lecture slides--as well as modes of assessment that promote inclusivity and critical thinking. I detail how current faculty can learn to incorporate the content of this work into their own teaching and scholarship through weekly journal clubs. Conclusion: SoTL outlets can publish transdisciplinary, inclusive course materials regarding structural inequality, thus mainstreaming and amplifying such work for the benefit of the field and our world.

AB  - Belonging is a critical factor for supporting student success and well-being in school. Unfortunately, the work of fostering belonging at school for all students continues to face significant challenges. One reason is that the field of education is working from a limited conception of school belonging, based mainly in the discipline of psychology. Belonging is more than just a psychological sense--it is also a social, cultural, and even political process. In this article, Paul Kuttner explores six aspects of belonging that are underemphasized in the school belonging literature, arguing that we should think of school belonging as agentic, intersectional, systemic, political, place-based, and a right. Kuttner proposes a definition of belonging that encompasses these aspects and uses it to suggest future directions for research and practice.

AB  - The medical education (Med Ed) research community characterises itself as drawing on the insights, methods, and knowledge from multiple disciplines and research domains (e.g. Sociology, Anthropology, Education, Humanities, Psychology). This common view of Med Ed research is echoed and reinforced by the narrative used by leading Med Ed departments and research centres to describe their activities as "interdisciplinary." Bibliometrics offers an effective method of investigating scholarly communication to determine what knowledge is valued, recognized, and utilized. By empirically examining whether knowledge production in Med Ed research draws from multiple disciplines and research areas, or whether it primarily draws on the knowledge generated internally within the field of Med Ed, this article explores whether the characterisation of Med Ed research as interdisciplinary is substantiated. A citation analysis of 1412 references from research articles published in 2017 in the top five Med Ed journals was undertaken. A typology of six knowledge clusters was inductively developed. Findings show that the field of Med Ed research draws predominantly from two knowledge clusters: the Applied Health Research cluster (made of clinical and health services research), which represents 41% of the references, and the Med Ed research cluster, which represents 40% of the references. These two clusters cover 81% of all references in our sample, leaving 19% distributed among the other knowledge clusters (i.e., Education, disciplinary, interdisciplinary and topic centered research). The quasi-hegemonic position held by the Applied Health and Med Ed research clusters confines the other sources of knowledge to a peripheral role within the Med Ed research field. Our findings suggest that the assumption that Med Ed research is an interdisciplinary field is not convincingly supported by empirical data and that the knowledge entering Med Ed comes mostly from the health research domain.

AB  - Purpose: There are growing expectations that students graduating from health courses and current health professionals have some proficiency in using telehealth. However, there is limited accessibility to multidisciplinary-based material to meet this need. This paper describes the development of an online telehealth education resource using a co-design approach and the strengths and challenges of embedding authentic learning principles in an open-access online course with a broad target audience. Design/methodology/approach: The authors first describe the co-design process of the course and discuss the pedagogy underpinning the course design. Then learner enrolment data is discussed to evidence uptake across key characteristics. Finally, the authors assess the efficacy of the co-design approach by analysing feedback collected from learners at the end of the course. Findings: The course is structured across four modules and comprises interactive content, reflective tasks, case studies and purposefully developed digital material. Responses from the working group and from learner feedback indicate that the course is an authentic and relevant introduction to telehealth practice for both health students and current health professionals, despite some limitations. Originality/value: This case study demonstrates the value of a co-design process and key learning design choices in online course development to meet the educational needs of learners from broad disciplinary backgrounds, in various stages of learning/understanding of telehealth and/or requiring a practice-based resource in the context of a rapidly changing policy environment.

AB  - Transdisciplinary (TD) graduate training programs are growing in number, yet little is known about their effectiveness or the development of TD attitudes and behaviors among students over time. This prospective longitudinal mixed methods study compares graduate students participating in a federally funded TD training program with non-participating students from the same disciplines and degree programs (n = 26). The Interdisciplinary Perspectives Index (IPI) and Behavior Change Collaborative Activity Index (BCCAI) were used to assess TD attitudes and behaviors at beginning, middle, and end of an MPH/PhD program. Additionally, a multiple case-based approach was used to further analyze changes among the TD students at three time points (n = 10), including a novel sketch protocol to elicit TD student conceptualizations (mental maps) of TD teams. Four assessments were used to construct an overall TD orientation score. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests showed TD behaviors increased over time only among TD students, and favorable TD attitudes were high at baseline and did not change for any group. Generalized Estimating Equations showed that TD behaviors were higher among TD students than traditional students at both mid and endpoint, with no difference at baseline. Visual assessments showed TD students' mental maps of TD research and team science, elicited under a novel sketch protocol, reflected greater integration and organization by endpoint. Two developmental patterns of increasing overall TD orientation emerged among the TD students. This article reports findings and insights applicable to TD graduate education and curriculum design and introduces a novel visual assessment tool.

AB  - Doctoral training programs and centers (DTP/C) serve as the nexus of research and teaching through networking, training, business, and industrial engagements. This paper used systematic reviews on selected searched phrases from Google Scholar, University of Nottingham Library, Research Gate and SCOPUS, and many other credible and indexed journal sites for relevant literature. The study revealed musingly that DTP/C is an advanced transdisciplinary platform of coproducing knowledge to address complex problems. This paper recommends that using a transparent communication process, setting up clear goals and targets with students with noncoercive consent, and strengthening the formal and institutional structures that take care of and address every actor's need and requirement are critical.

AB  - Pediatric feeding disorders are common and are often associated with chronic medical conditions and developmental disorders. A multidisciplinary treatment approach may be offered through outpatient or intensive programs. Benefit has been demonstrated with intensive programs, but there is little data regarding outpatient approaches. We described outcomes from a well-established outpatient feeding assessment program related to the referral base and program outcomes. Study packets collecting demographics and self-reported feeding skills were distributed to the referral population and redistributed three months later. Standardized surveys implemented included Montreal Children's Hospital Feeding Scale (MCH-FS) and parenting stress index (PSI-SF). One hundred and ninety-eight subjects completed the initial packet. MCH-FS was elevated in all subjects indicating a broad range of feeding concerns. PSI elevation was present in a broad range of comorbidities compared to group without comorbidities. At 3 months (n = 55), MCH-FS and feeding skills improved without change in PSI-SF. The quality of therapy overall was deemed excellent to above average by most subjects. A multidisciplinary outpatient program has a role in managing infants and children with feeding disorders regardless of comorbidity. Severely affected individuals may benefit from more intensive programs and/or may require long-term care to effect significant change.

AB  - Hyflex describes a course format that combines both online and in-person elements, allowing students the flexibility to attend class in person, participate remotely in real-time (synchronously), or complete all coursework at their own pace (asynchronously). This study was conducted to explore student and instructor experiences with Hyflex teaching, focusing on its flexibility and its impact on student success and engagement. In addition, we evaluated whether Hyflex teaching is a positive experience for instructors compared to traditional in-person teaching methods. For this study, we conducted pre- and post-semester student surveys, a post-semester student focus group survey, and post-semester instructor interviews. All three instructors had no prior Hyflex training and worked with an instructional designer to create Hyflex courses that followed best design practices. Overall, we found the design process demanding yet beneficial for students. Instructors noted varying levels of student engagement in their Hyflex courses, with in-person students generally more engaged than online or asynchronous remote students. Instructors also faced technological challenges and the need to adapt lab activities for remote students. Students in the focus group emphasized the flexibility of the Hyflex design, course organization, challenges with technology, and engagement. Overall, we believe in the potential of Hyflex instruction, especially for cross-disciplinary studies with some recommendations. These recommendations include adjustment to instructor workload and use of Hyflex primarily in upper division courses.

AB  - Considers multidisciplinary perspectives as a lens through which to view gifted education research. In the spirit of scholars who have also sought to ask field strengthening questions to help improve scientific advance, we address four questions and encourage other scholars from all disciplines to ask their own questions: (1) What if the field is much larger than we think it is? (2) What if the field is less intellectually diverse than we think it is? (3) What if the evidence supporting the efficacy of gifted programming is not as strong as we think it is? and (4) What if gifted learners may actually be okay even if they are not fully challenged? After reviewing evidence supporting (and failing to support) the core idea behind each of these questions (with a U. S. focus and for academically-gifted students in more academic domains) we conclude with ideas about continuing to ask field strengthening questions to improve research. We should explore questions and ideas and established findings from disciplines outside gifted and try to make gifted a more multidisciplinary field by being open to learning from other ways of approaching knowledge through a plurality of methods and disciplinary perspectives.

AB  - Leadership education as a field of study has largely been considered multi- or interdisciplinary, yet many leadership educators find their programs siloed within the constructs of higher education institutions inadequate in addressing complex issues of today's world. The authors challenge organizations to embrace a truly transdisciplinary approach to equipping students with the capacity and skills to address issues of the world today.

AB  - Transdisciplinary research (TR) is a growing field in a myriad of subject domains ranging from sustainability to education. The idea is to solve complex problems through the collaborative participation of academic actors, community stakeholders, governments, and other leaders to jointly define the problem and find solutions. To accomplish such complex projects, one of the main tools is an efficient technology platform. The need for an efficient technology platform, in turn, leads to a need for an evaluation tool to determine which is the most suitable for a given transdisciplinary research situation, however, a literature review confirms that research on such evaluation tools is scarce. The goal of this paper is to improve the evaluation of technology platforms for individual TR projects, based on the characteristics of that specific TR. The research question is "Can TR characteristics be used to construct an evaluation tool for technology platforms?" The specific aims used to answer the question were: the following: (1) to define the characteristics (core activities and skills) of TR and (2) to construct a tool for evaluating technology platforms for use in TR. Methodology: For the first specific aim, a literature meta-analysis was used; the second specific aim was addressed following a newly developed methodology, including elements of the technology acceptance model and elements of a standard technology evaluation process. Results: A chart for defining the core activities and skills in TR was developed, and a tool was constructed for evaluating technology platforms that could be used in TR.

AB  - Background: Researchers collected questions and needs for training from 10 inclusive research projects in the Netherlands. Based on literature research and the information collected, six training modules were developed. Researchers sought to learn how to develop and provide training and coaching to inclusive teams on organising collaboration in the different stages of their research projects. Method: An iterative training development process to support inclusive research projects was initiated by a research duo backed by a transdisciplinary team including researchers, trainers and designers. Some members of the team have experiential knowledge based on living with a disability. Results: Literature research resulted in four guiding theories, including Universal Design for Learning, Derrida's concept of Hospitality, post-materialist theory looking at agency as an assemblage, and Romiszowski's model situated within Instructional Design theory. Insights gained during development of the training modules are documented with text, figures and vignettes. A core finding was the need to add "Level Zero" to Romiszowski's model: a collective term created for all the interacting issues trainers had to consider because of research group diversity. Conclusions: Hospitality formed the heart of "Level Zero." Creating a failure-free space for learning is an important pre-condition for the development and organisation of training. Training can inspire exploration and reflection on collaboration and can illuminate how to conduct research within transdisciplinary teams. Essential practices included working with nonverbal research methods, as these are (more) fit for purpose when including the knowledge of experts by experience and incorporating practice- and stakeholder-based knowledge.

AB  - Interdisciplinary courses and activities are becoming more popular as the benefits of collaboration have become apparent. For example, collaboration between different disciplines in organizations, such as engineering and marketing, has been shown to significantly enhance the product development process. Various strategies have been used to encourage this collaboration. One strategy is to provide instruction in collaboration across disciplines at the undergraduate collegiate level. This case study discusses an interdisciplinary project between Marketing Research, Engineering, and Media Arts. The basic design of the initial course, strategies used to enhance collaboration, student learning outcomes, identification of key issues affecting the interdisciplinary project, and a revised design for teaching future interdisciplinary projects are included. Also included are some of the major challenges and design issues with interdisciplinary work.

AB  - This article examines the role of interdisciplinarity in strengthening social work's commitments to antiracism at the macro level. We describe our experiences of designing and implementing an interdisciplinary workshop for undergraduate students focused on the use of public policy to aid in the dismantling of white supremacy. Engaging sociological theories of race and racism supported student learning about the systemic nature of racial inequality and the need to accompany individual-level interventions with structural change. The dialogic benefits of interdisciplinarity are discussed in terms of strengthening macro social work education and forwarding a robust and clearly defined antiracist social work epistemology and praxis. Implications for social work education and practice are discussed.?

AB  - Background: Early career faculty experiences and perspectives on transdisciplinary research are important yet understudied. Methods: Assistant professors at 50 top-ranked social work programs completed an online survey assessing perspectives on the salience of transdisciplinary training in their field, obstacles to or negative impacts of transdisciplinary training, and current environments. Content analysis and descriptive statistics were used. Results: A large majority of all participants (N = 118) believed that transdisciplinary research is important, that greater training is needed, and that they are relatively well prepared in related skill sets. They are expected to build cross-disciplinary collaborations, yet only a small minority believed that social work researchers are nationally recognized as important collaborators, or that they are prepared to navigate tensions on research teams. Conclusions: We offer a multilevel framework of structural and training supports needed to realize transdisciplinary research in social work with relevance to other disciplines.

AB  - Academics are increasingly required to balance the expectations of the 'old' academy with a future model of universities as interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary 'problem solvers'. This paper highlights changing expectations of academics in producing alternative research outcomes in collaborative, practice-based research. Through a series of workshops with 20 researchers, preferred research outcomes and tensions in achieving these outcomes were identified. The tensions identified are presented as three dichotomies comprising the tension between: (a) 'I versus We' - individual versus team expectations & outcomes. (b) Disciplinary outcomes versus inter-/transdisciplinary outcomes. (c) Learning versus research objectives for the students and academics involved. These tensions reflect the authors' experiences of working in three international sustainability projects, drawing on lessons learned from these projects, with recommendations for universities seeking to implement interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary doctoral and postdoctoral programmes. Recommendations include the need for formal and informal leadership models, strong communication skills, empathy and willingness to learn from each other. A need for more systemic changes within university administration to better reward and value the breadth and depth of collaborative work, while facilitating open learning cultures and practice-oriented learning opportunities and curricula across faculties was also identified.

AB  - This chapter provides a brief history of the multidisciplinary process and how it has evolved over time. A rationale for why the process has changed is provided and how involving more professionals to obtain more specific assessment data and provide more direct input aids in the development of the student's individualized education program (IEP). In addition, a discussion on the incorporation of more reliable and accurate data directly from these individuals shows that a more educationally relevant IEP can be developed for students so that there is a better opportunity for academic success in the school. Incorporating more professionals, when possible, however, requires more planning, but ultimately this process will provide more accurate and reliable data to aid the process for the student, family, and teachers, and everyone will feel more a part of the process.

AB  - This article advances transdisciplinarity as a potentially useful applied theatre theory and method. It maps the ways transdisciplinary research principles informed and framed an applied theatre project and suggests that making applied theatre explicit rather than implicit as a transdisciplinary research process may help practitioners conceptualise and manage projects. In our case, it also increased our ability to contribute to second-order (systemic) change. I argue that applied theatre was always-already transdisciplinary research but articulating this alignment may be helpful to both practice and analysis. The project presented here implemented applied theatre in a university-community partnership addressing youth justice.

AB  - As higher education institutions look to educate and graduate degree earners that have the skills and knowledge necessary to design, communicate, and collaborate in ways that allow for innovative solutions to complex socio-technical challenges, new approaches to educational efforts are being considered and implemented. Institutional responses have included new courses that have a transdisciplinary focus and embedded course experiences that use problem-based approaches coupled with cross-disciplinary team exposure. Often these initiatives have a singular thematic focus (i.e., sustainability). Little is known about the efficacy of transdisciplinary learning initiatives, especially those that encompass a breadth of thematic areas, as it relates to development of complex thinking skills and whether these learning environments provide for similar benefits across student majors. This study, conducted at a Research I university, was designed to address this gap in the literature by examining whether a university level learning initiative using transdisciplinary approaches was achieving desired goals to advance undergraduate students' complex thinking skills. Findings among the respondents (n = 592) indicate that the initiative is advancing fundamental complex thinking skills in that specific courses allow students to learn about other disciplines and provide exposure to different disciplinary perspectives. However, results reveal that across all majors courses would benefit from increased real-world problem-based exposure and opportunities to interact with community stakeholders. Additionally, results suggest that undergraduates may need opportunities to develop a deeper understanding of the complexities that exist in cross-disciplinary collaboration, including how to develop integrated solutions that leverage the strengths of technical and non-technical approaches.

AB  - Although the tobacco plant has been employed as a medicinal and sacred herb by Indigenous cultures across the Americas, its usage drastically changed after the 15th-century colonial arrival; its large-scale commodification and global marketing once brought to Europe lead to hedonic and addictive uses harmful to health. As a consequence, tobacco smoking is now one of the largest public health problems worldwide. However, in the Peruvian Amazon, a region of origin of tobacco species, Indigenous healers still know how to use the plant for therapeutic purposes. Due to a general disregard of Indigenous knowledge and stigma, these uses have however not so far been clinically investigated. We hence conducted for the first time a clinical field study assessing a sample of patients treated by a traditional healer specialized in tobacco in the Peruvian Amazon (observational design, pilot study, N = 27). The study was conducted within a transdisciplinary and multi-epistemic medical frame, in close partnership with an Amazonian healer. We used validated self-report scales to quantitatively assess mental health variables before and after the weeklong treatment, and mixed-methods to report experienced effects. Paired-samples t-tests comparing pre- and post-treatment scores revealed significant reductions in anxiety, depression, perceived stress, and general symptom indicators. Experienced effects included initial physical discomfort, followed by psychologically or existentially/spiritually significant insights. Our findings point to a sophisticated therapeutic approach based on Indigenous knowledge of tobacco applications, which should be further investigated. The study also contributes to the burgeoning scientific field on therapeutic uses of contentious psychoactive plants.

AB  - New pedagogic approaches combining Transdisciplinary, Experiential, and Adaptive perspectives are emerging to respond to increasingly complex urban conditions. By addressing the gap in current urban design studio education, the study defined a framework to assist teachers in designing novel teaching formats based on TEA learning approaches. The framework proposed provides a reference to set up TEA urban design studios and an assessment toolkit to assess their effectiveness in learning and teaching. The comparative analysis of two studio applications shows interdependence of TEA learning and teaching dimensions and generates transferrable recommendations to support a new urban design studio pedagogy that effectively responds to contemporary societal and environmental challenges.

AB  - Integrating information from across multiple sources is an important science literacy skill that involves the following: identifying intra- and intertextual ties, modeling relationships between sources and claims and making an evaluation of the claims made. Tasks that involve reading, interpreting and synthesizing multiple sources have been well explored particularly in the epistemic cognition literature. Interdisciplinarity is a growing area of interest in science education, in terms of the ways we induct students into interdisciplinary ways of thinking and working, including the synthesis of knowledge from across scientific disciplines. While interdisciplinary contexts frequently involve connecting multiple sources from different disciplines, how students complete these text-integration tasks has not been well investigated. This paper develops a model of interdisciplinary text integration for science literacy, drawing on dimensions of epistemic cognition. We exemplify the application of this approach in a specific case of environmental science graduate students, drawing on student syntheses to illustrate how our approach can be used to differentiate between students' written syntheses.

AB  - Data analysis is one of the most popular fields of mathematics and includes statistics and probability. These two mathematical domains are some of the most well-known, influencing everyday life and the various sciences. Their teaching lays the foundation for primary education and culminates in secondary education. Probability and statistics are necessary for today and the future of several professions. This research attempts to highlight the multidisciplinary character of these two disciplines through the textbooks of primary education in Greece and Singapore. It aims to highlight the dependence of mathematics teaching on interdisciplinarity through textbooks. The textbook analysis was chosen because books offer varied learning opportunities. The researchers selected the books, partaking in the comparative analysis. After defining the basic principles dividing lines for the differentiation of the exercises, the analysis was conducted. It included two stages. In the first stage, the activities of the books were examined in their framework application. Then, their interdisciplinary character was accentuated in the scientific field. The results reveal a substantial dependence of data analysis on interdisciplinarity. More interesting is that the distribution of interdisciplinary exercises is prevalent in the scientific milieus.

AB  - The impact of hate speech, both on a personal and social level, has increased due to social media. This has made it the focus of interest of numerous scientific journals, which increases the visibility of this global problem. The aim of this research is to analyse the basic descriptive metrics of the scientific production on hate speech and social media, as well as to explore the interdisciplinarity of these approaches. A bibliometric study has been carried out on the basis of the works indexed in the Scopus database related to the binomial 'hate speech' and 'social media' over a period of 20 years (2001 to 2020). The metrics used show that it is from 2017 onwards when this topic begins to arouse greater interest among researchers and that they constitute a sufficient indicator to consider the topic as one of interest to the scientific community. The joint research between both concepts raises its quality levels from a strictly metric point of view. 'Computer Science' and 'Social Sciences' are the two areas that clearly define the scientific production on this subject. The inversion of percentages in terms of the areas of origin of the works and citations in these two areas, is evidence of this interdisciplinarity. The indicators obtained show the relevance and transcendence of a social problem in the face of which proactive measures must be implemented.

AB  - The relevance of the published research on the actualization of interdisciplinary integration at mathematics lessons is due to the need for conceptual clarification of what is included in the concept of an academic discipline, and, consequently, interdisciplinary integration. Currently, there is no uniformly consistent interdisciplinary terminology, moreover, interdisciplinary boundaries are often difficult to overcome. In pedagogical practice, intersubject is only rhetorically praised, but its practical implementation is often very difficult. This publication aims at studying the role and potential of the actualization of interdisciplinary integration at mathematics lessons. Mathematics is widely recognized as central to human development. However, there are not enough research concerning teaching mathematics in various contexts of educational systems. The object of the study is interdisciplinary integration at mathematics lessons within the framework of holistic learning concepts. Consideration of interdisciplinary integration at mathematics lessons gives researchers the key to education of the XXI century. Nevertheless, few studies are published concerning the proposed object that can serve as a basis for practice in the actualization of interdisciplinary integration at mathematics lessons. Qualitative critical phenomenology was used as a research methodology, since the logic of the actualization of interdisciplinary integration at mathematics lessons reflects a system of historically determined values transmitted by institutionalized models of behaviour, thinking and speech. The application of critical phenomenology allowed us to come to an understanding of how the social and pedagogical aspects of the actualization of interdisciplinary integration at mathematics lessons affect the ways in which students construct reality. Critical phenomenology has made it possible to identify various approaches to the study of the actualization of interdisciplinary integration at mathematics lessons, to study the impact of social interactions in the construction of interdisciplinary discourse by students, the possible impact that interdisciplinary discourse can have on learning. Since the research was of a qualitative nature, it was inevitably influenced by the interpretative methodological paradigm, which recognizes that individual life experience is formed by context, and ideas about knowledge are socially constructed.

AB  - There is a popular perception that interdisciplinary research collaboration can yield benefits to knowledge production, from improvements to creativity to advances in addressing real-world problems. However, studies into interdisciplinarity frequently point to material obstacles, such as burdensome time and resource requirements, difficulties in publishing, and scarce opportunities for grant funding, which imply that incentives or rewards might be required to motivate academics to collaborate with colleagues across research disciplines. This article reports the results of a survey of academics and interviews with senior university leaders at a large research-intensive university in Australia, which indicate a major difference of opinion on how to incentivise interdisciplinary collaboration. While survey respondents largely emphasised material concerns, university leaders cited cultural change as a preferred strategy. If interdisciplinary research collaboration is desired, this gap between the perceptions of academics, who do the research, and university leaders, who control the resources, will need to be bridged.

AB  - Images are central to our understanding of and learning about our world. We argue that visual training needs to be improved in the higher education system to enhance the potential of visual thinking to mediate productively our relationship with the context we inhabit. Initiatives from the social sciences and humanities since the end of the twenty century have highlighted the importance of training in visual research methods and visual literacy, but they also expose the scarcity of tools for understanding and applying images in research processes. In this paper, we examine the way visual methods were organised and employed in earlier studies and propose a new taxonomy. This classification will map these methods in an interdisciplinary framework that allows practitioners to use images in the development of projects. This proposal also seeks to inform future methodological approaches where images are recognised as a language of knowledge, analogous to numbers or linguistic expressions.

AB  - Engineering education has seen a growing interest in how students regulate their learning as a group in interdisciplinary projects. This study adds to the current literature on social regulation of learning by conducting a comparative case study of three interdisciplinary group projects addressing real-world challenges. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were synthesised into narrative episodes representing key aspects of the groups' regulative behaviours. We found indications of co- and socially shared regulation across all groups, with noteworthy differences in the project phases that led to varying student experiences. We discuss key factors that affected regulation along four themes we identified: (1) goal setting and planning, (2) implementation, monitoring, and evaluation, (3) the role of supervisors, and (4) the impact of disciplines. We offer insights for practitioners and provide a foundation for future research on social regulation in interdisciplinary group learning.

AB  - Background: Knowledge of quantum computing is arguably inaccessible to many, with knowledge of the complex mathematics involving a particular barrier to entry, creating difficulty in terms of teaching and inclusive learning for those without a high level of mathematics. Meanwhile, it is increasingly important that the knowledge of quantum technologies is accessible to those who work with real-world applications and is taught to the younger generation. Purpose: Resulting from collaborative dialogue between physicists, computer scientists, educationalists, and industrial end users, we propose the concept of quantum literacy as one means of addressing the need for transdisciplinary research in response to the complex problems that we see at the heart of issues around global sustainability. In this way, quantum literacy can contribute to UN Sustainable Development Goal 4, Quality Education. Methods: We introduce a specific puzzle visualization learning tool through which to achieve the pedagogic ends we set out with respect to quantum literacy. Visualization through puzzles can enable non-specialists to develop an intuitive, but still rigorous, understanding of universal quantum computation and provide a facility for non-specialists to discover increasingly complex and new quantum algorithms. Using the Hong-Ou-Mandel optical effect from quantum mechanics, we demonstrate how visual methods such as those made possible through the puzzle visualization tool can be very useful for understanding underlying complex processes in quantum physics and beyond and therefore support the aims of quantum literacy. Conclusion: We argue that quantum literacy, as defined here, addresses the challenges of learning within a highly bounded discipline and of access to the kind of powerful knowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners. We therefore argue for the importance of addressing pedagogic issues when powerful knowledge consists of dense concepts, as well as complex and hierarchical relations between concepts, in addition to presenting a strong barrier to entry in the form of mathematics.

AB  - Universities across the globe have begun to invest in transdisciplinary research: a complex form of collaboration that places divergent disciplinary specialists and community members in participatory research aimed at addressing an applied research question. For a collaboration to succeed in this knowledge work, participants must engage in radical boundary crossing among disciplinary and community knowledge cultures wherein language is the substance of these boundaries and crossings. Effective collaboration, communication, and writing are essential to the success of transdisciplinary research, but composition research on collaborative writing has yet to address what collaboration looks like in transdisciplinary settings. This article offers a theoretical synthesis that brings transdisciplinary research theory into conversation with composition theory and pedagogy by providing an overview of the core principles of transdisciplinary research, offering an activity systems interpretation of transdisciplinary research, and outlining a framework for incorporating transdisciplinary collaboration into university composition programs.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to explore a transdisciplinary approach to the careers and employability education of transnational education (TNE) students of higher education. It proposes that an approach which adopts three lenses of academic study, lived experience and career stage can provide maximum benefits to the TNE students' careers education, particularly in response to the modern workplace. The study aims to illustrate the potential benefits of such an approach to multiple stakeholders within higher education. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts a viewpoint approach drawing on higher education career service practitioner-based experience of using a specific approach to employability with TNE students studying with a large university based in the UK. Student evaluation data from this practice are referred to in the paper. Findings: This paper provides insights into how this approach to employability was received by higher education TNE students who participated in a pilot project led by a higher education careers service, which adopted the three lenses approach. Originality/value: This paper illustrates how a transdisciplinary approach to the careers and employability education of TNE students can be of significant value to the higher education students themselves, the institutions within which they study and the graduate recruiters looking to attract future employees for the workplaces of the future. It is hoped that by sharing this approach more stakeholders within the TNE and careers and employability communities within higher education will adopt a similar approach.

AB  - In recent years, many universities across the world have been implementing students-as-partners (SaP) programs to collaborate with students on teaching and learning projects. Within these SaP programs, for the benefits that cross-disciplinary learning brings, interdisciplinary partnership has been made a priority. To assess the extent to which interdisciplinarity has occurred within a university's SaP program, this study quantified the number of interdisciplinary partnerships that have occurred in the Student Partners program at McMaster University since 2020 and investigated the hiring practices within those partnerships. Results showed that certain faculties comparatively did not have as many interdisciplinary partnerships. Hiring practice analyses also revealed that there were faculties with a greater proportion of students applying to work with faculty/staff of the same faculty origin as themselves. This case study examines the variations in interdisciplinarity across faculties at McMaster University involved in a SaP program and explores ideas on future directions for enhancing interdisciplinarity in student partnerships.

AB  - Capstone experiences (CEs) serve a variety of purposes in higher education as opportunities to apply academic skills, explore post-graduate life and employment, and achieve a meaningful undergraduate event. This study investigated the purposes of CEs through a content analysis of institutional course syllabi/course outlines/module outlines and catalog/calendar descriptions at five institutions of higher education: a large public research university in Canada, a large public teaching university in the United Kingdom (UK), a college of a large public research university in the United States (US), and two medium-sized private liberal arts universities in the US. Using the CE purposes found in a review of scholarly literature as a research guide, the authors analyzed 84 institutional documents. CE purposes that appeared in the sample at lower percentages when compared with published studies included oral communication, a coherent academic experience, preparation for graduate school, preparation for life after college, and civic engagement/service learning. Implications for practice include the need for instructors and administrators to consider revising CE documents to better reflect the content and goals of the courses and to address the requirements of other audiences (e.g., program reviewers, accreditation evaluators). Moreover, the results of this study may assist educators in considering reasons for omitting explicit purposes from CE documents and/or justifying the inclusion of previously omitted purposes.

AB  - Using data from approximately 342,000 course-taking records collected from 4406 college students enrolled at Taipei Tech during the 2009-2012 academic years, we examine the impact of multidisciplinarity on students' academic performance. Our study contributes to the literature in three ways. First, by applying natural language processing (NLP), we analyze course descriptions of 375 subject areas from the Classification of Instructional Programs and measure the pairwise distances among them. Second, based on the course-taking records and the subject area distribution, we measure each student's degree of multidisciplinary learning using a proposed weighted entropy formula. Third, using the proposed multidisciplinary index, we find that the impact of multidisciplinary course-taking experience on individual students' academic performance varies across academic fields. In the college of engineering, the college of electrical engineering and computer science, and the college of mechanical and electrical engineering, a higher level of multidisciplinarity is associated with a higher average weighted GPA in core courses. However, a positive association does not exist for students in the college of management.

AB  - This article aims to delve into the theoretical perspective on imagination in education, focusing specifically on Imaginative Education theory. The approach involves a dual objective: critically analyzing the limitations and specific potentials of Imaginative Education to stimulate contemporary discourse on imagination in education and using it as a foundation to frame current research in philosophy and psychology within an educational context. Key elements of this theoretical operation include a critical examination of philosophical taxonomies on the concept of imagination and its reinterpretation in relation to Predictive Coding and Embodied Cognition theories. The fundamental goal of this conceptual clarification goes beyond the theoretical realm. The article aspires to contribute to the growing interest in imagination, fantasy, and creativity as essential elements of curriculum design and teacher education, serving both as educational objectives and resources to create meaningful learning environments and experiences. Hence, the focus on the IE theory aims to bridge the gap between theoretical reflections on imagination and learning and their practical implications in curriculum design and teacher education or professional development.

AB  - This paper explores the course design and implementation of a first-year discovery seminar on "Living in the Metaverse" offered at a business university. Integrated with standardized college-readiness topics, the course combines hands-on activities with collaborative assignments and class discussions to present a multidisciplinary exploration of the metaverse from business, technology, and societal perspectives. The authors describe how they utilized the TPACK (Technology, Pedagogy and Content Knowledge) model in designing the course, and how this model can be applied when considering how to incorporate new technologies into courses. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, the authors surveyed students in three sections of the course taught during two consecutive semesters to determine their attitude toward relevant technologies and the course topics. We found that hands-on activities with virtual reality headsets helped make metaverse concepts easier to grasp, while students still had concerns about widespread use of the metaverse, including privacy and security.

AB  - Health-related career goals are popular among high school science students, yet few understand the application of chemistry and biology research to the field of medicine and its impact on society. In this five-day multidisciplinary summer camp, high school students learn about the real-world relevance of medicinal chemistry research and its application to human health through a series of hands-on synthesis, isolation, and biological testing experiments. Our approach makes use of natural product related bioactive molecules, namely aspirin, oil of wintergreen, and eugenol, to highlight the connection between biology and chemistry in the field of medicinal chemistry. The subsequent analysis of these pharmaceutical agents via a variety of antibacterial testing, cell viability, and toxicity assays helps students understand the drug discovery process. In addition to laboratory experiments, students learn about various health professions through visits to Lawrence Technological University nursing and physician assistant program suites and a meeting with an experienced pre-health professions advisor. Through this unique ensemble of experiences, high school students gain valuable insights into the nature and impact of scientific research on the field of medicine and learn about a variety of health-related occupations. Participant survey responses indicate that students enjoyed learning about chemistry- and biology-related concepts and techniques related to the drug discovery process. Furthermore, this week-long summer camp met or exceeded all participants' expectations, with many students expressing enhanced confidence in their scientific abilities.

AB  - Over the last few decades, there has been an increase in the number of large federally funded transdisciplinary programs and initiatives. Scholars have identified a need to develop frameworks, methodologies, and tools to evaluate the effectiveness of these large collaborative initiatives, providing precise ways to understand and assess the operations, community and academic partner collaboration, scientific and community research dissemination, and cost-effectiveness. Unfortunately, there has been limited research on methodologies and frameworks that can be used to evaluate large initiatives. This study presents a framework for evaluating the Flint Center for Health Equity Solutions (FCHES), a National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD)-funded Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (TCC) for health disparities research. This report presents a summary of the FCHES evaluation framework and evaluation questions as well as findings from the Year-2 evaluation of the Center and lessons learned.

AB  - The main aim of this paper is to address the increasing need for science-art integration across all levels of education globally. Specifically, the need to identify a signature pedagogy for the Global Science Opera (GSO) that can be used in teaching and learning contexts in formal and non-formal education. This part of the paper draws upon the seminal work of Lee Shulman (2005) to contemplate and propose a signature pedagogy for the GSO. Contemporary ideas from the science-art teaching and learning sources are also used to develop a sound pedagogical foundation for the approach advocated by the GSO. We argue that the development of a signature pedagogy for the GSO provides clarity around the challenge of developing a standard approach to teaching science through art activities. This paper presents the GSO practices that has the potential influence to reshape science teaching and learning process through art.

AB  - Interdisciplinary learning plays a vital role in the education fields of the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. According to the literature, interdisciplinary studies are often associated with professional skills that should be taught in engineering and other similar programs. Knowing the attributes and scope of interdisciplinary learning concurrent with the technical requirements of an engineering degree can set students up for career success. The objective of this study was to establish a deeper understanding of the importance of interdisciplinary education in AEC students' success after they enter the industry. Knowing what makes students successful professionals, the link between interdisciplinary domains, technical domains, and metrics for professional success can offer guidance for programs to consider. To accomplish this, this body of work deployed a series of surveys investigating the importance of interdisciplinary learning on the graduates' success to companies who hire architectural engineering students. Success was characterized through teamwork, satisfied clients, successful technical solutions, happy people, and making a positive contribution to the industry. The results show that both technical depth and breadth were valued in parallel with experience working in teams and collaborative environments to achieve these areas of success. Furthermore, this paper discusses and suggests curricular relationships between interdisciplinary factors, such as breadth of knowledge and collaboration within the Architectural Engineering Department, in promoting the success of graduates in the AEC industry.

AB  - School counselors collaborate with multidisciplinary teams to implement universal mental health screening (UMHS) in schools and this work is especially pertinent in light of the U.S. K-12 mental health crisis. Because the school counseling UMHS literature is still emerging, expanding this literature is necessary, particularly to meet students' mental health concerns. The present study examined the qualitative experiences of school counselors and other multidisciplinary UMHS team members implementing screening. We coded data through a phenomenological lens and used deductive coding from the National Center for School Mental Health's (2018) eight steps to UMHS. We discuss not only the results but applications and implications, geared toward school counselors at the building and district level to assist with their practice.

AB  - Math modeling is a unique and powerful part of mathematics that is underutilized in contemporary classrooms. Teachers of all grade levels may utilize such modeling problems to better serve the students in their classrooms, with related analytical problem-solving activities that contribute to learners meeting the highest of learning standards. With a continued focus within mathematics education on critical thinking, creativity, disciplinary literacy and college/career readiness, math modeling is at the forefront of research-tested methods to develop these crucial skills. This is an important direction mathematics education that needs to go in order to prepare students for the future.

AB  - Industrial drug discovery teams encompass scientists from multiple specialties and require participants to communicate effectively across disciplinary boundaries. In this paper, we present an undergraduate or graduate classroom simulation of this environment. Over a series of five workshops, student teams of mixed scientific backgrounds perform five iterations of the chemistry cycle of small molecule drug discovery. Students analyze physicochemical, structural, and (fictional) assay data and use these to design new compounds for testing. Simulated assay results are returned to students who use the information in the design of subsequent compounds. After workshop 5, each team selects a single lead compound, supported by a potential synthetic route, a portfolio of assay data, and logical scientific decision-making. Our exercise provides students with opportunities for hands-on student-responsive data handing, team-building, and technical knowledge acquisition--all within an industrially relevant scientific scenario.

AB  - The teaching of reproduction, gender and sexuality at tertiary level is often compartmentalised, separating biological components from the political, socio-cultural, psychological and ethical perspectives that influence how knowledge is understood and utilised. In parallel, educators often have specialised knowledge and can struggle to address the broader questions outside their area of expertise. This is particularly true in an era of changing constructs and terminology related to gender and sexual diversity, and strong views as to which terminology is appropriate. Recognising this need, we organised a local symposium drawing together educators (lecturers, teaching-fellows, demonstrators) from across our university campus to discuss the range and nature of courses in medicine, sciences and the social sciences taught at our institution. Here, we outline the rationale, process and the key themes discussed, which included changing models of sex and gender, associated terminology changes and the importance of appropriate framing and incorporation of indigenous (Maori) perspectives. An interdisciplinary approach is essential to integrate theories engaging with the non-binary nature of sex and gender with the largely binary process of reproduction. This cultural shift requires educationalists to counter biased opinions and misinformation with accurate and diverse content to ensure teaching is accurate and up-to-date.

AB  - The article presents the authors' experiences in designing a storytelling map guide for the botanical gardens of Palacký University, Czech Republic, from a pedagogical point of view. The authors introduce a three-pillared original concept. The overall educational contribution is a combination of educational, thematic and technological knowledge which supports successful engagement in the storytelling process. In the Storytelling Map Guide for the Botanical Gardens and Greenhouse Collections, the first pillar represents the educational aspect. Botanical knowledge and familiarity with the study area, i.e. the Palacký University Botanical Gardens, represent the thematic pillar. The technological pillar is covered by knowledge of software, cartography and application design skills, including an overview of contemporary storytelling applications. Finally, the educational impact and benefits to students of geoinformatics are discussed.

AB  - A multidisciplinary origami activity that could be used in middle school mathematics and science lessons was designed and implemented. Mathematical purpose of the origami activity is to support students' conceptual understanding and procedural skills related to the concept of fraction. Regarding science, the activity aims to visualize Solar system and support its conceptual learning. The activity was implemented with 7th grade students in order to help them remember the related content and overcome the difficulties they experienced. The implementation process revealed that this multidisciplinary activity can be used by middle school teachers to support students' conceptual understanding of fractions and solar system topics, and to overcome some difficulties they experienced while learning these topics. Details about students' views and approaches that emerged during the implementation of the activity, teacher's views about the implementation, as well as suggestions for teachers who want to implement the activity, are given throughout the paper.

AB  - Immediately after its appearance, we at the University of Amsterdam's Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies enthusiastically adopted Allen Repko's "Interdisciplinary Research: Process and Theory" (Repko, 2008) as it was the first textbook that offered systematic explanation of and guidance through the complexities of an interdisciplinary research project. However, several characteristics of the projects conducted by our students made it an uneasy match for their needs and ours. For one thing, the Repko text targets students doing individual research projects whereas our students typically perform interdisciplinary research in teams. Our students also typically bring more disciplinary expertise to their interdisciplinary work than those whom the Repko text targets. And they often undertake empirical research as part of their projects--and not just the research in relevant literature that is emphasized in the Repko texts. Feeling the need for a textbook on interdisciplinary research that would better support students like ours, we decided to develop our own textbook, "Introduction to Interdisciplinary Research: Theory and Practice." In this article, we describe the version of the research process we present in our text, emphasizing the many forms of pluralism involved in the process as reconceived to better suit teams of researchers based in different disciplines, and sometimes pursuing empirical work which may involve extra-academic stakeholders.

AB  - Participatory research engages a transdisciplinary team of stakeholders in all aspects of the research process. Such engagement can lead to shifts in the research design, as well as who is considered a participant. We detail our experiences of studying an evolving stakeholder network in the context of a 2.5-year transdisciplinary, participatory project. We show how participation leads to shifts in the network boundary overtime and how a transdisciplinary effort was needed to retrospectively redefine the network boundary. Through tacking back and forth between ethnographic insights, research aims, and modeling assumptions, the team eventually reached agreement on what determined network membership and how to code network members according to their timing and level of participation. Our account advances literature on boundary and modeling approaches to shifting, evolving networks by demonstrating how participatory transdisciplinarity can be both a driver of, and solution to, capturing the complexity of evolving networks.

AB  - Some crises, such as those brought on or exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, are wicked problems--large, complex problems with no immediate answer. As such, they make rich centerpieces for learning with respect to public deliberation and issue-based dialogue. This essay reflects on an experimental, transdisciplinary health and science communication course entitled Comprehending COVID-19." The course represents a collaborative effort among 14 faculty representing 10 different academic departments to create a resource for teaching students how to deliberate the pandemic, despite its attending, oversaturated, fake-news-infused, infodemic. We offer transdisciplinary deliberation as a pedagogical framework to expand communication repertoires in ways useful for sifting through the messiness of an infodemic while also developing key deliberation skills for productively engaging participatory decision-making with concern to wicked problems.

AB  - Purpose: To highlight that, for higher education (HE) to fulfil its role and provide societies with the required knowledge and competencies that will enable a sustainable future, through research, education and campus operations, it needs to cooperate and promote interdisciplinarity within the sector and with society at large. Design/methodology/approach: This study is a follow-up on the author´s presentation, as President for the International Association of Universities (IAU), at the IAUP triennial conference 2021. It is not presenting outcomes of a specific research project but rather a personal experience and reflections on challenges and opportunities debated at global HE conferences, national and international seminars, IAU publications and global surveys. Findings There are many publications on challenges and opportunities when it comes to developing and capitalizing on the social responsibility of HE for a sustainable development. However, there is a lack of discussion on internal institutional responsibilities and support for the societal value of HE beyond the sector. Originality/value: This is the personal view of the author and builds on a long experience as scientist and academic leader.

AB  - How we talk about bilingualism has an effect on how others think about bilingual individuals, and in turn, how "active bilingual learners/users of English" (ABLE) students are assessed and taught in schools. I use a transdisciplinary approach of bridging social semiotics, applied linguistics, psycholinguistics, and cognitive linguistics to explain how code-switching is metaphor, an external perspective of bilingualism as inter-domain linguistic mapping and translanguaging is metonymy, an internal perspective of intra-domain linguistic mapping. By placing translanguaging/metonymy on the syntagmatic axis and code-switching/metaphor on the paradigmatic axis, I demonstrate through example sentences of monolingual and bilingual speech and figures, how accepting the inaccurate metaphor of bilingualism as just code-switching alone, sets in motion countless dichotomies that act to create the bilingualism-as-problem orientation for ABLE students in U.S. schools; most specifically for those at the intersection of bilingualism and disability. A transdisciplinary view of bilingualism includes both an internal perspective (translanguaging, metonymic combination of parts of the whole linguistic repertoire on the syntagmatic axis), plus an external perspective (code-switching, metaphoric alternation of linguistic features from diverse named languages on the paradigmatic axis). I conclude with implications for a more appropriate description of bilingualism and its role in education.

AB  - The primary role and value of a transdisciplinary online collaborative problem-based learning (OCPBL) project is that all disciplines fully participate in producing solutions to challenges. Acquiring the confidence to do so transcends all disciplines. The central role of educators then emerges in facilitating students' confidence in their ability to participate and perform in OCPBL projects. This paper focuses on Phase 3 of a longitudinal ethnographic study, with the aim of consolidating practical guidelines to facilitate confident participation in an OCPBL project. Guidelines emerged from exploratory focus groups with educators as participants involved in the design and facilitation of an OCPBL project. Thematic analysis presents two sets of guidelines: achievement of the facilitation of effective OCPBL by students and student teams and guidelines for the composition and orientation of educator panels and their facilitation of confident OCPBL. The latter makes the most significant contribution to theory and practice. Our research shows that educators should, in particular, guide and support students in exploring and clearly expressing their own feelings of professional self-worth within and beyond their own disciplines while gaining insight and developing due respect for others. Most importantly, full collaboration in an experiential transdisciplinary OCPBL project requires recognition and respect for one's own and others' disciplines, both among students and among educators. Confidence as a graduate attribute is also key to the required skill set in transdisciplinary online teams engaged in complex collaborative problem solving and value creation.

AB  - This article takes up a question of how early childhood studies and kinesiology might undertake interdisciplinarity together. Working with the provocation of the phrase 'movement belongs to all of us', this article probes the character of three particular interdisciplinary alliances between early childhood studies and kinesiology, asking what becomes possible and impossible for interdisciplinary work amid each collision. These intersections include moving with humans and new materialist movements, dancing childhoods and bodily boundaries, and doing collaboratories and social justice. Working closely with each of these intersections, I propose discord, perceptibility, and collectivity as three possible practices toward inventing unfamiliar interdisciplinarity between early childhood studies and kinesiology.

AB  - The growing number of interdisciplinary degree programmes offered at comprehensive research universities aim to ensure that students gain interdisciplinary understanding, defined as knowledge and skills that provide them with the means to produce cognitive enhancements that would not be possible through monodisciplinary programmes. Previous studies suggest that interdisciplinary understanding comprises six main elements: knowledge of different disciplinary paradigms, knowledge of interdisciplinarity, reflection skills, critical reflection skills, communication skills, and collaboration skills. However, empirical evidence to support this conceptualised model is lacking. The current study therefore proposes an Interdisciplinary Understanding Questionnaire (24 items) to assess this model. Its construct validity and measurement invariance were tested among 505 first-year Bachelor's students from different academic disciplines (e.g. humanities, science, social sciences). A (multigroup) confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the conceptualised model of interdisciplinary understanding, as well as measurement invariance across academic disciplines. Implications for educational practice, for instance regarding student assessment and quality assurance, are discussed.

AB  - Whilst the starting point is the impact of the pandemic the overall aim of the paper is to advance the case for the introduction of a transdisciplinary approach to learning. The justification for adopting this radical method is to deliver specific graduate outcomes in line with the 10 job skills for 2025 identified by the World Economic Forum. More specifically to promote creative and critical thinking amongst undergraduates. If the integration of skills is viewed as a key component of higher education the question is how they can be best delivered. A key point is to develop student self awareness of the limitations to their learning to introduce critical reflection. The possibility of students being 'pulled up short' and experiencing self-realisation is examined and how this may contribute to the advancement of their studies and the delivery of specific skills. Finally, the paper considers the idea of transdisciplinary teaching and learning and differentiates transdisciplinary ideas from other forms of crossing disciplinary boundaries. It explores the stated advantages, in terms of skills development, for adopting this type of approach noting the challenges it involves for both educators and students. It concludes that although there exist realistic challenges to transdisciplinary learning it is a strategy that promises significant outcomes. [For the complete Volume 21 proceedings, see ED629259.]

AB  - The study analyses the relationship between transdisciplinary integration, creativity and student motivation in three STEAM projects. It has been carried out over 3 years in a programme for gifted students. 152 students (11-12 years old), five teachers and four external professionals participated. The projects included a variety of scientific, humanistic and artistic activities, together with outings, the collaboration of experts and the creation of a transdisciplinary art-based final products. The research was carried out through the analysis of qualitative data (interviews, video-recordings, participant observation) using Atlas.ti8 within the framework of Activity Theory and statistical analysis of questionnaires. It shows how the transdisciplinary integration favoured a complex approach to knowledge with an essential role of the artistic-based transdisciplinary final products and fostered a plural approach to creativity. The active participation of the students favoured their motivation and involvement. The significant correlation between creativity, student motivation and transdisciplinary integration emerges as a key element in the STEAM projects implemented.

AB  - With the emergence of data science as an inherently multidisciplinary subject, there is increasing demand for graduates with well-rounded competence in computing, analytics, and communication skills. However, in conventional education systems, computing & quantitative, and communication skills are often taught in different disciplines. Data storytelling is constructing and presenting data stories to highlight the analytical insights to achieve the communication goals to a specific audience. Digital data storytelling leverages digital storytelling techniques and best practices in communication to deliver stories that can be shared in digital formats to a wide audience. In this paper, we describe and reflect on a semester-long project-based learning pilot using Digital Storytelling as a framework to allow students to explore topics themed around human flourishing and sustainability with the end goal of constructing data stories delivered in digital or video format (i.e., Digital Data Storytelling). The pilot work was conducted in an introductory data science course at a 4-year Minority Serving Institution in collaboration with students studying non-STEM disciplines at a partner community college. Our pilot demonstrates the potential benefit of this sustainability-aware Project-Based Learning design in raising students' awareness of sustainability issues, increasing confidence in cross-disciplinary communication competency, and at the same time deepening their understanding of data science concepts. We further reflect on the significant role of an effective program model as well as challenges and opportunities for building transdisciplinary communication competency to prepare for a diverse data science workforce.

AB  - Through the application of the Douglas Fir Group's transdisciplinary framework, this study investigated how three levels of mutually dependent influence (i.e., the micro level of social action and interaction, meso level of sociocultural institutions and communities, and macro level of ideological structures) operate across time and space to shape a bilingual heritage language learner's study-abroad (SA) experiences. Data were collected from standardized proficiency tests; language contact profiles; pre- and midprogram surveys; and interviews with the learner, classroom instructors, tutor-roommates, host family members, and the director of the SA program. The transdisciplinary framework enabled this study to expand its research focus and analytical scope, demonstrating that language learning was mediated by the three levels of mutually dependent influence in a dynamic and complex manner. This study has generated a richer understanding of multilayered complexity in heritage language development, advanced bilingual performance and proficiency, and bilingualism in language education and society.

AB  - Practising active video games (AVGs) requires performing motor and cognitive tasks, which might foster success in physical education and other school subjects but remains poorly investigated. This study examined the learning effects of six lessons using AVGs with physical education and mathematics content. Overall, 216 school-students composed an experimental group (n = 99) and a control group (n = 107). Both attended six lessons, each on using a Cartesian coordinate system and ball-throwing accurately, with AVGs in the experimental group only. Learning was assessed at Lessons 1 and 6, situational interest and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at Lessons 3 and 5. MANOVAs showed no between-group differences in situational interest and higher MVPA for the control group at Lesson 3 only. Statistical analysis showed higher learning scores (mathematics and physical education) for the experimental group at Lesson 6, suggesting possible interest in AVGs during multidisciplinary sequences connecting physical education and mathematics.

AB  - Innovation courses are needed in higher education to meet workforce demands and prepare students for societal challenges. Assessment of outcomes can be challenging in innovation courses, particularly those that leverage diversity to drive innovation. The authors report on assessment methods in one such course at a public university using the Learning Record, an evidence-based assessment tool. Case study and quantitative analysis results suggest that the Learning Record shows promise as a high-quality assessment for innovation courses. Further, students from diverse professional majors can complete the Learning Record, and instructors can consistently evaluate students from different professions.

AB  - Based on a study of a postgraduate course, we show how--through the processes associated with applying a strategic tool--students developed the understandings that allowed them to span disciplinary and organizational boundaries. We reveal how the students, working in groups and acting as consultants to industry clients, developed specific boundary-spanning skills learned through observation and practice (mimesis), and reflection. Namely, (1) working with others with different disciplines to establish roles and processes to operate successfully as a group, (2) establishing productive communication with other groups of diverse disciplines as part of project processes, (3) eliciting information from other groups of diverse specialists, and (4) managing an inclusive discussion process among other groups of diverse specialists for agreement. We discuss how these insights about mimesis and reflection add to pedagogic debates about instruction for interdisciplinary and inter-organizational learning and the implications for management education and development practice.

AB  - Due to its constructivist nature, interdisciplinary teaching appears ideal for increasing students' interests in subjects (Brassler, 2020; Kramer & Wegner, 2021). Although many argue in favor of a more comprehensive implementation of interdisciplinary teaching in schools, many practical barriers arise during the realization that need to be resolved following the design-based research approach (DBR) (Kramer & Wegner, 2022b). Especially at the upper secondary school level, implementation seems to be difficult. The question arises of how interdisciplinary instruction can be usefully implemented in the upper grades. As a first potential solution, interdisciplinary project days were developed in the subject combination of biology and physical education and evaluated with the help of an initial study. The prototypes developed increased both students' situational interests and their perceptions of the utility value of the subjects involved (Kramer & Wegner, 2021; 2022a). However, the implementation process could be optimized, as it currently depends on reducing other school subjects. Therefore, following the iterative cycle of DBR, a new prototype was developed involving interdisciplinary units within the regular subject lessons. The second prototype was empirically evaluated with a control-group design. In contrast to the first prototype, only descriptive trends were found, indicating that the interdisciplinary units trigger situational interest and stabilize individual interest. However, this cannot be supported statistically. Due to a high data dropout, the sample size should be increased, and the trends should be further investigated. In terms of practical feasibility, the second prototype has an advantage as it does not require any cancellation of subject lessons. However, implementing a second subject may reduce the time available for subject-specific content.

AB  - The field of higher education (HE) is characterized by diversity stemming from multiple sources. Diversity results in boundaries that carry the potential to promote personal and professional development for HE students. Boundaries also offer the possibility of learning generic skills and planning and carrying out challenging tasks that require collaborative problem solving in multidisciplinary teams. Drawing upon the theory of boundary crossing, this study aims to identify the kinds of boundaries that HE students experience during a multidisciplinary online course on forest bioeconomy and how they manage these boundaries in terms of boundary crossing while collaboratively solving an ill-defined development challenge set by a working life organization. The data consist of in-depth interviews with student teams (N = 20). The results provide insights into the pedagogical principles through which students' boundary-crossing processes can be facilitated in HE online learning settings.

AB  - This laboratory experiment offers a research-style experience designed for senior undergraduate students in a multidisciplinary laboratory setting. The experiment focuses on the synthesis, characterization, and application of a cation-exchange membrane made of COF-SO[subscript 3]Na/PAN for ion separation. By participating in this practical session, students gain firsthand experience in both the fundamental procedures of membrane synthesis and the application of widely recognized scientific research methodologies. Furthermore, the experiment offers students hands-on opportunities to become acquainted with modern instrumental techniques extensively used in chemical research, such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The acquisition of these skills not only provides students with valuable practical experience but also equips them with the ability to effectively communicate their future research accomplishments to the broader scientific community. Moreover, the experiment demonstrates the significant potential of the synthesized membrane material for real-world applications, as evidenced by its effectiveness in osmotic energy extraction through ion separation using reverse electrodialysis (RED). This serves to underscore the practical utility of the research findings and reinforces students' understanding of the broader implications of materials chemistry. It also enables instructors to contextualize the experiment within the broader field, encouraging students to explore the frontiers of knowledge and innovation.
