AB  - The most challenging global problems of our age involve coupled human--environmental systems within the Food-Energy-Water Nexus. The undergraduate students currently in our classrooms will be tomorrow's global citizens, each of whom must be prepared to understand and reason about these challenges and ultimately make decisions about them in a variety of contexts. Postsecondary institutions, then, must afford students multidisciplinary, STEM-based experiences that help them develop this knowledge and skillset. In light of this need, we developed and taught an introductory undergraduate course--Water in Society--grounded in contemporary, real-world, "socio-hydrological" issues. The course, designed to serve the needs of both STEM majors and nonmajors, was designed and offered by an interdisciplinary team of hydrology, economics, and science education faculty. Key course themes include engagement with authentic data, scientific models and modeling, multimodal forms of scientific communication, and research-based best practices for effective STEM instruction. Here, we describe the first iteration of the course, including elements of the class that exemplify these primary course themes and pedagogical reflection on instructional experiences and student feedback.

AB  - To address the need for STEM reform in K-12 schools, this article describes the design and implementation of a rigorous, interdisciplinary science and research program (ISR) in two local high schools (HS-S and HS-H). The ISR, adapted from the successful School for Science and Math at Vanderbilt program, provides seven courses over four years that focus on the development of critical thinking skills and the ability to construct and perform hypothesis-driven research projects. The courses are co-taught by a science teacher (masters or doctoral level) and a Ph.D. scientist. Overall, students in both programs showed higher science end-of-course test scores and ACT composite scores compared to their non-ISR peers, completed research internships at Vanderbilt, and presented their research at local and regional meetings. Currently 62 of the 77 ISR graduates are attending college, with 62% of the declared majors in STEM areas. As the programs have matured, challenges such as low student preparation (ISR-S) and competition with other school academic offerings (ISR-H) have been addressed, resulting in increased numbers of students participating in the program. The school district has demonstrated the value of the ISR program by providing funding for the scientists and expanding to a third school in 2016.

AB  - Peer Observation of Teaching has raised a lot of interest as a device for quality enhancement of teaching. While much research has focused on its models, implementation schemes and feedback to the observed, little attention has been paid to what the observer actually sees and can learn from the observation. A multidisciplinary peer observation of teaching program is described, and its data is used to identify the pedagogical aspects to which lecturers pay more attention to when observing classes. The discussion addresses the valuable learning opportunities for observers provided by this program, as well as its usefulness in disseminating, sharing and clarifying quality teaching practices. The need for further research concerning teacher-student relationships and students' engagement is also suggested.

AB  - Background: Lack of agreement about criteria and terminology for children's language problems affects access to services as well as hindering research and practice. We report the second phase of a study using an online Delphi method to address these issues. In the first phase, we focused on criteria for language disorder. Here we consider terminology. Methods: The Delphi method is an iterative process in which an initial set of statements is rated by a panel of experts, who then have the opportunity to view anonymised ratings from other panel members. On this basis they can either revise their views or make a case for their position. The statements are then revised based on panel feedback, and again rated by and commented on by the panel. In this study, feedback from a second round was used to prepare a final set of statements in narrative form. The panel included 57 individuals representing a range of professions and nationalities. Results: We achieved at least 78% agreement for 19 of 21 statements within two rounds of ratings. These were collapsed into 12 statements for the final consensus reported here. The term "Language Disorder" is recommended to refer to a profile of difficulties that causes functional impairment in everyday life and is associated with poor prognosis. The term, "Developmental Language Disorder" (DLD) was endorsed for use when the language disorder was not associated with a known biomedical aetiology. It was also agreed that (a) presence of risk factors (neurobiological or environmental) does not preclude a diagnosis of DLD, (b) DLD can co-occur with other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. ADHD) and (c) DLD does not require a mismatch between verbal and nonverbal ability. Conclusions: This Delphi exercise highlights reasons for disagreements about terminology for language disorders and proposes standard definitions and nomenclature.

AB  - Microfabrication is a critical area to many branches of science and engineering. However, to many students accustomed to seeing transistors as things that come in a lab kit, it is an obscure subtopic of their discipline. Beginning in 2009, the authors undertook a broad multidisciplinary approach to bring microfabrication into all aspects of the Binghamton University science and engineering curriculum. This program was coupled with a comprehensive assessment activity to evaluate the program's effectiveness and continuously improve it year by year. This paper reports the details of the implementation process, the techniques that were found to bring a hands-on experience to large classes, and the lessons learned from the assessments of this program to make this topic a mainstream part of engineering and science education.

AB  - This paper presents a multidisciplinary problem-based learning (PBL) project consisting of the development of a robot arm prototype and the implementation of its control system. The project is carried out as part of Industrial Informatics (II), a compulsory third-year course in the Automation and Electronic Engineering (AEE) degree program at the School of Engineering at Universitat Polite`cnica de Vale`ncia, Vale`ncia, Spain. The robot arm is a low-cost prototype, initially controlled with a joystick. The aim of the project is, first, to design and implement a full control system for the robot, including the necessary circuitry for microcomputer (ARM Cortex)-based control and, second, to pit the designed robot in competition against other students' robots. Incorporation of multidisciplinary PBL required changes in the organization of the course, which features various learning activities and their continuous evaluation; it also required knowledge of five other courses in the AEE program. PBL methodology is compared to a traditional method; the results obtained proved highly satisfactory. Moreover, the PBL robotic experience was highly rated by some 900 students.

AB  - The seafood industry in Florida is complex, with more than 80 varieties of Florida seafood commodities and an increasing number of imported products. This variety increases consumer confusion, especially with the growing concern about the origin, sustainability, and safety of seafood products. The objective of the Florida Seafood At Your Fingertips program is to provide Florida Extension agents with updated, science-based information regarding seafood, which will result in increased consumer awareness and consumption. Combining a survey instrument, curriculum modules, public displays, and a mobile application with the teaching expertise of Extension has allowed this program to reach consumers throughout Florida.

AB  - Shared expertise, team teaching, and cooperation among lecturers from different fields have become more and more important in promoting learning and achieving more innovative learning outcomes in multidisciplinary universities. To increase and improve sharing expertise between teachers from different faculties and disciplines, we wanted, on one hand, to identify skills and competences that teachers have in common and, on the other hand, to find areas in which they identify that they need complementation. As a framework for this research, we applied Lee Shulman's (1986) seven categories of teachers' knowledge base including the theory of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). The data were collected by group discussions. The teachers (N = 22) represented all seven faculties of Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences (UAS), that is, Business School, Civil Engineering and Building Services, Culture and Creative Industries, Health Care and Nursing, School of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Industrial Engineering, and Welfare and Human Functioning. The data were analyzed using theory-based content analysis. According to our data, the mutual core competence of a teacher is the capacity to interact effectively. It is a basis for shared expertise. Interaction skills are necessary in collaborative construction of knowledge as students, teachers of different fields, and their partners inside and outside the organization co-operate. Multidisciplinary co-operation among colleagues also helps to maintain subject matter knowledge, as it supports peer learning and encourages everyone to move out of their comfort zones.

AB  - Leadership development among postsecondary students can occur through a variety of experiences; one such experience is a leadership minor. The purpose of this descriptive interpretive study was to analyze students' experiences while enrolled in a leadership minor with a focus on exploring evidence of leadership identity development. By exploring the leadership identity development of students enrolled in a leadership minor, we sought to provide valuable information for professionals within postsecondary leadership education offering, or planning to offer a leadership minor. Our analysis revealed changes in the leadership identity and skill development of students involved in the leadership minor. Implications and recommendations for leadership development programs, specifically leadership minors, are discussed.

AB  - This article suggests that the arts and humanities are in the midst of an interdisciplinary turn. This turn is a reaction to two problems: the transformation of universities in the twenty-first century and the challenges posed by postmodernism. The interdisciplinary turn, as identified here, is toward critical thinking in teaching and learning and toward critical interdisciplinarity in humanistic inquiry. Exposing the problems and highlighting the opportunities can help scholars, artists, and educators consciously apply these approaches and intentionally plan for interdisciplinarity, with the goals of fostering student learning and advancing scholarship. By understanding what is happening in this turn, scholars and educators in the arts and humanities can better lead interdisciplinarity into the future.

AB  - This paper presents the course of events of a five-day summer camp on environmental chemistry with high emphasis on chemical analysis. The annual camp was optional and open for students of all disciplines and levels. The duration of the summer camp was five and a half days in the Feldberg Lake District in northeast Germany (federal state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania). The participants took part in the continuation of the examination of the lakes in the region, which leads back more than 50 years. They gained hands-on experience in environmental characterization of various lakes and classification by determining chemical, physical, and biological parameters such as phytoplankton, zooplankton, and macrophytes. Short lectures are presented by professionals covering a theoretical background of limnology, environmental chemistry, a variety of analytical methods, freshwater biology, and the specifics of the region. The camp in its present form was established in 1995, and about 20 students took part in the camp per year. Camp development, considerations regarding employed analytical methods, balance of theory, and other implications are discussed.

AB  - Over the past 50 years, the number of alternative schools for at-risk students have increased exponentially. However, the research concerning the students that attend these institutions has been, at best, unhurried. Even more wanting is the research regarding the development and critical evaluation of educational interventions that can motivate and educate these students. The purpose of this paper is to propose an original, interdisciplinary framework aimed at increasing the positive student outcomes of alternative high school students. Drawing on the insights of sociology, psychology, and athletics, the "Athedemic" (Authentic Athletic-Academic) model integrates authentic teaching of academic subjects, athletics, social and emotional learning, and health for a more comprehensive educational approach to improve the student experience and empower youth in alternative educational settings. Future directions of alternative school research are considered.

AB  - Preparing future professionals in any industry requires specific education and detailed training early on in the academic process ideally, prior to the influences of the work environment. Many schools and programs offer standard industry courses but much more needs to be accomplished, as the scope and management of private industry and public service continues to expand. In some cases, the current standard pedagogical practices have failed to prepare students for the workplace, an environment that is ever-changing due to advancing technologies, political agendas and societal pressures. By teaching in a silo and being focused on one content area, much of the educational system is providing a disservice to students by not removing the blinders. Sector lines have become increasingly blurred, so the education of future professionals must now take an interdisciplinary approach to successfully navigate this new environment. Market-ready graduates must have the ability to successfully navigate the private, public and nonprofit sectors. This research will suggest several possible avenues to an interdisciplinary pedagogy model, by examining the core competencies of three 'flagship' sector degrees. By combining traditional academic pedagogy with cross-sector topics, we may reduce instances of failed academic preparation and may in fact encourage the next generation of leaders to be even more dynamic than those who've come before, successfully converting theory to practice.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity is often framed as crucial for addressing the complex problems of contemporary society and for achieving new levels of innovation. But while science policy and institutions have provided a variety of incentives for stimulating interdisciplinary work throughout Europe, there is also growing evidence that some aspects of the academic system do not necessarily reward interdisciplinary work. In this study, we explore how mid-career researchers in an environmental science research center in Sweden relate to and handle the distinct forms of uncertainty that arise from conflicting institutional and policy impulses. Our material suggests that interdisciplinary academics are often confronted with and at times themselves operate with a surprisingly dichotomous, value-laden view of their research practice. Disciplinarity is primarily associated with the ideals of scientific rigor, while interdisciplinarity becomes conflated with application-oriented work and a lack of 'theory.' We also draw attention to the underlying practical dynamics that reproduce this tension and entangle it with the very process of academic socialization. Specifically, we analyze the ambivalent consequences of the various work-arounds that researchers rely on to carve out opportunities for ongoing interdisciplinary research within heterogeneous funding landscapes. These tactics turn out to be undermined by the overriding normative power of formal career incentives at universities, which continue to emphasize the ideals of the individual high-performing academic who publishes in disciplinary journals and attracts the most selective grants. Under such circumstances, the work-arounds themselves become an insidious mechanism that allows researchers to stay in academia but systematically marginalizes their voices and epistemic ambitions in the process.

AB  - The article builds on an empirical study of knowledge practices in international, interdisciplinary MA education, foregrounding the role of academic staff in identifying and explicating academic norms to students recruited from different subject areas and institutions. A central theme is transition, which refers to the state of liminality that postgraduates can experience when new to a discipline, institution and sociocultural context. I argue for lecturers as 'transition managers' who may ease students' transfer into an unfamiliar academic culture. This argument is explored in an analysis of interview data collected from four MA courses, which suggests that lecturers' transition management involves an awareness of classroom diversity, an acceptance of responsibility for academic socialisation and the development of new pedagogic practices.

AB  - Project-based learning units are often used for large scale work integrated learning (WIL) experiences in Liberal Studies Degrees as they offer scalability and sustainability of delivery to large cohorts. This systematic search and review evaluates the effectiveness of interdisciplinary project-based learning in Science Degree programs for developing discipline knowledge and employability skills. Education literature databases were searched for peerreviewed journal articles that discussed undergraduate science-based degree programs with project-based learning units involving students from multiple disciplines. Data were analysed for evidence of a skill gain in 6 areas (Discipline knowledge, Communication, Teamwork, Interdisciplinary effectiveness, Critical thinking and problem solving, and Self-management). Projects were assigned to categories based on interdisciplinary breadth and depth. Data was analysed by cross-tabulations, Fisher's Exact test and by calculating odds ratios (OR), which indicate the effect size. Perception of a skill gain was significantly more likely to be reported than an objectively measured skill gain (p<0.001). Real discipline skill gains were 6.6 times more likely in projects narrow in discipline mix (OR 6.6), however perceived discipline skill gains were high irrespective of project type. Projects with wide interdisciplinarity were significantly associated with perceived gains in interdisciplinary effectiveness (OR 32, p<0.05) and more likely to have perceived gains in communication (OR 2.5) and teamwork (OR 3.4) skills. When projects have greater interdisciplinary breadth or depth, perceived student employability skill gains increase, perceived discipline skill gains are unaffected, however actual discipline skill gains are less reported. Further research and evidence that project-based learning is meeting the desired WIL learning objectives of the curriculum is needed.

AB  - We designed a collaborative course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) between an Analytical Chemistry course and an Environmental Toxicology course to engage students in a research project that cannot rely on one discipline alone. This study reports on 47 students' self-reported experiences with the course outcomes and their opinions of the CURE project. Students in both courses increased their levels of experience in skills related to the CURE project, including their ability to design a project where the outcome was unknown. Further, most students felt a sense of project ownership, but their ownership was attributed only to the positive aspects of the CURE. At the end of the CURE, the students in both classes demonstrated the ability to connect ideas and techniques learned in the course to a broader environmental research question. We also suggest several tips for developing collaborative CUREs in undergraduate courses.

AB  - The current K-12 educational system often does not engage students in interdisciplinary learning. To address this need, we developed an integrated STEM + L (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math, and Digital Literacies) afterschool programme in which middle school students took discipline-specific roles (writer, scientist, artist, and engineer) and worked in small groups to produce multimodal science fictions. The study aims to investigate the effect of discipline-specific roles on students' interdisciplinary and collaborative learning processes. Two groups were chosen as comparison cases because their final products indicated low and high levels in integrating science and literacy respectively. Analysing and visualising students' individual role-changing patterns and examining their discourse in role-specific interactions revealed the following features for high-quality interdisciplinary learning: (1) Students need to be willing and able to enact not only expected roles, but also other roles; (2) Students need to develop awareness of their own and others' role enactment; (3) Collaboration between students with different roles may follow a possible trajectory from solo-construction, to co-construction, to re-construction. This study also proposes instructional strategies related to the design of discipline-specific roles to facilitate interdisciplinary learning in STEM education.

AB  - This study explores how life science researchers conceptualize, operationalize, and value Interdisciplinary Research (IDR). We interviewed a sample of 10 established life science faculty to understand the researchers' lived experiences and perspectives on participating in IDR. Six themes emerged from our data: (1) IDR requires the integration of insights from different disciplines, (2) IDR can occur within disciplines, (3) Collaborators should be intentionally selected, (4) Differences in languages must be reconciled, (5) Authentic and frequent collaboration is required, and (6) IDR is valued by life scientists because it broadens our understanding of complex scientific questions and produces great scholarly rewards.

AB  - This paper describes the development and implementation of engaging and supportive experiences to promote student engagement, persistence, and success at a commuter, open enrollment, public, minority-serving institution. Project components included faculty development at the SENCER Summer Institute (SSI) 2016, attended by a team comprised of an academic administrator, full-time faculty from English and math, and part-time faculty in chemistry; creation of a virtual learning community of freshmen enrolled in chemistry, English, and math, linked by the specific theme of the environmental impacts of de-icing roads with salt and the overarching theme of the impacts of human activities on the environment; and peer mentoring in chemistry. Faculty reflections and grade distributions indicate this is a promising approach and suggest strategies for overcoming challenges.

AB  - Between 1906 and 1909 the biologist Ronald Ross and the classicist W.H.S. Jones pioneered interdisciplinary research in biology and history in advancing the claim that malaria had been crucial in the decline of golden-age Greece (fourth century BCE). The idea had originated with Ross, winner of the Nobel Prize for demonstrating the importance of mosquitoes in the spread of the disease. Jones assembled what, today, we would call an interdisciplinary network of collaborators in the sciences and humanities. But early negative reviews of Jones's "Malaria and Greek History" (1909) by classicists and historians ended the project, despite a positive reception among malariologists. Today, the "Jones hypothesis" is often used to exemplify the naïvete of past scholarship, and few examine Jones's evidence and reasoning. In this age of renewed interdisciplinarity, a review of what went wrong is timely. Jones and Ross knew they were opening new methodological territory and struggled with the challenges of multiple ways of knowing. Over 100 years later, malaria remains an important site of historical-biological research, yet integration is elusive. After reviewing the Jones-Ross relationship, Jones's interdisciplinary campaign, and the reception of the hypothesis among classicists/ancient historians and in malariology, we conclude by highlighting some of the specific challenges faced by those exploring the interface of biology and history.

AB  - In a series of Teaching Exchange (TE) staff development workshops aimed at exploring prospective, bottom-up quality assurance in media studies in the United Kingdom, interdisciplinarity arose as a key topic. This article reflects on teaching staff's views expressed in the TE workshops around interdisciplinarity in relation to their experiences in designing and reaching courses, as well as in the classroom. To contextualize these arguments, the article introduces media studies' interdisciplinarity in reference to other fields, then summarizes the methods used to gain insight into the views of higher education practitioners in media studies in the United Kingdom. It then critically discusses the accounts given by workshop participants of three aspects of the role that interdisciplinarity plays in their pedagogy: at the levels of colleagues' profiles, course design, and student bodies. The article concludes by noting that tensions exist between top-down pressures "disciplinizing" media studies and its interdisciplinarity characteristics and argues that the field is best conceptualized as an (inter)discipline that, as such, faces distinctive pedagogical challenges and opportunities. The U.K. case study is posited as a possible counterpoint for other higher education contexts internationally.

AB  - Educational phenomena and child development fascinate many disciplines for which they offer a tremendous field of experimentation and application. More than a hundred years ago, when educational sciences adopted the main institutional emblems of an academic discipline (chairs, diploma, laboratories, scientific network etc.), they obviously vacillated between the dream of becoming a unified science (as pedology testifies), and the claim of a rewarding pluridisciplinarity that could synergise all disciplines concerned with the child and with education. This paper asserts that the issue of pluridisciplinarity is constitutive for the development of sciences of education whose object is ever coveted by other disciplines. The first section adopts the point of view of a social history and, on the basis of voluminous archives, it describes the main lines of the shaping of this pluridisciplinary field in Geneva, representative of that which also occurs elsewhere. In the second part, it presents a more theoretical reflection on the tensions and pitfalls of what we call the "process of disciplinarisation" of educational sciences, outlining the characteristics of this constitutively pluridisciplinary field.

AB  - An interdisciplinary approach has been adopted for undergraduate Law and Social Science students attending separate seven-week intensive language communication courses run at the University of Helsinki. The challenge has been to anchor this pedagogical development within theoretical frames of reference that contextualise the interdisciplinary PBL simulation. Focus is placed on one of the simulations - Bradford Simulation, based on the 1995 riots involving the Pakistani immigrant community in the English city of Bradford. Conflict encompasses multidimensional problems and synthesising interdisciplinarity with the PBL simulation attempts to create a learning environment in which students can gain an insight into the intricacies of conflict analysis, management and resolution. Considerations of student identity and learning factors are recognised. Key operational management factors requiring advanced organisational and communication skills by the teacher are also broached. Whilst positive outcomes have accrued there are limitations that have compromised the activity.

AB  - Situated in the context of an in-service professional development (PD) program focused on Interdisciplinary Science Inquiry, this quantitative study tests the validity of and further explores the theoretical model adapted from Desimone's (2009), "Educational Researcher," 38, 181-199 conceptual framework on effectiveness of PD. The participants include 204 teachers and 5,581 students within 12 local public schools from 2012 to 2016. The multilevel models indicate that PD participation, school-, and teacher-level factors influence teacher pedagogical content knowledge and inquiry instruction in different ways. Furthermore, the inquiry instruction significantly relates student understanding of interdisciplinary science concepts (ISCs) through a few mediators. Therefore, this study reinforces calls to provide teachers with high quality PD and contributes to current knowledge base of the mechanisms of how inquiry instruction influences students' understanding of ISCs.

AB  - The combination of organic synthesis and analytical chemistry into a related laboratory experiment is an excellent demonstration of the utility of making a compound to then be used further. Herein we describe an undergraduate laboratory experiment that involves the straightforward synthesis of an internal standard, ethyl 6-acetyloxyhexanoate, for the quantification of various aroma compounds in juice through GC-FID analysis. In addition to the organic synthetic procedures of undertaking a reaction under reflux, separation, and extraction protocols followed by determining the purity of a synthesized compound, this experiment also facilitates the teaching of making standard solutions, using solid phase extraction, preparing samples, and performing and interpreting the results of GC-FID analysis.

AB  - This paper focuses on system concept use in teaching either chemical core concepts or interdisciplinary chemistry-related topics. The system concept is important in order to develop global competences, and chemistry teaching plays a key role in this context. A questionnaire has been administered to two different samples, Italian teachers and International Baccalaureate (IB) teachers, in order to investigate their opinions about the issues involved. The most significant differences and similarities emerging from the survey have been analyzed mostly by dendrograms and then commented on. With due caution, it is possible to suppose similar attitudes in the two groups of teachers except for some aspects. For example, the analysis of system concept knowledge within pure chemistry highlights some deficiencies: Italian teachers in particular show a low level of epistemological awareness about the systemic character of chemistry, whereas its knowledge would allow not only a chemistry teaching improvement but also a productive use of chemical explanations in other scientific and nonscientific fields, especially in the social sciences; as a consequence, it would facilitate interdisciplinary teaching. Therefore, science teachers need epistemological insight into chemical systemic aspects, that may be provided by high quality textbooks and training initiatives focusing on the systemic character of chemistry and its interdisciplinary connections. In an analysis of chemistry teachers only, Italian teachers support interdisciplinary teaching more strongly than IB teachers, despite the rigidity and the state of crisis of the Italian education system, often attributed to a lack of broad-minded teachers. This evidence indicates a promising resource for the Italian education system. Moreover, a similar kind of questionnaire can be utilized by other education researchers in order to isolate and analyze some teachers' attitudes regardless the very different education systems in which every sample works.

AB  - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics or "STEM" focused pedagogy has been influenced changes in education for decades. Responding to the need for interdisciplinary skilled workforces, the STEM approach has been revised firstly to reflect the incorporation of Arts, (STEAM) and, more recently, to place stronger emphasis on cross-disciplinary connections. However, there is little empirical evidence to drive the development of a practical model for classroom implementation. This systematic review aims to consolidate existing empirical evidence on the incorporation of interdisciplinary learning via a STEM/STEAM approach in high-school environments using a PRISMA review scaffolding. The review identified ninety-nine articles that addressed interdisciplinary learning. However, the majority of them were excluded due to the lack of empirical evidence for such improvements, resulting in only eleven studies being included in the final synthesis. This suggests that more research is required prior to wide-scale implementation within high school education systems. Of those that met the selection criteria, the overarching theme was that improved outcomes were best achieved via either a real-world project-based or problem-based learning pedagogy with the use of community and industry support. However, due to the low number of studies found to fit the criteria, it is recommended that further research is conducted to provide greater empirical evidence to support this finding.

AB  - This article presents a series of activities that not only help learners discover the waggle dance--a behavior performed by scout bees to communicate the location of a flower patch--and its purpose but also introduce circuitry, engineering, and energy transfer using hands-on, inquiry-based strategies. These activities were conducted in a second-grade STEM enrichment setting with 20 students over approximately 90 minutes. The assessments were primarily formative, given the nature of the program. These interdisciplinary standards-aligned activities can be easily adapted to traditional elementary-level classrooms.

AB  - A women's university in Minnesota responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest in the Twin Cities provides a setting to explore ways in which critical, interdisciplinary, and collaborative campus approaches to virtual community-engaged courses and research bring focus to student learning and broaden the scope of collective university impact on urgent and emerging community issues. Three campus community engagement initiatives focusing on racial housing segregation, voting rights, and incarcerated women show the interplay and cumulative impact of curricular, cocurricular, and campuswide responses to systemic injustice. Drawing on interviews with faculty members, student evaluations, and community partner reflections, the author reflects on what can be learned from the adaptations represented in these three community-engaged initiatives during a time of crisis with critical and collective community and campus response.

AB  - Today, more than 23 million children and adolescents are obese or overweight in the United States. Physical educators strive to find appropriate, yet fun activities to encourage and increase physical activity. Introducing students to a variety of activities can promote family involvement in physical activity and create lifelong physical activity habits in children outside of school. Activities of mutual interest (such as roller skating) for girls and boys presented in a coeducational setting can accomplish these goals. Roller skating can be fun and can provide health-related fitness benefits. A roller skating curriculum may spark interest in lifelong physical activity and create an opportunity to incorporate various subject areas such as mathematics, science, health, etc. This article describes an interdisciplinary skating unit that was taught and implemented in a fourth-grade physical education class.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research teams and departments are seen by some as a way of addressing problems that cannot be understood using a traditionally narrow and uniform approach rooted in a particular discipline. This paper presents a postgraduate perspective by discussing the positive and negative impacts on Ph.D. research of this type of work and making recommendations for integrating students into teams containing multiple unfamiliar disciplines. These include formal discussion of opportunities and risks and following advice from those who have taken this route.

AB  - Interdisciplinary service learning opportunities are recognized as valuable educational tools for health care students. The Farm Worker Family Health Program, based on a community academic partnership model, enables health care students to treat migrant workers in rural Georgia during the annual farmworker migration. The present article describes how this opportunity has been incorporated into a graduate curriculum, including examining the challenges and successes associated with implementing this type of program. An additional aim is to explore the implications of merging interdisciplinary service learning and community partnerships with physical therapy education, specifically how student volunteers and migrant workers may be impacted by their participation.

AB  - This article adds to the dialogue on multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research, providing definitions and practical steps for using interdisciplinary educational research to enhance cultural awareness. Informed by a research study conducted by seven primary researchers situated in the U.K. and Kazakhstan, along with local partners, we sought to combine our varied disciplinary knowledge to examine the socio-educational topic of students' well-being in post-Soviet Kazakhstan. Through integrating disciplinary perspectives in particular from psychology, anthropology and sociology into educational research for a longitudinal study (2015-2017), we found enhanced cultural awareness relating to an expanded level of trust and strengthened socio-linguistic translations. The article provides practical steps with key examples from the study to demonstrate our process of utilizing interdisciplinary educational research. Findings suggest the challenges and potential of utilizing these practical steps for facilitating the move from multidisciplinary to interdisciplinary educational research to enhance cultural awareness.

AB  - In this essay, disciplinary "convergence" is offered as a construct that references the blurring of disciplinary walls, academic borders and institutional divisions, a construct that can frame conversations about the role of disciplines in addressing today's student needs in higher education. Convergence as a construct allows for a consideration of converging academic structures as well as the obligation of scholars and practitioners in higher education to address the needs of contemporary students aiming for life and work in a converging and increasingly mediated world. Ultimately, this work suggests that contemporary problems in an information society can be best addressed with broadly trained experts who can think, imagine and solve problem across traditional academic boundaries.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to scrutinise two ostensibly disparate approaches to school-based mental health promotion and offer a conceptual foundation for considering possible synergies between them. Design/methodology/approach: The paper examines current conceptualisations of child and youth mental health and explores how these inform school-based prevention and intervention approaches. The dominance of discrete, "expert-driven" psychosocial programmes as well as the potential of critical pedagogy is explored using frameworks provided by contemporary dynamic systems theories. These theories call for a situated and holistic understanding of children's development; and they look beyond static characteristics within individuals, to view well-being in relation to the dynamic social and historical contexts in which children develop. Findings: Psychosocial interventions and critical pedagogies have strengths but also a number of limitations. Traditional psychosocial interventions teach important skill sets, but they take little account of children's dynamic socio-cultural contexts, nor acknowledge the broader inequalities that are frequently a root cause of children's distress. Critical pedagogies, in turn, are committed to social justice goals, but these goals can be elusive or seem unworkable in practice. By bringing these seemingly disparate approaches into conversation, it may be possible to harness their respective strengths, in ways that are faithful to the complex, emergent nature of children's development, as well as committed to correcting inequalities. Originality/value: The current paper is unique in bringing together contemporary psychological theory with critical pedagogy perspectives to explore the future of school-based mental health promotion.

AB  - Interdisciplinary (i.e., university-wide programming) and disciplinary (i.e., programming open to participants from one college or department) teaching development programs for graduate students have been used for many years in higher education. Currently, research on the benefits of these teaching models remains scant in terms of a contextualized understanding, and empirical studies are needed. The purpose of this study was to determine graduate students' perspectives related to interdisciplinary and disciplinary teaching and learning experiences. Two online surveys were used: a quantitative survey and a qualitative follow-up survey. Three participatory focus groups were also conducted to allow for further in-depth exploration in both an interdisciplinary and disciplinary group setting that represented seven distinct colleges. Statistical and thematic analyses were conducted with survey responses, and thematic analyses were conducted on focus group data. Similar themes emerged from the survey and focus group data identifying perceived benefits of participation in either interdisciplinary or disciplinary teaching development. Respondents' perceived benefits were related to: (a) becoming a better teacher; (b) social learning; and (c) that while the perceived benefits of the models vary, the outcomes of both experiences are shared. The lived experiences of these graduate students expand the characterization of interdisciplinary and disciplinary programming. This study points to the need for graduate student programs--specifically teaching development offered by educational development units--to provide both interdisciplinary and disciplinary teaching development opportunities that achieve a blend of benefits for learners.

AB  - This paper discusses the conceptual and methodological challenges facing two researchers investigating the development of interdisciplinary curricula in two new secondary schools, one in the UK and one in New Zealand. It is a discussion of research in progress that will be of interest to readers because of both the methodological challenges discussed and the research area itself. The key issue we identify is one for both researchers and teachers: how might the concepts and perspective of one discipline be brought into a relationship with another to enable deep learning? This question in turn highlights a key methodological challenge: developing the means to describe and evaluate new forms of curricular design and implementation where a traditional discipline-based curriculum has been rejected in favour of interdisciplinary ones. The integrative aims of interdisciplinarity are also examined. We employ Bernstein's (2000) concept of "knowledge structures" and "languages of description" to theorise a continuum of approaches to curriculum integration, from "functional" to "principled." This methodological manoeuvre is made possible by the development of a "translation device." This procedural mechanism makes accessible to analysis the organising principles that are in play in the interdisciplinary curriculum design practices we have observed. We conclude with recommendations for the interdisciplinary curriculum researcher.

AB  - The ability to conduct interdisciplinary research is crucial to address complex real-world problems that require the collaboration of different scientific fields, with global warming being a case in point. To produce integrated climate-related knowledge, climate researchers should be trained early on to work across boundaries and gain an understanding of diverse disciplinary perspectives. This article argues for social breaching as a methodology to introduce students with a natural science background to the social sciences in the context of integrated climate sciences. The breach of a social norm presented here was to ask people whether the experimenter could ride on an elevator alone. We conclude that the approach is effective in letting students with a natural science background explore and experience the power of social reality, and is especially suitable for a small-sized introductory class.

AB  - Purpose: This retrospective case series utilized clinical data mining (CDM) to understand the potential key components in an integrated treatment approach delivered by speech-language pathologists (SLPs) treating adolescents experiencing persistent cognitive effects postconcussion. The first purpose was to describe the profiles of students treated in our clinic, how they were treated, and the nature of multidisciplinary communication. The second purpose was to generate testable hypotheses about effective intervention options for this population. Methods: Fifteen students aged 13-18 years experiencing prolonged concussion symptoms (PCS) were referred to our SLP graduate training clinic by a local pediatric neuropsychologist for cognitive rehabilitation services. Clinical data mining extracted clinical data in 4 main categories: (a) student characteristics, (b) SLP treatment parameters, (c) clinical outcomes following SLP treatment, and (d) the nature of multidisciplinary communication between practitioners. Results: Aligned with risk factors for PCS as reported in the literature, data on student characteristics revealed that the majority of students had sustained multiple previous concussions and reported a history of depression/anxiety. Data on SLP treatment parameters identified metacognitive strategy instruction and the training of assistive technology for cognition as the most frequent interventions selected to address academic goals. Data showing the frequency and type of multidisciplinary communication revealed that SLPs communicated most often with the pediatric neuropsychologist and educational liaison. Clinical outcome data revealed that 12 of the 15 students achieved their academic goals at the time of discharge. Conclusions: Overall, CDM results suggested that when working in a multidisciplinary team, SLPs can provide cognitive rehabilitation, support symptom reduction, and deliver psychoeducation potentially effective for students experiencing PCS. Key treatment and outcome measurement issues important for developing testable interventions are discussed.

AB  - With the increasing demand for STEM professionals, together with many of the current STEM professionals approaching or already gone over retiring age, there is a current shortfall which is now an urgent requirement to be addressed by Western countries as so much of activities and life in general is increasingly technology dependent. Actions that are currently being taken to address this shortfall in the UK by academic establishments, organizations and professional bodies are considered in this paper. Some of these include those actions that are directed at encouraging a better gender balance in the future as well as those involving actions to attract students to be aware of STEM from an early age to supporting women returning to the STEM profession. Parts of our research examines the learning and studying approaches adopted by some of the learners, their levels of attainment and attitude to learning to use technology and using technology to improve their learning. The paper reports on the developments and improvements from some of these initiatives and activities implemented. Some of these actions include details of competitions from primary to postgraduate students, women only training sessions, online support groups for STEM women, ranging from technical to career and social issues, and details of CAS (Computing At School) support for teachers, both face to face and online, currently with over 30,000 CAS participants. In conclusion the paper reflects on a roll out of some of these activities and potential impact on enhancing interest and uptake of STEM subjects by both the young and older learners and across diverse levels of education.

AB  - This paper identifies what can be called the "paradox of interdisciplinarity" (Weingart 2000) in Australian higher education research governance and explores some of its constitutive dimensions. In the Australian context, the paradox of interdisciplinarity primarily concerns the proliferation of a programmatic discourse of interdisciplinarity in government reports and government policy and strategy documents, often tied to notions of innovation and applicability, parallel to the persistence or even reinforcement of modes of governance and associated mechanisms that almost exclusively rely on rigid discipline-based classification systems to evaluate and fund research. Two interrelated dimensions of this apparent paradox are discussed. First, the conceptions of knowledge that underpin the use of notions of disciplinarity as well as interdisciplinarity in Australian government reports and policy and strategy papers are analysed. Second, an analysis of the Australian research governance system and its underlying mechanisms is presented, as they pertain to interdisciplinary forms of research. On the basis of these analyses, it is concluded that there is a significant mismatch between the discourse of interdisciplinarity and associated conceptions of knowledge on the one hand, and current, relatively inflexible governmental research funding and evaluation practices on the other. It is finally proposed that the occurrence and perpetuation of such a mismatch in the Australian context can only be understood properly if placed in the context of a more general paradox of research governance, where a politically charged rhetoric of innovation conflicts with the actual trend toward an increasingly diminishing scope for the self-organisation of knowledge.

AB  - In German primary schools, natural sciences and social studies are learned and taught in an integrative manner within a subject called Sachunterricht. To teach Sachunterricht in a high-quality manner, it is reasonable to assume that primary school teachers themselves require-- among other things, such as knowledge about pedagogy, teaching Sachunterricht, and the various content areas of Sachunterricht--a distinct interest, academic self-concept, and sense of belonging regarding natural and social sciences. Furthermore, they should possess a solid interdisciplinary competence that enables them to teach natural and social sciences in an integrative way. In the present study, we conducted a longitudinal survey of pre-service primary school teachers from a German university over a period of 2 years to investigate the changes in their (self-evaluated) interdisciplinary competence; the changes in their interest, academic self-concept, and sense of belonging regarding natural and social sciences; and the correlations between these constructs. Our data analysis revealed a decrease over time in participants' sense of belonging to natural and social sciences, as well as their (self-evaluated) interdisciplinary competence, while their academic self-concept in natural and social sciences remained stable. Participants' interest in social sciences decreased, while their interest in natural sciences increased. Moreover, we found varying degrees of correlation between these constructs. In summary, the results of the present study provide important insights into the professional development of pre-service primary school teachers within university-based teacher education for teaching natural and social sciences in primary school. The implications of these findings are discussed in detail at the end of this paper.

AB  - Internationalization presents both opportunities and challenges for higher education policies and curricula, as well as for teaching and learning methods. This article describes and discusses ongoing exploration and development of the planned curriculum of the MA in Media Education at the Faculty of Education at the University of Lapland, Finland, in terms of cultural inclusion and the integration of disciplines. The study concludes that the planned curriculum now includes new content that better supports cultural inclusion. Nevertheless, it was established that several steps are needed to move toward a more inter- and even transdisciplinary media education higher education curriculum.

AB  - Ill-structured problems abound that require sophisticated problem-solving skills, knowledge across multiple domains and the abilities to think critically and communicate effectively. Despite the abundance of rhetoric supporting the need to build these skills in our students, the acquisition of domain-specific knowledge is still the primary focus of most disciplines. Students who have not mastered these skills and possess only domain-specific knowledge will be underprepared to successfully contribute to the solutions to these problems. The IDEA Studio at Virginia Tech implemented a transdisciplinary collaborative learning environment in an effort to bring these skills out of the literature and into the real-world classroom. This paper describes our strategies, the dominant themes that drove our course structure, the challenges we faced and the lessons learned.

AB  - In this paper I call for "new forms of thinking and new ways of theorizing" the complex relations between the biological and social in sport and physical culture. I illustrate the inseparability of our biological and social bodies in sport and physical culture via the case of exercise and female reproductive hormones. Inspired by feminist biologists and philosophers of science such as Lynda Birke and Elizabeth Grosz, I describe my current research project in which I am seeking to create space for female exercisers' (as distinct from female athletes) voices about their embodied experiences of exercise-associated amenorrhea. I offer reflections from my ongoing study and reveal a number of dilemmas that emerge as I consider how we might bring biology--and particularly hormones--back into conversations about women's moving bodies in non-reductionist and non-determinist terms. I conclude by advocating the need for more transdisciplinary approaches to help us move toward more multidimensional understandings of the body in sport and physical culture.

AB  - Multidisciplinary lab experiments combining microfluidics, nanoparticle synthesis, and characterization are presented. These experiments rely on the implementation of affordable yet efficient microfluidic setups based on perfluoroalkoxyalkane (PFA) capillary coils and standard HPLC connectors in upper undergraduate chemistry laboratories. Fundamental principles and concepts as well as practical tips for the rapid deployment of microfluidics are presented. In-line membrane separation, the segmented-flow regime, high-temperature experiments, and in-line analytical techniques are illustrated by the preparation of inorganic nanoparticles (silver, gold, and cadmium selenide or telluride) in microreactors. Besides microfluidics, analytical techniques for nanoparticle analysis are also illustrated.

AB  - The need for evaluation capacity building (ECB) in military psychological health is apparent in light of the proliferation of newly developed, yet untested programs coupled with the lack of internal evaluation expertise. This study addresses these deficiencies by utilizing Preskill and Boyle's multidisciplinary ECB model within a post-traumatic stress disorder treatment program. This model outlines a theoretical framework, offers practical strategies, and emphasizes both context and culture, which are paramount in military health-care settings. This study found that the model provides a highly applicable ECB framework that includes ways to identify ECB objectives, tailor activities, and understand outcomes. While there was high utilization of ECB activities by program staff, there was misaligned evaluative thinking, which ultimately truncated sustainable evaluation practice. Based on this research, evaluators can better understand how to provide an ECB intervention in a complex cultural and political environment and assess its effectiveness.

AB  - Threshold concepts have been widely utilized to understand learning in academic disciplines and student experiences in a disciplinary curriculum. This study considered how threshold concepts might operate within an interdisciplinary setting. Data were collected through interviews with 40 doctoral students enrolled in an interdisciplinary program as well as content analysis of interdisciplinary curricula. The findings emphasize the importance of the integrative process to interdisciplinary initiatives. Interdisciplinary threshold concepts do not result from the addition of multiple disciplines, but rather are fostered through unique facets of the interdisciplinary experience.

AB  - Experiential learning provides students the time and space to participate in the process of learning by engaging in real, modern situations. Via hands on activities and reflection, students are able to assimilate new experiences with previous ones, and it has been repeatedly shown to improve student learning. We assessed how ten days of experiential learning in Tanzania, Africa affected student understanding and retainment of fundamental concepts in evolution, ecology, and ethology. We assessed 25 college students (n = 12 biology majors, n = 13 non-biology majors) with a pre- and post-test. The pre-test was announced to the students and given before travel, and a nearly identical post-test was unannounced and given four weeks after travel. Non-biology majors performed at least ~15-30% higher on their post-exam compared to their pre-exam, and biology majors performed 5-10% higher on their post-exam compared to their pre-exam. The success of our interdisciplinary course can partially be attributed to experiential learning, and our results suggest that experiential learning has a particular value to non-majors.

AB  - This paper argues that two fundamentally incompatible shifts are taking place in higher education institutions in the UK, and beyond: Firstly, there is a move towards appreciation of, and focus on, interdisciplinary teaching, learning and research. Secondly, the university institution is undergoing neoliberal reforms, in the spirit of New Public Management. It is argued that the latter leads to an intensification of pressures to specialise into increasingly narrow disciplinary niches, which in terms is detrimental to the possibilities for interdisciplinary cooperation. (Re)introduction of a feminist ethics of care into the university, as suggested by the feminist slow scholarship movement, is proposed as a possible solution to what is perceived to be negative developments in the higher education sector.

AB  - Higher education institutions are under increasing pressure to offer interdisciplinary education programmes; however, their implementation is not uncomplicated. Particularly where parts of a programme are delivered by different departments, academic development activities to change practices and develop a coherent interdisciplinary programme are problematical. This paper describes a team-based academic development activity aimed at improving student experiences of an interdisciplinary programme by seeking to resolve pedagogical, organisational and structural tensions. The activity is in the form of a Change Laboratory, a formative intervention method that builds on the theoretical framework of Cultural-Historical Activity Theory. Using this approach, participants were able to analyse and discuss the programme in a neutral interdisciplinary forum not available in academic development initiatives at the micro level of the individual teacher.

AB  - Whilst interdisciplinarity has become a central concern of research and learning in geography, few from the discipline have considered the practical facilitation of interdisciplinarity in the classroom. Module convenors, I argue, must pay greater attention to how learners engage and negotiate with peers and perspectives from other disciplines. In this paper, I focus on my own efforts in designing and teaching a second year undergraduate course on health, biomedicine, and society, to illuminate the opportunities and challenges facing teaching staff who seek to provide opportunities for interdisciplinary learning in the classroom. Drawing upon theories of communication, I demonstrate the significance of developing "communicative competence" as a pathway to successful interdisciplinary learning. Unless learners from one discipline can understand, and be understood by, peers from other disciplines, the accomplishment of interdisciplinary learning is undermined. Interdisciplinary modules should include learning outcomes that facilitate student development in this area. Approaching interdisciplinary learning through the lens of communicative competence casts critical attention upon the central abilities and cultural sensitivities that are the hallmarks of interdisciplinary collaboration--from negotiating meaning to critical disciplinary awareness--and highlights the lessons that interdisciplinarity poses for disciplines, such as geography, tasked with preparing students for interdisciplinary learning.

AB  - Purpose: This study developed an interdisciplinary STEM module called the 'Malaysian-Biotechnology-STEM' (MBS) based on the proposed conceptual framework. In addition, this study demonstrated an interdisciplinary approach to teach biotechnology. Method: A two-week pilot test was conducted in Perak, Malaysia. The student questionnaire and biotechnology achievement test were administered to 12 secondary school students (16-18 years old) from a selected school that offered Additional Science. The data were analysed with descriptive statistics. Findings: The study found that the MBS module could improve students understanding in biotechnology and help to foster their 21st century skills such as digital era literacy skill and inventive skill. The study also found that the average mean score of the student achievement improved after the intervention with MBS module. Significance: It can be concluded that the implementation of interdisciplinary MBS module could improve student understanding in biotechnology. Thus, it could further enhance students' interest to pursue the field in higher learning institutions and produce sufficient future workforce for the biotechnology industry.

AB  - The Advanced Interdisciplinary Research Laboratory (AIRLab) is a team-based multidisciplinary research course that focuses on the development of advanced skills including critical thinking, limits of knowledge awareness, metacognition, autonomy, professional capacity, and decision making in complex environments. For many students, AIRLab represents a first attempt at autonomous research, and as such, instructors emphasize teamwork skills development by way of the Kolb Learning Style Inventory and Agile project management techniques necessary for effective research progress. Recent AIRLab course refinements--by way of the introduction of weekly reflection reports, a new digital project management platform, a revised course marking scheme with greater focus on teamwork contributions, and the inclusion of the Earth Science discipline--has improved student learning and driven the course into new directions of interdisciplinary research. In this case, a novel decay-monitoring vessel was designed, permitting for continuous, multifaceted investigations of decay processes that govern fossilization.

In fact, the right to a multidisciplinary assessment is enshrined in the United Nations Convention of the Rights for Persons with Disabilities (United Nations, 2007). In order to avert a "one size fits all" response to particularly heterogeneous diagnoses, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD), the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends multidisciplinary input. Yet, multidisciplinarity lacks empirical evidence of effectiveness, is fraught with conceptual difficulties and methodological incompatibilities, and therefore there is a danger of resorting to an ill-defined eclectic "hodgepodge" of interventions. Virtually all evidence-based interventions in autism and intellectual disabilities are behaviourally based. Not surprisingly, therefore, professionals trained in behaviour analysis to international standards are increasingly becoming key personnel in multidisciplinary teams. In fact, professionals from a range of disciplines seek training in behaviour analysis. In this article we brought together a multidisciplinary group of professionals from education, health, and social care, most of whom have a dual qualification in an allied health, social care, or educational profession, as well as in behaviour analysis. Together we look at the initial training in these professions and explore how behaviour analysis can offer a common and coherent conceptual framework for true multidisciplinarity, based on sound scientific knowledge about behaviour, without resort to reifying theories. We illustrate how this unifying approach can enhance evidence-based multidisciplinary practice so that "one size" will fit all.

AB  - The mental health and well-being of young people and the accessibility of appropriate support is an increasingly salient matter in society. As mental health difficulties can disrupt education, providing pastoral care within education is mandatory within the UK, with established pathways for schools to seek specialist support from external agencies. This paper reviews services provided by a therapeutic team that is integrated within an Educational Trust, in the UK. The Trust comprises of a Social, Emotional and Mental Health (SEMH) secondary academy and an Alternative Provision (AP) academy (which includes Key Stage 3, Key stage 4 and a medical provision). A mixed methods design is used to evaluate the impact of the therapeutic team by considering; the accessibility of therapeutic support, targeted interventions for groups and individuals, and feedback from service users. Strengths and limitations of current methods used to measure the impact of the therapeutic team are discussed, including implications for subsequent academic years. The application of an integrated therapeutic team model to other educational settings is considered.

AB  - Despite its imperfections, academic peer review has been accepted as a satisfactory process by which assessment panels comprised of different disciplinary representatives arrive at agreement through a system of shared rules and language that respects disciplinary plurality. Artistic researchers, whose output is required to meet both scholarly research criteria and the aesthetic standards expected by their peers in the art world, express concern that university peer review processes disadvantage their disciplines due to differences between artistic research and more science-informed research expectations. As research created with the artistic "white cube" in mind intersects with this "black box" of scholarly peer review, do the shared protocols adopted by peer-review panels extend to research expressed not in scholarly text but in artistic artefact? Are there features inherent in artistic research that impinge upon equitable consideration within these settings? This paper draws upon face-to-face interviews with visual and performing artists in three Australian universities to explore how these researchers experience university peer review. It contributes a distinctive disciplinary perspective to understanding university assessment and evaluation processes for the benefit of both academic staff and postgraduate students.

AB  - Augmented reality (AR) is an emerging technology that blends physical objects with virtual reality. Through the integration of digital and print media, a gap between the "on and offline" worlds are merged, radically shifting student-computer interaction in the classroom. This research examined the results of a multiple case study on the use of the AR platform Aurasma in the higher education classroom with 145 students from three disciplines (education, human resource development, and marketing) who participated in the study. Research methods included data collection of pre-experience and post-experience student surveys regarding students' experiences using the platform Aurasma for enhancing learning. Findings included primarily positive student attitudes regarding the usability of AR in the classroom setting and insights into how the Aurasma platform facilitated inquiry and understanding of course concepts. Recommendations for future classroom use are given.

AB  - Recently, there has been a trend towards adding a multidisciplinary or multicultural element to traditional monodisciplinary project courses in computing and engineering. In this article, we examine the implications of multidisciplinarity for students' learning experiences during a one-semester project course for real customers. We use a qualitative research approach and base our analysis on students' learning reports on three instances of a project course titled "Multidisciplinary working life project". The main contribution of this article is the unified theoretical picture of the learning mechanisms stemming from multidisciplinarity. Our main conclusions are that (1) students generally have a positive view of multidisciplinarity; (2) multidisciplinary teams enable students to better identify their own expertise, which leads to increased occupational identity; and (3) learning experiences are not fixed, as team spirit and student attitude play an important role in how students react to challenging situations arising from introduction of the multidisciplinarity.

AB  - In order to explore the rich dynamics of using social media as a tool for learning within higher education classrooms, researchers across three disciplines: education, human resource development (HRD), and marketing, joined forces seeking ways to focus on learning through a retrospective analysis. Three concepts--engagement, community building, and personal meaning formed the framework for this study and were utilized to analyze the themes that emerged from student reflections and opinion surveys. This study used an exploratory mixed-method multiple-case study approach involving seven social media platforms: Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Second Life, and Skype. The research is unique because it not only looks at how social media can energize traditional and online instruction, it also cuts across three disciplines of higher education offering insights on how social media can be used to promote student learning.

AB  - This study examines the ties of sixth-grade teachers to their interdisciplinary team colleagues and explores the dimensions of their efficacy beliefs for their own and their colleagues' teaching. Teachers (n = 238; 83% female, 88% White) from 26 middle schools completed surveys about the relational aspects of ties to team colleagues, the dimensions of their sense of efficacy for teaching, and their perceptions of team members' collective efficacy at fall, winter, and spring of one school year. Greater tie strength in fall predicted greater relational trust at winter and spring. Tie strength to teammates in fall predicted greater efficacy beliefs for classroom management and collective efficacy across the year, through greater relational trust midway through the year. The findings expand theorizing and reveal organizational processes that may be used to leverage teacher efficacy beliefs.

AB  - Here, we present an interdisciplinary educational project intended for high school chemistry that is focused on the establishment of a mathematical model to describe the relationship between conductivity and concentration, while linking chemistry to mathematics with the help of computer software. The project was designed to help high school students engage in methods and comprehend advanced topics beyond the typical high school chemistry curriculum, as well as to resolve a problem that no single disciplinary perspective is able to solve. This project provided students with a simple method to build mathematical models, which could be used to help them discover the relationship between discrete experimental data and mathematical equations. A postinstructional survey showed that, after completing the project, more students knew how to construct mathematical equations that fit discrete data.

AB  - Scientific problems of the twenty-first century involve complex research questions that require an interdisciplinary approach. Educational research suggests that overall student achievement is greater in an interdisciplinary science curriculum than in a discipline-specific science curriculum. Regardless, the secondary school science curriculum in Ontario remains discipline-specific. The Ontario Ministry of Education (OME) released an 'Interdisciplinary Studies' curriculum in 2002; however, it appears to be sparsely implemented across Ontario. The objective of this study is to investigate what guidelines are provided by the OME to help Ontario secondary school science teachers (grades 11-12) design and implement interdisciplinary science courses. A document analysis methodology is used to gather data from selected OME curriculum documents. The results of this study found that interdisciplinary science courses are based on multiple models of interdisciplinarity; however, the guidelines provided for developing interdisciplinary curriculum, assessment, and teaching methods do not explicitly indicate which type of interdisciplinary model is applied, nor do the documents explicitly consider the degree of integration of concepts and skills from across disciplines/subject areas. Primarily, the results of this study may inform Ontario Ministry science curriculum writers, teachers and educators interested in interdisciplinary science curriculum elsewhere, about what aspects of the selected curriculum documents provide practical information for developing interdisciplinary science courses and components of the curriculum that may warrant potential revisions or additions during future curriculum drafting.

AB  - This article analyzes the academic identity constructions of applied linguists in the context of interdisciplinary collaborations as they seek to integrate language and content at the curricular core of an increasingly multilingual and multicultural university in Western Canada. The study draws on transcripts of audiotaped monthly meetings, framed as a professional learning community, where participants shared and discussed existing literature on interdisciplinary collaborations in support of multilingual student success, as well as their experiences with collaboration in the institution. In this qualitative study, data were analyzed thematically, and the themes that emerged suggest complex connections between institutional roles and professional identities with the changing roles of the participants in the institution interacting with the construction of their academic identities. Overall, we conceptualize these applied linguists as cross-boundary academics who perform translational functions within the institution in negotiating their disciplinary knowledge with faculty across the disciplines. As such, they contribute to building capacity in working in a multilingual environment through their efforts to integrate language and content instruction jointly with their disciplinary colleagues.

AB  - Live-in college residential life positions often involve extensive and diverse responsibilities including the support of residential students experiencing traumatic life events. While live-in staff undergo extensive training in regard to supporting these students, they are often ill-equipped to understand and prevent potential negative consequences associated with trauma support work including burnout, compassion fatigue, and secondary traumatic stress. Given the increase in students reporting traumatic life events including sexual violence, severe economic hardships, and severe mental health disabilities, it follows that live-in residential life staff are being called on more frequently to serve as first responders and support personnel for these students. Current literature highlights the potentially deleterious impact of trauma support work on helping professionals, but few publications exist that highlight ways to prevent these effects within a residential life context. This article looks outside of the higher education literature to explore how a related helping profession, social work, provides training and education to social work practitioners in order to mitigate potential negative outcomes stemming from their work with individuals experiencing trauma.

AB  - Higher education is faced with the challenging problem of preparing students for their careers while developing them to be well-rounded, life-long learners. Employers report they desire candidates who use a broader set of skills and have higher levels of learning and knowledge to meet the increasingly complex demands of today's workplace. At Mercer University, the Department of Chemistry offers a traditional ACS-certified B.S. degree in Chemistry, but for some students, this course of study does not address their desire for the interdisciplinarity that is becoming more common in today's work environment. The department has developed a program in Chemical Commerce that focuses on developing students' foundational knowledge in several of the chemical disciplines while also providing them with a business curriculum. The program provides a high degree of flexibility for students, with B.A. and B.S. tracks and three areas of focus in business to choose from (Accounting, Business Management, and Economics). An upper-level chemistry course titled "Traditions in Commercial Chemistry" was developed for advanced Chemistry, Chemical Commerce, and Biochemistry and Molecular Biology majors and served as a capstone experience for these students. This course focused on the application of advanced chemistry and its associated principles in a variety of business sectors. With the broad skills students have acquired in the program, they have gained employment in industry and matriculated into medical, pharmacy, and business-administration programs. Though not intended to replace a full chemistry degree, this program is in high demand and is experiencing exceptional growth from students who seek components of a chemistry degree while gaining business acumen. Approaches used in developing these degrees and course are highly transferrable to other institutions and may provide more options for students interested in a wider variety of career paths.

AB  - This paper addresses the gaps between language documentation and language revitalization. It is intended for several audiences, including field linguists interested in supporting endangered language sustainability efforts and participants of all kinds in language revitalization courses, programs, and infrastructure. The authors contend that ethnographic methods have transformative potential for contemporary language revitalization practice. Using anthropological tools, linguists and/or speech community members can enrich documentary efforts, mobilize linguistic data for more effective revitalization programs, and improve assessments of language revitalization projects. Beginning with a discussion of ethnographic methods and their connection to existing linguistic practices, this paper moves on to address the impact of language revitalization planning and infrastructure on endangered language use. It then outlines key ethnographic concepts that were identified as particularly useful in two pilot ethnographic methods classes run by the authors in 2015 and 2016, each of which can be operationalized using the basic tenets of participant observation. These concepts present ways of re-evaluating understandings of "communities"; considering language ideologies, ideological clarification, and language socialization; recognizing the nature and implications of different social roles and identities of those involved in revitalization projects; and attuning to genre and intertextuality in the development of resources. The incorporation of both basic ethnographic methodologies and of conceptual frames like these can supplement a field linguist's or a language revitalization program's tools to help them better collaborate across differences, support and assess language programs, and understand the obstacles that may exist between them, their collaborators, and sustainable language vitality.

AB  - Generational differences in the way knowledge-makers negotiate shifts in relation to interdisciplinary knowledge-making at one Canadian university are studied. Semi-structured interviews with 20 participants in science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines were conducted. Using a Foucauldian approach, transcripts were read to determine how academic identities and subject positions are formed and reformed through time as different discursive spaces are experienced. The historical perspective of older participants revealed the complex interplay between private and public "scripts". Participants demonstrated agency on behalf of themselves and their institution by engaging in practices they thought would provide space for research that "really mattered". Older participants who were administrators promoted instrumental forms of interdisciplinarity that did not challenge the central role of disciplines in the construction of expertise. Younger participants were more likely to resist being "disciplined"; they identified strongly with conceptual forms of interdisciplinarity and derived both satisfaction and creativity from working in the margins of knowledge spaces.

AB  - In this three-part article we seek to establish connections between the emerging framework of "sustainability science" and the methodological basis of research and practice in science education in order to bring forth knowledge and competences for sustainability. The first and second parts deal with the implications of taking a sustainability view in relation to knowledge processes. The complexity, uncertainty and urgency of global environmental problems challenge the foundations of reductionist Western science. Within such debate, the proposal of sustainability science advocates for inter-disciplinary and inter-paradigmatic collaboration and it includes the requirements of "post-normal science" proposing a respectful dialogue between experts and non-experts in the construction of new scientific knowledge. Such a change of epistemology is rooted into participation, deliberation and the gathering of extended-facts where cultural framings and values are the hard components in the face of soft facts. A reflection on language and communication processes is thus the focus of knowledge practices and educational approaches aimed at sustainability. Language contains the roots of conceptual thinking (including scientific knowledge) and each culture and society are defined and limited by the language that is used to describe and act upon the world. Within a scenario of sustainability, a discussion of scientific language is in order to retrace the connections between language and culture, and to promote a holistic view based on pluralism and dialogue. Drawing on the linguistic reflection, the third part gives examples of teaching and learning situations involving prospective science teachers in action-research contexts: these activities are set out to promote linguistic integration and to introduce reflexive process into science learning. Discussion will focus on the methodological features of a learning process that is akin to a communal and emancipatory research process within a sustainability scenario.

AB  - Interdisciplinary training for doctoral students is an emerging scenario in higher education. The learning relations of knowledge transfer (KT: transferring knowledge from one person to another) and knowledge integration (KI: integrating or synthesizing perspectives from different disciplines) built by doctoral students play an important role in the process of interdisciplinary training. This study explores how doctoral students from a wide range of disciplines build learning relations of KT and KI during online interdisciplinary training. A mixed-methods approach was applied. First, longitudinal social network analysis (SNA) was employed to investigate the patterns of KT and KI relations over a seven-month training period. Subsequently, interviews were conducted to triangulate the SNA findings. SNA results show that the establishment of KI relations is significantly less than that of KT. Qualitative results show three themes explaining the challenges of KI relations, including challenges of online settings, the design of the training modules, and student involvement. Practical implications are drawn for the improvement of online interdisciplinary training, such as suggestions to promote KI and strategies for group learning.

AB  - This paper examines shifts in the knowledge production policy agenda at Japanese research universities -- a transition from discipline-based academic tradition towards interdisciplinary forms of knowledge production -- through a case study of a leading interdisciplinary research institute. We examine this transition through the case of Tohoku University, one of seven 'Designated National Universities', and its flagship International Research Institute of Disaster Science. Documentary analysis revealed a renewed emphasis on interdisciplinarity, evident in restructuring towards a 'blended hybrid' model to reconcile the different institutional logics of diverse research traditions among its staff. Interviews with key stakeholders uncovered the internal dynamics of this process, its barriers and opportunities. We conclude with implications for Japanese higher education, arguing that a shift to 'blended hybrid' institutional forms is necessary but insufficient to maintain successful interdisciplinary research institutes. Success is contingent on simultaneous commitment to sustainable international connections and relationships with diverse external stakeholders.

AB  - Background: Teachers' beliefs play an important role in how teachers think about how students learn, and how content should be organized and taught. Integrated STEM is pushing the boundaries of some of the traditional assumptions in education--disciplined-based courses, courses taught independently by teachers, standards and content-driven, and no collaborative planning time for teachers. Six teachers, located in two high schools, participated in a year-long program to develop interdisciplinary collaboration to implement integrated STEM learning in their courses. A qualitative instrumental case study of the two teams of teachers was conducted to gain insights and understandings of the teachers' beliefs and instructional practices of STEM integration through interdisciplinary approaches in a complex system (i.e., hydroponics). Results: Themes regarding features, beliefs and practices, and challenges emerged from cross-case analysis of the teachers' stories, which resulted in two interdisciplinary collaboration models, multi-classroom and extracurricular activity, from each of the teams at each of the two high schools. Multi-classroom and extracurricular activity models had some resemblances, but also had differences. Both cases had the same goals to use real-world problems to help students see STEM connections, learn STEM knowledge and skills, and apply STEM knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems. Conclusions: Based on teachers' beliefs and their interdisciplinary STEM collaboration practices, three components were identified. Team size, teaching goal, and collaboration structure highly affect a successful interdisciplinary STEM collaboration model in high school settings. The study also contributes to expend the concept of a continuum of STEM approaches to curriculum integration, disciplinary, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary (Vasquez, Sneider, & Comer, STEM lesson essentials: Integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, 2013), and provides frameworks for structuring a successful interdisciplinary collaboration model in high school settings.

AB  - The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Seoul Agenda for Arts Education (2010) calls for ensuring equitable access to arts education for all, strengthening the quality of arts education and harnessing its potential to contribute to resolving social and cultural challenges. In both South Africa and Denmark, a practice-policy gap exists between what the curricula prescribe in the area of arts education and what is experienced to be happening in the everyday life at schools. This gap contributes to creating inequality in terms of access to arts education. It is therefore important to find ways that might give access to arts education to a broader range of children, and to find out how their participation might contribute to advancing their future opportunities. This paper explores how arts education policies can be enacted within schools in both Denmark and South Africa. It takes as its point of departure a project that investigates the potential of an educational practice that integrates dance with visual arts and involves multicultural groups of children, teachers and artists in two school classes in South Africa and Denmark. It focuses on what importance arts education might have, especially to those children in the two classes who are 'at risk', by illuminating their experiences and opportunities for learning through integration of dance and visual arts. In this study, a phenomenologically inspired concept of learning, which includes enhanced awareness, theories of multi-modal experience in the arts and Todres' concept of 'soulful space' contribute to illuminate educational potential of the artistic-educational approaches that were developed in the project. Through a hermeneutic phenomenological methodology, children's experiences were elicited through reflective group dialogues involving 'stimulated recall' based on photographs of them engaged in different activities and drawings that they had created, which reflected their experiences.

AB  - A crucial skill for researchers in inter- and transdisciplinary environmental projects is the ability to be reflexive about knowledge and knowledge production. Few studies exist on the operationalization of reflexive skills and teaching and learning strategies that help students master these skills. This research aims to contribute in this direction. We distinguished two components of reflexive skills: (i) assessing the relative contributions of scientific disciplines and non-academic knowledge in addressing environmental issues; (ii) assessing the role of norms and values in research. We developed a framework for teaching and learning reflexive skills and evaluated this framework within a quasi-experimental educational setting involving 3 groups of 30 students. Students' reflexive skills were assessed quantitatively using a pre- and post-test questionnaire. Moreover, students' reflection papers were analysed to get a better understanding of their perspectives on the teaching and learning framework. We show that it is possible to train students in reflexive skills, but it requires a well-designed learning setting.

AB  - Despite widespread acknowledgment of the importance of interdisciplinary pedagogy, disciplinary teaching remains the norm on most campuses, primarily due to cost and institutional constraints. Bridging the gap between literature on interdisciplinary teaching and active-learning techniques, this article describes an innovative and less costly approach through the linkage of case-study active-learning techniques with interdisciplinary principles at a small liberal arts college. We apply this student-centered approach to teaching international development, a field that critically needs integration across several social sciences. A practical way for political scientists to encourage undergraduate-level interdisciplinary thinking is to develop a case study that asks students to utilize practical problem-solving skills and policy analysis. We analyze the implementation and assessment of such a case study, discuss its successes and shortcomings and provide suggestions for expanded implementation. We also discuss the broad applicability of this approach to topics that require integration across disciplines in a variety of institutional settings.

AB  - This study explores student learning outcomes from an Introduction to Interdisciplinary Studies course. The article focuses on students' perceptions of cognitive abilities, skills and attributes developed through participation in an interdisciplinary research and design project. Participants were 50 students enrolled in the course. A pre-post survey matched pairs design was used to analyze data generated from Likert scale responses. Content analysis was used to analyze responses to open-ended survey questions. The study's findings illustrate the potential interdisciplinary studies programs have for fostering the development of skills required for success in the workplace and for good citizenship.

AB  - In this work, a laboratory experiment to introduce graduate students to nanotechnology is described. Students prepared poly(lactic-"co"-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles using two different synthesis procedures, a single and a double emulsion-solvent evaporation method. The students also performed a physicochemical characterization of the prepared nanoparticles (NPs) by determining the hydrodynamic size and zeta potential values through Dynamic and Electrophoretic Light Scattering, respectively. The experiments were designed to be accomplished in two 180 min sessions and have been successfully conducted by 24 graduate students.

AB  - This study provides a critical engagement with the principle of inclusion, as manifest in three international, interdisciplinary master programmes in Denmark. Initially, it is proposed that one focuses on the knowledge practices found in international, interdisciplinary education, asking to what extent these suggest inclusion in the sense that all students are treated as equals. The alternative is an exclusive learning environment where certain groups are singled out for special treatment, which will often request from them assimilation into the dominant practice. A conceptual point of departure is provided by the educational sociology of Pierre Bourdieu, which motivates the identification of "normative centres" (Graham, L., and R. Slee. 2008. "An Illusory Interiority: Interrogating the Discourse/s of Inclusion." "Educational Philosophy and Theory" 40 (2): 277-293. doi:10.1111/j.1469-5812.2007.00331.x, 283) related to the two themes of "interdisciplinarity" and "international-ness". The topics are subsequently pursued in an empirical analysis, drawing on 19 qualitative research interviews with lecturers involved in the three master courses. This leads to the conclusion that exclusive knowledge practices can be found in all programmes. At the same time, the interviews reveal a reality that is multi-centred, suggesting that interdisciplinarity is as "troublesome" (Land, R. 2012. "Crossing Tribal Boundaries: Interdisciplinarity as a Threshold Concept." In "Tribes and Territories in the 21st Century", edited by P. Trowler, M. Saunders, & V. Bamber, 175-185. Abingdon: Routledge) in higher education as the question of internationalisation.

AB  - The study discussed in this article sought to identify cross-program professional development needs of county-based Extension professionals (field educators). The study instrument was completed by 105 county-based Extension professionals. Interdisciplinary topics, such as program evaluation and volunteer management, were identified as subjects of needed professional development for the Extension professionals whose sole program area was Economic and Community Development. Extension professionals in both the Agriculture and Natural Resources and the Health and Human Sciences program areas tended not to identify topics from each other's program areas as subjects of needed professional development.

AB  - There are significant parallels between interdisciplinarity and phenomenology. Interdisciplinary conscious processes involve identifying relevant disciplines, evaluating each disciplinary insight, and creating common ground. In an analogous way, phenomenology involves conscious processes of epoché, reduction, and eidetic variation. Each stresses perspective taking and the role of imagination in achieving essential generalities--either interdisciplinary common ground or phenomenological eidetic intuitions. Integrated products of interdisciplinary research are "categorial intuitions," in phenomenological terminology, public and able to be communicated. The overall purpose of this comparison is to encourage communication between contemporary practitioners of both approaches to phenomena.

AB  - This article is a collaboration by the lead faculty member in a Masters program in Intercultural Studies and students who completed the program under his aegis. This article presents the program's approach to its research course sequence, an approach involving the integration of interdisciplinary and qualitative research. The authors first provide a theoretical justification for this approach by highlighting key principles and practices of both interdisciplinary and qualitative research that act as points of integration. Then, they contextualize this approach by framing it within the graduate program's three-course research sequence. The authors then illustrate this integrative approach with one cohort's collaborative project on Bedouin communities in Oman, focusing on three key features of integration: the multidisciplinary literature search, the data collection process, and the integrative analysis. The authors conclude with a model for integrative intercultural research.

AB  - We consider the philosophical and pedagogical aspects of "man-labour" system and justify its interdisciplinarity. On the basis of results of scientific researches the need for an objective systematization and specialization in pedagogy is emphasized. Four areas of education sciences systematization, proposed by Z. Vyatrovsky are analyzed. Particular attention is paid to the problems of the dialectical relationship of labour pedagogy, labour psychology and vocational pedagogy in globalization and integration processes. In this context prognostic significance of research aimed at dynamic development of "man-labour" system in the information and technology community is revealed.

AB  - Population ageing signals the need for a responsive community aged care workforce respectful of older people's diverse healthcare needs. Person-centered care premises individual needs and preferences to enhance participation in health care. Training for diversity does not yet exist for this workforce, but is necessary to ensure appropriate care for diverse community-dwelling older people. This article aims to review the range of research traditions for conceptualizing diversity training, theoretical approaches, and empirical findings to understand the relevance for the community aged care sector. Using a meta-narrative approach, research from health, education, psychology, sociology, and business literature was reviewed for meaningful contribution to supporting training for community aged care workers. Meta-narrative review principles included: planning, searching, mapping, appraisal/synthesis, and recommendations. Six meta-narratives were identified, consolidated into three areas: person-centered and culturally competent health care; human rights approach; and psychological approaches to diversity training. The meta-narratives highlighted diversity within diversity and a move toward intersectionality. Meta-narratives were linked through concepts of inclusion, reduction in bias, and access and equity healthcare policy and practice. Training for community aged care workers is challenging, with this synthesis providing new understandings of diversity training, paramount for provision of responsive and equitable health care for older people.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the intercultural learning outcomes for students in the Interdisciplinary Ghana Study Abroad Program. Data were collected from 28 students using the Intercultural Learning Outcomes (ILO) questionnaire containing 29 statements and 5 content domains (functional knowledge, world geography knowledge, interpersonal accommodation knowledge, global interdependence knowledge, and cultural sensitivity knowledge). Data were collected before engaging in and after completing the short-term program. Overall mean ratings showed that 83% of the 29 statements increased from pretest to posttest whereas none of the statements experienced a decrease in ratings. Paired t test revealed that a significant increase occurred in mean ratings for two content domains--functional knowledge and knowledge of global interdependence.

AB  - Problem-based learning is often characterised as an approach encompassing interdisciplinary learning; however, little attention has been explicitly paid to what a claim of interdisciplinary problem-based learning means in practice. Even less attention has been given to address the consequences of interdisciplinary problem-based learning for students, teachers and institutions of higher education. This article examines the intentions and principles of interdisciplinary learning and problem-based learning, respectively. This examination reveals considerable overlaps of the two perspectives which, it is argued, make problem-based learning a potentially compelling pedagogical practice conducive for students' learning across disciplines. The second part of this article addresses three distinct barriers which need to be addressed in order to realise the potentials of interdisciplinary learning in problem-based settings. These barriers are related to the organisation of curriculum, developing student competencies to navigate with interdisciplinary problems and developing teacher competencies to meet student's needs. The conclusion is that interdisciplinary learning cannot be taken for granted in problem-based settings, and only if issues of interdisciplinary learning are specifically addressed can problem-based learning be considered a pedagogical approach adequately scaffolding interdisciplinary learning in higher education. Consequently, more research is needed to fully comprehend the potentials of problem-based learning as conducive for interdisciplinary learning. Particularly, research into the scaffolding of interdisciplinary learning in problem-based learning is required.

AB  - This study aims to describe the history of interdisciplinary education and the current trends and to elucidate the conceptual framework and values that support interdisciplinary science teaching. Many science educators have perceived the necessity for a crucial paradigm shift towards interdisciplinary learning as shown in science standards. Interdisciplinary learning in science is characterized as a perspective that integrates two or more disciplines into coherent connections to enable students to make relevant connections and generate meaningful associations. There is no question that the complexity of the natural system and its corresponding scientific problems necessitate interdisciplinary understanding informed by multiple disciplinary backgrounds. The best way to learn and perceive natural phenomena of the real world in science should be based on an effective interdisciplinary teaching. To support the underlying rationale for interdisciplinary teaching, the present study proposes theoretical approaches on how integrated knowledge of teachers affects their interdisciplinary teaching practices and student learning. This research further emphasizes a need for appropriate professional development programs that can foster the interdisciplinary understanding across various science disciplines.

AB  - It is recognised that educational environments influence learning experiences, so it is important to ensure that educational buildings are designed to be fit for purpose. In order to ensure that educational buildings meet the needs of those who use them, all relevant stakeholders should be involved in the design process. However, this is not straightforward and much remains unclear about how involvement in such complex design processes should proceed. This article presents the findings of four small heterogeneous groups of architects, educational designers, teachers and students from the UK and The Netherlands, discussing how they would envision optimal collaboration and involvement of stakeholders in the process of (re)designing educational buildings and instructional methods. Presentations from the four groups were transcribed and analysed. Informed by a review of existing models and frameworks, our findings were synthesised into a new interdisciplinary model of participatory building design in education. This new model focuses on an iterative design process with different stakeholders involved in different ways at different times. We propose that this model can inform policy and practice in educational building design, as well as within co-creation of curricula, learning, teaching and assessment.

AB  - Prior to the recycling process, raising awareness of plastic waste impact, e.g., polluting oceans worldwide, is undoubtedly a first attempt to tackle this pandemic environmental issue. With this in mind, the presented practical session is an effort to entice an interdisciplinary audience of science undergraduates toward a sustainable future. The associated assignment focuses on a collaboration of undergraduate chemistry students and engineering undergraduates with a minor program in chemistry. Acting on an adequate uncluttered mind map of practical guidelines, the students acquire and exchange multiple "good laboratory practice" skills. By this, engineering undergraduates get acquainted with chemicals, e.g., polymers, while future chemists get an impression of how economics is concerned to maintain a balance between economy and ecology, i.e., a circular economy. In a grand finale, the students present their interdisciplinary communication skills via a poster exhibition: "chemistry meets economics." Moreover, via this interdisciplinary approach the traditional polymer chemistry laboratory session, still a substantial part of the organic chemistry curriculum in the polymer chemistry courses, gets a makeover and will be integrated into a modern, advanced curriculum.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to re-conceptualize the phenomenon of motivational climate in Physical Education and sport coaching as a concept that is not purely psychological in nature, but also highly dependent upon pedagogical and sociological theories. In doing so, an interdisciplinary perspective is promoted where the three aforementioned disciplines combine and intersect in order to enrich teachers' and coaches' understanding of motivational climate. The ultimate aim is to assist practitioners in fostering an effective and stimulating learning environment. The pre-existing TARGET acronym (task, authority, recognition, grouping, evaluation and time) is used to structure the paper. These TARGET structures are further developed with links to relevant pedagogical and sociological theory to enrich them. Further, a strong emphasis is placed on "relationships," which have not previously been featured in the TARGET literature. It is anticipated that inter-disciplinary research on motivational climate will emerge from the ideas presented.

AB  - Interdisciplinary understanding requires integration of insights from different perspectives, yet it appears questionable whether disciplinary experts are well prepared for this. Indeed, psychological and cognitive scientific studies suggest that expertise can be disadvantageous because experts are often more biased than non-experts, for example, or fixed on certain approaches, and less flexible in novel situations or situations outside their domain of expertise. An explanation is that experts' conscious and unconscious cognition and behavior depend upon their learning and acquisition of a set of mental representations or knowledge structures. Compared to beginners in a field, experts have assembled a much larger set of representations that are also more complex, facilitating fast and adequate perception in responding to relevant situations. This article argues how metacognition should be employed in order to mitigate such disadvantages of expertise: By metacognitively monitoring and regulating their own cognitive processes and representations, experts can prepare themselves for interdisciplinary understanding. Interdisciplinary collaboration is further facilitated by team metacognition about the team, tasks, process, goals, and representations developed in the team. Drawing attention to the need for metacognition, the article explains how philosophical reflection on the assumptions involved in different disciplinary perspectives must also be considered in a process complementary to metacognition and not completely overlapping with it. (Disciplinary assumptions are here understood as determining and constraining how the complex mental representations of experts are chunked and structured.) The article concludes with a brief reflection on how the process of Reflective Equilibrium should be added to the processes of metacognition and philosophical refection in order for experts involved in interdisciplinary collaboration to reach a justifiable and coherent form of interdisciplinary integration. An Appendix of "Prompts or Questions for Metacognition" that can elicit metacognitive knowledge, monitoring, or regulation in individuals or teams is included at the end of the article.

AB  - A significant problem in today's school science education is that students often perceive fundamental scientific principles and natural laws as isolated pieces of knowledge without connections between them or to natural phenomena. Instead, students too often are engaging in activities which are distinct and do not follow a meaningful learning sequence, thus depriving them of the opportunity to transfer knowledge and build on past experiences make connections between the different fundamental principles of our world. In our work, we proposed to teachers the use of the "Big Ideas of Science", a set of overarching core ideas, as a cross-disciplinary 'backbone structure' for science education that could support their efforts to facilitate students' ability to see and make the connections between previously and newly acquired knowledge as well as between science subjects taught in school classroom and everyday life. The results presented in this paper confirm that teachers indeed found such an approach beneficial for their students and that the "Big ideas Of Science" could contribute in teaching science more effectively.

AB  - This study explores what academics in one major university in Great Britain (The Great Western University) perceive interdisciplinary research (IDR) to be, and in doing so, differentiates it from associated concepts, such as multidisciplinary research and transdisciplinary research, found in the research literature. This study is important because the university in which the study is set has undertaken a complete restructuring of colleges and departments to support interdisciplinary research. The inquiry utilized a two-phased, mixed methods, descriptive case study to examine perceptions of the nature, significance, and benefits of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research. The methods of data collection were semi-structured interview (25 participants), survey (127 participants), and analysis of archival documents. The findings indicate that the restructuring of The Great Western University to support interdisciplinary research began on less than firm footing. While scholars seem to have clarified in the definitions of interdisciplinary approaches, in practice there is still a lack of clarity in sectors which are less familiar with interdisciplinary approaches to solving major problems facing society. We identified issues of clarity of terminology and mission, flexibility of implementation, and alignment of faculty incentives as involving necessary but unmet conditions for fostering and promoting interdisciplinarity throughout the university.

AB  - Twenty-first-century biology is inherently interdisciplinary. Every aspect of biology, from molecules to organisms to ecosystems, is richly informed by the physical, mathematical, and computational sciences. It is both an exciting and daunting time for biology educators--exciting because of the vast opportunity for important new discoveries that will come about in an interdisciplinary context, yet daunting for many current biology educators who were not trained within such a framework. The call for transformation of the undergraduate biology experience to better address interdisciplinarity is not new. At St. Olaf College, a liberal arts college with an undergraduate-only population of [approximately] 3000, school administrators are fortunate in that their relatively small size allows for a certain degree of nimbleness as they consider changes that foster interdisciplinarity. In this essay, the authors share some perspectives and examples that have emerged for them over the past 10 years or so as they have attempted to offer a broadly interdisciplinary environment in which their students and faculty explore and understand biology.

AB  - This project identified academics who have been involved with interdisciplinary leadership initiatives and sought to find out what had motivated them, what issues they had encountered and how they had resolved them. A powerful message emerging is the central importance of motivation in interdisciplinary work. Interviewees spoke of leaving their disciplinary "home" for a more complex and difficult--but often more rewarding--environment. Interviews also illuminated the impact of interdisciplinary work on academic careers and suggested that an academic's career stage was a vital factor influencing the likelihood of pursuing an interdisciplinary initiative. The individual and systemic challenges brought on by interdisciplinary work highlight the role of structure and agency in an academic career path. These issues coalesce around reward systems, where there is a need to recognise the expanding role of academics within interdisciplinary contexts.

AB  - Multilingualism is a prevalent reality in today's world. From an individual level to a societal one, multilingualism incorporates many aspects that have been studied extensively by diverse social research disciplines. The present article will explore the potential directions which multilingualism research can take, concentrating mainly on the benefits of the integration of psychological methods in mainstream multilingualism research. We propose that a closer collaboration between psychologists and applied linguists is necessary for the advancement of the field of multilingualism. The integration of the themes and methodologies of the two social sciences will be advantageous to both. The diverse methodological approaches should not be viewed as a hindrance for the development of multilingual research, but rather as an asset. Linguists and psychologists can draw on each other's methodological expertise since many of the research questions asked are comparable and complementary.

AB  - One reason scholars and students are attracted to interdisciplinary studies and its research process is because doing good work in the field requires values, traits and skills that are virtuous rather than vicious. This study examines how successful interdisciplinary research is intrinsically related to the human capacity for reverence in the face of complexity. Articulating reverence in the research process advances our understanding of interdisciplinary theories concerning complexity, perspective taking, common ground and integration. The result helps balance the cognitive emphasis in interdisciplinary studies with an account emphasizing emotion and character. Interdisciplinary reverence illuminates the kind of integration practiced in the humanities and fine and performing arts.

AB  - This article utilizes one counselor education program's experience as a framework for exploring how to prepare counselors to work in interdisciplinary teams. Based on an interdisciplinary training program that involves faculty and graduate students from counseling, social work, nursing, internal medicine and family medicine, the article explores the role discipline-specific orientations play in the outcome of interdisciplinary training programs. Using practical examples grounded by the program's experiences and literature on interdisciplinary training, understanding of the dynamics of interdisciplinary training programs is explored. Implications for preparing counselors for interdisciplinary work and future research are provided.

AB  - The article deals with interdisciplinary aspects of learning in the case of physics and psychology. It describes the lab-based academic course focused on: observation and experimentation; discovery of new scientific facts; measurement; identification of errors; the study of psychological characteristics of people (time perception, the reaction time, thresholds). The above techniques are commonly used by both physicists and psychologists. Students are interested in these topics. They are very important, but are excluded from traditional physics and psychology courses.

AB  - Problem-solving has been one of the major strands in science education research. But much of the problem-solving research has been conducted on discipline-based contexts; little research has been done on how students, especially individuals, solve interdisciplinary problems. To understand how individuals reason about interdisciplinary problems, we conducted an interview study with 16 graduate students coming from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. During the interviews, we asked participants to solve two interdisciplinary science problems on the topic of osmosis. We investigated participants' problem reasoning processes and probed in their attitudes toward general interdisciplinary approach and specific interdisciplinary problems. Through a careful inductive content analysis of their responses, we studied how disciplinary, cognitive, and affective factors influenced their interdisciplinary problems-solving. We found that participants' prior discipline-based science learning experiences had both positive and negative influences on their interdisciplinary problem-solving. These influences were embodied in their conceptualization of the interdisciplinary problems, the strategies they used to integrate different disciplinary knowledge, and the attitudes they had toward interdisciplinary approach in general and specific interdisciplinary problems. This study sheds light on interdisciplinary science education by revealing the complex relationship between disciplinary learning and interdisciplinary problem-solving.

AB  - To understand how Geography and Geographical Information Science (GIS) can contribute to Interdisciplinary Research (IDR), it is relevant to articulate the differences between the different types of such research. "Multidisciplinary" researchers work in a "parallel play" mode, completing work in their disciplinary work streams and exchanging outputs as and when needed. This will ultimately result in separate publications by participants from each discipline and fosters a loose continued connection between researchers (Aboelela et al., 2007). "Interdisciplinary" research is described in language from all disciplines involved. Data and analytical methods are also more mixed, requiring researchers from one discipline to learn, at least in part, about methodologies from the others in order to complete their work. Publications are shared and language will be established that is intelligible to all involved fields (Aboelela et al., 2007). Examining the above, Geography and GIS fit very well into the multidisciplinary context. They can contribute tools, methods and techniques to problems, while permitting researchers to work within their own discipline. The potential of Geography and GIS for interdisciplinary research can also offer a useful approach to address the interdisciplinary challenge of finding a common language between two or more other disciplines, permitting integration of data and analytical methods. This article briefly introduces the papers presented at a symposium session held at the Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute for British Geographers) 2012 Annual Conference in Edinburgh, entitled "Geography in Interdisciplinary Research: Threat or Opportunity?" Submissions were invited that focused on the importance of Geography and GIS in interdisciplinary research, both as a separate discipline contributing methods, tools and techniques and also as an integrator and unifying factor, with the potential of providing a common starting point to overcome the challenges of bringing interdisciplinary teams together. The article concludes that the papers in this symposium highlight a number of factors that cause difficulties with interdisciplinary research, requiring effort from all parties to overcome. The ability of a team to move beyond the multi-disciplinary and into the interdisciplinary context depends to a great extent on the interest of team members in research, methods and data from other disciplines.

AB  - Disciplines play a major role in agricultural education and extension. Biology, chemistry and physics are all essential to understand nature and to improve the quality of agricultural production. During the past centuries, disciplines have evolved, and a multitude of specialisations emerged, like cell biology, colloid chemistry and geophysics. The development of specialisations went so far that one can speak of overspecialisation in areas, the problem of which is that there is too little communication and cooperation between subspecialisations. It is surprising that the pedagogy of interdisciplinary education is underdeveloped. Given the importance of interdisciplinary education, it is absolutely necessary to develop an interdisciplinary field of Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK). This can best be taught to future teachers by introducing them to different fields that are included in solving practical problems, or trying to attain certain goals. In a situation in which there are no, or hardly any, guidelines for implementing interdisciplinary education beyond the generic recommendations of educational research, how can educators make progress with the creation of a PCK for interdisciplinary education? To answer this question, this article describes six characteristics of interdisciplinary thinking that can serve as a foundation of a taxonomy of educational objects in the field of interdisciplinary education. It also presents principles that can be used in the implementation of interdisciplinary education.

AB  - Engineering students often conduct information searches without sufficient consideration of the context of their research topic. This article discusses how development of a new information literacy (IL) mindset through instruction in integrated IL education affects students' understanding of research problems and formulation of information search questions. The course observed is a mechanical engineering seminar for undergraduate engineering students with integrated IL education. A survey-based research method is utilized with surveys carried out at three stages of the course. The results show that as the course progressed, students' interdisciplinary research problem descriptions became more profound and their formulations of information search questions developed more advanced understanding of the principles of information use. Preliminary parallel results have been analyzed from 2013 to 2016 at a university of technology in Finland.

AB  - This article explores a doctoral sustainability leadership course in an interdisciplinary leadership program. Learners in the course study sustainability and sustainability leadership from a systemic design perspective. They are invited to become visionaries who work across boundaries and disciplines with cooperative and reflective spirits to find integrated solutions for complex organizational problems. The first section provides course background information on the interdisciplinary, interdependent, and integrated complexity of the sustainability movement. It also examines the different and often ambiguous understandings of sustainability and why a systemic design platform might provide a more expansive vessel for sustainability leadership and projects. The second section investigates systems thinking, design action, the nature of change, and dialogue--the core of good design. The third section uses a learner's case study "Air Combat Command Sustainability Design Project" to illustrate how an organizational leader built a sustainability plan unique to his organization. Five domains (BenEli, 2012) provided the overarching infrastructure. Although each domain embodies a separate area, together they make up a unified organizing principle that works toward integrating essential elements into a strong infrastructure. The article concludes with reflections from both the course facilitator and the course learner.

AB  - Interdisciplinary undergraduate programs have grown dramatically in recent decades, but they are vulnerable to cuts given various stakeholders' calls for greater accountability in higher education. Assessing the outcomes of interdisciplinary majors presents an array of challenges, including how to describe and categorize patterned variation in the place and purpose of disciplines in interdisciplinary programs. Knight, Lattuca, Kimball, and Reason's (2013) typology conceptualizes this variation in terms of curricular features and staffing of interdisciplinary programs, and asserts that stronger programs are marked by less reliance on disciplinary courses and faculty whose lines are in disciplinary departments. We argue that another important source of variation is the approach taken to interdisciplinary education: how the program connects disciplines (e.g., via integration or juxtaposition) and what the program aims to foster (depth, breadth, or specific skills). Attending to these aspects of variation in interdisciplinary programs improves the Knight et al. framework insofar as it permits investigation of which combinations of interdisciplinary approaches, curricular design, and staffing might best foster particular educational aims. We demonstrate the utility of this improved framework by applying it to a recently completed external review of an interdisciplinary program at a liberal arts college (ours). We offer some suggestions for how to align different approaches to interdisciplinary education with an institution's general curriculum, the major's curriculum, and program staffing.

AB  - This article will describe how I have integrated my work as a psychotherapist specializing in trauma and as a literature professor in an interdisciplinary course on Trauma Narrative in which I explore with my students how literary texts (novels, poetry, and plays) and clinical discourses (e.g. the "Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders," psychological theories, and research studies) can inform and challenge each other as we seek to understand the lived experience and meaning of trauma. Current interdisciplinary theories of trauma that revise the doctor/patient relationship into witness/testifier implicate us in this class as witnesses of trauma testimony. Indeed, these literary, clinical, and theoretical works force us to ask the very fundamental questions: What assumptions do I bring to a literary text/individual that mediate my response to either? How does this text/individual interrupt these assumptions and challenge me to new ways of listening? How does this text/individual change me? Following a description of the course, I will discuss how we can foster meaningful integrative research projects with our students as we ask them to encounter the limits of their own understanding of the suffering of others, or, at times, their own jarring identification with this suffering. How can teaching toward interdisciplinary integration call us to witness our students as they discover the ways in which their reading, writing, and research call them to witness "themselves" anew? And what are the unique challenges of engaging in this work when the focus is trauma?

AB  - This study aims to compare and contrast the connotations of the concepts of "science" and "history" that were formed in the minds of students attending both Faculty of Science and Letters, History Department and Faculty of Education, Science Education Department at Agri Ibrahim Çeçen University. The participants of the study are 173 students from the History Department, including the whole education level of the department and 71 students from Science Education Department including all classes. The participants were asked what they mean by the concepts of "science" and "history" and what connotations they made. Survey method is used in a descriptive research model. The Word Association Test (WAT) related to history and science has been utilized as a data collection tool. According to findings received after the analysis, it is found that there was no significant difference between cognitive sentence structures of the students, who are attending different disciplines, towards both the concept of history and science. As a result of the Word Association Test, although there are some differences according to the departments of education, many concepts in general are similar. When examining the cognitive sentence structures for the concepts, there is a need for research on the interrelationship of basic concepts with special areas. Thus, this research gains more importance.

AB  - Providing interdisciplinary learning opportunities in agriculture, food, natural resources (AFNR), and science is critically important. School-based agricultural education offers a valuable platform to connect AFNR and science; however, interdisciplinary teaching requires willing and able teachers. The current study considered the intentions of school-based agriculture teachers to teach science within AFNR curriculum. Using the theory of planned behavior, attitude toward teaching science, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and perceived science knowledge were considered as independent variables to teaching science within AFNR curriculum. The explanatory model was analyzed using structural equation modeling. In total, school-based agriculture teachers intended to teach science in 39.91% of AFNR curriculum. Only perceived science knowledge was a statistically significant, negative predictor of intended science teaching. Findings pinpoint the need for additional research into the unexpected relationship between perceived science knowledge and science teaching intentions. The need and nature of potential explorations, along with specific recommendations for practice, are discussed.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the effect of the interdisciplinary (the disciplines of Turkish, Social Science, Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Public Administration) activities performed in the scope of the Community Service Practices Course on the air pollution awareness (APW). This study has been performed as a multiple case study. Participants consisted of 32 pre-service elementary school teachers and 122 elementary school students enrolled in a 4th grade. Data were collected using the Air Pollution Awareness Questionnaire, Know-Want-Learn forms and interviews. Content analysis was used for analysis of data. The APW of participants have increased. It has been determined that the pre-service elementary school teachers have evaluated the implementation as being generally successful. Also it has been seen that the implementation has served different purposes out of the study aim for the pre-service elementary school teachers like providing teaching experience and how to teach the interdisciplinary subjects.

AB  - This two-year qualitative study explored the learning process alongside students' perceived outcomes within an interdisciplinary project-based learning (PjBL) task. Students from three different undergraduate courses were assigned a project that spanned across all three classes and placed student teams in the roles of client and contractor. Content analysis of reflective journals and focus groups provided a rich view of the learning experience from the student perspective. Findings from Year 1 demonstrated ways in which students had employed soft skills (e.g., communication, collaboration), but also revealed the need for changes to the course design to fully realize the interdisciplinary vision of the project. Findings from Year 2 showed how students negotiated the realistic tensions of the client-contractor relationship while working to develop both soft skills and hard skills (e.g., programming, design, market research). Overall, this study reveals how the interdisciplinary nature of this project supported important aspects of student learning that might not have occurred through a more traditional class project. In addition, it sheds light on the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration among instructors when designing a PjBL experience that pushes students to crosses disciplinary boundaries.

AB  - While interdisciplinary courses are regarded as a promising method for students to learn and apply knowledge from other disciplines, there is limited empirical evidence available whether interdisciplinary courses can effectively "create" interdisciplinary students. In this innovative quasi-experimental study amongst 377 Master's students, in the control condition students were randomised by the teacher into groups, while in the experimental condition students were "balanced" by the teacher into groups based upon their initial social network. Using social network analysis, learning ties after 11 weeks were significantly predicted by the friendship and learning ties established at the beginning of the course, as well as (same) discipline and group allocation. The effects were generally greater than group divisions, irrespective of the two conditions, but substantially smaller than initial social networks. These results indicate that interdisciplinary learning does not occur "automatically" in an interdisciplinary module. This study contributes to effective learning in interdisciplinary learning environments.

AB  - The first year university experience is inherently linked to student retention and success. First year students are often unprepared for the academic requirements of university, which can result in stress, poor student outcomes and low student retention rates. Although there is considerable literature on the challenges students face when transitioning to university, there is limited research on successful interdisciplinary for-credit transition subjects that support students, particularly in Australia. An interdisciplinary for-credit transition subject for first year university students was designed, implemented and evaluated to determine students' perceptions of its effectiveness in preparing them for the academic demands of university. Thematic analysis of 36 qualitative interviews with students was conducted. Students reported having gained knowledge and confidence in the essential academic skills required for university and therefore felt more prepared. Implementing similar subjects in other settings may provide a strategy to support students' transition to university.

AB  - There has been a national call to transition away from the traditional, passive, lecture-based model of STEM education towards one that facilitates learning through active engagement and problem solving. This mixed-methods research study examines the impact of a supplemental Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) program on knowledge and skill acquisition for students in introductory biology, chemistry, calculus and applied statistics courses. Results indicate program participants reliably outperform their matched pairs in courses that emphasize quantitative reasoning. Moreover, program participants report acquiring important insights about learning, collaboration, and engagement in undergraduate STEM education. These results are consistent with previous findings on PLTL and also provide insight into the roles of course context and student population on program outcomes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of an interdisciplinary and intergenerational educational experience in the elderly, in teachers, students and their parents or guardians. Creative Dance and Drama Workshops were articulated with Portuguese, PE, Arts and IT subjects. A total of 20 6th graders, their parents or guardians, five teachers and 15 elders participated in the study. An analysis of 194 free evocations based in the free word association technique was performed, along with 17 semi-structured interviews. From the literary texts "Os Piratas" and "Ulisses", an expressions-based work was proposed, where drama and movement games were explored. Evocations of the central core were of Friendship, Learning, Affection, Solidarity and Interaction. Of the 264 text units analysed, interaction with the elders was highlighted. In the teachers' perception about the subjects and workshops involved in the project, a valorisation of IT and of Portuguese was registered. It is also relevant the amount of references to values and to the Interaction with the elders. This interdisciplinary and intergenerational project has revealed itself valuable for the integral and humanistic training of the students, having also given rise to corporeal artistic and emotional experiences relevant to their well-being.

The mechanisms used for facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration around the development of a collective conceptual framework and associated methodologies for investigating aspects of rural community inclusion in later life are outlined. Lessons relevant to geography education learned about the benefits and "messy reality" of interdisciplinary working are highlighted.

AB  - This paper documents the experience and lessons from implementing an e-learning program aimed at creating multidisciplinary research capacity. It presents a case study of bringing together a multidisciplinary group of professionals on-line to learn the skills needed to be a successful researcher in the context of HIV/AIDS and food security problems in Eastern and Southern Africa. Lessons from the experience for future development of similar courses indicate that some of the factors that can enhance the success of e-learning programs in developing countries are: assessing the needs of the participants, easy access to educational technology, addressing the differing learning styles of the participants, continuous interaction and commitment of course moderators, enabling access to open access learning materials and combining various pedagogical approaches. The paper concludes that enhancing the skills of professionals in developing countries through e-learning programs is imperative to meet the human capacity needs for greater economic development and service delivery.

AB  - Background: Health care professionals can have a dramatic impact by assisting patients with tobacco cessation but most have limited training. Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of a 4-hour tobacco cessation training program. Methods: A team of multidisciplinary health care professionals created a veteran-specific tailored version of the Rx for Change program. The curriculum was administered through local trainings at 5 Veterans Affairs facilities. Participants completed pre- and posttraining surveys to assess key knowledge-based competency components, perceived ability to implement the 5 A's of treatment (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange), and self-efficacy for overall ability to assist patients with quitting. Results: A total of 205 out of 291 health care professionals completed pre- and posttraining surveys. Participants reported significant improvement in their overall ability and ability to implement the 5 A's of tobacco treatment (P < 0.0001). No significant differences were found between health care disciplines on overall ability posttraining. Conclusion: The training increased clinicians' knowledge and perceived self-efficacy. The analysis is the first evaluation that supports a face-to-face, multidisciplinary training model across a large health care system. Translation to Health Education Practice: With increased evaluation of this training model, Health Educators of large health care systems should provide multidisciplinary, tobacco cessation trainings to health care professionals.

AB  - We have witnessed, over the past century, an evolution in the manner in which students with disabilities are educated. Indeed, the quality of education students with special needs receive, in many ways, may be more aptly termed a revolution -- from a legal and pedagogical perspective. The tremendous strides special education has made during this period of time has resulted in the current situation in which students with special needs are placed in the least restrictive environment, which often is an inclusive classroom in which general education and special education teachers work together in a collaborative, co-teaching environment. This chapter traces the events, legislation, and court cases that provide the historical context for this situation. In addition, models and essential components of co-teaching are examined, as well as the roles and requisite skills of general education and special education co-teachers. Of critical importance, in the success of co-teaching, is the need for special education and general education teachers to approach the curriculum planning and instructional processes in a collaborative and cooperative manner in order to achieve optimum results from the resulting co-teaching partnership. Finally, the assessment of special education and general education co-teaching efficacy is discussed, specifically through the use of three assessment rubrics used to evaluate co-teaching, co-planning, and co-assessment.

AB  - Background: The use of psychotropic medication to manage challenging behaviours of people with intellectual disabilities is a contentious issue which NHS England has now focused on. This paper looks to evaluate this within the multidisciplinary context. Method: Records of clients (n = 106) open to a Community Intellectual Disabilities team for care relating to challenging behaviours were examined. Those recommended psychotropic medications in the absence of a mental health diagnosis were scrutinised for supporting MDT assessments. Results: Over half the clients with challenging behaviours were being prescribed psychotropic medications and many of those had very few MDT assessments to inform care. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the extent psychotropics are used in the absence of MDT informed support for people with intellectual disabilities and behaviours that challenge. A vision to simply withdraw such medication might be simplistic. Local MDT plans are in development to systematically reduce reliance on this type of restrictive practice.

AB  - This study makes use of a pre-test/post-test design (with a control group) to test the effect of an interdisciplinary energy course on student attitudes and values related to energy issues. The interdisciplinary energy course was co-taught by engineering, political science, economics, and oceanography professors at the United States Naval Academy during the fall of 2015. The study finds that students in the interdisciplinary energy course experienced significant changes in their energy attitudes on half the categories tested, while students in the control group did not experience similar changes. The changes were greatest among female students, politically moderate students, and engineering students. The findings suggest that interdisciplinary instruction can have a powerful impact on student values, but that the impact works through existing demographic and ideological factors.

AB  - The multidisciplinary nature of kinesiology seems to be an ideal configuration for conducting interdisciplinary research. Proposed as a potential solution to overcome fragmentation, interdisciplinary research has a role within kinesiology that remains unknown. In this study, we explored kinesiologists' perceptions of interdisciplinary research, including perceived benefits and limitations. Kinesiologists (n = 45) from academia, the majority from Europe and North America (76.2%), answered a primarily open-ended, seven-question Internet survey. The overarching themes determined via open coding were Benefits (i.e., the positive aspects to conducting interdisciplinary research) and Limitations (i.e., the challenges to conducting interdisciplinary research), each with eight subthemes. Overall, the participants felt interdisciplinary research was valuable, but each had legitimate reservations, creating a contradictory environment that causes tension between the perceived benefits and limitations. Until the tension can be resolved, interdisciplinary research will continue to remain on the fringes of kinesiology research.

AB  - To recruit underrepresented students with demonstrated financial need into STEM disciplines, Lock Haven University established the interdisciplinary Nano Scholars Program, offering National Science Foundation-funded scholarships, academic support, and social support. Small cohort sizes, a student-led science learning community (the Nano Club), and mentored undergraduate research fostered academic and cocurricular student engagement. Nano Scholars outperformed matched control peers on overall GPA, average number of credits per semester, graduation in 4 years, and graduate school placement rates. A comprehensive program fostering engagement through individualized attention, a robust learning community, meaningful research opportunities, and peer and alumni support is essential.

AB  - Interdisciplinary curriculum supports cognitive development through well planned lessons at early age. This article focuses on a specific experimental study done in 2010 on Grade 7 learners in a Lebanese private school to aid them in empowering their skills and competencies to solve a real life problem. The objective of this experimental study is to prepare students for Grade 10 to create the necessary chemistry between learners and Physics as a discipline. The problematic can be stated as: The synergy of teachers' team work to design an interdisciplinary curriculum implementing ICT in classrooms facilitates the transfer and construction of knowledge and scaffolds learners with necessary skills and competencies from an early age to solve physics problems. The results were very optimistic showing 57% development of the study group members in comparison with only 10% for the control group members. Further studies are necessary on larger samples and for longer duration to expose learners to different topics and trace the effect of interdisciplinary curriculum after 4 years.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research can be defined as the practice of discovering new objects of knowledge beyond disciplinary borders. It often operates through the cross-fertilization and hybridization of concepts, theoretical frameworks, and methodological tools to enable the description, analysis, and understanding of the complexity of objects of study that cannot be reduced to the strict limits imposed by any one discipline. The aim of this article is to take stock of the theoretical and methodological issues involved in the interdisciplinary research process from the perspective of serendipity, which is a creative process of considerable value to science. The intent is to show that the decompartmentalization of disciplines, the ability to decenter and open one's mind to the unexpected are intrinsic to the work of researchers who position themselves between and beyond disciplines. Our contention is that, as a process of discovering with a completely open mind ("sine anticipatio mentis") things that are not being searched for, serendipity is thus capable of playing a central role in interdisciplinarity, boosting the exchange of ideas and speeding up their circulation among researchers committed to exploiting the heuristic dimension of the unexpected.

AB  - With the growing recognition of the importance of interdisciplinary research, many faculty have increased their efforts to form interdisciplinary research teams. Oftentimes, attempts to put together such teams are hampered because faculty have a limited picture of the research interests and expertise of their colleagues. This paper reports on three major initiatives supported by the Office of Research in the College of Education at Florida State University aiming at increasing interdisciplinary research among faculty members, namely the design and implementation of (1) a college-wide faculty research interests/expertise database, (2) a college-level research grant program, and (3) a multi-college research conference.

AB  - Drawing on the experience of training graduate students and researchers in qualitative and mixed-methods analysis since the mid-1990s, the authors reflect on the evolution of a multidisciplinary graduate course developed in a Canadian university since 2007. The hands-on/hands-off course design based on the use of NVivo was developed in parallel with a conceptual and reflexive position on methodology and multidisciplinarity in the context of an action research supported by their institution. This article exposes the four basic components of the course and the constructivist assessment model based on a term-long team analysis of original data created specifically for this purpose. The balance between collective and individual work, in-class and online exchanges, hands-on experience with the software and hands-off reflection is described and compared to recent pedagogical literature on the subject. The interest of this blended approach in fostering the development of the methodological expertise expected from researchers and graduate students, as well as the main issues and challenges facing this type of training in a research environment characterised by new approaches and tools, are discussed.

AB  - The High School Summer Research Program (HSSRP) is a rigorous eight-week research experience that challenges high school students to a novel scientific question in an engineering laboratory at the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science (HSSEAS) at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The program collates highly motivated students from all socioeconomic statuses, ethnicities, and genders to increase the diversity of applicants for STEM majors at four-year universities, and thereby potentially promotes a more diverse and innovative STEM workforce. To supplement students' unique research projects, HSSRP comprises several professional development opportunities, such as faculty presentations, lab tours, and industry tech talks. Students are trained to communicate their research through scientific posters and oral presentations in a ''learn-by-teaching'' system that further exposes all students to the multitude of creative strategies that are currently employed across the engineering disciplines to tackle world issues. This integrates with HSSRP's strong social element, which encourages students to act as a support system for each other in the midst of the challenging eight weeks, and serves as a network for students after the program. A survey of the 2014-2016 HSSRP classes indicates high satisfaction with the program, and a high likelihood of pursuing a STEM degree and advanced STEM degrees. Surveys of HSSRP alumni shows that a vast percentage of students are pursuing STEM degrees or are currently working in the STEM field.

AB  - Primary school teachers need adequate professional knowledge and motivational orientations to qualify scientifically and technologically literate students. Previous studies have focused on the impact of coursework on (pre-service) primary teachers' content knowledge, rather than on the development of academic self-concepts. In addition, the influence of the course format and the major field of study has not been investigated much to this date. Thus, this study examines the effects of an interdisciplinary course on pre-service primary teachers' content knowledge and academic self-concepts in science and technology using a quasi-experimental, quantitative, pre-post-follow-up design (n = 202). Whilst no significant changes in knowledge were revealed for the baseline group not participating in the course, significant short-term and long-term cognitive gains were found for the experimental group. Biology-, chemistry-, physics- and technology-related self-concepts increased significantly when participating in the course. The results also indicate that the course format and major field of study can have an impact on the development of pre-service teachers' professional knowledge. Regarding the development of academic self-concepts in the experimental group, it can be assumed that both the weekly and block course format are beneficial for heterogeneous learner groups consisting of pre-service teachers with different major fields of study.

AB  - Discovering the cultural dimensions of high ability is analogous to a large-scale creative problem-solving initiative. Just as the early phases of the creative-problem-solving process require broad-scope searches through diverse data sources, understanding the culture-giftedness nexus requires broad-scope excursions through interdisciplinary scholarly sources that can enable deeper understanding of culture. Here, we engage in such an excursion and borrow insights from leading thinkers in cultural anthropology, English studies, political science, ethical philosophy, and history, and use these insights to generate new ways of thinking about the cultural aspects of giftedness. The foreign concepts analyzed include anti-anti-relativism, mythological archetypes, the artificial reification of culture, distant proximities that influence personal identity, ethnocentrism and particularist morality, differing views of nature, and the influence of critical communities and motley coalitions in a globalized world.

AB  - Numerous national initiatives call for interdisciplinary mathematics and science education, but few empirical studies have examined practical considerations for integrated instruction in high school settings. The purpose of this qualitative study was twofold. First, the study sought to describe how and to what extent teachers integrate mathematics and science curricula in their classrooms after having participated in an intervention to promote and support mathematics and science integration. Second, the study was intended to expand our understanding of the barriers to and factors that enable integrated approaches in high school classrooms. The theoretical component of this study builds on and adapts previous models of science and mathematics integration to introduce the Intradisciplinary, Cross-disciplinary, Multidisciplinary, Interdisciplinary (ICMI) framework for identifying and defining classroom integration strategies. Findings include a description of several distinct practices high school teachers related to integrated instruction as well as the trade-offs teachers considered when making decisions related to integrated curricula. The implications of the findings for researchers and practitioners are discussed. Finally, we propose the conceptualization of "interdisciplinary pedagogical content knowledge" in mathematics and science as an area of focus that will enable teachers to successfully move toward interdisciplinary instruction.

AB  - Game jams, hackathons and similar group game creation events have become increasingly popular over the past decade (Fowler et al., 2015). They provide new and exciting opportunities for education and research. They foster creative thinking and innovation (Preston et al., 2012), and strengthen project management and communication skills (Smith & Bowers, 2016); all of which are essential skills for working in industry (Pirker et al., 2016).

AB  - This paper argues in favour of the beneficial currency of Thomas Carlyle's "On Heroes, Hero-worship and the Heroic in History" in three ways, each of which finds the basis of its critique in aspects of Foucault's theories of discursive practice, as explored in Foucault's theories of historical discourse; 1) that Carlyle's terminology connects with his discursive practice in an ambiguous manner, as his concept of worship is more akin to study than devotion, if we take the text of his lectures as evidence of his perception; 2) the sources of enlightenment Carlyle offers us, based on these studies of heroic individuals, may provide an exemplar for interdisciplinary scholarship centred around biographies of notable individuals, and finally; 3) we challenge the notion that heroes such as those Carlyle offers us can be manifest in the present and argue that the depth of insight Carlyle demonstrates into his subjects is only possible by means of a lengthy temporal transition: the historicity of these narratives, and the narratives of social codification, cultural development and long-term impact witnessed and described over generations, is what makes them feasible at all.

AB  - This article describes three interdisciplinary events held outside of the classroom to examine social psychological concepts in the criminal justice system, with undergraduate students enrolled in criminal justice and psychology courses. These events can most accurately be described as using a synthetic interdisciplinary approach, in which the disciplines of psychology and criminal justice remain clearly identifiable in looking at phenomena like occurrences of bystander apathy, while enabling a holistic view of these phenomena. First, 75 students celebrated the life of Kitty Genovese, a famous victim of bystander apathy. Later in the semester, the same students competed in a game-show-like review session. Finally, 45 students explored the intersection of the mental health and criminal justice systems with professionals from various fields. Overall, students enjoyed the social interaction with their peers across the majors, as well as with their professors and professionals in the field. Students also indicated that the interactive learning techniques enhanced their new understanding of the intersection of the disciplines. Future research should investigate the offering of interdisciplinary events to students within and across academic divisions to build community and enhance students' understanding of their educational and career opportunities.

AB  - This paper builds upon Perna's college choice model by integrating Anzaldúa's theory of "conocimiento" to propose an interdisciplinary college choice framework for Latinx students. Using previous literature, this paper proposes college-"conocimiento" as a framework that contextualizes Latinx student college choices within the inequitable distribution of institutional resources in the K-12 system. In particular, the framework centers on the notion that a lack of adequate college guidance can influence a cyclical Latinx college choice process. College-"conocimiento" is defined as a serpentine process where Latinx students reflect on the college information that they receive, in relation to their intersectional identities when preparing for college. The pathway of "college-conocimiento" entails seven cyclical spaces and aims for students to develop a reflective college consciousness, exemplified through self-advocacy and supporting peers with the college choice process. This paper challenges college choice as a sequential process by noting that students can repeat stages as needed.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research is frequently viewed as an important component of the research landscape through its innovative ability to integrate knowledge from different areas. However, support for interdisciplinary research is often strategic rhetoric, with policy-makers and universities frequently adopting practices that favour disciplinary performance. We argue that disciplinary and interdisciplinary research are complementary, and we develop a simple framework that demonstrates this for a semi-permanent interdisciplinary research field. We argue that the presence of communicating infrastructures fosters communication and integration between disciplines and the interdisciplinary research field to generate innovative knowledge. We apply this to the experience of economic history in Australia in the second half of the twentieth century to demonstrate the life cycle of a semi-permanent field.

AB  - In 2013, the Center for Digital Scholarship at Miami University was established and coincided with the redesign of the Children's Picture Book Database, which had a successful web presence for nearly 20 years. We developed the Digital Literacy Partnership (DLP) website project in order to upgrade the project to Omeka as a new digital management tool and to establish a second resource called the Health Literacy Database. Over time, the project grew to include three databases with the mission to promote the contributions of literacy, health, and technology on learning. In this case study, we describe the role of academic libraries in supporting faculty and student design projects; share the history and mission of the DLP project; and explain the digital team of faculty, librarians, and undergraduate students. We also outline the production of public health eBooks targeted to children and adults with low literacy skills; the social marketing decisions we made from web usage statistics; and the technical lessons learned throughout this collaborative digital project.

AB  - Curricular demands and best practices for middle school require interdisciplinary units. Arts integration can provide motivation and a new pathway to learning. This unit focused on inquiry into the natural history of artifacts and rocks recovered from the exposed subsoil of an area near Cedar Falls, Iowa that had been bulldozed as part of subdivision development. The described unit involved preservice teachers in exploration of all subject areas (language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies) with arts-integrated projects (agate watercolor painting, stone tool graphing, acrylic polymer clay agate keyring making, and stone tool drawings). The content area activities for social studies included identification and lifestyle interpretation of stone tools found intermixed with rocks and sand in the subsoil of the site. Science content activities included identification of rocks (igneous and metamorphic rocks; quartz nodules, geodes, and agates; and iron ore specimens) from the site along with interpretation of basalt cobbles that had been ground flat as glacially transported, and interpretation of maps and diagrams of glaciation, iron ore deposits, and agate deposits. Language arts activities involved word study through morpheme analysis of words such as "anthropology" and "artifact" along with matching a set of descriptive adjectives to objects related to agates. Mathematics content activities focused on graphing. Preservice teachers were highly engaged in the activities, remarking that they learned new content and pedagogy. Some expressed lack of confidence regarding artistic ability because of little experience and the desire to complete everything in the correct manner. At the end of the lessons, preservice teachers expressed that teaching the content through themes allowed for a great number of connections between subject areas, increased real-life connections, and deeper understandings of the topics.

AB  - University programs are currently faced with a number of challenges: how to engage students as active learners, how to ensure graduates are "work ready" with broad and relevant professional skills, and how to support students to see their potential as agents of social change and contributors to social good. This paper presents the findings from a study that explored the impact of an authentic, interdisciplinary project with health, architecture and landscape students. This project facilitated students' entrée into the lived experience of women and children requiring refuge services as a result of homelessness and/or domestic violence. Students collaborated with stakeholders from the refuge sector, visiting sites, undertaking individual research, exchanging ideas and problem-solving, to develop a design guide for a women's refuge. Focus groups were conducted at the conclusion of the activity to gauge students' perceptions of the value of the activity. Results indicated that the "hands-on" and collaborative nature of the learning experience in a real-world context was valued, primarily due to its direct relevance to professional practice. Architecture and landscape participants reported an increase in their understanding and knowledge of refuge clients, and many expressed a commitment to further learning and contribution to the sector. Nursing students felt that the authentic learning experience helped prepare them for the "real world" of practice and that it aided development of their professional identities and capacity to effect real-world change. The learning activity had a positive impact on knowledge acquisition and students' confidence to act as agents of social change.

AB  - This study investigated the use of interdisciplinary learning activity task to construct students' knowledge in Mathematics, specifically on the topic of scale drawing application. The learning activity task involved more than one academic discipline, which is Mathematics, English Language, Art, Geography and integrating the Brunei Darussalam national philosophy of the Malay Islamic Monarchy. A quantitative method using a pre-experimental design focusing on one-group pre- and post-test design was used for this study. The participants were selected from a convenient sample of 43 Year 9 students in one of the secondary schools in Brunei. The findings were also triangulated with the students' collected reflective journal artifact documents. Each student journal was analyzed using the identified learning activity stages within the RBC-model, where the R denotes "Recognizing," B is "Building with" and C means "Constructing." The results showed an improvement in the students' achievement, and they were able to construct the mathematics knowledge by means of collaboration among group members. Based on the findings, it is recommended that Mathematics teachers be encouraged and supported to design authentic and interdisciplinary learning activity that are learner centered catering to the different needs of our students and also to meet the 21st century skills demand.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of science instruction given through the game and physical activities course in accordance with interdisciplinary teaching approaches on students' science achievement and retention. The participants were 82 third grade students from a public elementary school. Three classes were chosen as experimental groups and one class was chosen as a control group in the school. The instruction period lasted for five weeks in all groups. The data were collected by an achievement test and an education portal achievement (EPA) test. The pretest-posttest control group design was used in the study. Data obtained from the tests were analyzed through one-way analysis of variance and post-hoc analyses. The findings indicated that some of the experimental groups were more successful than the control group with large effect sizes. The results suggested that the game and physical activities course incorporating interdisciplinary teaching approaches could be used in increasing students' science achievement and retention of science knowledge.

AB  - Interdisciplinary, collaborative teaching and learning is recognised as important for twenty-first century tertiary education that seeks to build students' critical thinking, cultural competence and global understanding. The core elements needed for truly successful collaboration are, however, little understood. This article presents a critical case study of a teaching team's reflections on experiences in collaborating over two years to deliver a new interdisciplinary undergraduate course focused on culture and society. The findings highlight the importance of building a robust team culture built upon shared leadership, mutual trust and commitment, grounded by strong institutional support, to give any collaboration integrity and sustainability.

AB  - "This We Believe" advocates the use of a curriculum that maximizes early adolescent learning by integrating multiple disciplines rather than teaching them in isolation. The development of an interdisciplinary curricular unit is a common assignment in middle grades teacher education programs that seek to prepare teacher candidates to undertake this curricular approach in their future careers. However, this common assignment presents challenges to both the instructors who design the project and the candidates who undertake it. This article offers middle-level teacher educators a structured process that guides candidates' development of a high-quality interdisciplinary unit through clear and intentionally sequenced steps that are rigorous but approachable.

AB  - Background: A faculty development program was implemented over four years at a 4-year regional comprehensive university and two partnering community colleges. This project was focused on improving student learning in introductory Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) courses at each institution, by helping faculty adopt inclusive, student-centered pedagogies. Survey data were combined with data from classroom videos, faculty interviews, and student questionnaires collected during the first two years of the project to give insight into how faculty initially implemented the theory and strategies they learned and how the students perceived instruction from participating faculty. Results: These data sources were combined to generate four overall themes to characterize our project and guide future projects. These are: (1) implementation of student-centered learning took a variety of forms; (2) quality implementation of student-centered teaching practices lagged behind understanding of the theory behind those practices; (3) the most robust perceived barriers to implementation of student-centered teaching stayed constant, while more moderate barriers were ranked differently from year 1 to year 2; and (4) faculty perceptions of student-centered learning practices were not always the same as students' perceptions. These themes build from the extant faculty development literature in that they are drawn from the unique context of a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional project, and that they represent an "on the ground" perspective from case studies combined with "big picture" findings from surveys. Conclusions: This paper describes the faculty development project, as well as our collection and interpretation of data from surveys and case studies, to ultimately develop the four themes. Recommendations deriving from these themes are also described. These include modeling a variety of pedagogies; adopting realistic expectations for faculty change; institutionalizing faculty development so it can take place over multiple years; being transparent with faculty about known barriers and aligning supports with those barriers; and helping faculty develop strategies for transparency with students about student-centered pedagogies.

AB  - This article presents elements from the research journey pursued by the author in the area of interdisciplinarity in education, and more specifically in elementary education, which he has been studying for 30 years. The text begins by presenting the reasons that led to undertaking doctoral studies on this issue. It then addresses the foundations of the conceptual frame of reference used by the author in performing research studies. The article then examines three results that emerge from this research: a conceptual clarification of the notion of interdisciplinarity with respect to curricula and professional training; certain empirical findings on the conception and practice of interdisciplinarity among elementary school teachers; and the existence of three interpretive logics of interdisciplinarity associated with three distinct cultures--English-speaking American, French-speaking European, and Portuguese-speaking Latin American. To conclude, the article proposes a definition of interdisciplinarity in schools based on the Francophone reality, along with three principles for promoting an integrative approach in teaching-learning relationships.

AB  - The aim of this study was to implement and evaluate the instructional design prepared as consumer-oriented and based upon interdisciplinary curriculum. In this study, case study approach, which is one of the qualitative research patterns, was employed. Observations, interviews and document analysis were used to collect data. For analyzing the data, inductive and deductive content analysis methods in the scope of the content analysis were used in combination. Consequently, it was indicated that instructional design which was developed with an interdisciplinary approach contributed to gain interdisciplinary knowledge and skills and develop consumer consciousness. In the light of these results we may conclude that this design is implementable. However, it was clear that the students had difficulties in points such as performing mathematical operations and expressing warrants. These situations made the implementation process more difficult. These results will contribute to the development of various approaches in mathematics instruction and the diversification of the implementations regarding mathematics use in real life.

AB  - While the use of electronic portfolios has been thoroughly explored in undergraduate and discipline-specific graduate programs, less research has been conducted among interdisciplinary adult learners. This case study explores the feasibility and acceptability of ePortfolios across two years of implementation in an inclusive, graduate-level interdisciplinary training program. After initial implementation with cohort one, focus groups revealed the need for ongoing accountability and support, the importance of transparency and clarity, challenges related to buy-in, and unanticipated tensions between the personal and professional role of the ePortfolio. Between implementation years one and two, improvements were made to the ePortfolio process based on trainee feedback. Following implementation with cohort two, these changes and trainee perceptions of the ePortfolio process were assessed with open-ended surveys. Cohort two also identified personal challenges related to technology and endorsed the importance of accountability and support; however, they also identified a much greater appreciation for the ePortfolio as a new technology and the ways it helped them document, reflect on, and integrate their training experiences into their identity. These results indicate that the ePortfolio is a promising technology in interdisciplinary settings for integrative learning and holds potential for program assessment; however, accountability, support, and transparent communication are needed to realize its full potential.

It also examines the development of the interdisciplinary research process presented in the article. The controversies surrounding these ideas are explored in depth, along with the overall impact of the article on the field of interdisciplinary studies.

AB  - Accepting Newell's invitation to develop his interdisciplinary theory to address new developments, I first consider Newell's complex systems theory of interdisciplinarity. I then review developments of his theory before critiquing its merits and deficiencies. This critique is informed by recent critical realists' works that point to deficiencies rooted in interdisciplinary theory's holistic realist ontology, which they argue is incomplete. I then review critical realists' ontology and their case for interdisciplinary epistemology, which I argue marginalizes constructivism. Finally, I outline a constructivist-realist ontology. This approach incorporates an agentic theory of human agency and a social network view of social structure. I then consider the implications of this analysis for Newell's original ontology, and thus for his interdisciplinary epistemology.

AB  - The purpose of this theoretical exposition is to bring two fields into discussion concerning the issue of motivation, in the new monetized context of education, through an encounter between John Dewey and self-determination theory. Using Dewey's Experience and Education as well as self-determination theory's most fundamental scholarship (e.g., Ryan and Deci 2000), we offer a contemporary parallel with Dewey's thoughts on "New" and "Old" education and examine it through the lens of self-determination theory. This interdisciplinary perspective combines educational psychology with philosophy of education to retheorize motivation as a critical response to the "New" educational shift toward monetization, which we argue should be resisted.

AB  - This study explores how African American STEM students pursued research experiences outside of STEM disciplines, drawing on nine years of data from the undergraduate research journal "XULAneXUS" at the STEM-focused, historically black institution Xavier University of Louisiana. Findings indicate that a successful STEM education for black students benefits from non-STEM research mentorship that supports and reinforces minority students' commitment to STEM careers. Data show that STEM students engaged in non-STEM research to help them study and explain phenomena, revealing significance in the agency of STEM students to broaden the scope of their STEM education at a STEM-focused institution.

AB  - Cultivating interdisciplinary connections between freshman and capstone students epitomizes a novel pedagogical approach to deepen student understanding of the learning process in a Community College environment. Within such a context, this article focuses on the outcomes of a two-semester collaborative effort that aims to establish and strengthen interactions between students at opposite ends of the academic spectrum. The work discussed focuses on an initiative in which capstone students in their final college class before graduating are supported in using their educational experiences to guide their first-year peers as they make the transition to college life. After discussing the creation and implementation of scaffolded collaborative assignments in which capstone students peer-reviewed freshman students work, the paper assesses the impact of the research on student understanding of the learning process by analyzing the quality of their work in the peer-review endeavor and the outcomes of their self-reflection activities.

AB  - This two-year case study examined multi-modal, interdisciplinary approaches to engage both immigrant English Second Language (ESL) and English Language Learners (ELL) in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) learning and to build STEM identity and self-efficacy. Leveraging innate abilities, multiple intelligences, and self-identified interests, children in Grades 3 through 8, new to America and STEM, became inquiry-based researchers of sound-making, soundscapes, and nonverbal communication systems in diverse species including human music-making using technology, analysis, communication research, and observation skills. Using generative and lateral thinking methodology for science translation, interdisciplinary methods, and team-based learning, the students demonstrated increased STEM interest, STEM learning, and STEM skill sets while developing self-efficacy as STEM learners and communicators.

AB  - This research is a qualitative study that examines the practices of teachers of science, mathematics, Turkish and social studies regarding interdisciplinary teaching approach. Participants in the study consisted of 35 teachers working in three different secondary schools with different socioeconomic backgrounds in the province of Adana in the academic year of 2016-2017. The data were collected by interviewing the participants through the "Demographic Characteristics Form" and "Interdisciplinary Teaching Practice Evaluation Form" developed by the researcher and analyzed by content analysis method. The results showed that the secondary school teachers performed the interdisciplinary teaching practices and that they influenced by the course goals and contents, information about different courses, characteristics of different students and extra goals. Interdisciplinary teaching practices are important in terms of promoting effective learning, having mental and emotional goals, and providing quality education services. It was revealed that both science and social sciences can be related to each other and to art lessons in the teaching process and the students are positively affected by the interdisciplinary teaching process. It was also found that teachers need guidance, adequate knowledge and skills, cooperation, and instructional designs or plans to guide them for practice.

AB  - South African education is in crisis, which also presents an opportunity for innovation and experimentation. This paper describes and analyses one such pedagogical experiment with a combined class of Architecture and Applied Theatre students from the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa. Students were taken through a critical pedagogical process that culminated in a 'spatial event' entitled "Masihambisane" [Let's walk!] that was responsive to the inner-city site and its peripatetic occupants. The article takes the position that a critical and socially responsible pedagogy can mitigate against the damage of past injustice and the alluring alienation of the capitalist agenda.

AB  - In this paper, we examined students' engagement in an implementation of a Workplace Simulation Project (WSP). The WSP was designed to actively engage students in learning disciplinary content by inviting engineers from industry to have a physical presence within the school building to collaborate with teachers and students to complete projects which simulate the tasks authentic to their work. We focus on the first year implementation of the program that partnered a high school in the rural Midwest with an engineering unit of a government organization. Using a multiple methods study design, we analyzed disciplinary and interdisciplinary pre and posts test along with students' interviews to determine learning gains as well as students' interpretations of creative and critical thinking as experienced in the project and their knowledge of the engineering design process. Effect sizes showed that students in the WSP group had notable gains over the control group participants. Additionally, students' knowledge of core elements of the design process were identified in inductive analyses of the interviews. Findings from this study will provide usable knowledge about effective ways to support systems and design thinking and ways to support expert-novice collaboration to ensure success.

AB  - Evaluation of interdisciplinary, team science research initiatives is an evolving and challenging field. This descriptive, longitudinal, mixed methods case study examined how an embedded, formative evaluation approach contributed to team science in the interdisciplinary Research into Policy to Enhance Physical Activity (REPOPA) project, which focused on physical activity policymaking in six European countries with divergent policy systems and researcher--policymaker networks. We assessed internal project collaboration, communication, and networking in four annual data collection cycles with REPOPA team members. Data were collected using work package team and individual interviews, and quantitative collaboration and social network questionnaires. Interviews were content analyzed; social networks among team members and with external stakeholder were examined; collaboration scores were compared across 4 years using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Annual monitoring reports with action recommendations were prepared and discussed with consortium members. Results revealed consistently high response rates. Collaboration and communication scores, high at baseline, improved slightly, but ANOVA results were nonsignificant. Internal network changes tracked closely with implementation progress. External stakeholders were primarily governmental, with a marked shift from local/provincial level to national/international during the project. Diversity (disciplinary, organizational, and geopolitical) was a project asset influencing and also challenging collaboration, implementation, and knowledge translation strategies. In conclusion, formative evaluation using an embedded, participatory approach demonstrated utility, acceptability, and researcher engagement. A trusting relationship between evaluators and other project members built on joint identification of team science objectives for the evaluation at project outset, codeveloping guiding principles, and encouraging team reflexivity throughout the evaluation.

AB  - Challenge-led interdisciplinary research is a relatively new way of bringing together disciplinary expertise in response to complex societal and environmental problems. Common difficulties include how to define 'interdisciplinary research'; how to improve the participation and flourishing of early-career researchers; and how to manage projects with disparate teams of researchers while deepening external collaborations. This article reports from a major initiative of this type. It interrogates qualitative data generated from program evaluation among participating researchers, identifying insights on beneficial structural (program design) and 'soft' infrastructure (human capital) variables, as well as on-going barriers and tensions. Notwithstanding the difficulties of communicating and collaborating across epistemic domains, the program in question exceeded expectations in building interdisciplinary research and early research careers--though not necessarily in ways initially imagined. Staggered funding pools meant it was acceptable in early phases for low-cost projects to 'fail safely', while strict funding guidelines on distal interdisciplinarity compelled unlikely and novel researcher combinations and projects. Moreover, such program design features 'granted permission' to early-career researchers to approach more senior, cross-faculty researchers as potential collaborators, hence building leadership capacity. Human capital variables included a dialogic approach to project development ('curating' projects as they evolve), inclusive program leadership, and promotion of the benefits of a collaborative rather than competitive research culture. Distal interdisciplinarity not only nourishes novel and unlikely research projects that respond to complex problems; with good program design and meaningful relationships it can, we argue, also build research careers differently from an early phase.

AB  - In the Indian context, concerns have been raised for many years about the learning outcomes of primary school children. The complexity of the issue makes it difficult to advise stakeholders on what needs to be done to improve learning in primary schools in India. As it has been shown that low socio-economic status is one of the key factors that negatively affect learning outcomes, the focus of the Multilila project ('Multilingualism and multiliteracy: Raising learning outcomes in challenging contexts in primary schools across India') is on educational achievement among children of low socio-economic status. In following the development of language, literacy, maths and cognitive abilities of primary school children over two years we hope to throw new light on why multilingual children in India do not always experience the cognitive advantages associated with multilingualism in other contexts. This paper focuses on some of the methodological challenges faced by this project. After explaining the rationale for the study, we sketch the contribution this project can make to the discussion about cognitive advantages of bilingualism. We then focus on the Indian context before presenting the methodology of the project (design, participants, instruments and procedure). Finally, we summarize the key challenges for the project and possible solutions to those challenges, and present an outlook towards the future.

AB  - Although the relationship between the classroom learning environment and academic achievement has been explored in subject-free and disciplinary subject contexts, research into this relationship is still lacking in the context of interdisciplinary subjects. This study investigated the relationship between the classroom learning environment and student achievement in an interdisciplinary subject (i.e. liberal studies) in Hong Kong secondary schools. The mediating role of critical thinking was also explored. The participants were 410 Hong Kong secondary school graduates. The structural equation modelling analyses indicated that (1) the Content aspect of the classroom learning environment had an effect on the achievement in liberal studies, and this effect was not mediated by critical thinking; (2) the Pedagogy aspect predicted critical thinking skills, which in turn predicted the achievement in liberal studies; (3) the Relation aspect had no significant effects on critical thinking skills and student achievement in liberal studies. Suggestions on enhancing students' high-order thinking skills and achievement in interdisciplinary subjects were provided.

AB  - The article reports on the results of a Design-Based Research path realized through a workshop about the "Visual Storytelling" (VS). The workshop aimed to develop teacher's professional competences about digital narrative documentation to be certified through the Open Badge system. The interdisciplinary design was developed according to the ICT-TPACK framework between the two courses "Methodologies, Didactics and Technologies for Teaching" and "Educational Research" in the Master's degree in Primary Teaching. 32 students were involved to deal with the documentation of some real educational experiences observed at school. They were asked to fill a semi-structured questionnaire at the end of the workshop. Other data came from a rubric used to evaluate VS products from three different points of views (students' self-assessment; university teachers; school teachers). The workshop stimulated the students to use technologies creatively, critically and reflectively to develop an authentic task realizing a VS product. According to the students' opinion, the workshop also facilitated collaborative processes as well as skills of self-assessment and the personalization of learning.

AB  - Photocatalytic hydrogen generation over semiconductor photocatalysts has attracted considerable attention over the past few decades. This experiment is designed for sophomore- and higher-level undergraduates who are in the majors of materials chemistry, analytical chemistry, catalysis, or chemical engineering. In this experiment, CdS nanoparticles and nanosheets were first fabricated with a one-step direct-precipitation reaction and a two-step precipitation--ion-exchange reaction, respectively, and then used as photocatalysts for visible-light hydrogen evolution from water, in the presence of noble-metal Pt nanoparticles as in situ cocatalysts and sodium sulfide and sulfite (Na[subscript 2]S/Na[subscript 2]SO[subscript 3]) as sacrificial reagents. A gas chromatograph with a thermal-conductivity detector (GC-TCD) was used to quantitatively monitor the produced hydrogen gas. This interdisciplinary experiment is expected to give students an introduction to nanomaterial synthesis, the general process of photocatalytic hydrogen generation, and the principles and use of instruments. Upon the completion of the experiment, students understand how chemistry can be utilized for renewable-energy applications.

AB  - The IPN Oaxaca CIIDIR has a mission to train human resources to postgraduate level that contribute to sustainable regional development in the South-East of Mexico. This is a vulnerable region that boasts an important source of natural resources and a great social, economic and technological backwardness that is directly related to the educational aspect. A master's degree has been designed with three lines of work, taking into account the strengths of the CIIDIR-Oaxaca: Design and sustainable technologies to the building, Security and food safety, and water resources. The aim is to encourage the transfer of knowledge and technology, with methodologies that allow promoting the work of collaborative multi and interdisciplinary and linking with the professional sector. The curriculum design responds to the educational model of the IPN, this model is characterized as facilitator of professional skills and too responds to the model of social integration. The curriculum of the master degree in "Project management for the solidary development" was designed with vocational guidance in response to the shortcomings detected in the region about social and environmental problems, through relevant diagnosis and analysis. This program is included in the PNPC-CONACYTi. The starting point of this methodology is the social order and the context deals with the social, economic and environmental aspects. The training of graduate students has the focus of solidarity economy and sustainability as an alternative view and feature in the proposal of projects to manage.

AB  - Purpose: Interdisciplinarity is necessary to explain or solve complex problems and questions of today's world. Therefore, it's important to analyze the situation within an educational institution to get to know what students think about interdisciplinary work. The purpose of this paper is to try to achieve an insight into how e-learning technologies (like WebCT) are perceived by students and to what degree information and communication technologies (ICTs) could improve communication and cooperation between students. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of two online surveys and the attendance of a course, the experiences and approaches of students were analyzed. Findings: The results show that most of the students see the positive aspects of interdisciplinary interchange and the benefit of learning from each other, so most of them are open minded regarding interdisciplinarity--an important requirement is given. Information and communication technologies are a good instrument to strengthen the cooperation and communication between students and can further be a helpful device for an interdisciplinary working approach. Practical implications: Based on these findings, more accesses to interdisciplinary cooperation can be worked out especially in the master program we have analyzed which sees interdisciplinarity as one of its main goals. Knowing that the openness and readiness from students' side is given, the offer for interdisciplinary ways of interchange could be expanded. Social implications: The results show that the students are open-minded to other students' knowledge and views, which also shows the mutual acceptance and respect for other opinions. This is very important for teamwork and also for multicultural interchange on an international basis. Originality/value: Not only in social regard but also for complex questions of science and society in general the results of student's experiences and approaches are auspicious for international frameworks.

AB  - Colleagues from information technology and three academic departments collaborated on an instructional technology initiative to employ student response systems in classes in mathematics, accounting and education. The instructors assessed the viability of using software-based systems to enable students to use their own devices (cell phones, tablets, laptop computers) rather than relying on dedicated devices needed with a hardware-based student response system. The instructors also evaluated student reaction to the technology and share their perceptions about the pedagogy, noting that all three felt there was a positive effect on student engagement. Finally, the instructors reflect on the long-term impact of the initiative on their teaching.

AB  - Building a doctoral program in leadership is never an easy task, and building an interdisciplinary doctoral program is even more difficult. Yet, it is the interdisciplinary approach that differentiates typical leadership programs from others and offers learners an integrated view of leadership theories and practices. This special report presents an example of designing and implementing an interdisciplinary doctoral program that promotes social justice leadership. Drawing from firsthand experiences of program faculty, staff, and administration, we share lessons learned and the logic behind adopting an interdisciplinary approach for those creating programs that seeks to promote social justice. We found that by allowing students and faculty to convene together, rather than disperse into separate, isolated academic disciplines, emerging scholar-practitioners are encouraged to engage in realistic, professional practice investigation and problem-solving techniques. Through this experience, we also found that conscious coursework design involves integrating multiple, often quite divergent, disciplines into a core set of courses. Additionally, we learned that unifying students through a common mission permits distinctive discussions, including personal reflection and ethical decision-making opportunities among the concepts, constructs, and knowledge that extend beyond disciplinary lines (Cherney et al., 2012). We also found that cultivating a diverse student body and faculty base requires everyone to work strategically within the program, recognizing the call for coherence and consistency across disciplinary lines. Finally, we discovered that developing a dissertation in practice allows students to implement an evidence-based solution within their professional practice setting as their pinnacle doctorate work (Herr & Anderson, 2014; Olson & Clark, 2009). We conclude this paper by reiterating our finding that leadership programs that promote social justice are enhanced by adopting an interdisciplinary approach as this allows for the creation of a program that challenges students to learn at a more complex level, faculty to integrate disciplines, and programs to promote socially just ideals. We discuss implications for other schools seeking to develop an interdisciplinary doctoral leadership program.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research is a valuable approach to addressing complex real-world problems. However, undergraduate research mentoring is discussed as an activity that happens in disciplinary silos where the mentor and student scholar share a disciplinary background. By transcending traditional academic divisions, we argue that mentors can train a new generation of scholars who think innovatively and create integrative research questions. We examined a sample of undergraduate students and their faculty mentors to determine the extent to which interdisciplinary research teams exist at George Mason University. Results indicated that interdisciplinary research teams are rare and faculty rank was their main predictor. University administrations can make specific choices regarding recognition and support for interdisciplinary undergraduate research mentoring that also advance institutional mission and values.

AB  - The dominant account of interdisciplinary integration mobilizes linguistic metaphors such as bilingualism or the learning of new languages. While there is something right about these linguistic metaphors, I urge caution about philosophical confusions that can arise in the absence of careful scrutiny of how our language relates to the world. Drawing particularly on Ludwig Wittgenstein's insights in his "Philosophical Investigations," I recommend four therapies to treat confusions that may arise when we uncritically reflect on the relationship between language and the world. Interdisciplinary scholars could benefit from careful attention to the ways that (1) understanding is a social deed, (2) language is a set of tools, (3) analysis into simple concepts loses meaning, and (4) the "grammar" of different regions of language can complicate translation. I then revisit what is correct about linguistic metaphors and emphasize that the challenge of integration is agreeing to a way of organizing social practices and prioritizing social goals, or what Wittgenstein called a "form of life." These closing reflections shift from the therapeutic, anti-theoretical reading of Wittgenstein's later philosophy to a reading that recognizes a positive project in his work.

AB  - Two professors at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock co-taught an interdisciplinary course in speaking and writing dialogically, that is, without lecture. Given that many learning environments include large enrollments and online instruction, both of which often foster an impersonal atmosphere, it seemed that dialogic instruction might significantly counter what we believe to be a distressing trend. We, the instructors, worked to create a positive social world in the classroom (guided by the theory of the Coordinated Management of Meaning) and to foster deep learning. We also endeavored to apply some of the principles Paulo Freire advanced in "Pedagogy of the Oppressed." Outcomes were better than expected. Students moved deeply into the assigned readings. Both speaking and writing improved markedly and in relationship with each other. We share our explanation of this work concerning dialogical pedagogy in writing that is itself dialogical.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the article was to convey experiences with pioneering interdisciplinary sustainability research by involving undergraduate students. Experiences with initiating and conducting multiple research projects spanning engineering and sustainability are described, and recommendations for programs and faculty in other institutions of higher education that plan to implement or support similar endeavors are discussed. Design/methodology/approach: The article and presented conclusions are based on three separate research projects, where specific examples as to how those projects were developed as well as challenges and rewards faced during the project are described. Findings: It is concluded that faculty should not refrain from working with students from different backgrounds and disciplines. Bringing different backgrounds and perspectives to a project enables a big picture view of problems at hand and leads to better solutions that are more in line with the three pillars of sustainability, while at the same time providing valuable hands-on experience to undergraduate students. Originality/value: By its very definition, sustainability is an interdisciplinary field and, thus, requires novel approaches for education and research compared to other settled fields of science. A viable way to increase the role of sustainability in higher education is to foster interdisciplinary research and teaching. The institutions role in promoting such efforts has been discussed together with example strategies that were found to be successful as well as those that were not. The article presents results of potential successes in projects where the traditional disciplinary bounds have been breached, and an interdisciplinary approach has been used to achieve project goals. The article also gives examples on what types of sustainability research can be conducted with undergraduate students.

AB  - Whether fluid cognitive functions are malleable has been a topic of ongoing debate for at least the past 100 years. Ever-evolving technology has led to new and diverse fields of investigation entering this debate. There are significant advantages to be gained by integrating different scientific paradigms, but there are also significant challenges. Cross-paradigm differences in levels of analysis, nomenclature, and expectations of training outcomes complicate interpretation of training results. It is argued that further investigations of (a) cross-paradigm intricacies and (b) strategy versus process training, particularly with spatial abilities, are needed.

AB  - Two curriculum scholars of contrasting epistemological backgrounds engage in a complicated curriculum conversation on the subject of fear and learning. One author's position is that learning is not only fraught with fear but also requires fear to be transformational. Furthermore, education is intimately connected to fear and unrest. The other author's position is that learning is biologically adaptive, generally of benefit to individuals and pleasurable under natural conditions. Societal learning among humans occurs relatively quickly, though never quick enough to keep pace with changes in the environment. The dialogue results in newfound recognition of the nature and power, of our perspectives on the one hand and the nature of curriculum conversation itself on the other hand.

AB  - In the present article, we describe a 3-day experimental workshop on type I diabetes aimed at helping high school students to understand how fundamental research on glycemia regulation contributes to the development of scientific knowledge and therapeutic strategies. The workshop engaged students in open-ended investigations and guided experiments. Each class was divided into three or four groups, with each group working with a trained doctoral student or postdoctoral fellow. During an initial questioning phase, students observed slides depicting the glycemia of individuals in various situations. Students identified hyperglycemic individuals relative to the average glycemia of the displayed population. Students were asked to devise a treatment for these diabetics. They quickly realized that they couldn't experiment on patients and understood the need for laboratory models. Each group gave ideas of experiments to perform. We then explained, taking into account their propositions, the protocols students could execute to address one of the following questions: Which criteria must an animal model of diabetes fulfill? How do pancreatic cells maintain glycemia? Is there a way to produce an insulin protein similar to the one released by human pancreatic cells? We used two different evaluation metrics of the workshop: a questionnaire filled out by the students before and after the workshop and a poster produced by students at the end of the workshop. We found that this educational approach successfully improved student awareness and understanding of the scientific reasoning and research process.

AB  - The current framework for integrating HIV/AIDS into university curriculum is mainly informed by the need to make HIV/AIDS education relevant to specific disciplines, and to equip graduates with necessary skills to respond to HIV/AIDS in their professional capacities. This strategy mainly emphasizes content and knowledge and largely ignores the current context in which students live and make sexual decisions. This paper explores the opportunities for utilizing multidisciplinary, and participatory integrated HIV/AIDS education programmes to address sexual risk-taking and students' vulnerabilities to HIV/AIDS within their university campuses. It examines students' preferences regarding development and implementation of HIV/AIDS programmes based on the findings of a PhD study conducted at three universities in KwaZulu-Natal province. Data was obtained through a questionnaire survey involving 1400 students, and in-depth interviews with 24 students and three HIV/AIDS coordinators drawn from across the three universities. Non-participant observations were also conducted at each of the three universities. Study findings indicate that participatory programmes and those that have an entertainment component demonstrate currency within student communities. Students rejected the didactic approach undertaken by some communication programmes with some participants arguing that "young people don't want be told what to do." A comparative semiotic analysis of HIV/AIDS posters within university campuses revealed a huge disparity between posters designed by students and those obtained from national communication campaigns. The choice of imagery and semantic codes differed significantly. The paper suggests the adoption of a Freirian pedagogical methodology in implementing an integrated and multidisciplinary HIV/AIDS education programmes so as to generate conditions in which students are able to reflect on their own realities and personalize the risk of HIV infection.

AB  - This research investigates multidisciplinary teamwork in an English special school located in the West Midlands region of the UK. The research was carried out by Paola Molteni, a PhD student at Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Milan, Karen Guldberg of the Autism Centre for Education and Research Director at the University of Birmingham School of Education, and Nick Logan, head of the Psychology and Therapists Department at Sunfield Children's Home, Clent. The school uses the innovative SCERTS (Social Communication, Emotional Regulation, Transactional Support) model. The methodology was a collaborative and participatory case study focused on the point of view of professionals and on understanding the teamwork process through analysis of three teams working together to implement SCERTS. Methods included focus groups, semi-structured interviews, direct observations and questionnaires; the data were analysed using the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis method. The research provides an example of good practice and enables practitioners to reflect on the issues involved in implementing a multidisciplinary process using the SCERTS approach. The findings show that the SCERTS Model can support the educational team in promoting and exchanging good daily practice and planning educational work together. The article draws out implications for further studies that aim to analyse teamwork in other settings and over a longer period.

AB  - Evidence based practice (EBP) is reflected in social work publications, accreditation standards, research, and funding opportunities. However, implementing EBP in social work practice and education has proven challenging, highlighting the need for additional resources. This paper describes the Transdisciplinary Model of EBP, a model based on advances in EBP across health disciplines including social work and its application to the development of an online EBP training portal. Utility of the Transdisciplinary Model and a training portal for social work education is discussed. Also included is a description of the training modules, the Council on Social Work Education Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards competencies reflected in the modules, and a case example using the modules in a master's of social work course.

AB  - Many mathematics educators are not aware of a strong connection that exists between the education of computer programming and mathematics. The reason may be that they have not been exposed to computer programming. This connection is worth exploring, given the current trends of automation and Industry 4.0. Therefore, in this paper we take a closer look at the Common Core's eight Mathematical Practice Standards. We show how each one of them can be reinforced through computer programming. The following discussion is virtually independent of the choice of a concrete programming language. Therefore, in the interest of simplicity, we will use a well-known educational programming language named Karel the Robot based on (Pattis, 1995) which is freely available online in NCLab (NCLab, 2019). The visual character of this language will allow us to provide more illustrative examples than would be possible with a standard programming language such as Java, C++ or Python.

AB  - Much has been written in recent years about how historical scholarship can be used to shape practice in the classroom. As an historian of the medieval period now working as an history teacher, Dhwani Patel offers a fresh perspective on these debates. During her PGCE year, Patel found herself reflecting on how the lenses and methodologies that shaped her own practice as an historian could help her tackle the weaknesses she identified in her Year 7 pupils' understanding of how power functioned in the medieval period. In this article she shows how she drew on her research to plan an enquiry exploring the importance of rituals in establishing political authority, and evaluates the potential of using cultural history to build more secure, nuanced understandings of political history.

AB  - An apparent conflict between preferences for hierarchical as opposed to distributed organizations is evident in arguments about disciplinary and interdisciplinary organization. It characterizes as well a wide array of other arenas ranging from the biological to the political. In this article, parallels between biological, neurobiological, and social observations are explored in an effort to outline a general approach  that may be useful in thinking about interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary activities as well as forms of social organization in general. A key element in the approach is an ongoing individual and collective process of story creation, sharing, and revising.

AB  - Recent calls for university administrators to advance interdisciplinary research and teaching have suggested that allocating campus space to such initiatives is key to their success. Yet questions remain concerning just what kinds of spaces are most conducive to this agenda. This article aims to shed light on this relationship by drawing on case studies of five interdisciplinary area studies centers for the study of the Middle East from US campuses. From interview and observational data, we examine how faculty and staff perceive and use their space to support interdisciplinarity, and the ways that spatial attributes condition centers' operation. Our cases highlight how interdisciplinary space is a complex configuration of material form, location, and meaningfulness, as these spaces are relationally embedded in broader campus geographies, and human agents construct meanings for them that are not determined by their physical design. We conclude with lessons for practice and further research concerning the different ways that campus spaces can be designated to facilitate idea trading across disciplinary boundaries, build cross-disciplinary community, and achieve legitimacy for interdisciplinary enterprises.

AB  - A two-semester-long interdisciplinary support effort to improve student posters in organic chemistry lab is described. In the first semester, students' literature search report is supported by a workshop conducted by an Instruction Librarian. During the subsequent semester, a second workshop is presented by the Instruction Librarian, an English professor, and the Assistant Director of the college's Learning Center. In that workshop, the students are shown PowerPoint applications to enable them to produce digital posters. They also learn the conventions of scientific poster layout and design, scientific writing style, use of graphics, and correct ACS documentation. The interdisciplinary support culminates in a poster competition at the end of the second semester. The digital posters created not only exemplify professional scientific design and content; they are also easily transported, presented, and stored and eliminate the expense of printed posters.

AB  - An interdisciplinary approach provides many benefits that warrant the need for its use at technical universities teaching foreign language as an academic discipline. This article reviews recent Russian researches focused on interdisciplinary integration, summarizes advantages and proves overall high efficacy of the interdisciplinary approach to teaching a foreign language for students. When taken as a basis, this approach was found to open up new prospects for implementation of didactic principles of learning at foreign language classes. The article describes the implementation of the principles of interdisciplinary coordination, systematicity and consistency, scientificity, occupational focus, visualization, affordability, strength, consciousness, pro-active behavior, educational training, availability, focus on student's individual character, and intercultural interaction within the framework of the interdisciplinary approach. Incorporation of these principles is demonstrated using training of students of the National Research Nuclear University MEPhI [Moscow Engineering Physics Institute] as an example. At MEPhI, students learn a foreign language during the entire period of their education and study the following credit modules: Introduction into General Technical Foreign Language; General Technical Foreign Language; Occupation-oriented Foreign Language; Foreign Language for Occupation-oriented Communication, Business Communication; Foreign Language for Academic Research; and Communication Foreign Language (in-depth study).

AB  - Modern level of informational technologies development allows the authors of educational courses to decrease their dependence from technical specialists and to independently develop distance-learning courses and their separate online components, which require special methodical learning. The aim of present study is to develop a distance-learning course in linguistics with regard to the specifics of the course that uses modern informational technologies. Scientific and methodic significance of the study consists in the fact that the developed online course is an innovative representation of the results of methodic and scientific research work of teachers and students. Therefore, it expands their opportunities to participate in the university's innovative activity, along with the educational and research activities. Within the presented project we plan to transfer the communicative-activity paradigm of learning into practice of distance forms of organizing students' independent work and to model a new educational product (online component of the course) on the basis of these results with consequent integration in educational process.

AB  - Peer-learning networks (PLN) can be valuable tools for doctoral students. Participation in these networks can aid in the completion of the dissertation, lead to increased scholarship productivity, and assist in student retention. Yet, despite the promise of PLNs, few studies have documented their effect on social work doctoral education. This article explores aspects of an interdisciplinary PLN focused on child welfare. This study used a questionnaire with scaled survey items and open-ended questions to examine the use, benefits, and challenges to participating in the PLN. After a brief review of the literature, this article presents findings from the study, discusses the implications for social work education, and concludes by explicating strategies for developing PLNs in social work education programs.

AB  - Despite the significant role of oral presentation in the academic context, many university students evade opportunities for participation due to low self-efficacy. The present study has been conducted to compare oral presentation self-efficacy of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners with undergraduates and postgraduates of Non-EFL majors, and to investigate the relationship of this construct with their teaching and prior academic oral presentation experiences as two modes of Bandura's [(1995). "Exercise of personal and collective efficacy in changing societies." In A. Bandura (Ed.), "Self-efficacy in changing societies" (pp. 1-45). New York: Cambridge University Press] mastery experience. Extracting the oral presentation sub-skills from the literature, an oral presentation self-efficacy questionnaire with 38 five-Likert scale items was constructed. A two-way between-group ANOVA was run on the responses of a total 48 postgraduates (25 EFL and 23 Non-EFL) and 63 undergraduates (28 EFL and 35 Non-EFL) selected randomly from two of the universities in Iran. The results indicated no difference between EFL and Non-EFL students, whether at undergraduate or postgraduate level, in terms of their oral presentation self-efficacy. Spearman's correlation coefficient, however, showed a strong positive correlation between the two modes of mastery experience and oral presentation self-efficacy (r = 0.44, n = 111, P < 0.01; r = 0.42, n = 111, P < 0.01). With no difference in oral presentation self-efficacy of university students at various academic disciplines and levels, it seems that oral courses in the EFL curriculum have not contributed to the benefit of EFL students' oral presentation self-efficacy. Teaching and academic experiences, however, have played a key role in enhancing self-efficacy particularly in EFL postgraduate students who have a higher chance of gaining teaching experience. The results suggest the need for curriculum developers and lecturers to introduce more courses on oral presentation skills at universities.

AB  - Indigenous Studies is a rapidly growing field of enquiry both nationally and internationally. The internationalisation of the discipline is dependent on its interdiciplinarity and on the collaborative efforts of interdisciplinary scholars. Colonised Indigenous people globally share similar experiences despite differences in histories and contexts. In collaborative situations, dedicated scholarship brings together Indigenous people and allies who are committed to the global expansion of Indigenous knowledge through shared understandings of experiences and histories. Collective efforts can improve curriculum development, enhance opportunities for publication, bring scholars together in conferences and symposia and provide opportunities for new research networks for Indigenous scholarship. This paper addresses spheres of collaborative and collective endeavours that continue to reap benefits nationally and internationally in the field of international Indigenous Studies.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that service-learning (SL) can help students not only develop their personal qualities but also enhance their social and civic sense of responsibility. Despite many promotions since the mid-1990s, the development of SL is popular in humanity faculties but not in technical faculties with intellectual orientations less associated with social services. The shortage of support in these areas can be attributed to the lack of a conceptual model to guide the delivery of a quality service-learning subject for disciplines like building and engineering. To fill the gap, this study examined use of a 3-tier service-learning model that offers a pragmatic pedagogical design for developing SL subjects by encompassing interdisciplinary academic education and field services. The findings reveal that, beyond the technical skills in building and engineering, students' generic skills and their awareness of social responsibilities have been enhanced through this interdisciplinary SL program.

AB  - This paper deals with an empirical study examining the effectiveness of interdisciplinary teaching in biology and physical education (PE) regarding the students' growth in knowledge. The study was conducted with 141 German sixth form students. In groups, they were taught three hours a week for a period of six weeks. In order to compare the effectiveness of regular lessons with the project, the study uses a test and control group design. This means a test group takes part in interdisciplinary teaching (IdT) lessons while a control group of peers receives subject-related lessons. After being exposed to the different kinds of lessons for a certain time, we then compared the effects on the students' skills in a pre-/post-test. The IdT lessons are designed to complement each other so that the biology lesson supplies explanations for processes occurring in PE, whereas the PE lesson provides a visualisation of the theoretical biology content. In this paper, first the current German curricula requirements as they relate to interdisciplinary teaching will be outlined. After this, the state of research concerning interdisciplinary teaching, methodical-didactic expectations and learning targets will be provided. Following on from this, the data investigated in the course of the study will be presented, such as the study design and measuring instruments. The results of the pre-/post-test will be described and then discussed in the conclusion. They indicate a significant growth in knowledge with the test group (IdT) when compared with the control group (F(1, 113.24) = 126, p<0.01, n[superscript 2][subscript p] =0.43).

AB  - Educational policies require the use of data and progress monitoring frameworks to guide instruction and intervention in schools. As a result, different problem-solving models such as multitiered systems of supports (MTSS) have emerged that use these frameworks to improve student outcomes. However, problem-focused models emphasize negative behaviors and protracted interventions implemented only after students show a pattern of failure or resistance to intervention. Positive Youth Development (PYD) is a nascent proactive developmental systems model that is aligned with MTSS yet was developed in contrast to problem-focused approaches. Research suggests that physical health is an important PYD variable associated with positive school outcomes. In this article, authors systematically review and integrate specific literature demonstrating how nutrition, under the rubric of physical health, is a developmental asset that advances PYD and positive student outcomes. In addition, they highlight interdisciplinary measures available to school mental health professionals that advance good nutritional practices, PYD, and positive student outcomes.
