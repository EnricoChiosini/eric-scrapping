AB  - This paper is interested in the interdisciplinary characteristics of European integration studies. It explores how the institutional and intellectual, internal and external boundaries of this interdisciplinary field are shaped. For this purpose, it discusses two interlocking dynamics that are most important: on the one hand, the European Union actively attempts to mobilise European integration studies to contribute to building a united Europe by providing specific spaces, resources, and infrastructures for academic research and the public dissemination of results. On the other hand, the external and internal boundaries of this interdisciplinary field are shaped by the movements and interactions of scholars from different academic backgrounds. Together, the different academic strands and policies coproduce the interdisciplinary field of European integration studies. Suggesting avenues for future research, the conclusion recommends analysing key debates in the context of European integration in terms of boundary objects around which academics, policy-makers, and publics can engage with each other and points to specific sites for further observations of these processes of coproduction.

AB  - Social workers and attorneys both interact with persons from diverse backgrounds every day, yet although interpersonal skills are an essential focus of social work education, these skills are not addressed in legal education. Interdisciplinary courses in which social workers and lawyers learn interpersonal skills together and have an opportunity to practice them through service learning opportunities are a way to remedy a gap in legal education. The authors describe a project recently piloted at a large midwestern university in which law and graduate social work students participated in an interdisciplinary course with a service learning component requiring students to work together on cases. As one component of the clinic's assessment, all students were pre- and posttested via an interpersonal skills survey. The law students showed statistically significant improvement in interpersonal skills at the end of the course. The results indicate a need for increased support for interdisciplinary education, specifically partnerships between the professions of law and social work.

AB  - This article responds to the rising emphasis placed on interdisciplinary collaborative learning and its implications for assessment in higher education. It presents findings from a research project that examined the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary collaborative student symposium as an assessment task in an art school/humanities environment. After addressing key ideas relating to interdisciplinarity, collaboration and assessment, the authors evaluate a practical model for facilitating interdisciplinary collaborative learning. Drawing on student surveys and assessment outcomes, the findings highlight the extent to which collaborative teaching and learning, coupled with social software tools and associated modes of communication, foster innovative, high quality interdisciplinary work, and offer an adaptable assessment framework for broader application in higher education settings.

AB  - A tiered response model for social-emotional learning (SEL) is needed to address the significant mental health needs of young people in this country. In collaboration with other school mental health professionals, school psychologists have a unique expertise that situates them to be systems change agents in this work. This article describes a pilot project that focused on augmenting existing SEL services with SEL assessment within a tiered system of support in one elementary school. Using a consultation-based model grounded in principles of empowerment evaluation, an interdisciplinary school team used SEL data collected during one school year to inform the delivery of SEL interventions and supports. Data from SEL, academic, and behavioral assessments were examined retrospectively to illustrate the potential value of integrating assessments and interventions across domains. The discussion offers implications for ongoing efforts to develop and implement tiered response models through interdisciplinary collaboration among school mental health professionals.

AB  - A geographic information system (GIS) can be a valuable research tool, helping scientists understand location and bridge the gaps between subjects in interdisciplinary research (IDR), which has been promoted for its real-world solutions. However, a GIS can be difficult to use and may require understanding of a number of concepts as well as tools and technology. This complexity is compounded by additional challenges commonly encountered in IDR. This paper examines some of the challenges facing learners of GIS in IDR projects, with a particular focus on the appropriateness of current teaching methods in this context.

AB  - One of the difficulties in teaching global sustainability in the introductory political science classes is the different emphases placed on this concept and the absence of the consensus on where the overall balance between environmental protection, economic development, and social justice should reside. Like many fuzzy concepts with which students struggle, teaching sustainability lends itself to pedagogical examination within the scholarship of threshold concepts. This article investigates students' understanding of sustainability in the seven semesters when the concept of sustainability was introduced via role-playing simulation and compares it with the similar data from a more recent semester when simulation was supplemented with traditional lecture and classroom exercises. Ultimately, our research question is twofold: (1) How do students define a multifaceted concept like global sustainability and (2) what is the better way to teach it--active learning only or active learning in combination with traditional instruction?

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to describe experience gained with a required six-credit year-long course, the Capstone Interdisciplinary Team Project, a key component of the Master of Science (MS) in Sustainability degree at the City College of New York. A common feature of sustainability problems is their interdisciplinary nature. Solutions to sustainability problems often require professionals with different training and backgrounds to work as a team. A sustainability curriculum should provide students with the skills needed to competently participate in an interdisciplinary team. Design/Methodology/Approach: Instructors drawn from different departments and divisions of the college developed a pool of sustainability-focused Capstone projects and acted as mentors to teams of students with diverse undergraduate backgrounds. Students attended workshops designed to provide training in teamwork, research and report preparation. An independent evaluator designed an evaluation protocol to assess the course's impact both while it was implemented and after the course was concluded. Findings: Early experience with the program strongly indicates that the Capstone project requirement is an effective learning tool. However, identifying qualified mentors, developing suitable projects, assembling teams and administering the Capstone course are demanding tasks. Although students often experience difficulties in the early stages of their work, they ultimately express satisfaction and appreciation for the skills learned in the course. Practical implications: The inclusion of a capstone team project in a graduate sustainability curriculum is strongly recommended. Adopting such a course requires significant effort and sustained faculty engagement. Originality/value: Although there is considerable experience with undergraduate engineering Capstone course requirements, little is known about interdivisional capstone requirements at the level of master's degree in Sustainability. This paper details new and relevant experience helpful to the implementation of such a requirement.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate a professional development programme that prepares and assists teachers with the implementation of a multidisciplinary science module, basing the evaluation on "participants' reactions," the first level of Guskey's five-level model for evaluation (2002). Positive evaluations at the higher levels in Guskey's model are thought to depend upon those at the first level, that is, teachers' positive appreciation for the professional development programme. Different instruments (questionnaires, e-mail correspondence, and interviews) were used at various stages in the four-part professional development programme. The data were categorised by the stage in the programme to which they pertained: individual preparation; preparation seminar; online support; or reflection meeting. The data from all participating teachers were combined in word tables, with some parts paraphrased in a few sentences. In general, the teachers were satisfied with the professional development programme. This paper identifies several elements that ensure teacher satisfaction in the multidisciplinary professional development programme, indicates which are the difficult elements of this programme, and suggests how these difficulties can be handled in such a programme.

AB  - Establishing a Transactive Memory System (TMS) is essential for groups of learners, when they are multidisciplinary and collaborate online. Environments for Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) could be designed to facilitate the TMS. This study investigates how various aspects of a TMS (i.e., specialization, coordination, and trust) can be facilitated using a transactive memory script that spans three interdependent processes (i.e., encoding, storage, and retrieval) in multidisciplinary CSCL. Sixty university students were assigned to multidisciplinary pairs based on their disciplines (water management or international development). These pairs were randomly assigned to a scripted or non-scripted condition and asked to discuss and solve a problem case. The script facilitated construction of a TMS, fostered learners' knowledge transfer and convergence, and improved the quality of problem solution plans. Specialization and coordination aspects of the TMS were mediators for the impacts of the script on joint but not individual problem solution plans. (Contains 1 figure and 2 tables.)

AB  - The scientific process is nonlinear, unpredictable, and ongoing. Assessing the nature of science is difficult with methods that rely on Likert-scale or multiple-choice questions. This study evaluated conceptions about the scientific process using student-created visual representations that we term "flowcharts." The methodology, Scientific Process Flowchart Assessment (SPFA), consisted of a prompt and rubric that was designed to assess students' understanding of the scientific process. Forty flowcharts representing a multidisciplinary group without intervention and 26 flowcharts representing pre- and postinstruction were evaluated over five dimensions: connections, experimental design, reasons for doing science, nature of science, and interconnectivity. Pre to post flowcharts showed a statistically significant improvement in the number of items and ratings for the dimensions. Comparison of the terms used and connections between terms on student flowcharts revealed an enhanced and more nuanced understanding of the scientific process, especially in the areas of application to society and communication within the scientific community. We propose that SPFA can be used in a variety of circumstances, including in the determination of what curricula or interventions would be useful in a course or program, in the assessment of curriculum, or in the evaluation of students performing research projects.

AB  - This article focuses on the "Relational Agency Framework" (RAF), an analytical tool developed for an Australian review and evaluation study of an early years' policy initiative. We explore Anne Edward's concepts of "relational expertise", "building common knowledge" and "relational agency" to explore how Edwards' concepts, which she refers to as "gardening tools", and the RAF work together to support early years multidisciplinary networks. We argue that early childhood professionals who come together in a multidisciplinary network develop their collective capabilities through relationality and a focus on belonging. The RAF embeds Edwards' relational concepts and enables the exploration and articulation of how network participants' individual, discipline-specific knowledge and expertise augments to support collectively transformative practice within their network, their place and wider community. We conclude that a sense of belonging is foundational to the emergence of such relational agency in networks. Tools such as the "gardening tools" and the RAF offer possibilities for addressing the challenges of how to support collaboration between government, early years professionals and communities to work holistically in the best interest of all children and their families.

AB  - In this paper, insight into forensic science students' experiences of a case-based scenario with an interdisciplinary guided-inquiry experience in chemistry and biology is presented. Evaluation of student experiences and interest showed that the students were engaged with all aspects of the case-based scenario, including the curriculum theory components as well as the active learning within interdisciplinary laboratories. Working in groups of three during laboratories was favored by students, but mixed responses for group assessment were observed. Since the introduction of the case-based scenario, sustained improvements in student assessment outcomes were observed. Questionnaire respondents indicated a strong interest in case-based learning. We propose a methodology framework for the case-based scenario investigation in forensic science and discuss the student experiences and improved learning occurring with the scenario involving an interdisciplinary guided-inquiry experience in chemistry and biology. This work suggests that an interdisciplinary guided-inquiry learning approach, ideally contextualized within a case-based scenario, is adaptable to other science discipline combinations.

AB  - Children's participation is a popular rallying cry among child rights activists and community development groups, backed by the recognition of children's participatory rights in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). Participation is both a guiding principle of the UNCRC and an explicit right. Article 12 establishes the right of children (who are capable of forming their own views) to express them freely in all matters affecting the children, and for their views to be given due weight, in accordance with age and maturity. In South Africa, children's participatory rights are recognised in the Children's Act, the Child Justice Act and, in a more circumscribed way, the South African Schools Act.

AB  - Our understanding of the process of interdisciplinary research has expanded considerably over the last decades. The purpose of this brief paper is to take stock of where we are and where we are going. The first section addresses definitional issues and discusses the relationship between teaching and research. The second section discusses potential objections to the idea of identifying best practices for interdisciplinary research. The third section outlines best practices for each step in the interdisciplinary research process, and identifies avenues for further research.

AB  - This chronological overview of the development of interdisciplinary theory starts with the pre-cursors of theory: the development and elaboration of the definition of interdisciplinary studies, influential but problematic images of interdisciplinary studies proposed by Donald Campbell and Erich Jantsch, and best practices in interdisciplinary studies identified through AIS. It continues with a review of the motivation behind a theory of interdisciplinary studies, the controversy it engendered, and an assessment of what remains to be done. It concludes with the challenges to theory posed by new types of interdisciplinary studies, especially transdisciplinary studies and the science of team science.

AB  - This article describes how two faculty members at Cabrini College--one from biology and the other from psychology--incorporated interdisciplinary community-based research in an honors course on environmental watershed issues. The course, Environmental Psychology, was team-taught in partnership with a local watershed organization, the Valley Creek Restoration Partnership (VCRP) in such a way that the students could see first-hand the interdisciplinary nature of many community-based research (CBR) projects. The study of watersheds is necessarily an interdisciplinary endeavor, requiring an understanding of natural, social, and behavioral sciences. Additionally, since both faculty were working with the same community partner, they anticipated that they would be able to align and integrate their research designs more closely with one another when team-teaching an interdisciplinary CBR course. The interdisciplinary CBR course exposed more students at Cabrini College to an experiential learning opportunity. The course was open to students in any major and at any level in the Cabrini College Honors Program. The design, implementation, and assessment of the course can serve as a roadmap for others considering teaching an interdisciplinary CBR course in honors, including details about the collaboration between faculty from different disciplines with a community partner, student focus group data on course learning outcomes, the impact of an honors interdisciplinary CBR project from a community partner perspective, and the expansion of the honors model into an institution's general education requirements for all students.

AB  - Recognition of the value of a scientifically literate citizenry has driven American science education reform since the 1950s. We have seen some improvement in the comprehension of science facts in the past 10-20 years, but far less improvement in Americans' understanding of the nature of science. College science courses are ideal venues for promoting science literacy. However, in an effort to condense a complicated subject into a single semester, the nature of science is often lost amidst the facts presented in a freshman survey course, often the entirety  of a non-science major's experience in science. We argue that an interdisciplinary approach that integrates the sciences and the humanities can attract non-science majors, increasing these students' exposure to scientific concepts by relating them to students' existing interests and knowledge. This fosters science literacy by teaching students that science is a process of human inquiry with a distinct methodology, instead of simply a litany of facts. We recommend that a successful interdisciplinary course should present an engaging topic with which students can  identify, incorporate opportunities for student research, and offer site visits to working laboratories.

AB  - The authors designed and ran a crash course on emotional robotics involving students from both the Information Engineering School and the Design School of Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy. The course consisted of two intensive days of short introductory lessons and lab activity, done in interdisciplinary groups and supported by a well-equipped prototyping and modeling lab. People from very different backgrounds had to work efficiently together, going from problem setting through the demonstration of the physical implementation of an object able to show four different emotional states. Both teacher evaluation and questionnaire-based feedback from the students show that it was successful and useful to set up this type of intensive experience in which students share their abilities to achieve a common goal. Key aspects for the success of the course were the short time the students had to reach a well-defined, yet general, goal, the students' ability to find efficient ways of cooperating and sharing their competences, students' motivation to arrive at a working prototype, and the strong support from teachers and lab personnel.

AB  - This purpose of this paper is to provide a theoretical foundation for inclusion in Canadian schools for this Special Issue on Inclusive Education. In response to the need for an interdisciplinary framework, this paper uses an interpretive literature review methodology to construct a framework for educational inclusivity based on four disciplinary perspectives: (a) special education and disability studies, (b) multiculturalism and anti-racist education, (c) gender and women's education, and (d) queer studies. The constructed framework elucidates four conceptions of inclusivity--normative, integrative, dialogical, and transgressive--positioned on a continuum with each conception representing a different approach to inclusion. Unlike previous models, this framework is not anchored to any one marginalized group; rather, it is intended to represent multiple forms of inclusivity to edify historical, existing, and idealistic educational practices and structures for all forms of difference.

AB  - This scoping literature review examines the topic of interdisciplinary doctoral research supervision. Interdisciplinary doctoral research programs are expanding in response to encouragement from funding agencies and enthusiasm from faculty and students. In an acknowledgement that the search for creative and innovative solutions to complex problems is best addressed through interdisciplinary collaborations, research-intensive universities are increasingly encouraging interdisciplinary projects and programs. The expansion of interdisciplinary research to the context of doctoral research may impact several core components of the doctorate: the enactment of the student-supervisor relationship, the process of forming and working with a supervisory committee, and the process and outcomes of doctoral research. In order to ensure that interdisciplinary doctoral supervision occurs in a positive and effective way, it is necessary to understand the distinct needs and challenges of interdisciplinary students and their supervisors, through scholarship about this phenomenon.

AB  - This study considers code-switching (CS) and pausing in two sociolinguistically distinct groups in London and Cyprus, bilingual in Greek-Cypriot Dialect (GCD) and English. The characteristics of their speech are examined both in monolingual and bilingual modes (Grosjean, 2001). It was hypothesised that in London Greek-Cypriots, where CS is a "default mode", pausing behaviour would be affected by the same factors as in monolinguals, but not by CS. In Cyprus, on the other hand, where CS serves specific discourse functions, overall fluency was expected to be negatively affected by the more marked character of the alternation. Results revealed that CS has no significant effect on pausing in either context. Conversational motives, along with lexical, grammatical and processing issues, are the determining factors in bilingual, as well as monolingual, pausing. Despite the lack of difference found here between the two groups, we conclude that sociolinguistic and discourse variables should form an essential element in attempts to model bilingual speech production.

AB  - This paper presents a theorised classroom-based account discussing the author's interdisciplinary approach to engaging first-year teacher-education students in self-critical inquiry using creative writing techniques as an entry point into Arts-based three-dimensional storytelling. Via an interpretation of Lacan's "speaking subject"--combined with theories of the postmodern "self"--the discussion explores the creative potential of autoethnography as a practice of self-reflection, writing, artistic expression and three-dimensional storytelling. Here, particular examples of students' works are provided to exemplify the power of this interdisciplinary Arts/English methodology to facilitate students' opportunities to: a) self-narrate and self-examine personal experience with a view to understanding and visually expressing the personal and public self; and b) utilise creative writing techniques in tandem with Arts-based forms of visual expression to raise questions about how language, dimensionality, and the Arts might intersect to construct and narrate individual subjectivity, and the implications for understanding professional identity.

AB  - States and jurisdictions are under increased pressure to demonstrate the use of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for children's mental health, increasing the demand for a workforce trained in these practices. Universities are a critical pipeline for this workforce. This article describes the genesis and evolution of a university-based initiative for training in EBTs for children, youth, and families. Given both the need to make training in EBTs available to future providers in a range of disciplines and that mental health providers increasingly find themselves on interdisciplinary teams (despite university-based training being relatively siloed along disciplinary lines), the initiative has had an interdisciplinary focus. Two tracks are described: (a) Practitioner Track, a course series in which students learn a specific EBT, and (b) Referral Track, a monthly lecture series designed to engage a wider university and community audience. Results of the program evaluation component of this initiative revealed that students can significantly increase their skills and self-efficacy in components of EBT delivery through participation in the active, skill-focused courses. Furthermore, the results of the lecture series evaluation appear to meet an important need for community-based providers and other supportive individuals in transferring useful knowledge about best practices. Implications and future directions are discussed.

AB  - The fast-paced nature of the healthcare setting, coupled with the number of allied professionals involved, demands accurate and concise written communication. It is imperative that written communication between nursing and allied professionals be clear to ensure that the highest quality of care is provided and that patient safety is maintained. The authors feel the considerations documented by nursing students after reading an interdisciplinary evaluation report have the potential to improve the level of care provided to a patient and the patient's experience of the care, as well as the student's knowledge regarding allied healthcare. Students noted that reading the report had the potential to adjust their expectations of the patient's communication abilities, cognition, or behavior and increase their awareness of the need to modify their own communication skills. If a nursing student understands the possibility of challenges in communicating with patients with communication disorders, this may carryover to future interactions, resulting in better patient care. Understanding patient concerns is critical for nurses, and this data indicates that reading a speech evaluation report provides the nurse with pertinent information.

AB  - The study of ruthenium polypyridyl complexes can be widely applied across disciplines in the undergraduate curriculum. Ruthenium photochemistry has advanced many fields including dye-sensitized solar cells, photoredox catalysis, lightdriven water oxidation, and biological electron transfer. Equally promising are ruthenium polypyridyl complexes that provide a sterically bulky, photolabile moiety for transiently "caging" biologically active molecules. Photouncaging involves the use of visible (1-photon) or near-IR (2-photon) light to break one or more bonds between ruthenium and coordinated ligand(s), which can occur on short time scales and in high quantum yields. In this work we demonstrate the use of a model "caged" acetonitrile complex, Ru(2,2'-bipyridine)[subscript 2](acetonitrile)[subscript 2], or RuMeCN in an advanced synthesis and physical chemistry laboratory. Students made RuMeCN in an advanced synthesis laboratory course and performed UV-vis spectroscopy and electrochemistry. The following semester students investigated RuMeCN photolysis kinetics in a physical chemistry laboratory. These two exercises may also be combined to create a 2-week module in an advanced undergraduate laboratory course.

AB  - An interdisciplinary subject, liberal studies, was introduced as a compulsory and core subject into the New Senior Secondary Curriculum in Hong Kong in 2009 with the purpose of expanding students' knowledge base and increasing their social awareness through investigation into a variety of issues. However, transforming curricular innovations into real classroom settings and maintaining them is a complicated process. This study aimed to investigate, during its first round of implementation, teachers' pedagogical practices in 21 local schools through in-depth interviews and documentary analysis. The results reveal that the school administrators and teachers were more likely to adapt their teaching approaches and teaching materials than their teaching content and assessment. Both good practices and examination-oriented practices in the process of curriculum implementation were evident in this study. These findings contribute to our understanding of the implementation of an interdisciplinary curriculum in examination-oriented systems and inform the practitioners of school-based practices of curriculum implementation.

AB  - This paper describes the implementation of an innovative approach to work-integrated learning using interdisciplinary projects within a university Faculty of Business. Further, it discusses the implementation of integrated and authentic assessments involving academic units in the marketing, urban planning and business communication disciplines. The authors reflect on issues involved with the introduction of interdisciplinary teaching and learning strategies, representing a shift from traditional silo approaches in tertiary education. The paper considers how a student-centered learning approach can support innovation in higher education. It highlights the importance of providing students with an integrated, "in situ" approach to learning within the context of their own learning institution. The paper concludes by asserting that universities can provide business students with authentic and relevant business problems, the opportunity to access the resources of the university and engage with staff and students across a range of disciplines to facilitate a project-based learning environment on-campus.

AB  - Paper to Plastics (P2P) is an interdisciplinary program that combines chemistry and biology in a research setting. The goal of this project is 2-fold: to engage students in scientific research and to educate them about sustainability and biodegradable materials. The scientific aim of the project is to recycle unwanted office paper to the useful biodegradable polymer poly(lactic acid) (PLA). Through this program, students learn firsthand how chemistry and biology interact to form useful materials from waste. Students combine biological techniques, such as enzymatic digestion and fermentation, with chemical techniques, such as distillation and catalysis, to accomplish the conversion of waste paper into PLA. Through this summer program, students ultimately become familiar with diverse laboratory techniques, while learning how their scientific interests can be used to address important social problems.

AB  - The purpose of this article was to synthesize intervention studies using coaching with parents in early intervention with a focus on (a) definitions and descriptions of coaching with parents; (b) characteristics of families and coaches; (c) parameters such as settings, contexts, dosage, and professional development related to coaching; and (d) child and family outcomes. Through a search of articles from 2011 to 2013, the authors identified 8 studies that met search criteria. Results indicate that there is no common definition/description for the term "coaching with parents in early intervention." Furthermore, the use of the term "coaching with parents" spans a continuum that on the one end can best be described as relationship-directed process and on the other end an intervenor-directed process. This continuum continues to create confusion for practitioners in appropriate use of coaching with parents. In addition, although positive outcomes are noted for infants and toddler who experience disabilities and their families, it is difficult to discern the direct impact of coaching with parents. The studies, as a whole, tend to give broad descriptions for the use of coaching but little information on how to individualize given specific child and family outcomes. Finally, the intended outcomes of coaching with parents are not fully articulated. Given these results, this synthesis has found the need for increased research efforts in the area of coaching with parents with focus on clarification of the term "coaching" and the parameters that affect its effectiveness.

AB  - We investigated whether students in psychology-based learning communities (LCs; i.e., cohorts who took introductory psychology and English together) performed better on psychology tests than those in standard classes. There were two types of LC; in one (connected LC), we created links between English and psychology by using English class readings that related to the social psychology unit, and by requiring students to produce interdisciplinary group podcasts. In the other (unconnected LC), there were no interdisciplinary connections. Students in the connected LC had higher mean test scores in psychology than both students in unconnected LCs and those in standard classes. Our results suggest that students perform better on psychology tests when efforts are made to consolidate information through interdisciplinary links in an LC.

AB  - Knacktive is a one-term course that incorporates a highly select group of undergraduate students and replicates the intense teamwork atmosphere of a technology-oriented, professional marketing communication agency. As an interdisciplinary learning opportunity, Knacktive melds students from five disciplines--including art and graphic design, interactive digital media and computer science, public relations, journalism and media studies, and marketing and business management--into an interactive, team-based course facilitated by five faculty members representing the disciplines. Although other college-level student agencies exist, many are staffed by students from only one discipline. Utilizing active research methodology, faculty reflections resulted in course changes that significantly improved course functionality. Student achievements included client implementation of many of the student team-developed concepts and promotional materials. Student reflections collectively viewed the agency-like process as a "brutal" but rewarding experience. The students also noted that the experience helped develop more professional attitudes about meetings, deadlines, interpersonal communications, collegiality, teamwork, and problem solving skills.

AB  - This paper provides insights into both the educational design of textbooks and interdisciplinary education. The author introduces two educational principles for textbook design--instructional alignment and balancing diversity and meaningful guidance for readers--and applies them to writing his own textbook chapter for being interdisciplinary. The two broad conclusions are: textbook design can be a new area of study in higher education, illuminated by curriculum design and reflective practice; and textbooks can provide a useful method of interdisciplinary education.

AB  - Scientific undergraduate research in higher education often yields positive outcomes for student and faculty member participants alike, with underrepresented students often showing even more substantial gains (academic, professional, and personal) as a result of the experience. Significant success can be realized when involving deaf and hard-of-hearing (d/hh) undergraduate students, who are also vastly underrepresented in the sciences, in interdisciplinary research projects. Even d/hh Associate degree level students and those in the first two years of their postsecondary careers can contribute to, and benefit from, the research process when faculty mentors properly plan/design projects. We discuss strategies, including the dissemination/communication of research results, for involving these students in research groups with different communication dynamics and share both findings of our research program and examples of successful chemical and biological research projects that have involved d/hh undergraduate students. We hope to stimulate a renewed interest in encouraging diversity and involving students with disabilities into higher education research experiences globally and across multiple scientific disciplines, thus strengthening the education and career pipeline of these students.

AB  - Students need to think and work across disciplinary boundaries in the twenty-first century. However, it is unclear what interdisciplinary thinking means and how to analyze interdisciplinary interactions in teamwork. In this paper, drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives and empirical analysis of discourse contents, we formulate a theoretical framework that helps analyze interdisciplinary reasoning and communication (IRC) processes in interdisciplinary collaboration. Specifically, we propose four interrelated IRC processes--"integration," "translation," "transfer," and "transformation," and develop a corresponding analytic framework. We apply the framework to analyze two meetings of a project that aims to develop interdisciplinary science assessment items. The results illustrate that the framework can help interpret the interdisciplinary meeting dynamics and patterns. Our coding process and results also suggest that these IRC processes can be further examined in terms of interconnected sub-processes. We also discuss the implications of using the framework in conceptualizing, practicing, and researching interdisciplinary learning and teaching in science education.

AB  - This activity is designed to illustrate an application of resistive forces in the introductory physics curriculum with an interdisciplinary twist. Students are asked to examine images of riverbed boulders after a flood and estimate the water flow that was needed to push the boulders downstream. The activity provides an opportunity for students to gain an understanding of the physics of natural phenomena with applications to environmental science and environmental engineering, to gain a stronger appreciation for physical modeling and estimation, and to become "environmental detectives"!

AB  - Decoding disciplinary expertise for novices is increasingly part of the undergraduate curriculum. But how might area studies and other interdisciplinary programs, which require integration of courses from multiple disciplines, decode expertise in a similar fashion? Additionally, as a part of decoding area studies and interdisciplines, how might a sequential experience of library-based research practice support that curriculum? Finally, how might a program introduce students to fellowships and career opportunities in the field early in their studies? Area studies and interdisciplinary departments face particular challenges in this regard because of multiple entry points into the major and the lack of a consistent pattern of student movement through the major (due to students studying abroad or because of the array of different disciplinary courses comprising individual programs of study). A tested course designed to address these issues, and adaptable for other area studies or interdisciplinary programs, is part of the required curriculum for Asian Studies at St. Olaf College in Northfield, MN.

AB  - Understanding the process of attachment formation in young children has been a focal point in child development research for decades. However, young children's attachments are not only with human beings; they also form bonds with companion animals, particularly dogs ("Canis familiaris"). Given the number of dogs that are kept by families and the amount of time that young children spend with these animals, the child-dog bond merits further study. In this review of the literature, young children's interactions with companion canines are explored from an attachment theory perspective. Research on human-animal interaction is a burgeoning field of inquiry that includes well-established disciplines (e.g., sociology, psychology, child development/family studies) as well as emerging fields, such as anthrozoology, neurobiology, ethology, and bioecology. This review is grounded is organized around four themes in the research: (1) the treatment of animals in the family; (2) influences on the child/dog bond; (3) the uniqueness of attachments formed with dogs; and (4) canine attachment behaviors. The review concludes with a discussion about why study of the child-companion animal attachment has lagged behind other areas of study and offers recommendations for future research.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to describe actions designed to foster interdisciplinary research efforts at a major university in the UK. The study employed a descriptive mixed method case study approach to collecting and analysing the data used to draw its conclusions. One hundred and twenty-seven academic staff responded to the survey. The results of the survey were verified by 25 interviews with heads of colleges, heads of schools, research coordinators, research team leaders, and team members. These interviews were supported by document review to support the findings. Leadership is important at the college and university levels if interdisciplinarity is to thrive. According to the data, this seems to have not yet occurred at this particular institution. The university has done well with most of the big structures that enrich and support interdisciplinarity. However, "small" structures such as clarity of meaning, motivation of staff, misalignment of old structures, time and workload, and loss of identify have impeded the move to university wide interdisciplinarity. A series of three recommendations are made to move the interdisciplinary project forward: stay clear on focus, extend the benefits of serendipity to more people, and remember that one size does not fit all.

AB  - GlobalEd 2 (GE2) is a set of technology-mediated, problem-based learning (PBL) simulations for middle-grade students, that capitalises on the multidisciplinary nature of the social sciences as an expanded curricular space for students to learn and apply scientific literacies and concepts, while simultaneously also enriching their understanding of the social sciences. This paper reports the results of an implementation of the GE2 curriculum focused on water resources with 535 seventh and eighth grade students from both suburban and urban school systems. The results indicate positive changes in students' writing self-efficacy, interest in pursuing future science educational opportunities and the quality of their written scientific argumentation after participation in a GE2 simulation. Curricular implications and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Wind energy conversion systems (WECS) nowadays offer an extremely wide range of topologies, including various different types of electrical generators and power converters. Wind energy is also an application of great interest to students and with a huge potential for engineering employment. Making WECS the main center of interest when teaching power electronics and electrical machines can therefore be highly advantageous. This paper describes a novel teaching experience using wind energy as the starting point for understanding power electronics and electrical machines. The results point out the wide variety of concepts involved in the course, the numerous competences that it can enhance, and its positive reception by learners.

AB  - Recent debates about the future of academia have focused primarily on teaching the STEM subjects. This is certainly a valuable call for action, but it also threatens to ignore the significant contributions of the humanities and other fields. This article presents a workable alternative by way of looking at more technical writings by 18th-century German Jesuit missionaries in Sonora (today Mexico and Arizona), which invites a critical analysis of the data provided by those authors about the natural environment and the social conditions and also a thorough examination of "literary" texts at the same time from a humanistic perspective. Those narratives also serve as meaningful documents for all German students in the Southwest because they indicate the importance of the German language for the study of the local history going back almost two hundred years.

AB  - So far, not enough effort has been invested in developing reliable, valid, and engaging assessments in school science, especially assessment of interdisciplinary science based on the new Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Furthermore, previous tools rely mostly on multiple-choice items and evaluation of student outcome is linked only to their raw scores in standardized tests. In addition, educational research on student science achievement always limits in certain grade/subject according to application of raw scores. This study provides a way to design, validate, and further improve an instrument to assess student understanding in interdisciplinary science across grade and time. Meanwhile, student learning growth is investigated. The data are collected from elementary/middle school student survey from an Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Partnership (ISEP) in Northeastern part of the USA. The results show a generally good quality of instrument through various aspects of empirical evidence, such as dimensionality, model-data-fit, and validity. Finally, student learning growth in understanding interdisciplinary science shows a sharp increase between elementary and middle school. The study sheds light on developing more reliable and valid instruments in assessing student science understanding based on the new standards and it also provides suggestions of implementation in both educational research and practice.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the benefits, barriers and challenges of the transdisciplinary approach to training, and to present findings of a case analysis. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on the research findings of an experimental training program for Greek local government managers co-funded by the European Union. Findings: The adoption of the transdisciplinary approach for the effective training of (local government) managers has a number of important advantages, including the connection of training with real problems that organizations face today, as well as the development of transdisciplinary competences necessary for the effective adaptation and activation of managers in the turbulent environment of the new economy. Research limitations/implications: The experimental training program focuses on managers of Greek local government organizations. However, the critical factors that are described are relative to the training needs of most organizations operating in the new globalized economic environment. Practical implications: The design of the transdisciplinary training programs, as well as their implementation and evaluation processes, can be of use to all organizations interested in the strategic training and development of human resources, regardless of their size and sector. Originality/value: There is a great potential for the development of training programs based on the transdisciplinary approach. Fields of immediate application are those where social, economic and ecological elements interact and should be integrated in a sustainable way. (Contains 2 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - Collaboration has become a main characteristic of academic research today. New forms of research organizations, colaboratories, have come to the fore, with distributed research centres as their most complex example. In this study, we aim to provide some insight into the collaboration strategies of researchers in their daily researching activities within a distributed research centre. More specifically, we wish to understand to what extent information and communication technologies facilitate collaboration within distributed research centres. We will do this by presenting the case of the Interdisciplinary Institute for Broadband Technology (IBBT), a research organization active in Flanders, Belgium. The paper will draw from a qualitative-ethnographic study carried out within the 16 academic research groups that are part of IBBT. The discussed topics include the effects of the introduction of such a virtual collaborative organization, the internal organization of the research groups and the collaboration between these groups.

AB  - Group counselors commonly collaborate in interdisciplinary settings in health care, substance abuse, and juvenile justice. Social network analysis is a methodology rarely used in counseling research yet has potential to examine task group dynamics in new ways. This case study explores the scholarly relationships among 36 members of an interdisciplinary community of practice. Findings suggest some disciplines work together more than others and members are more likely to interact interpersonally than in knowledge production. The study also finds members who are more central to the group than others, and subgroups that may be centers of work and creativity.

AB  - The article is aimed at describing one of the possible interdisciplinary courses for students of the 7-9 classes of the basic school connecting mathematics with natural sciences and the study of such courses role in the formation and development of meta-subject competencies of students. The leading method for this is the modeling of interdisciplinary courses, the main tools for the development of meta-subject competence in which are the interdisciplinary character of the content, including open and partially open type tasks in the course structure and the organization of project activities of schoolchildren in the field of studying mathematics and related disciplines. As a result of the research conducted by the authors they worked out several author's interdisciplinary courses, among them a special place is taken by the course "Mathematics in Natural sciences" for the classes of the natural-science profile. It is suggested in it to consider mathematical questions when applying them to the material of related disciplines both through the study of theoretical material and in the process of solving problems, including the open type, and involving schoolchildren in the project of interdisciplinary activity. Practical use of the interdisciplinary courses allows to see the achievements of meta-subject results by schoolchildren and the successes of students both in mathematical preparation, expressed by high marks on the subject, and related disciplines, which indicates the improvement of mathematical education quality of students who received training using the proposed methodology.

AB  - This article details the aim, development, and implementation of the Chemistry-Genetics Course Collaborative (CGCC), a cotaught offering of a human genetics course with an honors introductory chemistry course. The CGCC was formed to fully integrate the two courses, along with the associated chemistry lab, to create an interdisciplinary scientific community among the students and their professors. The design of the courses was purposefully aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards, incorporating its interwoven strands of disciplinary core ideas, scientific practices, and crosscutting concepts. This article represents Part I of the research and contains the original interdisciplinary plan for the semester, along with the revised schedule after repeated, unified, and purposeful attempts by both faculty members to encourage students to buy into the course design were largely unsuccessful. Detailed descriptions of course assessments and rubrics, issues to be considered in designing such a nontraditional course structure, and reflections on the experience of implementing one are also included. Part II of the research, to be published separately, will focus on the analysis of assessment, attitude, and interview data.

AB  - Multidisciplinary team members were surveyed to identify the frequency with which they use recommended assessment practices, how they interpret assessment information, and their confidence working with English Language Learners (ELLs) for the purpose of determining possible eligibility to receive special education services. Results of this study support the idea that recommendations from the literature are being increasingly put into practice by professionals working directly with students. Findings also indicate that professionals benefit from higher education and in-service trainings that focus specifically on issues relating to the assessment of ELLs for the determination of possible provision of special education services. Furthermore, results support the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - A multidisciplinary dance and theatre arts program geared for high school-aged youth can result in both short-term and the long-term outcomes for its students if it seeks to offer a life-changing peak experience as part of the arts training and performance process. By integrating a combination of dance, movement, theater, music, creative and reflective writing, as well as identity exploration and creative collaborations, performing arts programs can provide participants an experience that is truly transformative. In particular, such a program can help initiate and support meaningful mentoring and developmental relationships. A summer performing arts program set at a university site is an ideal opportunity to implement a sequence of strategic creative and social activities that offer high school youth daily activities that can establish a foundation for these significant relationships to emerge. By including college-aged program counselors who attended the program when they were in high school, acting as "step-ahead" peers, a program model such as this one provides potent possibilities for burgeoning leaders and mentors to emerge and meaningful relationships to take hold. Furthermore, the performance material generated in such a program can directly represent the personal evolutions of the students and the developmental relationships that are originated throughout the program's creative and social processes. This article uses the UCLA Summer High School Dance Theater Intensive program as a case study of a progressive, multidisciplinary, summer performing arts program that positions the initiation of developmental relationships as one of its core values.

AB  - Health Science students at the University of KwaZulu-Natal perform better in their professional modules compared with their physiology modules. The pass rates of physiology service modules have steadily declined over the years. While a system is in place to identify "at-risk" students, it is only activated after the first semester. As a result, it is only from the second semester of their first year studies onward that at-risk students can be formally assisted. The challenge is thus to devise an appropriate strategy to identify struggling students earlier in the semester. Using questionnaires, students were asked about attendance, financing of their studies, and relevance of physiology. After the first class test, failing students were invited to complete a second questionnaire. In addition, demographic data were also collected and analyzed. Correlation analyses were undertaken of performance indicators based on the demographical data collected. The 2011 class comprised mainly sport science students (57%). The pass rate of sport science students was lower than the pass rates of other students (42% vs. 70%, P < 0.001). Most students were positive about physiology and recognized its relevance. Key issues identified were problems understanding concepts and terminology, poor study environment and skills, and lack of matriculation biology. The results of the first class test and final module marks correlated well. It is clear from this study that student performance in the first class test is a valuable tool to identify struggling students and that appropriate testing should be held as early as possible.

AB  - One of the goals of international education is to help students learn about different regions of the world. Such education is inherently multidisciplinary, including geographical and historical perspectives to put the places and regions in spatial, ecological, and temporal context. A wide variety of systematic disciplines also can be involved in such study. Recognizing this reality, Augustana College initiated in 1974 an overseas fall term program in East Asia and has continued the program on a triennial rotation with similar programs in Europe and Latin America. Teaching courses that normally would be offered on campus, the faculty adapt the classes to the countries and particular places being visited through use of guest lecturers, field experiences, special events, and the neighborhoods in which the accommodations are located. When each program is completed, students have a good multidisciplinary understanding of the region and of the importance of a geographic perspective for such understanding in any part of the world.

AB  - Because present initiatives guiding educational decision-making place a high emphasis on accountability, there was a need to explore the educational value of the literacy and science education courses' joint interdisciplinary focus for elementary education. With current research alluding to time constraints, scripted curriculum, and memorization dominating teachers' decisions about instruction, it seemed important to gain insight into the practical nature of the interdisciplinary method with former students. Former pre-service teachers in their first years of teaching were surveyed. The goal was to find out how the interdisciplinary strategies influenced their instruction and students' learning, and if they were continuing to meaningfully chunk their curriculum. Twenty-five of the forty former pre-service teachers returned the survey. These first-year teachers reported making cross-curricular connections and articulated a range of benefits for their students. However, they also discussed hindrances to their attempts at making cross-curricular connections, including state and local mandates, time constraints, and dilemmas related to being a first-year teacher. The findings from this study could prove valuable to teacher educators in elementary education programs, as well as to those involved in planning and facilitating professional development activities for elementary school teachers.

AB  - This essay proposes a model of university-community partnership called "an engaged swarm" that mobilizes networks of students from across classes and disciplines to work with off-campus partners such as nonprofits. Based on theories that translate the distributed, adaptive, and flexible activity of actors in biological systems to organizational networks that include humans, swarms are well-suited to providing a diverse range of responses to complex problems. As such, swarming tactics can be useful when applied to nonprofit organizations that do not have the capacity or time to redesign their communications strategy across print, web, and social media platforms. Employing a case study of three classes that collectively produced a wide range of multimedia artifacts for a nonprofit in a single semester, the essay illustrates how a swarm embedded within a university operates, and concludes by providing a schema for modifying swarms to future partnerships.

AB  - A new, interdisciplinary, team-taught course has been designed to educate students in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) so that they can respond to global and urgent issues concerning computer control systems in nuclear power plants. This paper discusses our experience and assessment of the interdisciplinary computer and nuclear energy course, which was developed and offered primarily to ECE students at Howard University. A unique team-teaching model utilized with ECE professors and nuclear field experts was applied to teach the two diverse subjects: computer safety and nuclear energy. The survey result from the first offering of the course showed a very positive response from the majority of the students about the team-teaching method and the knowledge acquired on the two subjects.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change is a complicated issue involving scientific data and analyses as well as political, economic, and ethical issues. In order to capture this complexity, we developed an interdisciplinary student and faculty collaboration by (1) offering introductory lectures on scientific and ethical methods to two classes, (2) assigning the same technical and opinion texts about anthropogenic climate change to both classes, and (3) coordinating multidiscipline discussions with students about their common reading assignments. Student learning was documented using identical pre- and postcollaboration surveys. We hypothesized that students would be better prepared to understand and engage in public debate about anthropogenic climate change if they were first taught to distinguish clearly between scientific and ethical claims. Our results from pre- and postcollaboration surveys support our hypothesis; as students showed an increased understanding of the distinction between science and ethics, they were better able to critically analyze popular articles and to develop their own questions about anthropogenic climate change. The results also suggest that our students were more prepared to think critically about scientific inquiry than about ethical inquiry regarding anthropogenic climate change.

AB  - First-year seminar programs have been a feature on the landscape of post-secondary teaching and learning in the United States, since they first appeared in the 1880s at Boston University (Mamrick, 2005). More recently, they have begun to appear at Canadian universities. For example, first-year seminars were introduced a decade ago at the University of Guelph, as a campus-wide initiative. To recognize the first decade that these unique, interdisciplinary seminars have been offered, faculty were surveyed to understand better the impact of the program on those teaching in it, as well as their perceptions of their students. The experience of the University of Guelph suggests first-year seminar programs can have a significant influence on the teaching and professional experience of faculty and encourages them to extend their networks beyond the department and across the campus. Significantly, seminars serve as sites for pedagogical experimentation that can influence departmental curricula. Faculty who teach a first-year seminar have high satisfaction and report myriad benefits to morale, teaching, and research. The salutary effects of a first-year seminar program are not local but would be transferable across post-secondary institutions.

AB  - The authors of this article are two teacher educators who worked collaboratively to co-teach an interdisciplinary English and US history class to eleventh-grade students in an urban high school. They wanted to ensure the methods they were teaching preservice teachers were current and effective. The article discusses the foundational beliefs that influenced their teaching, the interdisciplinary curriculum they taught, some of the challenges they encountered, and a brief snapshot of the students' views of the curriculum. The authors discuss that putting their beliefs into practice outweighed the challenges they encountered--a culturally relevant, authentic, interdisciplinary curriculum can be effective in an urban classroom. The experience also assisted them in teaching their English and social studies methods classes.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to discuss the implementation of case-based teaching and use of response technologies to graduate students in a food science course. The article focuses on teaching sensory science and sensometrics, presents several concrete examples used during the course, and discusses in each case some of the observed outcomes. Students' evaluations, peer feedback, and self-observations throughout the course collectively indicated that the particular initiatives were effective in engaging student participation and promoting a more active way of learning. Case-based teaching provided students with the opportunity to apply their knowledge and their analytical skills to complex, real-life scenarios relevant to the subject matter. The use of audience response systems further facilitated class discussion and was extremely well received by the students; this resulted in a more enjoyable classroom experience.

AB  - This article reports on the efforts of a political science professor teaching a multidisciplinary course focused on New York City to develop an interdisciplinary class project designed to lead students to an appreciation of the immigrant experience in the United States "From Ellis Island to JFK" (Foner, 2000). The particular interdisciplinary project that the article describes employs work from philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and political science in an effort to help students grasp more fully the often contentious and always complex process of immigrant acculturation from traditional cultures to life in a modern capitalist society. The project culminates with students considering how the narrative in Mario Puzo's novel "The Fortunate Pilgrim," which chronicles the fortunes of an early 20th century Italian immigrant family in New York, reflects the academic work covered previously in class and whether the story line applies more generally to the experiences of recent immigrants to the United States. It is notable that the venue within which this class occurs, St. John's University, has had as part of its larger mission for nearly 150 years the education of first-generation college students. This mission is a particularly telling one in a classroom peopled with first-generation Muslim immigrants as well as fifth or sixth generation descendants of the southern and eastern European immigrants of the turn of the last century.

AB  - This study examines teachers' initial conceptions of an integrated STEM-PBL approach and their perceptions of what facilitates or hinders implementation in their schools. This study took place within the first year of a three-year STEM Professional Development (PD) program for middle school math, science and English language arts teachers. The two primary PD components were a week-long, summer institute and a school-year cross-curricular unit planning that included a lesson-study component. Qualitative methods were used to analyze teacher responses from PD evaluations, teacher reflections, interviews and program artifacts. The study provides insight into the feasibility of an integrated STEM-PBL model. The study concludes with implications for practice and a discussion of how future interdisciplinary professional development can be conceptualized.

AB  - This paper presents a concept for analysing the bearing of institutional settings on inter- and transdisciplinary research and education for sustainable development and applies it to a concrete case example. It asks in how far the funding programme requirements and the institutional project arrangements impacted on the research process and project results. The example demonstrates not only the well-known difficulties of inter- and transdisciplinary research, but also steering possibilities. The involvement of co-financing project partners and partners from schools secured the inter- and transdisciplinary project implementation. However, they also influenced the project outcomes according to their organisational interests. They prioritised economic and ecological over social issues, which in consequence limited the sustainability discourse within the project with regard to its breadth and inclusiveness. The paper concludes that the appropriate selection of research and practice partners as well as the sufficient budget, time and professional resources for inter- and transdisciplinary cooperation management, are crucial for the successful implementation of inter- and transdisciplinary research or educational projects for sustainable development.

AB  - This article investigates transdisciplinarity in relation to information behaviour and information literacy. It demonstrates how these areas are especially suited to transdisciplinarity thought, notes the potential that transdisciplinarity offers in these contexts and presents the key components of transdisciplinarity in two complementary breakdowns designed to help academics and information professionals recognize the value of the concept to their own work. The article considers how transdisciplinarity may be understood in terms of transferable skills, collaboration across different areas, phenomena that affect various disciplines and the use in one field of ideas associated with another. It concludes with reflections on the overall strengths and weaknesses of transdisciplinarity. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - To attract and retain more academically qualified students to science and mathematics, we developed a merit-based scholarship program for incoming students with STEM interests. Scholarship recipients participate for the first two years in an interdisciplinary learning community and declare a STEM major by the sophomore year. STEM Learning Community (SLC), a year-long course initiated in fall 2009, has become a permanent part of the College curriculum. Content consists of weekly meetings for discussions and presentations on such topics as scientific ethics, relationships between science and technology, the nature and history of science, and the interplay between scientific discovery and societal development. A major component are group research projects conducted during the school year and presented at our annual undergraduate research symposium. In addition, we provide career counseling, visits and presentations by STEM professionals, and internship opportunities. Students report that they are developing such valuable skills as problem solving ability, communication skills, collaboration, and knowledge of the research process. Enrollment and graduation data show that numbers of participants, especially women and minority students, increased following the inception of the SLC. The results suggest that targeted scholarships combined with engagement in collaborative undergraduate research are a useful tool for enhancing STEM recruitment and persistence.

AB  - Leaders of community-based learning programs must prove the worth of their programs to community hosts, while engaging students at appropriate levels of learning. Pitfalls multiply when programs are interdisciplinary, involve multiple sites, and/or deal with questions of social equity. Such programs must effectively match and prepare students and site supervisors, coordinate disparate curricular elements, facilitate communication between participants, and provide an educationally valid approach to ethically charged aspects of the curriculum. The 2007-2010 Hamline University "Bringing It All Back Home" project, focused on environmental and justice issues associated with large-scale urban redevelopment, provides one model for meeting challenges that such programs commonly pose.

AB  - As the new generation of designers face more complex design issues, the forms of design research start to shift towards a user-centred approach to problem-solving. The cooperation and communication among various fields and specialisations are becoming more complex; in many practical design cases, in particular, technology developers face challenges in deciphering the creative ideas of designers and the needs and restraints of users, society, law and science. The emergence of integrative design based on a wide range of disciplines has prompted discussion and exploration among various participants. The direction of contemporary design research has already transformed from one based on production of artefact to one focused on the integration of varied knowledge and fields at different stages. We examine such design research based on a problem-driven approach in two case studies characterised by interdisciplinary collaboration for solving complex problems. We focus on the transformation and implementation of integrative design research methods and suggest a "reflection-in-action" problem-solving process for strengthening the capabilities of multidisciplinary design research.

AB  - With global specialization of work units within organizations, interdisciplinary work practices comprised of collaborative efforts between technical and business teams are increasingly common in today's workplace. While higher education has responded by creating opportunities for remote teams to learn from collaborative work, occasions for interaction between remotely situated "significantly diverse" teams such as business and engineering are few. This study describes a pedagogical offering between U.S.-based business teams and U.K.-based engineering teams that delivers such an experience around mutually dependent, socially responsible projects. Results from student surveys and reflections confirm that the pedagogical design is able to generate perceived interdependence between these diverse teams. Student responses to surveys also suggest that the collaboration is effective in raising student confidence in interdisciplinary and remote team work among students. The study concludes with recommendations for transferability and actualization of interdisciplinary collaboration.

And it requires reasonable localization of interdisciplinary research organizations in universities. Facing the difficulties participated in collaborative innovation, they should establish a perfect operation mechanism, play the role of collaborative innovation platform, and actively transform to collaborative innovation center scientifically and effectively.

AB  - The relationship between research and teaching has long been at the core of the unsettled debate over the development and distribution of human knowledge. Recently ways to bridge teaching and research has come to the fore in higher education reform again. Partly pushed by the adoption of national academic assessment regimes, most of which are predisposed toward research, and partly charmed by the fame tied to scientific discovery and theory innovation, university academics tend to put more emphasis on research at the expense of teaching. On the other hand, with the job market becoming more challenging and higher education becoming more expensive, demands for better university teaching are on the rise. Research seems to be at loggerheads with teaching. Is this the destiny of university academics? The objective of this article is to reflect upon the long-debated relationship between research and teaching by examining how this relationship plays out in the discipline of the law. In addition, this article aims to provide a better understanding of the relationship between research and teaching in law with the help of pedagogy and education theory.

AB  - Integrating interdisciplinary social studies topics and social responsibility concepts into a business education class can be meaningful for student learning. The discipline of social studies includes multiple areas such as economics, history, sociology, and anthropology. Social responsibility in a business sense means that companies are concerned with the communities in which they operate beyond making a profit. Social responsibility has recently been emphasized as a way to teach students about how their actions can affect society. Microfinance is an example of social responsibility in which individuals across the world can loan money to struggling entrepreneurs in poor countries. Microfinance lends itself well with social studies since it emphasizes how people live and work in other countries. This paper describes how social responsibility and social studies can be woven into an integrated project for an introductory computer applications class. The course and projects are described and they can be customized for use in a high school or post-secondary setting.

AB  - Are there ways to document interdisciplinary learning, specifically the forms integration takes? This article reports on stage two of a Carnegie scholar project on interdisciplinary teaching and learning in learning communities at Holyoke Community College. In the first stage, the author used the Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy as a course-level assessment rubric to document the strong relationship between learning community instruction and interdisciplinary learning. In this follow-up qualitative study to make interdisciplinary learning both visible and audible, the focus is on student writing, specifically the mechanisms students use to integrate their learning across learning community course levels and to develop integrative habits of mind. In-depth interviews were conducted with twelve learning community students or scholars using a Link Aloud method which preserves student voice in writing and conversation by drawing on two methods from cognitive psychology, concept mapping and verbal protocol analysis, where students "think aloud" while performing a task. After reviewing completed Link Alouds with the twelve student-scholars, twelve precise mechanisms of integration were identified.

AB  - This paper uses the reflections of a recent workshop on biology and the humanities subject areas to consider the potential for designing a first year interdisciplinary module that brings together teachers and learners in the Biosciences with their counterparts in English and History. It considers three building blocks of module design: aims and objectives; teaching and learning strategies; and assessment; and provides a commentary on the discussion of interdisciplinarity in the broader literature. The authors argue that interdisciplinary teaching and learning must be transformative, but not in the way many previous advocates of interdisciplinarity have assumed. Rather than transcending disciplines, the authors contend that the aim should be to enhance disciplinary understanding. Learners should emerge from the interdisciplinary module not having lost their identity as biologists, but having enhanced it. They should have become "better" biologists in the sense of having developed a broader, critical understanding of the precepts of their discipline, as a first step to an understanding of biology inflected with a literary and historical awareness.

AB  - As non-teacher training courses in UK higher education in Education Studies have grown and developed in recent years they have received enormous interest. All of these Education Studies degrees claim to integrate a number of disciplines using an interdisciplinary or a multidisciplinary paradigm. Traditionally the systematic integration of disciplines within courses has created a range of lenses for focusing upon issues such as in medical sociology and health. However, by their very nature, Education Studies courses are complex and influenced by a number of factors such as the socio-economic climate, political factors, changing technologies and the contemporary views of childhood as well as the changing and evolving socio-constructions of childhood. Currently, Education Studies courses integrate a number of disciplines to investigate the learning process in context. There is a trend for Education Studies degrees to shift between terms of disciplinarity such as multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity. This paper examines the nature of Education Studies degrees and tries to provoke the debate about the mono, inter, and multidisciplinarity nature of Education Studies. The paper promulgates that Education Studies by its nature and complexity cannot seek identity with any one of these approaches. It will suggest that, given the complexity of the context it serves to match, that instead Education Studies is embedded within transdisciplinarity.

AB  - Writing groups for doctoral students are generally agreed to provide valuable learning spaces for Ph.D. candidates. Here an academic developer and the eight members of a writing group formed in a Discipline of Public Health provide an account of their experiences of collaborating in a multicultural, multidisciplinary thesis writing group. We consider the benefits of belonging to such a group for Ph.D. students who are operating in a research climate in which disciplinary boundaries are blurring and where an increasing number of doctoral projects are interdisciplinary in nature; in which both academic staff and students come from enormously diverse cultural and language backgrounds; and in which teamwork, networking and collaboration are prized but not always proactively facilitated. We argue that doctoral writing groups comprising students from diverse cultural and disciplinary backgrounds can be of significant value for postgraduates who wish to collaborate on their own academic development to improve their research writing and communication skills; at the same time, such collaborative work effectively builds an inclusive, dynamic research community.

AB  - Background: In fields such as medicine, psychology, and education, systematic reviews of the literature critically appraise and summarize research to inform policy and practice. We argue that now is an appropriate time in the development of the field of engineering education to both support systematic reviews and benefit from them. More reviews of prior work conducted more systematically would help advance the field by lowering the barrier for both researchers and practitioners to access the literature, enabling more objective critique of past efforts, identifying gaps, and proposing new directions for research. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to introduce the methodology of systematic reviews to the field of engineering education and to adapt existing resources on systematic reviews to engineering education and other developing interdisciplinary fields. Scope/Method: This article is primarily a narrative review of the literature on conducting systematic reviews. Methods are adapted to engineering education and similar developing interdisciplinary fields. To offer concrete, pertinent examples, we also conducted a systematic review of systematic review articles published on engineering education topics since 1990. Fourteen exemplars are presented in this article and used to illustrate systematic review procedures. Conclusions: Systematic reviews can benefit the field of engineering education by synthesizing prior work, by better informing practice, and by identifying important new directions for research. Engineering education researchers should consider including systematic reviews in their repertoire of methodologies.

AB  - Scientific reasoning and scientific argumentation are highly valued outcomes of K-12 and higher education. In this article, we first review main topics and key findings of three different strands of research, namely research on the development of scientific reasoning, research on scientific argumentation, and research on approaches to support scientific reasoning and argumentation. Building on these findings, we outline current research deficits and address five aspects that exemplify where and how research on scientific reasoning and argumentation needs to be expanded. In particular, we suggest to ground future research in a conceptual framework with three epistemic modes (advancing theory building about natural and social phenomena, artefact-centred scientific reasoning, and science-based reasoning in practice) and eight epistemic activities (problem identification, questioning, hypothesis generation, construction and redesign of artefacts, evidence generation, evidence evaluation, drawing conclusions as well as communicating and scrutinizing scientific reasoning and its results). We further propose addressing the domain specificities and domain generalities of scientific reasoning and argumentation as well as approaches for facilitation. Finally, we argue for investigating the role of epistemic emotions, the role of the social context, and the influence of digital technologies on scientific reasoning and argumentation.

AB  - In the opening credits of the television cult classic "Iron Chef," Chairman Kaga takes a huge bite out of a big yellow bell pepper. With the ensuing smirk on his face, he introduces the famous "Kitchen Stadium," which he notes is his "dream in a form never seen before." What follows is a learning experience in which three chefs with different specializations engage in a timed cooking competition focused on a specific theme ingredient. In this paper that was originally presented in a plenary session at the 2013 Association of Interdisciplinary Studies Conference in Oxford, Ohio, the author extends the Kitchen Stadium metaphor and draws upon the work of Marcia Baxter Magolda and Robert Kegan as well as other interdisciplinary scholars to discuss the challenges and joys of interdisciplinary education and to advance a call for a more developmental approach to interdisciplinary teaching and learning.

AB  - In this comment, I first highlight the contributions of Robinson-Cimpian, Lubienski, Ganley, and Copur-Gencturk (2014) in particular and a more interdisciplinary approach in general for the subdiscipline of developmental psychology. Second, I identify some historic methodological foci of psychology and encourage Robinson-Cimpian et al. to consider these possibilities. Finally, I end with my perception that the emerging subdiscipline of developmental methodology can provide a common context for interdisciplinary dialogue in developmental science.

AB  - This Practice Brief describes a grant-funded pilot program at an urban four-year public college, developed to address the needs of students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). This Interdisciplinary Collaborative Support Services program provided (1) more clinical assistance for students with ASD to promote their academic and social success; (2) education, training, and supervision for graduate student mentors; (3) in-service training for faculty, staff, students, and administrators; and (4) a resource library related to the target population. This article describes the work among the different program partners to offer interdisciplinary, collaborative services for the students who elected to participate in the initiative and reports both the positive outcomes and challenges of the program. This article concludes with suggestions for expansion of the practice and research opportunities on the efficacy of the model.

AB  - In order to meet the South Dakota Board of Regents requirements for an upper level writing course with global perspective for all graduates, the administration at the University of South Dakota established an interdisciplinary course to be taken by all majors. Two faculty members from different disciplines were assigned to teach each section with support from an English Ph.D. student. The institution built an active learning classroom for 18 teams of 6 students taught simultaneously in each section. However, after only four semesters, the administration canceled the course. In this article, we offer an analysis of this situation and suggest lessons learned, both positive and negative, during the development, implementation, and redesign of this interdisciplinary course.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity is a pervasive trend in 21st-century knowledge building and innovation. It is predicated on the recognition that creative solutions to the world's increasingly complex problems require the intersection of diverse expertise. Little scholarly attention has been directed towards how the new interdisciplinary (ID) model is influencing the processes and outcomes of graduate research training. In a qualitative study informed by critical narrative analysis and conducted at one institution, we investigate the epistemological, structural, and relational factors that shape ID doctoral research supervision, explore how differing knowledge cultures and values are negotiated in supervisory practices, and consider how established structures and discourses influence the processes and outcomes of these supervisory relationships.

AB  - The integration of co-teaching across disciplines in higher education is an approach that enhances the learning experience for both students and faculty. The process of examining material from the perspective of two disciplines contributes to critical thinking skills beyond traditional pedagogical approaches. This article presents a model for interdisciplinary co-teaching based on the authors' experience with an undergraduate course titled Children and Violence. The course Children and Violence evolved out of the professors' shared interest and professional experiences working on issues of childhood violence. Children and Violence was designed to encourage students to grapple with the complex issues that contribute to children becoming victims of violence or perpetrators of violence (or in some cases, both). The course was created using the criminal justice and psychology disciplines because these fields naturally interface when addressing the subject of child maltreatment and youth violence. A major purpose of the course was to examine the societal problem of children and violence from a critical multidisciplinary perspective. This paper will review the development of this course, as well as present suggestions for best practices for interdisciplinary co-teaching.

AB  - In response to a request from a campus student organization, faculty from three fields came together to develop and teach an integrated interdisciplinary course on water issues and social activism. This course, "Water as Life, Death, and Power," brought together issues from the fields of anthropology, biology and chemistry to explore water rights, access to clean water, and water treatment methods. Students enrolled in the course developed interdisciplinary projects related to a variety of local and global water issues to present real-world solutions at a university-wide student research showcase. This article reports the assessment outcomes of the course, measuring changes in both interdisciplinary learning and levels of student activism.

AB  - This citation analysis examines the ability of the local collection at the Pennsylvania State University to meet the needs of global and area studies researchers focusing on monographs published by faculty members on Latin American studies in a ten-year period. The study focuses on book use to address the tempting notion that packages and online sources can fully and universally support international and area studies across multiple disciplines. The author assessed the works cited by such criteria as availability at the University Libraries, language, place of publication, age of citation, and online availability. This study could inform collection development decisions and contributes to a general understanding of faculty research trends and the library's role in supporting the research related to Latin America across disciplines and academic units.

AB  - This article covers how an interdisciplinary course was developed using the expertise and resources of a history professor, the history and psychology subject librarians, and the university's writing center. The course, supported by a grant, was aimed at helping students improve their research, information literacy, and writing skills across disciplines. The article discusses the involvement of the partners from the initial planning stages to its conclusion, focusing especially on how the librarians created a library session, course-specific guide, annotated bibliography assignment and grading rubric, and how these were used as opportunities to interact with the students throughout the course. Also covered are research and writing challenges, especially for English-language learner students, and how they were addressed by all the partners. It also discusses how the librarians used this experience to seek out opportunities to create similar collaborations with other instructors, and to strengthen ties with support services on campus.

AB  - The University at Buffalo School of Social Work established the VISA Center (the acronym stands for "vision, integrity, service, and accountability") in collaboration with the school district of Buffalo, New York. With funding from the New York State Education Department, a university on-campus center was set up to serve 30 students at a time who were suspended from middle school for violence, substance abuse, or weapons possession. Students attended a two-week program, provided by an interdisciplinary team of social workers, counselors, and teachers as an alternative to the regular out-of-school suspension. Over a two-year period, the program provided academic and behavioral counseling to 280 sixth to 11th grade students who were compared with a control group of 707 students also suspended during this time frame. The two groups were compared on individual demographic factors (for example, age, race, gender) and outcome measures such as resuspension rates, grades, and survival data (length of time without a suspension). The study also examined school-related variables (for example, school suspension rates, total number of students) to determine their impact on outcome measures.

AB  - Children with mental health disorders are at elevated risk of deleterious academic outcomes. The school, acting as a bridge between home and community, is a key site for identification and intervention with children experiencing mental health distress. Yet survey research has indicated that many teachers and other school staff have limited knowledge of children's mental health and are unprepared to support students in distress. Grounded in collaboration theory, the current study extends previous research by conducting focus groups with both school staff and community mental health center professionals to deepen understanding of how school employees' knowledge of children's mental health influences their ability to recognize and collaboratively support students in distress. Results revealed that many school staff experience challenges in supporting students because of their limited mental health knowledge, particularly in the areas of symptom identification, psychotropic medication, and community mental health services. The identified lack of children's mental health knowledge also contributes to the existence of mental health stigma. In addition, group participants identified training about children's mental health and support from upper-level administration as key needs to increase knowledge and better support students' emotional and educational well-being. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications and recommendations for school social workers.

AB  - Adolescents are considered as a nutritionally vulnerable subgroup because of their alimentary behaviours. Considering that alimentary habits are strongly influenced by knowledge about digestion, an experiment was conducted with aim to determine whether conceptual understanding and functionalization of this knowledge can be improved by the interdisciplinary teaching approach. The experiment encompassed 258 students attending the fourth year of high school. No statistically significant difference in the level of the previously acquired chemistry, biology and physics knowledge concerning digestion between the two groups was determined on the pre-test. Conversely, the students in the experimental group significantly outperformed those in the control group on the post-test that required a deep understanding and the application of knowledge about digestion in solving real-life problems. Therefore, it was concluded that high-school teachers can be advised to apply the interdisciplinary teaching approach in order to improve their students' knowledge about this process.

AB  - This paper describes a multi-disciplinary, project-based course. The course is aimed at providing greater curricular access to applied statistics for students across both divisional and departmental boundaries and includes lecture and laboratory components as well as intensive individualized instructor and peer support. Learning materials and teaching strategies were designed to be structured enough to allow students to consistently move forward with their research projects, yet broad enough to encourage them to creatively and independently explore their questions by actively driving the decisions involved in inquiry. In this way, the support each student receives is dictated by their own research question and the results at each stage of their project. We describe the course around the six recommendations of the ASA-endorsed Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) which foster opportunities for project-based work through an emphasis on the use of real world data, active learning, conceptual understanding rather than memorization, and the use of technology.

AB  - Food insecurity (FI) affects millions of people in the United States and is associated with medical problems, as well as poorer physical and emotional-behavioral adjustment. Failure to thrive is a condition where children fail to gain an appropriate amount of weight, and it can cause long-term effects on cognitive and psychomotor development. While the extent to which FI may contribute to FTT is unclear, FI may contribute both directly through inadequate caloric or nutrient intake and indirectly through increased family stress, parental depression and a chaotic family environment. We present an overview of how FI and FTT may interact, followed by a case study from our multidisciplinary clinic for children with FTT. The importance of screening for FI as well as FTT is discussed. We describe ways for individuals, organizations, and agencies to help reduce the effects of FI in both individuals and their communities.

AB  - Interdisciplinary experiments are being offered in upper-division chemistry laboratory courses in an attempt to encourage students to make a connection between techniques learned in one discipline to affirm chemical principles that form the basis of chemical reactions in another chemistry discipline. A new interdisciplinary experiment is described in which students synthesize bis(lutidine)silver(I) nitrate complexes, where the position of the methyl groups on the pyridine ring varies. The stability of these metal complexes is evaluated as a function of basicity of the ligand by studying the rate of decomposition of the metal complex through isothermal thermogravimetric analysis. An Arrhenius plot is used to determine activation energies for the decomposition reaction, and the data are used to establish the positive correlation between the activation energy with the basicity of the lutidine ligand.

AB  - Transitioning to university can be a daunting endeavour, with student success dependent on a myriad of effects (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). Understanding how to navigate university systems, who to meet, how to get help, how to study, and what goals to set can be hard to grasp (Valle et al., 2003). We provide an overview of the new interdisciplinary foundations course, which piloted in fall 2014, for first-year Faculty of Science students at McMaster University. This course provides a taste of research-based learning (Healey, Jenkins, & Lea, 2014) and develops essential skills that are important for an undergraduate degree and future academic or career plans, exposes students to a wide range of departments and programs in the Faculty of Science, and invites students to reflect on their academic journey and how it may be changing as a result of the course. This customized approach intentionally teaches students how to locate and use institutional resources and the expectations that the institution has of its students, while offering opportunities to create networks of support essential for student success and retention (Kuh, Cruce, Shoup, Kinzie, & Gonyea, 2008), and speaks to a number of considerations highlighted in the literature (e.g., Ambrose, Bridges, DiPietro, Lovett, & Norman, 2010). Other factors considered include balancing the needs of the Faculty, the resources available, and the goals, demands, and interests of the students. In this paper, we describe the course's design, structure and implementation, key components of the course, support from upper-level science students, and preliminary pedagogical results, which assess its impact on and perception by students.

AB  - The notion of interdisciplinarity in higher education raises significant questions about the very nature of knowledge and knowing. Are there fundamental knowledge bases associated with particular disciplines that cannot be understood through interdisciplinary teaching and learning? Or is there a common knowledge base across the disciplines that can be accessed--linguistically and metaphorically--through interdisciplinary teaching and research? These questions are not inconsequential, particularly for faculty members who invest their time and energy in interdisciplinary work. In this article, the authors explore interdisciplinarity in relation to faculty work, especially in terms of pedagogy and scholarship. First, they review the literature on definitions of interdisciplinarity, its applications in higher education, and why this is important in light of traditional faculty reward structures that privilege disciplinary expertise. Second, they present the methods and findings of a case study of how science faculty at one institution developed and managed an interdisciplinary curriculum across their programs. Third, they discuss the implications of innovative curricular efforts that present a challenge to both the traditional departmental separation of the disciplines and conventional faculty reward structures.

AB  - This essay reappropriates the segmentary form of the three works of Agustin Fernandez Mallo's "Nocilla" project ("Nocilla Dream" [2006]; "Nocilla Experience" [2008]; "Nocilla Lab" [2009]) en route to an urban reading of its fragmentary structure. The project's interdisciplinary push, overwhelming incorporation of both scientific and literary/cultural references, and method of collage evoke the shifting flow and complex nature of contemporary urban life. The ubiquity of references to urban communities within the text of "Nocilla" itself suggests connections to work by such figures as Georg Simmel, Walter Benjamin, Louis Wirth, David Harvey, Raymond Williams, Guy Debord, Henri Lefebvre, and Jane Jacobs. Moreover, the present essay's extratextual references, drifting method, and punctuated structure constitute a fitting scholarly tribute to the interdisciplinary approach that Fernandez Mallo has labeled "postpoetic."

AB  - We investigated the hypothesis that interdisciplinarity is being explicitly taught behind the facade of traditional disciplines. We interviewed 14 academics (seven geographers and seven agricultural scientists) about their teaching in the inherently interdisciplinary field of natural resource management. Our teachers were generally well informed about interdisciplinarity, believed it is important in a natural resource management degree, and participants viewed the traditional discipline-based structure as a major obstacle to collaboration, mostly because of competition between disciplines for student income. Other barriers included the strong rewards of disciplinary specialization, the difficulty of sustaining teaching teams, and other university structures, such as inflexible timetables. We suggest that if institutions with traditional discipline-based structures want to provide students with interdisciplinary opportunities, teachers need to be adequately supported in terms of workload, career rewards and pedagogy.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe the components of a sustainability transdisciplinary education model (STEM), a contemporary approach linking art, science, and community, that were developed to provide university and K-12 students, and society at large shared learning opportunities. The goals and application of the STEM curriculum will be discussed. Design/methodology/approach: The STEM integrates the sciences, arts and aesthetics, and the university with the greater New Britain community, and beyond. Academic areas included geography, environmental science, communication, art history, aesthetics, and teacher education. The transdisciplinary methodology was integrated in a learner-centered design. To achieve a cycle of community engagement regarding sustainability, university students were placed within the greater New Britain community. This included interaction with K-12 urban public schools, the New Britain Museum of American Art (NBMAA), numerous nongovernmental organizations, state and federal governmental elected officials, and the general public. Findings: As a result of the mutual learning implicit in the STEM, all participants expanded each other's understandings of sustainability. Students were learning from instructors, instructors were learning from students, students were learning from students, instructors were learning from instructors, and all were learning and sharing knowledge with the greater community. As a result, all participants gained a deeper and broader understanding about human-environment relationships and how humans impact natural resources. Practical implications: Because the assignments given to the university students were authentic performance tasks embedded in sustainability issues, students developed a broader disposition for thinking and learning and therefore become metacognitive. The STEM emphasized aesthetic education, integrating science and the arts. As a result, the participants developed their ability to connect academic domains of knowledge and creatively address sustainability challenges. Originality/value: The convergence of science, art, and aesthetics enabled the participants to develop a deeper spiritual awareness and understanding of eco-justice for the promotion of a sustainable society. The STEM utilized cultural resources of the university and New Britain community (i.e. institutional members of the NBMAA and The Central Connecticut State University). Students were introduced to the concept of mutual learning with all the communities and organizations involved. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)

AB  - Interdisciplinary exploration is vital to education in the 21st century. This manuscript outlines an innovative laboratory-based teaching method that combines elements of biochemistry/molecular biology, kinesiology/health science, computer science, and manufacturing engineering to give students the ability to better conceptualize complex biological systems. Here, we utilize technology available at most universities to print three-dimensional (3D) scale models of actual human muscle cells (myofibers) out of bioplastic materials. The same methodological approach could be applied to nearly any cell type or molecular structure. This advancement is significant because historically, two-dimensional (2D) myocellular images have proven insufficient for detailed analysis of organelle organization and morphology. 3D imaging fills this void by providing accurate and quantifiable myofiber structural data. Manipulating tangible 3D models combats 2D limitation and gives students new perspectives and alternative learning experiences that may assist their understanding. This approach also exposes learners to 1) human muscle cell extraction and isolation, 2) targeted fluorescence labeling, 3) confocal microscopy, 4) image processing (via open-source software), and 5) 3D printing bioplastic scale-models (×500 larger than the actual cells). Creating these physical models may further student's interest in the invisible world of molecular and cellular biology. Furthermore, this interdisciplinary laboratory project gives instructors of all biological disciplines a new teaching tool to foster integrative thinking.

AB  - A special topics course combining two relevant and contemporary themes (forensic DNA analysis and illicit drug detection) was developed to stimulate student enthusiasm and enhance understanding of forensic science. Building on the interest of popular television shows such as "CSI" and "Breaking Bad," this course connects essential concepts in biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, organic chemistry, and general chemistry with criminal justice studies to kindle student interest using the forensic science theme. Available to students in criminal justice or natural science majors, the forensic science theme is the focus as students participate in interdisciplinary activities and discussions while exploring fundamental principles used to solve crimes. Requiring critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, the collaboration of students of different academic focus leads to the debunking of myths surrounding both police and forensic scientists, while developing an awareness of how law enforcement and scientists work together in reality.

AB  - This study examines what the members of an interdisciplinary research alliance, at the intersection of Engineering and Education Ethnography, learned through ongoing dialogues among members (2012-2014). The analyses make visible how, and for what purpose(s), this interdisciplinary "research alliance" was constructed, including the theoretical/conceptual roots of perspectives guiding the members of the alliance, and how these orienting perspectives served as anchors for exploring points where differences in understandings became visible to members. By tracing responses that members had to differences in understandings, we examine how the differences became resources for members to (re)examine their initial assumptions and understandings of particular teaching-learning processes, and how these differences supported members, individually and collectively, in extending and (re)formulating their understandings of the relationship between and among teaching and learning processes that constituted "no distance education" processes. Through the presentation of three "telling cases", we make visible how the dialogues led to different levels of ethnographic analysis (cases 1 and 2). Each was undertaken to develop an understanding of what counted as the "no distance education" process, both at the design and institutional level across national institutions as well as in the course across times and events. The third telling case explores transformations in understanding particular aspects of teaching-learning relationships that the members reported were related to the ongoing dialogues and ethnographic research.

AB  - Crowded curriculums and restrictive program requirements often mean that comprehensive media literacy education is impractical at the university level, and that media literacy competencies can be addressed only in the form of narrowly focused lessons integrated into existing classes. This study considers the extent to which such limited lessons can lead to the development of broader, well-rounded media literacy competencies. Data gathered from a quasi-experiment involving 118 participants suggests that narrowly focused media lessons can be used to encourage the development of broader media literacy competencies, but that focused instruction remains necessary as well.

AB  - In recent years, an increasing number of research projects have been dedicated to competency assessment not only in school and vocational education, but also in higher education (Blömeke, Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia, Kuhn, & Fege, 2013). Compared to competency assessment in schools, competency assessment in higher education still is under-researched. The focus of this journal issue is on interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers, projects, and institutions on a national and a cross-national level. The authors draw examples especially from the KoKoHs program, which includes 70 collaboratively organized projects at approximately 50 institutions of higher education in Germany and Austria (Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia, Kuhn, & Toepper, 2014). The collaborative project alliances bring together higher education teachers and researchers from specific fields of study, as well as experts of teaching methodology, survey design, psychometrics, translation, media production, and many other fields. Moreover, KoKoHs project teams cooperate with international experts of teaching methodology, test development, and psychometrics from universities and testing institutes in 20 countries (e.g., the United States, Australia, and Japan). Altogether, the articles in this issue illustrate the importance of research on domain-specific and generic knowledge and skills acquired in various teaching-and-learning environments within social and institutional contexts of higher education.

AB  - The Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter (LRSM), University of Pennsylvania, was built in 1965 as part of the Advanced Research Projects Agency's (ARPA) Interdisciplinary Laboratories (IDL) program intended to foster interdisciplinary research and training in materials science. The process that led to the construction of the four-story structure served as the focus of intense debates over the meaning and process of interdisciplinary research in universities. The location of the building, its size, internal design, and functionalities were all subject to heated negotiations among patrons, scientists, and university administrators, to find the proper place of interdisciplinary materials science on the University of Pennsylvania's campus. Building on the recent work on laboratory architecture, this paper argues that the negotiations and controversies over the LRSM building were concrete representations of the broader struggle over the appropriate place of interdisciplinary research and training within a university.

AB  - Background and purpose: The purpose of this exploratory case study is to describe how scholars negotiated disciplinary divides to develop and communicate to their students an understanding of the basic features of scientific knowledge. Our goals were to examine boundary crossing in interdisciplinary collaboration and to assess the efficacy of adding science content to an introductory Women's Studies course. Sample: We studied a collaboration between faculty in Biology and Women's Studies and evaluated science modules in a Women's Studies course at a regional four-year university in the Midwestern USA. The study included 186 student participants over three semesters and four faculty from Philosophy, Women's Studies and Biology. Design and method: Women's Studies and Biology faculty collaborated to design and implement science content learning modules that included the case of women and science in an introductory Women's Studies course. Qualitative data collected from faculty participants in the form of peer debrief sessions and narrative reflections were used to examine the process of interdisciplinary collaboration. Students exposed to curriculum changes were administered pre- and post-lesson surveys to evaluate their understanding of issues faced by women in science careers, the nature of science, and interest in science studies. Data from collaborators, student journal reflections, and pre-/post-lesson surveys were considered together in an evaluation of how knowledge of science was understood and taught in a Women's Studies course over a longitudinal study of three semesters. Results: We found evidence of discipline-based challenges to interdisciplinarity and disciplinary boundary crossing among collaborators. Three themes emerged from our collaboration: challenges posed by disciplinary differences, creation of a space for interdisciplinary work, and evidence of boundary crossing. Student participants exhibited more prior knowledge of Women's Studies content than nature of science but showed learning in the areas of scientific literacy and the understanding of issues related to women in science careers. Student understanding of science content was enhanced by the participation of a woman scientist in the learning module. Conclusion: This case study illustrates how creating an inclusive space for interdisciplinary collaboration led to successful curriculum transformation and academic boundary crossing by faculty participants. Success is evident in the legacy of interdisciplinarity in the curriculum and learning gains by students. Use of a feminist science studies framework was successful at helping students learn about the influence of values on science and the tentative nature of scientific conclusions. It was less successful in teaching the distinction between science and other ways of knowing and the conception that science is an evidence-based approach to understanding the natural world. This study highlights the importance of interdisciplinary teams of faculty members collaborating to help students learn about science by modeling that there are multiple ways of knowing.

AB  - Work integrated learning (WIL) units can be discipline specific and constructed for majors or degrees with a strong vocational orientation. This paper describes an undergraduate unit with its genesis in a public relations internship. The original unit enjoyed strong support from industry partners and was instrumental in many graduates securing employment. The school owning the public relations major also offers other majors and degrees and sought to capture the eagerness of students to engage in workplace participation, but against an institutional imperative to consolidate teaching activities The challenge was to create sufficient universality without diluting the success enjoyed by the PR internship program or detracting from the need for effective WIL outcomes. The result was a set of processes, assessments and management practices that could be efficiently and readily adopted by any participating discipline. The unit could run every semester and separate disciplines could opt in or out. Efficiencies were to be optimized while still delivering the outcomes desired by students, industry partners, and the academics involved.

AB  - One of the greatest challenges facing social science and marketing programs in the start of the 21st century is how to "globalize" our curriculums, so that our tech-savvy, but often internationally and cross-culturally inexperienced students have, understand, and are prepared to embrace the diverse opportunities that will be an increasing part of their futures. This article presents the work of two professors from Marketing and Political Science disciplines, who developed a cross-disciplinary course addressing lessons of macro and micro political economy and marketing strategies, in an in-classroom setting, with an optional international experience.

AB  - In its 10th anniversary issue, "The Chronicle Review" asked a number of scholars to identify the "Defining Idea of the Next Decade." One nominee: the movement to abandon the disciplines in order "to meet the scholarly and public challenges educators face" (Ecklund, 2010). In Elaine Ecklund's perspective, it is only through interdisciplinary research that people will find answers to pressing questions such as how to battle cancer, combat environmental devastation, and understand religion. The authors conducted a study of this five-year, $20 million interdisciplinary research collaboration, which incorporated more than 25 disciplines across the natural sciences, social sciences, engineering, humanities, and professional fields. In the process, they learned that there are five key questions that administrators, faculty, and students should ask before embarking on such collaborations: Do you have the time, the people, the resources, the structures, and the supportive departments that are needed to enable interdisciplinary work? These are the essential conditions for such work to succeed.

AB  - Engaging with the quilts of Gee's Bend offers a rich opportunity for students in grades four through eight to develop appreciation for pattern, rhythm, and innovation while learning about history, entrepreneurship, and political activism. By easily accessing print, film, and Internet resources teachers can include these vibrant quilts and quiltmakers in the art classroom for study. This Instructional Resource draws inspiration from several of the Gee's Bend quilts and encourages close examination and thoughtful visual and verbal responses by students. Two interdisciplinary engagements building on students' experiences viewing the quilts and learning about the historical and contemporary context of Gee's Bend are presented in this article.

AB  - This article will demonstrate that practice-led photographic research offers an example of dialogical encounter. Through recourse to an outline of my own practice and the experience of completing a practice-led doctoral thesis, the article will account for photographic practice and interdisciplinary research in terms of dialogism. This will demonstrate that visual research is a productive nexus: it does not simply concern itself with the products of creative practice, but is a generative space itself. The article will also discuss interdisciplinarity from a personal perspective on practice-led research, which, over time, has developed into an interdisciplinary mode of working. The radical notion of the dialogical self will be considered with specific reference to interdisciplinarity and practice-led research. The dialogical encounter will also be considered in relation to transformative learning encounters and what is at play in learning through practice, an encounter which places its protagonists at risk. However, far from being a negative state of affairs, this interstitial space in which the researcher/learner/teacher is lost and found is in fact a highly productive place in which to be.

AB  - Scholars and teachers have long struggled to respond to the growing demand for interdisciplinary approaches to complex social issues. They come to the table with their own disciplinary perspectives (scholars more rigidly than students, perhaps), but they also recognize the limitations of investigating social issues through a single disciplinary lens. They have learned, in short, that it is not sufficient to approach the pressing issues from just one perspective. Colleges and universities across the United States have acknowledged the benefits of interdisciplinary scholarship. Higher education is shifting its emphasis from mastery and expertise in a particular discipline to dialogue, interaction, and process across disciplines. Nonetheless, many in the academy and beyond still wonder how to engage in interdisciplinary study in a productive way. Those at Wesleyan University have not yet dealt with all of the nuances of framing a dynamic interdisciplinary curriculum that must, given its roots in social concerns, evolve quickly as times change. But the authors think that their new College of the Environment and its associated think tank offer one template for supporting flexible interdisciplinary education and scholarship. The college brings students and scholars together to address any number of social issues spanning multiple disciplines, building on existing university departments. A linked major lies at its core: every student majoring in environmental studies must merge this interest with a primary major from another, perhaps more traditional, department. Students explore the depths of particular fields through their primary departments, but they also explore the boundaries of their disciplines through their interdisciplinary experiences in environmental studies. Put another way, the primary major provides the scholarly depth students need to understand the rigorous standards of a discipline while the linked environmental studies major provides a broader context for integrating knowledge across disciplines and developing new ways of thinking. The College of the Environment at Wesleyan was formed with the recognition that members of the academy need new ways to ask questions and pursue knowledge about environmental decision making and its consequences. The college's framework promotes interdisciplinary scholarship from the outset, but it achieves this goal without sacrificing sources of traditional strength. The authors think the college can produce graduates who are able to integrate ideas and help solve complex issues that know no disciplinary boundary.

AB  - The Internet, which has made information ubiquitous and seemingly infinite, has transformed education. Universities are challenged to educate students to navigate and evaluate critically the undifferentiated information of the Internet so that students gain the ability to transform it into knowledge. To better understand the effects of taking a First-Year Seminar we examined the types of research resources students consulted before and after taking an interdisciplinary graded for-credit First-Year Seminar at a midsize comprehensive public university in Canada. We analyzed 2,576 anonymous questionnaires collected across 102 first-year seminars. After completing a first-year seminar, students consulted more reliable and scholarly resources, irrespective of the semester of enrollment. Generally, there were some improvements noted between first and second semester students. However, comparisons between students who had just completed a seminar in semester one with students who were about to begin a seminar in semester two, reveal that the improved results are not solely attributable to the normal transition and maturation process experienced by students in their first semester of university.

AB  - Interdisciplinary teaching has been advocated as a means to foster cooperation between traditionally separate fields and broaden students' perspectives in the classroom. We explored the pedagogical difficulties of interdisciplinary team teaching through a first-year seminar in magic, religion, and the origins of science. Although many accounts in the literature suggest a more cohesive approach to interdisciplinary teaching, we first introduced the separate fields, their methodologies, and limitations before combining the insights from all three fields to analyze case studies relating to the main themes of the course. In this case study, we reflect on how this "pieces-to-picture" method reduced student confusion when confronted with several disciplines in our classroom.

AB  - This article describes findings and evolution of a teacher-training program based on a partnership of knowledge domains (technology, content, and pedagogy), teaching staff (college faculty and school teachers), educational institutions (colleges and K-12), and local communities (urban and suburban). Within 5 years, more than 180 teachers from 15 secondary schools attended a 3-tier summer institute and follow-up activities. Summer trainees were offered stipends, laptop computers, advanced graphing calculators, smart boards, LCD projectors, mentorship, and technical support during the academic year. While teachers were initially frustrated to learn outside their subject areas, they all completed the initial workshop and more than half returned in subsequent years for advance and expert level training. External evaluators collected data and conducted longitudinal analysis of performance indicators for teaching quality and student learning. Teachers reported increased level of student engagement in and comprehension of mathematics and science topics. Graduation rates and student achievement scores in partnering school districts increased noticeably during the initiative. Comparison of target and control groups showed that treatment students consistently outperformed non-treatment students.

AB  - Interdisciplinary problem-based learning (PBL) aims to provide students with opportunities to develop the necessary skills to work with different health professionals in a collaborative manner. This discourse study examined the processes of collective knowledge construction in Japanese students in the tutorials. Analyses of video-recorded data elicited from three multidisciplinary cohorts and their learning portfolios provided insights into their participation and introspection during the discussions. The results indicate there were two patterns of knowledge construction: (a) co-constructions between students from different disciplines and (b) elaborations between students from the same discipline. Their learning processes were mediated by their cultural assumptions, professional identities, understanding of other professionals, and perceptions of collaborative learning. The finding suggests that interdisciplinary PBL has the potential to enhance students' collaborative learning skills, and students' participation is situated within a cultural context.

AB  - Current literature about interdisciplinary education research is focused on three points: conceptual definitions of interdisciplinarity, the need for interdisciplinary research to tackle the advent of problem-based research and the positive curriculum outcomes to be gained from interdisciplinary research. While this research is important, it does not always include an account of the often complex and politicised interactions that might affect the outcomes of interdisciplinary research groups. This paper provides one possible "roadmap" for successful interdisciplinary collaboration. It is based on a reflective case study of the authors' own formation of an interdisciplinary research group and the practical resolutions to both the theoretical and the practical issues involved in achieving interdisciplinarity in education research.

AB  - Because educational research has grown more global in nature over the course of the last few decades, researchers find themselves questioning how best to conceptualize content and establish distinct levels in educational research. Globalization has exacerbated the need to rethink culture and context, to understand how and why similar content are, for cultural reasons, interpreted and received differently. The symposium on "Rethinking Culture, Context, and Comparison in Education and Development" brought together several groups of noted scholars to discuss the issues of this phenomenon. Of those groups of scholars, author Gita Steiner-Khamsi sets her focus on two: those that utilize a disciplinary lens versus those that apply an interdisciplinary, or rather multidisciplinary approach to the comparative inquiry of education. Steiner-Khamsi begins this essay by dismissing the dichotomy between anthropology and comparative education as a false juxtaposition and proposes instead a reflection on the disciplinary versus the multidisciplinary approach to the comparative study of education. In this ongoing discussion, she argues that the method of comparison strongly relies on an interdisciplinary approach in order to understand and generalize findings on similarities and differences between educational practices, beliefs, and systems.

AB  - College science education needs to foster students' habit of mind beyond disciplinary constraints. However, little research has been devoted to assessing students' interdisciplinary understanding. To address this problem, we formed a team of experts from different disciplines to develop interdisciplinary assessments that target introductory college-level science. We started our project by focusing on osmosis, a topic that involves knowledge from multiple science disciplines. We developed an instrument focusing on this topic and administered it to 3 classes of college students. A Rasch partial credit analysis showed that the items demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties. The findings also revealed the differences between student's disciplinary and interdisciplinary understanding. The educational implications of the study were discussed.

AB  - It is generally agreed that price discrimination can, in some circumstances at least, be an extraordinarily unpopular business practice. In late 2000, customers discovered that Amazon.com was varying its prices online for the exact same products. Although the incident is almost fifteen years old, it has become the standard reference in law review and business literature on the risks of consumer price discrimination. This article uses the Amazon.com story as a launching point for a hypothetical case study on the subject of consumer price discrimination. Both the substantive topic and the teaching methods employed by this case study should be of significant value to both undergraduate and graduate business students. In terms of teaching methods, the advantages of using case studies in the legal studies classroom have been fairly well established in the literature. The body of this article aims to provide the basic legal, ethical, and economic background necessary for instructors to introduce the rich topic of consumer price discrimination into the business school classroom. Part 2 gives some background on the economics of price discrimination so that the instructor is fully equipped to explain what price discrimination means, why firms engage in this practice, as well as some of the real-world limits on its use. Part 3 addresses the legality of consumer price discrimination and explains why price discrimination against end-use consumers will usually be legal under the Robinson-Patman Act. Part 4 touches on some of the ethical issues raised by consumer price discrimination. Throughout the article, there are discussion questions that instructors can use to stimulate discussion on the major legal, ethical, and business points raised by the case study; these questions can be assigned as homework prior to class or can be integrated into the class discussion, depending on the instructor's preferences. The hypothetical Gargantuan.com case study, which includes a transcript of a meeting between a consulting firm and a potential client and an excerpt of the relevant law, is contained as an appendix to this article.

AB  - This article examines the use of interdisciplinary project co-design, as a mechanism for increasing the capacity of a school and promoting the growth of teachers' professional practice in an urban high school setting. Changing teaching practices and the professional culture within a school can be extremely difficult. Simply providing resources about novel strategies can be ineffective. In fact, in some school cultures, suggestions for classroom practice change can be received with hostility, being viewed by some teachers as acts questioning their professional competence. This study describes how a strategically chosen task, interdisciplinary project co-design, was used by external technical assistance providers as a productive, non-threatening mechanism for instructional improvement, by simultaneously enhancing classroom practices and cultivating the growth of teacher collaborative practices.

Analysis of a unique case study involving a teacher candidate with traumatic brain injury illustrates the inequities of the traditional concern conference method to addressing problems in the field. Authors propose a transdisciplinary team model as a more inclusive approach to capitalising on the strengths of teacher candidates.

AB  - In this article we describe the challenges of transdisciplinary teamwork involving four faculty members from dissimilar epistemological traditions in the process of developing a manuscript on the lessons learned in our teaching collaboration. Our difficulty originated in implicit mental models and assumptions that caused incongruence between our intent to collaborate and the (habituated) relationship structure of the partnership. The dynamics are described through the lens of Tannenbaum and Schmidt's leadership model and Aristotle's causality. We suggest that successful collaboration necessitates careful attention to the process of establishing the collaboration, its structure, and the metacognitive capacities to see one's own thinking, suspend one's epistemic beliefs, and engage in productive dialogue around conflict.

AB  - College and university educators seek to increase student engagement in learning content, skills, and applications. To achieve this goal, we used transformative teaching techniques in the design of a World Challenge: a two-week, group-based, reflective course for sophomores leading their own learning in developing creative solutions to the problem of Health, Hunger, and Humanity. Through indirect guidance by faculty members from multiple disciplines, students led their own learning in small groups to research this global problem and develop local solutions. Given the breadth of the course objectives ranging from applying content to teamwork and productivity, we used a variety of assessment tools: pretest/posttest, rubrics, questionnaires, focus groups, peer assessments, and self-reflections. The data documented increases in content knowledge, and provided formative and summative feedback on engagement and satisfaction to the core faculty members. Student comments at the end of the course suggest the intensive experience was indeed transformative.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the role and responsibilities of Norwegian kindergarten (i.e., preschool for ages 0-6 years) from the perspective of participants involved in multidisciplinary collaboration on behalf of children with severe disabilities and their families. The authors employed a multiple-case study approach comprising 26 interviews across six cases. Findings suggest that kindergarten is considered an important partner for families and a major contributor to the provision of services. Kindergartens were valued for their (1) close relationships and intimate knowledge of children as individuals, (2) the sense of security and relief of stress that they provided to parents, and (3) for acting as a "driving force" in multidisciplinary collaboration. Findings are discussed in relation to two contrasting views of the kindergarten professional as an early childhood expert and as a compassionate caregiver who, in many ways, functions as an extension of the parental role. The authors conclude that it is the latter of these two perspectives that dominates perceptions of kindergarten professionals among participants.

Algorithms for the assessment and treatment of SIB in this context, respectively, from a multidisciplinary, integrative perspective are proposed and challenges and opportunities that exist in clinical and research settings are discussed.

AB  - Against a background of increasing inequality and its impact at various levels on childhood and family life, of the growing societal significance and uptake of extra-familial childcare provision, and of social policy goals emphasising participation and education for all, the early childhood education and care (ECEC) sector in Germany is facing new and heightened challenges. This article presents and analyses current and empirically observable changes in society. It comes to the conclusion that ECEC needs to be more strongly viewed as an interdisciplinary challenge, and that ways forward need to include a comprehensive professionalisation and workforce development project: the aim must be to provide children and families with care and support services tailored both quantitatively and qualitatively to their needs, thereby offering not only support to facilitate the reconciliation of work and family obligations and an alternative place of education for children, but also programmes of specific support for disadvantaged and support-dependent children and families.

AB  - The authors of this article suggest a thesis about the purpose of teaching a foreign language--it is student's communicative activities, i.e. learning a foreign language in practice. The teacher's task is to encourage activities of every student and to create situations to develop their creative activities in a learning process. New information technologies streamline and diversify the learning process and, at the same time, open up good prospects to expand the educational framework and undoubtedly bring an incredible motivational drive and promote the principles of individualization of learning. At the current stage of development, the educational system tends to gradually shift towards learner-centered cooperation where a learner plays an active role. Non-standard technologies, encouragement of teacher's creative pursuit and professional advancement, and implementation of innovations proved to be useful in the learning and educational process.

AB  - This paper describes a case study of an innovative approach to teaching at an engineering school. The postgraduate course "Project Work and Communication in Research and Development (R&D)" was developed at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of the University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia. The main aim of the course was to make the entry of young engineering graduates into the business environment as easy as possible. Currently, engineers are facing more and more interdisciplinarity and project work in their daily assignments. The course was designed to remedy any deficiencies in the multidisciplinary professional skills and knowledge of the graduate-level students, and it covered the topics of innovation management, communication in R&D, project management, and problem solving in teams. An end-of-course survey showed positive feedback from participating students. The empirical data (enrollment ratio of students, session attendance ratio, and average student grade) proves that the course met its goal of honing the professional skills of postgraduate engineering students.

AB  - Multidisciplinary projects involving electrical engineering (EE), mechanical engineering (ME), and computer engineering (CE) students are both exciting and difficult to conceptualize. Answering this challenge, this paper presents a multidisciplinary educational platform on radio frequency identification-based assistive devices. The combination of software, hardware, circuit, and mechanical design makes this platform an excellent choice for undergraduate student projects and curriculum development. Through working on these multidisciplinary projects, students will be able to study a complex engineering and technology system that: a) exposes them to applied and cutting-edge technologies, b) encourages them to participate in an integrated, multidisciplinary curriculum, and c) trains them in methods of applied technology and the skills necessary to transition from academic to professional environments.

AB  - Introductory statistics needs innovative, evidence-based teaching practices that support and engage diverse students. To evaluate the success of a multidisciplinary, project-based course, we compared experiences of under-represented (URM) and non-underrepresented students in 4 years of the course. While URM students considered the material more difficult than non-URM students, URM students demonstrated similar levels of increased confidence in applied skills and interest in follow up courses as non-URM students. URM students were found to be twice as likely as non- URM students to report that their interest in conducting research increased. Increasing student confidence and interest gives all students a welcoming place at the table that will afford the best hope for achieving the kind of statistical literacy necessary for interdisciplinary research.

AB  - This article discusses problems of reconstructing the recent development in the field of empirical research on education ("empirische Bildungsforschung"), especially problems resulting from its interdisciplinary character, its divergent institutional contexts and its multimethod approach. The article looks at the position of various disciplines--in particular, science of education ("Erziehungswissenschaft") and educational psychology--involved in research on education as an interdisciplinary field of study. Compared to previous times, important shifts concerning the relation between these two disciplines can currently be observed. The argument is about the notion of competence, about the right to define success criteria and about resources. Finally, this discussion focusing on Germany is then placed in the wider context of different cognitive and institutional forms of doing and organizing education studies and research in different countries.

AB  - Despite the increasing interests and practices in interdisciplinary science education, little research has been documented to develop effective assessments targeting students' interdisciplinary learning. In response to this gap, a team of scientists and educators developed an interdisciplinary assessment instrument targeting osmosis, which was chosen because it involves concepts from multiple disciplines and was identified as one of the most important topics by college instructors from different disciplines.

AB  - The increasing interdisciplinarity of scientific research creates both challenges and opportunities for librarians. The liaison model may be inadequate for supporting campus research that represents multiple disciplines and geographically dispersed departments. The identification of units, researchers, and projects is a first step in planning and providing support for research and publication. The proposed research audit model seeks to inventory research projects and personnel for interdisciplinary biomedical research using a relational database. The innovative use of a discipline-specific ontology as descriptive metadata holds promise for revealing connections that might not otherwise be discovered.

AB  - Mathematics plays a crucial role in physics. This role is brought about predominantly through the building, employment, and assessment of mathematical models, and teachers and educators should capture this relationship in the classroom in an effort to improve students' achievement and attitude in both physics and mathematics. But although there are overwhelming amounts of literature on modeling in science and mathematics education, the interdisciplinary position is seldom addressed explicitly. Furthermore, there has been a striking lack of exposure of the question of how future teachers, who are largely educated in a mono-disciplinary fashion, can best become equipped to introduce genuinely interdisciplinary teaching activities to their future pupils. This paper presents some preliminary reflections upon a graduate course, which aims to prepare future physics and mathematics teachers for interdisciplinary teaching, and which has been designed on the basis of influential theoretical expositions of the concept of interdisciplinarity.

AB  - The meaning of the term energy varies widely in scientific and colloquial discourse. Teasing apart the different connotations of the term can be especially challenging for non-science majors. In this study, undergraduate students taking an interdisciplinary, general science course (n?=?49) were asked to explain the role of energy in five contexts: radiation, transportation, generating electricity, earthquakes, and the big bang theory. The responses were qualitatively analyzed under the framework of conceptual metaphor theory. This study presents evidence that non-science major students spontaneously use metaphorical language that is consistent with the conceptual metaphors of energy previously identified in the discourse of students in introductory physics, biology, and chemistry courses. Furthermore, most students used multiple coherent metaphors to explain the role of energy in these complex topics. This demonstrates that these conceptual metaphors for energy have broader applicability than just traditional scientific contexts. Implications for this work as a formative assessment tool in instruction will also be discussed.

AB  - Palliative care is a complex area of healthcare best delivered by an interdisciplinary team approach. Breaking bad news is an inherent part of caring for people with life-limiting conditions. This study aims to explore an interdisciplinary breaking bad news role-play in a palliative care module. Participants were undergraduate medical and nursing students. Qualitative data from focus groups, student and facilitator feedback and a role-play recording were thematically analysed. The findings revealed that the role-play led to increased understanding of and changes in attitudes towards key palliative care principles, interdisciplinary teamwork, and communication of bad news. There was evidence of increased self-awareness. Findings suggest that the interdisciplinary breaking bad news role-play was a rich integrative learning experience valued by students.

AB  - This article discusses the role of the hybrid field of law education and its status in South Africa. The authors suggest that, in their consideration of education law, it should be understood as the particular collection of legal rules that regulate all activities and relationships in education. These legal rules as applied in education are derived from various sources such as legislation, common law and case law. Herein they discuss why education law research is necessary, why it is challenging, and the need for globally competent education law researchers. After a review of the current status of training and research in education law in South Africa, the authors suggest a target group for the development of globally competent education law researchers and offer a development strategy for training educationists as law education researchers in this area.

AB  - Increasing complexity is one of the most pertinent issues when discussing the role and future of design, designers and their education. The evolving nature of digital media technology has resulted in a profession in a state of flux with increasingly complex communication and design problems. The ability to collaborate and interact with other disciplines has recently been strongly articulated as an imperative skill for the future designer. How the education of such a designer is facilitated in practice is less well defined. The implementation of authentic problem-solving processes that introduce design students to workplace realities is often missing in design education. In order to manage the increasing complexities of design problems and technology a learning and teaching approach that facilitates the interaction of multiple disciplines was implemented and trialed over a period of two years in an undergraduate digital media design programme. This approach, known as the POOL model framework, is based on a "pool" of resources and people to be applied as needed when responding to complex design problems. This paper focuses on the extent to which complex interactive design projects can be managed through multidisciplinary collaboration. Feedback from students and educators is presented and which reveals that the framework does provide an opportunity for students to resolve complex design and technological problems and contribute to project outcomes that could not be achieved when working individually.

AB  - Knowledge brokering (KB) may be one approach of helping researchers and decision makers effectively communicate their needs and abilities, and move toward increased use of evidence in health care. A multidisciplinary research team in Nova Scotia, Canada, has created a dedicated KB position with the goal of improving access to quality colorectal cancer care. The purpose of this paper is to provide an in-progress perspective on KB within this large research team. A KB position ("knowledge broker") was created to perform two primary tasks: (1) facilitate ongoing communication among team members; and (2) develop and maintain collaborations between researchers and decision makers to establish partnerships for the transfer and use of research findings. In this article, we discuss our KB model and its implementation, describe the broker's functions and activities, and present preliminary outcomes. The primary functions of the KB position have included: sustaining team members' engagement; harnessing members' expertise and sharing it with others; developing and maintaining communication tools/strategies; and establishing collaborations between team members and other stakeholders working in cancer care. The broker has facilitated an integrated knowledge translation approach to research conduct and led to the development of new collaborations with external stakeholders and other cancer/health services researchers. KB roles will undoubtedly differ across contexts. However, descriptive assessments can help others determine whether such an approach could be valuable for their research programs and, if so, what to expect during the process. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - The National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project "Mathematics, Science, and Technology Partnership" (MSTP) developed a multidisciplinary instructional model for connecting mathematics to science, technology and engineering content areas at the middle school level. Specifically, the model infused mathematics into middle school curriculum through the alignment of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curriculum, creating a mathematics infused curriculum planning template for teachers, and the implementation of connected STEM professional development workshops in middle schools. Through data collected from teachers, administrators, and faculty members involved in these activities, it was found that all involved were satisfied with connected curriculum, STEM teachers were able to successfully increase their own mathematics pedagogy and content knowledge, and students were able to grasp mathematical concepts when they were applied in science, technology, or engineering content areas.

AB  - The Simmons World Challenge is a unique, interdisciplinary program recently developed at Simmons College. It immerses students in an intensive winter-session course that challenges them to tackle a pressing social issue, such as poverty or hunger, and create actionable solutions to the problem. The program was conceived and designed to harness the strengths of pedagogical theories on transformational teaching and learning. This article describes the Simmons World Challenge and presents assessment findings from the program's third iteration in 2013, as well as on the long-term impact of the program based on follow-up assessments with the first two cohorts of students. These assessment findings demonstrate the deep and positive impact of the program on students' engagement with learning, personal growth, academic habits and attitudes, student leadership and initiative, and sense of community at Simmons College.

AB  - The current literature relates to how teachers develop knowledge and practice of science inquiry, but little has been reported on how teachers develop interdisciplinary science inquiry (ISI) knowledge and practice. This study examines the effect of university research experiences, ongoing professional development, and in-school support on teachers' development of ISI pedagogical knowledge and practices. It centers on documenting diverse teachers' journeys of experiencing ISI as well as developing knowledge of ISI. It was found that there was variation in ISI understanding and practice among the teachers as a result of the combination of teachers' experiences, beliefs, and participation. Thus, in order to help teachers develop ISI knowledge and pedagogy, barriers to ISI knowledge development and implementation must also be addressed. Professional developers must articulate clear program goals to all stakeholders including an explicit definition of ISI and the ability to recognize ISI attributes during research experiences as well as during classroom implementation. Teachers must also be held accountable for participation and reflection in all aspects of professional development. Program developers must also take into consideration teachers' needs, attitudes, and beliefs toward their students when expecting changes in teachers' cognition and behavior to teach inquiry-rich challenging science.

AB  - Veterinary medical research traditionally focuses on animal health and wellness; however, research activities at veterinary colleges extend beyond these traditional areas. In this study, we analyzed eleven years of Web of Knowledge-indexed peer-reviewed articles from researchers at the twenty-eight United States American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) accredited veterinary colleges. We had three goals in assessing the published literature of veterinary college researchers. First, we identified a list of journals and research areas outside veterinary medicine in which veterinary researchers publish. This list of journals can be customized to identify those most essential at each institution. Second, we identified collaborative work by veterinary researchers across disciplines and institutions. Using textual analysis tools and visualizations helped us illustrate and clarify these data. Last, we developed a methodology for defining an interdisciplinary serials list outside a subject core that can be customized for specific institutions and subject areas.

AB  - We report on the establishment of communities of practice at four Australian institutions and evaluate their effectiveness and durability as a means of building staff and institutional capacity for interdisciplinary teaching. A community of practice approach is a potentially valuable methodology for overcoming dynamics of fragmentation, isolation and competition within universities. The communities we established were anchored by a shared focus on the topic of climate change and they worked collaboratively to build relationships of trust and reciprocity between teachers in a wide range of disciplines. The aim of each community was to improve the teaching of climate change through enabling members to integrate diverse disciplinary perspectives, to teach collaboratively, to promote innovation through exchange and to demonstrate leadership within their institutions. The key factors that made our communities effective and durable are: (1) designation of two leadership roles, activator and facilitator, (2) provision for institutional autonomy in domesticating the model to fit local circumstances and (3) a pragmatic emphasis on opportunities for teaching innovation and leadership within existing administrative structures, teaching programs and workloads. We conclude that suitably designed and resourced communities of practice are a viable means of improving interdisciplinary teaching of complex problems by facilitating both staff development and institutional learning.

AB  - Throughout history humans have dreamed of a better life. This concept of utopia can be used as a central focus for thematic and interdisciplinary instruction. This approach has three key advantages. First, students recognize that certain themes are consistent across time and place and that realization can lead students to explore their own dreams and how those dreams reflect the realities of their own cultures. Second, this thematic approach encourages interdisciplinary connections among economic and social history, literature, geography, and culture. Finally, students critically analyze a wide variety of primary sources, including songs, prose, poetry, and images. This article outlines utopian dreams of everyday working people from the Middle Ages to the present and presents a variety of student activities related to the utopia theme.

AB  - This study documented the means by which STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) educators experienced the mathematics and science associated with understanding lunar phenomena. The article reports how well STEM education graduate students interacted with projectbased materials as they engaged in interdisciplinary teaching and learning. Research questions pursued were: (a) How will students' spatial mathematics and scientific understandings develop as they engage in a contextualized, technology-rich, project-based environment? and (b) How will the students' group projects affect their understanding of lunar related concepts? A mixedmethods approach was used with this semester-long design study to expose how focused project work facilitated spatial understanding. Significant gains were made on lunar-related concepts that had been previously resistant to conceptual change (lunar motion and effect of lunar phase with location change). An implication of this study suggests that technologies (i.e., Stellarium, online blogging with Australia, and Geometer's Sketchpad) facilitated students' project progress, aided students' understanding of how perspective matters in terms of Earthly sky viewing, and deepened students' understanding on domains that included spatial reasoning.

AB  - We present our case study of an interdisciplinary team project for students taking either a psychology or computer science (CS) course. The project required psychology and CS students to combine their knowledge and skills to create an online cognitive task. Each interdisciplinary project team included two psychology students who conducted library research and drafted a design protocol for the cognitive task and a CS student who created the online version. The teams produced nine applets to test cognitive abilities such as memory and imagery. Our pre-post Interdisciplinary Team Project Survey indicated students gained significant experience working with each other by the end of the semester. Psychology students reported increases in areas such as summarizing data and delivering an oral presentation. CS students reported gains in computer programming. Leadership ratings moved upward for CS students, and psychology students reported greater experience conducting team projects by the end of the semester. CS students experienced some challenges with the interdisciplinary project regarding time management. We offer lessons learned and identify strategies for improving interdisciplinary team projects. An interdisciplinary team project prepares students for the type of work they will find in graduate school or workplace.

AB  - Tour Across America is an interdisciplinary, project-based, multimodal (IPM) activity where students get the opportunity to apply what they learn to a real-life situation while illustrating the interdisciplinary nature of literacy. It provides students with a high-interest, creative platform to review, reinforce, and integrate learned literacy skills and strategies across the content areas. Tour Across America allows students the opportunity to become concert tour managers for a fictional band. This IPM framework is an appropriate supplemental activity for upper elementary through high school language arts classes, regardless of the students' ability levels or socioeconomic status. This article contributes to the research on adolescent literacy in two ways: by demonstrating the importance of using IPM strategies to bridge the gap between in-school literacies and out-of-school literacies, and by providing an activity that is effective and efficient at getting students to become literate across the content areas.

AB  - The cereal box design activity is intriguing both for its simplicity and the resourcefulness that it can generate in young people. Also, it lends itself to a variety of curriculums. It covers both consumerism and Design for the Environment (DfE) concepts broadly and in depth. The activity introduces a wide range of topics. They include graphic design; basic drawing; sketching and rendering; measurement of area, volume, and weight; technical presentation skills; oral and written reports; the technological design process; applied problem solving; marketing; consumer research; eco-packaging; environmental education; recycling; point-of-purchase displays; and considerations of form, function, and aesthetics. Teachers can easily adapt the activity to serve as an interdisciplinary project throughout the school. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - We present two simple, one-dimensional, stochastic models that lead to a qualitative understanding of very complex systems from biology, nanoscience and social sciences. The first model explains the complicated dynamics of microtubules, stochastic cellular highways. Using the theory of random walks in one dimension, we find analytical expressions for certain physical quantities, such as the time dependence of the length of the microtubules, and diffusion coefficients. The second one is a stochastic adsorption model with applications in surface deposition, epidemics and voter systems. We introduce the "empty interval method" and show sample calculations for the time-dependent particle density. These models can serve as an introduction to the field of non-equilibrium statistical physics, and can also be used as a pedagogical tool to exemplify standard statistical physics concepts, such as random walks or the kinetic approach of the master equation.

AB  - To recruit and retain more students in all science disciplines at our small (5,000 student) public university, we implemented an interdisciplinary strategy focusing on nanotechnology and enhanced undergraduate research. Inherently interdisciplinary, the novelty of nanotechnology and its growing career potential appeal to students. To engage students in learning and to keep them engaged, we offer progressively more independent research opportunities with faculty mentors and encourage participation in a robust science learning community that supports students outside the classroom. Activities beginning in the freshman year build connections with faculty members and student peers and foster a growing individual identity as scientists. Since implementing this approach in 2005, a total of 73 students have enrolled and 32 have graduated. Half of the currently enrolled students are biology-chemistry majors and the rest are physics majors. We have significantly increased the number of student publications in peer-reviewed journals. These gains were achieved without sacrificing standards: 32 graduates have earned on average 148 credits and maintained a mean GPA of 3.17, and half have gone on to graduate school.

AB  - As education budgets shrink, art teachers need to find ways to position the study of art closer to mainstream academics by exploring concepts that cut across disciplinary boundaries. Art teachers can challenge students to do serious and thorough research about subject matter partnering with teachers in other areas to select subject matter that is already part of the curriculum or go beyond it for extra credit. Supported by at least two teachers, the students gather both visual and verbal information and make art that is based on a solid grasp of both facts and underlying concepts or big ideas embedded in the research. Any art teacher who strives to link artmaking to the lives and interests of students understands the importance of personal connections. By positioning the study of art alongside mainstream academics, art teachers can partner with teachers in other areas to explore subject matter that is already part of the curriculum, and even expand beyond it. The author discusses how two artists integrated a model for interdisciplinary study with unifying themes in which visual art is the expression of ideas supported by solid research and, conversely, the research is extended by the artmaking. The author shows how research fits into the creative process for the artists, considers some art historical precedents, explores how two artists and a scientist integrate research in other fields with art, and discusses classroom application.

AB  - We report on the experience of creating a socially networked system, the Research-oriented Social Environment (RoSE), for representing knowledge in the form of relationships between people, documents, and groups. Developed as an intercampus, interdisciplinary project of the University of California, this work reflects on a collaboration between scholars in the humanities, software engineering, and information studies by providing an opportunity not only to synthesize different disciplinary perspectives, but also to interrogate and challenge the assumptions each brings to team-based design projects in the digital humanities. This work examines socially networked knowledge as both content and methodology for collaboration, calling for further critique and future investigation of epistemological questions in models of social networks.

AB  - Many major funding organizations, policymakers, government agencies, and other higher education stakeholders want higher education to encourage interdisciplinary learning so that students graduate with the requisite skills to take on complex jobs in science, policy, business, and industry. Calls for this kind of change have been most urgent within the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields; they are key to America's capacity to maintain its global economic position, yet their enrollments have been shrinking in recent years. Studies have demonstrated that students with exposure to interdisciplinary learning experiences tend to be retained as majors, as well as gaining preparation for successful careers and life in the 21st century. Project Kaleidoscope (PKAL) has been looking at systemic ways to create interdisciplinary teaching and learning environments. Like the National Academies report, PKAL thinks that campuses across the country have not created environments hospitable to interdisciplinarity. In this article, the authors highlight research conducted on one of the major projects facilitated by PKAL: Facilitating Interdisciplinary Learning (FIDL), funded by the W.M. Keck foundation. This project is among the largest to examine the facilitation of interdisciplinary learning. The authors report on the lessons learned from this initiative in how to bring interdisciplinary learning to scale. First, they briefly review the institutionalization theory that they used to frame their findings. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - This paper offers an example of how to introduce student-centred knowledge creation and competency development in a systematic way into a master's programme. The curriculum of a new course called Module 9 was framed according to experiential learning theory. While student teams work on self-selected projects, their learning processes are accompanied by workshops and tutorials. As a consequence, practical experience drives students' learning within the applied projects that were implemented in collaboration with local companies. Coding of learning memoranda shows that each team applies each learning mode during the different stages of the projects. While evaluations of the experiences were generally positive, awareness of the learning processes can be increased throughout the course. Reflections include important lessons and improvements for the next cohorts.

AB  - Interdisciplinary collaboration is a cornerstone of WAC/WID efforts and integral to productive relationships between writing specialists and disciplinary content experts. Such collaboration, however, suffers from welldocumented challenges. In this article, I use textual discourse analysis to build a deeper understanding of the discursive spaces through which interdisciplinary collaboration takes place. Drawing on Norman Fairclough's (2001) framework for interactional analysis, I examine the linguistic features of a handout I composed to facilitate a WID meeting with biology faculty. Applying Fairclough's elements of social practices--representing, relating, identifying, and valuing--I trace connections between language use and themes in WAC/WID scholarship in order to investigate the complex process by which writing specialists operationalize disciplinary values in local contexts. My analysis shows how linguistic and rhetorical properties of communication can enable interdisciplinary relationships in WAC/WID contexts by strategically bridging disciplinary differences, as well as constrain relationships by confounding participant roles and responsibilities. Mapping links between discourse, language, and social interaction, I argue, allows writing specialists to critically examine our communicative strategies and their impact on the professional relationships we broker, empowering us to more creatively navigate the challenge of interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - Adolescents present a unique collection of characteristics and challenges which middle school interdisciplinary teams were designed to address. This article describes a research study which explored parental involvement strategies employed by interdisciplinary teaching teams from three very different middle schools: an affluent suburban school, a mid-level rural school, and a high-poverty urban school. A multiple-case study approach was used, and interdisciplinary teams at each middle school were interviewed, responded to journal questions, and were observed at parent nights and related events. Parents were also included as participants through focus groups, one-on-one interviews, and written questionnaires. The researcher identified themes within each setting, as well as four cross-case themes. All of the interdisciplinary teams in this research study utilized strategies grounded in a belief regarding the essential role parental involvement plays, maintained an open and approachable attitude toward parents, served as a resource to parents, and approached problem-solving opportunities as a team. The findings of this study serve as a bridge between what is known about adolescent development, best middle school interdisciplinary teaming models, and the essential nature of parental involvement in education.

AB  - This article argues that Education Studies needs to develop its existing interdisciplinarity understanding of structures and agencies by giving greater attention to the modern process theories of self-organisation in the physical, biological, psychological and social sciences, sometimes given the umbrella term "complexity theory". The relation of humans to the biosphere is topicalised, including the social role of the emotions presented by evolutionary psychology and learning theory. Further, Education Studies is seen as a suitable discipline for bringing these concerns into the broader intellectual culture and the curriculum. A number of proposals for reform are presented in the conclusion.

AB  - As an educator, it is always interesting to learn and employ new and creative ways of thinking and methods in teaching. However, the application of these new ideas in our classrooms needs more examination for better ways of implementation. Since the postmodernist theory and approaches have been practiced in education in the past few decades, the criticisms stated by educators and scholars have led to an examination of its impact on teaching and learning in different fields. In this paper, I would like to bring forth the educational issues under the influence of post-modernist trends and, eventually, develop the new postmodern approach in higher education. In this way, we offer other perspectives, taking into account interdisciplinary theory and principles, as a feasible alternative and prevailing idea in higher education. An interdisciplinary approach will be discussed as a way to solve the problems related to the negative effects of current postmodern issues in education. Contemporary single-disciplinary theories and approaches in education have evolved toward interdisciplinary thinking that integrates different perspectives and fields. These new multiple approaches can serve as the educational basis for reconstructing value of the humanities. This proposition is considered as an issue when facing the critical situation in postmodern education in our society today. In addition, the interdisciplinary thinking will be employed, based on the multiple-perspectives from literature, philosophy, religion, science, and cultural studies. The integration of these related but distinct disciplines will elucidate programs and hopefully serve to inspire the basis for new postmodern education.

AB  - This article reports and reflects on the design and use of the board game KEEP COOL on climate change. The game covers and integrates central biophysical, economic, and political aspects of the issue. By using a board game as common language between students and scientists from different scientific cultures, knowledge of different disciplines can be integrated and different views can be discussed. Thus, even complex issues such as the free-rider problem, trade-offs between adaptation to and mitigation of climate change, and path dependencies can be studied. KEEP COOL is the first game on climate change that is readily available from a commercial publisher. It has successfully been used in multiple settings, for example, as a tool for interdisciplinary research, public relations, public understanding of science, and, in particular, teaching. The experience with the game indicates that it can be effectively used in seminars with students to obtain a holistic picture of the issue and to lay out a common language for deeper reflections on climate change. This contribution also identifies some pitfalls and essential instruments for its adequate use for teaching.

AB  - As part of a U.S. Department of Education grant to expand Latin American and Caribbean Studies at Albright College, the authors of this article, one a historian and one an artist, teamed up to teach a course called Revolutions: Art and Revolution in Latin America. In the class, they proposed to combine a studio art printmaking class with Latin American history content. They wanted to use a different kind of technology to help students understand the past, and use Latin America's revolutionary past to help students understand the different ways that art has been used to promote social change. This article is going to talk about the methods that they use to teach the class, the resources available, and some of the challenges of offering this type of hybrid class.

AB  - The growing number of faculty positions in biology education, the formation of professional societies focused specifically on biology education, and the increasing number of publications in biology education over the past decade
point to the emergence of biology education as a relevant area of research for biologists. Doctoral programs focused specifically on biology education are explicitly designed to produce scholars prepared to advance knowledge
in the field, answering important questions inherent to biology education and serving as leaders in biology education reform. However, the limited number of doctoral programs specifically focused on biology education and the growing number of faculty positions advertised for scholars with this specialization suggests there is a need for additional programs with this focus. To address this need, Middle Tennessee State University recently developed an interdisciplinary PhD with a specific concentration in "biology
education." The program is a collaborative effort between the College of Basic and Applied Sciences and the College of Education and brings together faculty with expertise in basic biology, biology education, and
educational theory and practice to prepare scholars who possess the expansive set of professional skills that will allow them to advance the field of biology education. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - Reflective practice is an important vehicle for the apprenticeship of tacit and procedure-oriented knowledge. This article explores the development of reflective practice in the teaching of an innovative design course. Starting from a characterization of the "materials of a design situation" (problem-solution duality, methods and tools, management, piloting and organization of projects), we analyse the contributions brought to this practice based on the results obtained within a Masters Degree course. Reflective practice contributes at least two issues: the conscious use of tools in design process and the acquisition of keys to self-analyse the individual and group position and to understand and to manage project uncertainty.

AB  - The School of Engineering and Design Multidisciplinary Project (MDP) at Brunel University is a one week long project based activity involving first year undergraduate students from across the School subject areas of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering and Design. This paper describes the main aims of the MDP and gives an overview of how it has developed over the last four years to become a key part of the engineering undergraduate programme at Brunel University. The paper then presents an in-depth evaluation of the MDP, following the collection of 114 survey responses from students across all four subject areas and all four academic years that have participated in the activity, to assess the impact of the MDP on the student learning experience throughout the period of undergraduate study. The paper also discusses feedback about the MDP obtained from the relevant professional bodies that accredit Brunel University undergraduate engineering programmes, and representatives from the Brunel Placement and Careers Centre, to assess their opinions of the usefulness of the project activity in developing key transferable skills and enhancing the employability of Brunel graduates. The findings of this study will ensure the continued success of the MDP in future academic years and also provide a case study of a large scale multidisciplinary group project teaching activity that may prove useful to those considering or currently developing such activities at other higher education institutions.

AB  - Insights into the development of civic values, attitudes, knowledge, skills and behaviours are greatly demanded by adults worried about a seemingly steady decline in the societal interest of their offspring. Hence, the collection of studies in this special issue on civic engagement in adolescence is not only timely and enlightening, but it also has the potentials to contribute to research in different disciplines on various dimensions, mechanisms and normative models of civic engagement. The studies reveal some promising attempts to bring civil themes into the field of adolescent development. However, to overcome some conceptual, methodological and empirical shortcomings, future developmental studies in the area need to be substantially improved by considering cultural and institutional conditions, by focussing on processes across various everyday life contexts, by merging theories from different disciplinary fields, by conceptualizing adolescents as changeable subjects, and by delineating untested and unwarranted normative assumptions.

AB  - The raising of Henry VIII's warship, the "Mary Rose," from the sea bed set in train an extraordinary programme of interdisciplinary research, relentlessly pursuing the clues to Tudor life and death provided by the remains of the ship, its cargo and crew. In this article Clare Barnes offers fascinating insights into the way in which this recent scholarship has helped to transform our understanding of the period. She also explains how the Learning Department at the Mary Rose Museum use artefacts and source materials alongside competing theories advanced over time, to build historical enquiries for students of different ages. While these tap into young people's curiosity about the ship's sinking, they go beyond the details of this question to develop their knowledge of the enquiry process itself and of the ways in which historical knowledge is constructed and debated.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the potential of online communication technologies to facilitate university-led transdisciplinary sustainable development research and lower the ecological footprints of such research projects. A series of case studies is to be explored. Design/methodology/approach: A one year project is conducted in which a series of research tasks are carried out on an online communications platform. Findings are compared to other examples from the literature. Findings: Online communication technology can be used to facilitate transdisciplinary research tasks, saving time, money and with less environmental impact than that of face-to-face meetings. However, in order for online collaboration to be successful the researchers must be very organized and have strong facilitation skills. Research limitations/implications: The research takes place in a North American setting. Time zone issues and access to sufficient internet technology can be a barrier in global research collaboration. Practical implications: Online communication technology can be a practical way to lower the environmental impact of the research process and lower the cost of collaborative meetings. Originality/value: The outcomes of this research suggest online collaboration can play a much larger role in student and faculty research, including but not limited to online research analysis, data collection and field exploration.

AB  - Scholars have enumerated unique challenges to collaborative interdisciplinary research, many of which evade prescriptive solutions. Some of these challenges can be understood as "essential tensions," necessary and persistent contradictory imperatives in the scientific process. Drawing from interviews with internationally renowned interdisciplinary environment-society research center leaders primarily located in United States academic institutions, we identified three hierarchical tensions in collaborative interdisciplinary research: (1) an epistemic tension between knowledge generation processes that blend multiple approaches into one unified intellectual perspective versus pluralistic processes that maintain multiple, discrete intellectual perspectives, (2) a structural tension between organizations that provide stability to persist and build unified knowledge, while maintaining the flexibility to experiment with novel organizational arrangements that foster innovation, and (3) "affective" tensions for individual researchers between the security of working within cohesive research communities versus attraction to the creative challenges in new intellectual communities. Our results indicate that these tensions are interdependent, similar to previous observations that disciplinary and interdisciplinary knowledge productions are linked. Rather than attempt to resolve tensions between dueling directives, leaders of interdisciplinary research centers can manage essential tensions with purpose through process-oriented and self-reflective management of the unique epistemic culture of the research centers they lead.

AB  - To contribute effectively to academic discourse on urban sustainability, disciplines need to think outside their silos and work together more collaboratively. Although straightforward to posit in theory, the practical realities of bringing together people with different worldviews, languages and skills can be frustrating and lead to loss of motivation. This paper presents the findings from a qualitative study of interdisciplinary team working on an urban sustainability project. Through analysis of archival materials, observations and interviews, a major theme of motivation was uncovered and explored. We conclude with some suggestions for working more effectively interdisciplinary, urban sustainability projects.

AB  - Much educational neuroscience research investigates connections between cognition, neuroscience, and educational theory and practice without reference to the body. In contrast, proponents of embodied cognition posit that the bodily action and perception play a central role in cognitive development. Some researchers within the field of Mind, Brain, and Education (MBE) explore this theory by researching the impact of sensorimotor activity on academic competencies such as language comprehension, mathematics, and scientific thinking. In this article, I call for this work to be highlighted more centrally in MBE training programs. Toward this end, I model an investigation of the concept of embodied cognition that can be used in MBE curricula with a dual purpose: to train future practitioners in the seminal metaphor of mind as an embodied system, and to demonstrate effective interdisciplinary research, which is critical to advancing the field of Mind, Brain, and Education.

AB  - Cemeteries have traditionally been cast as scary and creepy places in children's literature, as well as in popular television shows and movies. Spooky media images, coupled with exaggerated stories from their friends, might leave young learners wary of cemeteries and with feelings of fear and anxiety. Cemeteries are, however, unique community resources that deserve consideration as a teaching tool. A visit to a local cemetery typically does not strain classroom budgets, as it requires minimal travel and can generally be accomplished for free. A trip to a local cemetery offers ample opportunities for teachers to make interdisciplinary connections in their elementary classrooms; cemeteries are "part science, part art, part history." Cemeteries provide students a chance to see, firsthand, how architecture, stonecutting, mortality rates, and even names have changed over time within the local community. A cemetery field trip also can be an introduction to the social studies topics of economics, religion, geography, immigration history, and public health. Integrating mathematics and problem solving into the study of cemetery burial plots helps students gain a deeper understanding of social issues and struggles. Students can practice representing and interpreting data, which is essential in elementary mathematics. In addition, cemeteries provide students with an opportunity to investigate science topics and be actively involved in the process of doing science, essential to the development of scientific literacy. In this article, the authors outline the planning and enactment of field-based activities during a field trip to a cemetery by fourth graders from Blowing Rock, North Carolina. The activities emphasize social studies, science, and math themes to engage and challenge students. (Contains 14 notes.)

AB  - The high demand for the integration of sustainable topics into university curricula presents new challenges for the way chemistry is traditionally taught. New teaching concepts are required that consider and connect different disciplines to achieve a higher student awareness of the importance of these topics for humanity, the environment, and the future of our planet. This article describes a uniquely multidisciplinary graduate course on solar energy; the course may serve as an example of how to incorporate sustainable topics into chemistry programs, and as a starting point from which to build for others. It combines different scientific, industrial, political, and humanitarian approaches to the topic and provides a broad overview of one of the main future energy resources. New teaching methods are introduced, combined, and evaluated with respect to their effectiveness for a sustainable education within science and, in particular, chemistry. The success of this new course concept is demonstrated by high student satisfaction in a trial course evaluation and impressive exam results.

AB  - Background: Given the continued need to educate the public on both the meteorological and engineering hazards posed by the severe winds of a tornado, an interdisciplinary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) module designed by the faculty from the Oceanography and Mechanical Engineering Departments at the United States Naval Academy (USNA) was developed to engage students ages 12 to 16 in the fields of meteorology and engineering. Interdisciplinary educational modules such as this one are becoming increasingly common components of academic outreach programs, but to our knowledge, this is one of the first to combine the fields of meteorology and engineering. While many studies have examined changes in student engagement and interest in the STEM fields as a result of participating in interdisciplinary activities such as this one, relatively fewer have focused on quantifying changes in student content knowledge. The primary purposes of this paper are to (1) describe our interdisciplinary STEM module in detail and (2) report immediate changes in students' knowledge on basic meteorological and engineering content as a result of their participation in the module. Results: Results from a quick, easy-to-administer assessment instrument given to students immediately before and after their participation in the 1-h module indicated that they learned basic content in both meteorology and engineering. Mean improvement of scores on the assessment questions was 40.2%, a change that was statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Other studies that focus on quantifying student learning may wish to lengthen the time between student participation in the module and the administration of the post-module assessment. Conclusions: Our interdisciplinary module integrated material from meteorology and engineering and was successful at promoting student learning. We recommend that other institutions consider developing similar interdisciplinary STEM activities, and we particularly encourage the development of activities that relate to current events. Finally, we recommend assessing content learning as another way to measure the success of interdisciplinary STEM activities.

AB  - In response to a request from a campus student organization, faculty from three fields came together to develop and teach an integrated interdisciplinary course on water issues and social activism. This course, "Water as Life, Death, and Power," brought together topics from the fields of anthropology, biology and chemistry to explore water rights, access to clean water, and water treatment methods. Students enrolled in the course developed projects related to a variety of local and global water issues to present real-world solutions at a university-wide student research showcase. This article describes how we organized the learning community, composed of students, faculty, and staff, and outlines the training process of developing a sense of community, content integration, and interdisciplinary teaching techniques.

AB  - One of the aims of Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) in Scotland is greater inclusion of interdisciplinary learning and teaching in school education. There is, arguably, a limited amount of guidance in the CfE literature to advise and support secondary teachers in the practical implications of the planning, preparation and implementation of interdisciplinary learning and teaching. This paper examines this guidance and insights from research literature and presents the findings from a research project, "Searching for Meaning," which focused on science and religious education teachers collaborating in planned interdisciplinary learning and teaching in secondary schools. The paper identifies some of the key factors for effective interdisciplinary learning and teaching between science and religious education. These include: support from the school leadership; openness to interdisciplinary work and willingness to learn about other disciplines; teamwork, dialogue and joint planning and the need for time and support for teachers. These findings are potentially significant for other forms of interdisciplinary learning and teaching.

AB  - Successfully creating and implementing interdisciplinary curricula in introductory science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses is challenging, but doing so is increasingly more important as current problems in science become more interdisciplinary. Opening up the silos between science disciplines and overcoming common institutional barriers (cost, limited time, need to deliver specific course content, and lack of faculty commitment) is possible by bringing students together from different science courses to discuss interesting interdisciplinary problems. This article describes the mobilization and implementation of a community-oriented Interdisciplinary Science Seminar (ISS) that adds interdisciplinary content to traditional introductory science courses without a significant investment of additional resources. In addition, increased faculty collaboration on interdisciplinary curriculum was achieved, and a second new student-oriented interdisciplinary science program was created.

AB  - This paper describes an investigation into student reasoning about potential energy in the context of introductory electrostatics. Similar incorrect reasoning patterns emerged both in written questions administered after relevant instruction and in one-on-one interviews. These reasoning patterns are also prevalent in responses to questions posed about gravitational potential energy in the context of universal gravitation in introductory mechanics. This finding is relevant for interdisciplinary research, because many courses in multiple disciplines first introduce the concept of electric potential energy in analogy to gravitational potential energy. The results suggest that in introductory courses students do not gain an understanding of potential energy that is sufficiently robust to apply in more advanced physics courses or in disciplines other than physics, in which students must frequently reason with energy in the context of interactions between atoms and molecules.

AB  - In a world that is becoming increasingly more visual, there is a greater need to educate children to better understand images. A school subject that deals directly with image understanding is visual arts. This article discusses an interdisciplinary approach to promote art understanding, within a multimodal environment that combines art and music. The approach was tested with pre-service elementary school teachers (experimental and control group). The target group is of special interest because, in many countries, generalist-teachers and not art-specialists teach art in elementary schools. The findings indicated that when art viewing was accompanied by musical stimulus (experimental group), viewers/listeners were able to exhibit a variety of art appreciation skills and to move to elaborated responses to the artworks. The findings have implications for teacher-training courses as they suggest ways of enhancing future teachers' art-appreciation skills and set a framework for developing multimodal educational material for art viewing activities.

AB  - Librarians have long recognized the importance of privacy to intellectual freedom. As digital technology and its applications advance, however, efforts to protect privacy may become increasingly difficult. With some users behaving in ways that suggest they do not care about privacy and with powerful voices claiming that privacy is dead, librarians may question whether privacy is worth protecting. This article reviews some of the extensive scholarly literature on privacy from disciplines outside the field of library science, including anthropology, law, philosophy, political science, psychology, and sociology, and it identifies fourteen reasons privacy matters to individuals, relationships, and to society. It also discusses the challenge of defining privacy and addresses the question of how the concept of privacy spans cultures. Librarians may find this broader understanding of the value of privacy useful in affirming and defending their commitment to the privacy of library users.

AB  - The breadth of knowledge required for the multidisciplinary field of nanotechnology challenges and extends traditional concepts of multidisciplinary graduate education. There is a paucity of information, both general reporting and peer-reviewed studies, on the challenges for graduate students working in this multidisciplinary paradigm, from the students' perspectives. We report two graduate-student perspectives from different instructional models: (i) the core academic department that has expanded student choice by allowing additional classes to be taken from outside the core department and (ii) multiple departments working together to provide choice and diversity across the curriculum. We find, even after many years of multidisciplinary research, that traditional university organizational structure does not easily accommodate multidisciplinary research. In addition, administrative autonomy of academic departments and colleges, competition among various departments for contracts and grant submission, and a disconnect between research and teaching challenge multidisciplinary research endeavors. The students recommend that (i) university administrators support multidisciplinary departments and develop mechanisms to promote faculty participation; (ii) institutions and departments provide more multidisciplinary groups, centers, and institutes and encourage networking through broad collaboration; (iii) more graduate and postdoctoral fellowships for multidisciplinary research be created; and (iv) departments create more flexible curricula allowing their students to participate in more courses outside the department, necessary for a multidisciplinary thesis. Progress in multidisciplinary science will rely both on deep, specialized knowledge and, increasingly, on scientists who can speak a number of scientific languages and take advantage of synergistic connections. As new and more effective approaches to multidisciplinary training are developed, perhaps it is time to listen more to those with the most intimate experience of the system's successes and failures--the students who are training now to be the next generation of research leaders.

AB  - Most educators know that the best way to truly understand new material is to teach it. The use of students as peer educators provides numerous benefits to the student teacher and his or her classmates. Student-led instruction or peer-to-peer teaching is not a new concept or teaching technique. Peer teaching traces its roots back to the ancient Greeks and Aristotle. Aristotle is known to have used "archons" or student leaders to help fellow students understand the tenets being taught. This use of fellow students or classmates to augment learning has continued to today. This article examines a project designed to facilitate peer-to-peer teaching in order to augment learning.

AB  - Despite the increasing investment in multi-year federally funded science and technology centers in universities, there are few studies of how these centers engage in learning and change based on information submitted from various agents in the oversight and evaluation process. One challenge is how to manage and respond to this evaluative information, especially when it is conflicting. Although the center can learn and adapt in response to this information, it can also become subject to a vicious circle of continuous restructuring and production of documentation to address various and potentially inconsistent recommendations. In this paper we illustrate the effects of such a dynamic based on our experiences as external evaluators of the $25 million NSF-funded Learning in Informal and Formal Environments (LIFE) Center. The case study presents an analysis of annual reports and strategic planning documents along with other sources of evidence to illustrate the evolution of center organizational approaches in response to evaluations by external review panels, center evaluators, program managers, and other external stakeholders. We conclude with suggestions for how evaluators may help centers ease the cost of learning and reduce the likelihood of a vicious circle. (Contains 1 figure and 2 tables.)

AB  - Current trends in public education towards increased standardization and accountability through the use of high-stakes testing have limited both the amount of time spent teaching social studies and the quality of social studies instruction in American elementary schools. With these nationwide trends in mind, this article explores the roles and responsibilities of the individual teacher in the teaching of social studies by asking how pre-service and inservice teachers understand their responsibility to teach social studies before and after a ten-day social studies professional development institute. Informed by the current status of elementary social studies instruction and professional development, Noddings' (2009) conception of responsibility as opposed to accountability, and the literature on rationale development in the social studies, this study illustrates the potential for professional development to positively impact teachers' felt sense of responsibility to teach social studies, and, as a result of those deepening commitments, move teachers towards the desire to use more constructivist pedagogies.

AB  - This paper uses social network analysis to evaluate how the formation of an interdisciplinary brain research institute affected interaction and collaboration among neuroscientists at one Canadian university. The research institute, formed in 2004, has about 100 members representing ten different departments across the university campus. We conducted a whole network survey of the members in 2010, asking them to report on their professional interactions (advice seeking, co-supervising, co-teaching, co-authorship, holding grants, and organizing conferences together) with each of the other members during the five years before and the five years since the foundation of the Institute. Whole network measures examined include density, isolates, average degree and multiplexity. We compared these measures over time. Our findings indicate that professional interactions among the neuroscientists have increased since the founding of the Institute. The main networks of collaborators are now clustered around the three organizational themes of the Institute, which were formalized in 2010. We also examined how individual-level characteristics of the scientists affected professional interaction. We show that departmental co-membership, office co-location and Institute themes are all significant predictors of interaction among neuroscientists at this university since the foundation of the Institute. Social network analysis is a useful tool for evaluating the impact of the establishment of an interdisciplinary institute on scientists' relationships.

AB  - With the introduction of key information sets (KIS) for all university programmes in the UK from 2012, the character, content and delivery of university degrees may be increasingly used by potential students to differentiate between degree programmes. Therefore, developments in curricula and the relationship to the profession are of growing importance. In this paper, we explore the role of programme content in prospective students' decision-making and describe the prevalence of interdisciplinary content in civil engineering curricula. Following this, we detail student perceptions of interdisciplinary content. It is found that universities currently operate a varied approach to transparency regarding curriculum; students pay little attention to programme content before embarking on their chosen degree; and engineering students view interdisciplinary content in the curriculum with ambivalence, usually ascribing its necessity in the preparation for post-university employment.

AB  - The family and consumer sciences (FCS) teacher shortage is one need that can be mitigated by exposing high school students to professional trends and future work settings via service-learning. Such exposure can affect student recruitment by influencing high school students' knowledge and attitudes toward FCS careers. This study explored the impact of an interdisciplinary service-learning project on secondary FCS students in regards to career choice. Researchers utilized a university educational methods course to expose undergraduate students to recruitment strategies. Knowledge and attitudes about careers in FCS were surveyed in secondary FCS students before and after participation in the university educational methods class project. It was determined that an interdisciplinary service-learning approach is effective in changing high school students' knowledge and attitudes about content taught in FCS courses as well as providing undergraduate FCS students the opportunity to practice skills learned in the classroom.

AB  - Learning communities can strengthen early undergraduates' learning, but planning them can be daunting for instructors. Learning communities usually rely on integrative assignments that encourage interdisciplinary analysis. This article reports on our experiences using microloans as an interdisciplinary assignment in a learning community that united algebra with world literature. Students used the microfinance website www.kiva.org to make small loans of real money to entrepreneurs in low-income countries. Four themes emerged from student reaction to the assignment: awareness of Africa, community impact, mathematical consciousness, and productive collaboration among students. Our reflections suggest that microfinance assignments may support integrative learning across many other disciplines.

AB  - An investigation of the possibility of life in the universe, or astrobiology, is
an ideal topic for an interdisciplinary seminar course. Answering the topic's
inherent questions--whether life exists elsewhere in the universe and, if it
does indeed exist, whether we on Earth could contact such life--requires
an interdisciplinary approach and multiple perspectives from the sciences,
social sciences, and humanities. Described are several highlights of a
community college's 15-week seminar course, Life in the Universe, including
students' perceptions of the course elements as ascertained from an end-of-course survey. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - Supplementing classroom instruction with online materials and learning activities is becoming less avant-garde and more of an expectation for faculty members in higher education. The use of Blackboard, WebCT, or proprietary software, like Georgia Institute of Technology's Sakai installation (T-Square), has become a requirement, rather than an option. Citing both Project Tomorrow's "Speak Up 2008" report and "Visions 2020.2," a report based on a survey sponsored by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the Department of Education, and NetDay, a nonprofit organization in California, the "Chronicle of Higher Education" concluded in their "The College of 2020: Students" report that the students of 2020 "are restless with the traditional forms of learning and eager to incorporate into their educations the electronic tools that have become omnipresent in their lives: their smartphones, laptop computers, iPods, and MP3 players" (Van Der Werf and Sabatier 7). Faculty intent on reaching such students must devise nuanced methods of course delivery and revise course assignments to more comprehensively account for these shifting paradigms. As these alterations are made, faculty must also devise new systems of evaluating student work when it reaches beyond the discipline-specific learning outcomes to include technical writing and digital design components. In constructing an interdisciplinary course on the intersections between science and science fiction at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, one of my goals was to create assignments that challenged students' technical prowess, as well as their skills with writing and critical analysis. Requiring students to learn or improve upon their HTML skills by developing webpages, rather than traditional essay assignments, allowed me to more easily convey the idea of technical languages as having their own rhetorical principles. The complexity of the projects required a staged evaluation process that ultimately challenged students to work far beyond the assignment "requirements," as they began to truly explore the boundaries between different modes of discourse.

AB  - Fostering interdisciplinary learning in biology will require significant changes in the way one teaches science to K-12 students. The perspective on interdisciplinary biology teaching and learning in this essay is based on the author's experiences as a former research cell biologist, high school science teacher, and developer of secondary science curricula and teacher professional development programs used in a variety of school districts nationwide. On the basis of these experiences, the author is enthusiastic about the importance of preparing students for the interdisciplinary nature of modern biology, yet concerned about the challenges faced by teachers and school districts as they move toward a modern curriculum. Transforming interdisciplinary biology teaching at the secondary level must include changes in curriculum, instruction, assessments, and teacher professional development in order to support teaching for conceptual understanding and for making cross-disciplinary connections. To prepare students for the nature of modern biology, biology educators must provide them with frequent opportunities to engage in studying interdisciplinary scientific questions or problems. Students will need sufficient time and support to explore, analyze, and reflect on the contributions of various disciplines to advances in modern biology.
