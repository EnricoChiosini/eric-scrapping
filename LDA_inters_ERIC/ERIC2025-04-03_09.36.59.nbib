AB  - The VAX-TRUST project addresses vaccine hesitancy in seven European countries with a systematic and evidence-based approach. Interventions, targeting healthcare professionals, draw from behavioural and social theories. A checklist, inspired by the TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description and Replication), ensures a detailed description of actions, transparency and replicability. The intervention development process begins with collaborative meetings and systematic revisions, concluding with external evaluations for replicability in diverse public health contexts. This study aims to provide valuable insights for future complex interventions in public health, based on lessons learnt to reduce the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases. The analysis of educational interventions within the VAX-TRUST project has led to the definition of precise guidelines to ensure their replicability and adaptation to various contexts, attempting to establish a universally applicable approach. Active participant engagement and consideration of local social dynamics, beyond information transmission, have emerged as key factors to improve intervention effectiveness. Various educational tools and collaboration with academic institutions have contributed to strengthening credibility.

AB  - This article discusses the latest developments of the Sucre4Stem tool, as part of the Sucre initiative, which aims to promote interest in computational thinking and programming skills in K-12 students. The tool follows the Internet of Things approach and consists of two prominent components: 1) SucreCore and 2) SucreCode. SucreCore incorporates an advanced microcontroller packaged in a more compact design and enables wireless connectivity. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming tool, supports two different sets of blocks depending on the education grade, and facilitates wireless communication with SucreCore. At the educational level, Sucre4Stem fosters new group dynamics and encourages students to experiment real-world projects by promoting the "programming to learn" approach to concepts from other disciplines as opposed to the strategy widely applied in schools of "learning to program" in isolation.

AB  - The University of Lagos is one of Nigeria's premiere Universities, established in 1962 with core values emphasizing commitment to quality academic learning and character, integrity, continuous improvement of staff professionalism and competence, as well as a strong commitment to cutting-edge research. In 2012, the University established the Research and Innovation Office, which was subsequently restructured into two offices: the Research Management Office, and the Innovation and Technology Transfer Office, for more efficient functioning. Over the years, the Office has provided enormous support to over 1,700 academic faculty and researchers for cutting-edge research built on a multi-disciplinary approach. This paper provides a detailed discussion of the strategies employed by the Research Management Office to promote multi-disciplinary research from inception to date, the results of efforts to promote collaboration across the currently existing wealth of diversity in academic and research disciplines among researchers in over 12 faculties of the University, the successes recorded, and the challenges faced. The paper further makes recommendations for the advancement of these strategies, and suggestions for pragmatic solutions to challenges experienced while drawing practical and applicable lessons from international best practices for supporting multi-disciplinary research.

AB  - Photosynthesis is the predominant metabolic process for energy obtention in plants. Here we describe a case study where a set of anatomical, biochemical, and molecular characters are used to reconstruct the evolution of the C[subscript 4] photosynthetic pathway, within the evolutionary framework provided by the genus "Flaveria." Our main educational goal was to engage biology undergraduate students to solve a photosynthesis-related phylogenetic problem by stimulating them to assemble informative characters of diverse nature. This case study was successfully implemented as a seminar in a massive university introductory course, during the COVID19 lockdown. Using an online learning environment, most small groups achieved the Students Learning Outcomes, which were assessed through a questionnaire and an open-ended question. Individual performance was also evaluated through a specific exercise in the course's midterm test. Finally, students were surveyed for their perception about the seminar through a poll. We concluded that this seminar could be easily adopted to promote the learning of complex and interdisciplinary content like the C[subscript 4] photosynthetic pathway in undergraduate botanical education, even in a large online introductory course.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has brought disruptions and constraints to K-12 STEM education, such as the shortened classroom time and the restrictions on classroom interactions. More empirical evidence is needed to inform educators and practitioners which strategies work and which do not in the pandemic context. In response to the call for more empirical evidence and the need for cultivating responsible and competent 21st century citizens, we designed and implemented a transdisciplinary STEM curriculum during the COVID-19 outbreak. In order to facilitate the smooth delivery of the learning contents and authentically engage learners in the learning process, multi-model video approaches were employed considering the characteristics of three disciplines, STEM, social service, and writing, as well as learner diversity. Pre- and post-test results indicated that students' transdisciplinary STEM knowledge improved significantly after completing the curriculum. The integration of STEM, social service, and writing disciplines promoted the growth of students' empathy, interest, and self-efficacy. Consistent with the quantitative results, students responded in the interview that their STEM knowledge and empathy were both enhanced. Some implementation strategies introduced in the current study are also applicable when the standard teaching order is restored in the post-COVID-19 era.

AB  - The integration of biology with mathematics and computer science mandates the training of students capable of comfortably navigating among these fields. We address this formidable pedagogical challenge with the creation of transdisciplinary modules that guide students toward solving realistic problems with methods from different disciplines. Knowledge is gradually integrated as the same topic is revisited in biology, mathematics, and computer science courses. We illustrate this process with a module on the homeostasis and dynamic regulation of red blood cell production, which was first implemented in an introductory biology course and will be revisited in the mathematics and computer science curricula.

AB  - The paper investigates how teacher trainees in higher education geography and external, non-scientific partners perceive and experience collaborations in an active teaching and learning approach. Such formats are recommended in education for sustainable development (ESD) but are likely to be challenging experiences for all actors involved. The study analysed two transdisciplinary-oriented courses, where future teachers in geography and primary social and science education collaborated with civil society partners. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 students and partners; course evaluations complemented the database. The analysis identified several approaches to collaboration and aspects that either led to intensive collaboration or challenged its transdisciplinary character. Furthermore, the study revealed the interdependencies between the external partners' expectations, their motives and the perceived effects of the collaborations. The partners anticipated a wide range of expectations, some of which went beyond what the students could reasonably deliver. Our analysis also showed that the collaborations enabled students to learn, experience and reflect on an active teaching and learning approach to ESD. We conclude that transdisciplinary-oriented courses can oscillate along the spectrum between "nice try" and "valuable initiative". The paper ends with recommendations for shaping and delivering transdisciplinary-oriented courses effectively.

AB  - Background: Computational approaches in STEM foster creative extrapolations of ideas that extend the bounds of human perception, processing, and sense-making. Inviting teachers to explore computational approaches in STEM presents opportunities to examine shifting relationships to inquiry that support transdisciplinary learning in their classrooms. Similarly, play has long been acknowledged as activity that supports learners in taking risks, exploring the boundaries and configurations of existing structures, and imagining new possibilities. Yet, play is often overlooked as a crucial element of STEM learning, particularly for adolescents and adults. In this paper, we explore "computational play" as an activity that supports teachers' transdisciplinary STEM learning. We build from an expansive notion of computational activity that involves jointly co-constructing and co-exploring rule-based systems in conversation with materials, collaborators, and communities to work towards jointly defined goals. We situate computation within STEM-rich making as a playful context for engaging in authentic, creative inquiry. Our research asks "What are the characteristics of play and computation within computational play? And, in what ways does computational play contribute to teachers' transdisciplinary learning?" Results: Teachers from grades 3-12 participated in a professional learning program that centered playful explorations of materials and tools using computational approaches: making objects based on rules that produce emergent behaviors and iterating on those rules to observe the effects on how the materials behaved. Using a case study and descriptions of the characteristics of computational play, our results show how familiarity of materials and the context of play encouraged teachers to engage in transdisciplinary inquiry, to ask questions about how materials behave, and to renegotiate their own relationships to disciplinary learning as they reflected on their work. Conclusions: We argue computational play is a space of wonderment where iterative conversations with materials create opportunities for learners to author forms of transdisciplinary learning. Our results show how teachers and students can learn together in computational play, and we conclude this work can contribute to ongoing efforts in the design of professional and transdisciplinary learning environments focused on the intersections of materiality, play, and computation.

AB  - The Small Group Learning (SGL) permeates throughout higher education fields of study. Thus, our aim is to assess the influence of a planned activity of SGL on a variety of competences appraisals through a multidisciplinary perspective. To that end, cooperative learning activities implemented under the SGL approach were programmed for six different degrees. For each activity, students were provided with instructions about what the activity was about and how to make it. Two surveys were scheduled before and after the completion of the SGL. Our findings are presented in a descriptive and quantitative analysis, using surveys with which we examine the pre and post differences in students' self-reports. As a result, self-perceptions on oral and written expression and bibliography competence increased after the practice of the Small Group Learning (SGL) strategy in students from Social Science degrees as well as in students from Psychology degree. In addition, receiving feedback showed an improvement for the whole sample after doing SGL. Our results confirm that, in order to achieve an excellent quality education, SGL could be applied equally in different fields of study: both Health and Social Sciences. The novelty of this study is that it has been conducted in six different academic degrees and has focused on higher education skills in order to improve future undergraduate's employability.

AB  - Purpose: Interior architecture is based on theoretical, practical, and practice-based knowledge associated with other design disciplines that form a multidisciplinary framework. The aim of this study is to evaluate the art, science, and technical competencies that form the basis of knowledge and skills for the students within interior architecture education in Turkey. The other discussion is to what extent the courses provided during education meet the basic learning outcomes and provide for the professionals as part of the multidisciplinary study. Research Methods: Courses included in educational programs are categorised under 'theoretical/ theoretic', 'artistic/aesthetic', and 'technical/ practical', and are taken as a basis in the study, and the ratios and quantitative response values are determined. Besides, the joint readings of the subject are obtained by the interviews conducted with professionals. Findings: In the research, the numerical data of the courses related to art and aesthetic values, and the courses aiming at the application by transferring technical knowledge are obtained. The theoretical course workload yielded higher values. For findings related to the basic competencies acquired by the professional interior architects, there is the problem with 'technical expression' and 'experience in practice' within education. Implications for Research and Practice: The discussion of the standardisation through the educational programs should be avoided with a flexible approach. The consistency will be ensured through training practices and collaborations aimed at professional practices. In the future, collaborations for professionalism and studies in education and practice will play a supporting role after the graduation of students.

AB  - Multidisciplinary education is being increasingly introduced into many countries' curricula. In Finland, the national curriculum of 2014 made multidisciplinary education mandatory in basic education. This case study investigates how history teaching is perceived and implemented within a multidisciplinary module in a Finnish primary school. Data was collected through interviews and observations, and the analysis followed a thematic analysis procedure. The study is theoretically framed around concepts of multidisciplinary education, history education, and multidisciplinary history teaching. The results indicate that multidisciplinary education can support history's status and relevance as a subject, as its connections to other subjects and the lifeworld are clarified. In multidisciplinary education, historical content can be holistically studied through multiple perspectives. History content can also provide a base for developing overarching competences and skills related to other subjects. As the case of study was clearly affected by its context, the article addresses education as a complex phenomenon. Regardless of the curriculum approach, teachers need to be sensitive to the framing conditions for teaching and learning. To support history learning, both in multidisciplinary and subject-based education, the conditions for students' learning need to determine teaching purposes and methods.

AB  - Strong communication skills, in varied professional settings, have become an absolute necessity for young professionals. Therefore, university educators are challenged to provide novice specialists with the effective foreign language training that could bring the real professional world into the classroom. This study suggests an innovative method for teaching communication skills to students, through the use of real-life scenarios, drawn from the professional context. The core objective of the research was to define whether the scenario-based instruction could effectively enhance the development of professional communication skills of students in the context of university foreign language training. The data were collected through active observation and critical incidents technique, analyzed and summarized by means of descriptive statistics. The results of the study indicate the efficacy of scenario-based communication training in higher education. However, scenario-based instruction requires careful assessment of learners' needs and expectations, thoughtful selection and design of teaching materials, and the development of an active learning environment.

AB  - Although one of key ideas behind the introduction of STEM (or STEAM) as a unifying concept, is to emphasize the interdisciplinary character of many real world problems, there is a non-trivial educational challenge in exceeding existing subject boundaries and implementing multidisciplinary activities into the classroom. The present case study covers the design, implementation and evaluation of a multidisciplinary unit in a Finnish lower secondary school, grade 9. The entire multidisciplinary unit was organized around the central concept of energy, and the present study focuses on an activity within that unit that explored how energy can be used to analyze both living and non-living systems. Evaluation of the activity was done with pre and post student questionnaires, analyzing the students' written poster presentations and focus group interviews done with a voluntary group of students after the whole unit. The aim of the study was to explore how students understand the multidisciplinary character of the energy concept. Our results show both challenges and possible gains of working in a multidisciplinary way. However, to succeed serious thought has to be invested in both identifying core concepts that gain by being analyzed in an interdisciplinary way, and in the design of appropriate learning activities around these core concepts. Our study is as an effort in this direction.

AB  - The challenge and pleasures of studying child and adolescent peer experiences come from the complexity and the significance of these relationships for development in childhood and adolescence. In spite of the recognized strengths of the current literature on the effects of experiences with peers, research on peer experiences is often limited by an inattention to the effects of the hierarchical structure of the peer system. Experiences with peers are known to be situated in complex and multilevel social contexts. These contexts can be as small (or as focal) as a relationship dyad (e.g., two best friends interacting together), a peer group (e.g., more than two peers interacting together simultaneously), or as large and diverse as the cultural contexts of nation-states. A consequence of this multilevel organization peer research would benefit from the use of models that can account for variables and processes that occur at different levels of social complexity. This multilevel approach would also be multidisciplinary because it would require the integration of constructs typically studied in different scholarly disciplines. We show how a broader and less disciplinarily focused perspective can enrich our understanding of the features and processes of peer experiences.

AB  - It is commonly accepted that inquiry in adapted physical activity involves the use of different disciplines to address questions. It is often advanced today that complex problems of the kind frequently encountered in adapted physical activity require a combination of disciplines for their solution. At the present time, individual research questions in adapted physical activity are most often developed and pursued by researchers from a single discipline despite incentives to the contrary. However, the inclusion of multiple disciplines to address research questions raises a number of challenges. A major one is effective communication. The language related to the use of multiple disciplines is often used loosely. Key terms, such as multi-disciplinary, interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary, and cross-disciplinary, are often used interchangeably. We introduce the technical meaning of these terms and outline some key epistemic challenges to communication across disciplines and highlight the importance of willingness, on the part of researchers, to carefully listen to each other.

AB  - This study presents an analysis of preschool teachers' reasoning about pedagogical goals. Of specific interest is how teachers in a Swedish and a Finnish context describe goals for children's learning and how they describe them implementing these goals into their practice. The research question is thus: How are pedagogical goals perceived and enacted, in the thematic-oriented and play-based pedagogical practice of preschool? In-depth interviews were conducted with six preschool teachers, of which three expressed learning goals guiding their pedagogical work. The Variation Theory of learning is the guiding principle throughout the analysis, and reveals indirect and direct objects of learning and content for learning described by the three teachers. A deeper analysis of the features of these provides a comprehensive picture of pedagogical goals that are intertwined and move between activity goals, working goals and transdisciplinary goals. These results contribute to our understanding of the characteristics of preschool pedagogy and the complex pedagogical practice preschool entails.

AB  - Creating a more coherent and integrated curriculum in higher education is a perennial concern. Critics and philosophers such as Immanuel Kant--one of the fathers of our modern academic system--candidly describes the political, social, and economic influences that underwrite academic fragmentation and dysfunction. Despite its complex definitions and epistemological challenges, interdisciplinarity is often cited as an integral part of plans to reform curricula. This article explores some of those plans, and it challenges present conceptualizations of interdisciplinarity as a change agent. Based on a theoretical study of Kant and Mikhail Bakhtin, a dialogic approach is recommended for curriculum redesign, and failure is recognized as a permanent feature rather than an anomaly in the structure of higher education.

AB  - Throughout 2018 we had the privilege of engaging with Julie Thompson Klein using an ethnographic approach combining interviews via teleconferencing and email exchanges to discuss many aspects of her work with the goal of understanding how she herself views her scholarly evolution over the past five decades. Discussions about Klein's life quickly became intertwined with stories about her work, and the process of capturing details of her intellectual journey resulted in a collection of commentaries in which biography could not be easily separated from review of her scholarly output. In this article, we decided to foreground the richness of the dialogue we have so enjoyed in which there has been a fusion of the two kinds of content, incorporating Klein's reflections to illuminate some of the central themes of her entwined personal and academic trajectories. We have chosen to organize the material into three categories that we see as primary areas of focus for her and her work over the years: interdisciplinary educational activities, contributions to the professionalizing of interdisciplinarity, and discourse on teams. Whenever possible, we quote Klein directly in her own words (printed in italics) to facilitate our overview of these areas.

AB  - In higher education institutions, critical race theory (CRT) is known to be associated with fields that study racial disparities or systemic oppression such as law, education, and ethnic studies. The impression that CRT is unrelated to fields like business or computer science may have led scholars and practitioners from these disciplines to put their focus on elsewhere than on racial inequality and its implication in their research and practice, despite apparent need. To counter such fallacy, this review article--focusing primarily on the US context--discusses CRT literature in fields where its presence is less known which are nevertheless among the major domains of higher education institutions: health sciences, computer science and information technology, sports, business, and religion. By discussing example research of how scholars have utilized CRT in different fields to challenge the race-neutral thinking that often obscures structural racism, this paper exposes racism's ability to alter manifestations and to appear through various shapes and forms within the higher education context. Initial recommendations on how educators may engage in further discussions or actions will also be considered. This paper concludes that racist ideologies are often hidden behind discipline-specific vocabulary or technical language, and it is by tackling the ideologies at work underneath the technicalities can we address the chameleon-like nature of racism more effectively.

AB  - Student evaluation of teaching (SET), a major tool for assessing teaching quality in higher education is a crucial research topic. Among 13 studies published about online peer SET in "Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education" over the past two decades, ease of use, clarity and helpfulness of SET information were repeatedly tested. This study introduces theory from the information systems field to give a multi-disciplinary view in testing how students' perceptions may affect their intention to continue to use an online peer SET system. While past studies focused on ratemyprofessor.com, offering results from USA, Canada and UK, this study aimed to provide Asian insight by using data from Taiwan. Based on 364 student members of the selected website, findings indicated that disconfirmation of SET information significantly affected perceived usefulness, trust and satisfaction, ultimately shaping continuance usage intention of the online peer SET system. Practical implications for online peer SET website managers and institutional SET managers are discussed.

AB  - Flipped classes are designed to facilitate self-teaching, self-assessment, and self-regulation (Talbert, 2017). Because flipped classes demand more student responsibility than traditional classes, monitoring their own learning and making adjustments are crucial in helping students perceive this increase as manageable. The current study hypothesized that students in flipped classes would show increases across the semester in their self-regulated learning and that students who engaged in reflective writing tasks (e.g., Nilson, 2013) would show more improvement than those who did not. Data were analyzed from a sample of 332 students enrolled in courses across multiple disciplines. Contrary to expectations, students' motivation and learning strategy scores decreased or remained stable across the semester, except for peer learning, which improved. In general, completing reflective writing tasks seemed to attenuate the decline in motivation scores and actually improve some learning strategy scores. These results suggest the benefit of reflective writing, and future research should examine other mediating/moderating factors, like mindset, in studies involving self-regulated learning and flipped classrooms. Methodological challenges in conducting multidisciplinary SoTL research also are discussed.

AB  - To promote rich discourse around scientific and engineering practices, teachers may turn to engineering design-based science curricula; however, this has discursive demands which have yet to be examined in a unit focused on integration of engineering and science. To investigate these discursive demands, we expand on the definition of discourse to include the ways of knowing, doing, talking, reading, writing, and context within science and engineering--and refer to these as disciplinary Discourses. The following major research question guided this study: how are multiple Discourses enacted by both the teacher during whole class discussions and students in small groups in an engineering design-based curricular unit? In this descriptive case study, we investigated these disciplinary Discourses in a design-based unit that focused on integration of engineering into a sixth-grade genetics unit through whole-class videos and audio recordings of a target student group. Our findings suggest that while the Discourses present in whole class discussions often reflected the focus of the daily lesson, this unit creates a space for multidisciplinary Discourse to emerge between science and engineering. Also, this teacher merged everyday and more technical disciplinary Discourses to scaffold the students' understanding. Finally, we observed multidisciplinary Discourses between science and engineering emerge in our student group, suggesting that students can successfully integrate the two disciplines. This study therefore begins to investigate the disciplinary Discourses present in a design-based curricular unit and specifically multidisciplinary Discourses that may enhance students' understanding of both science and engineering.

AB  - The ability to analyse aspects of visual culture--works of art, maps or plans, graphs, tables and X-rays--quickly and efficiently is critical in decision-making in a broad range of disciplines. Eye tracking is a technology that can record how long someone dwells on a particular detail in an image, where the eye moves from one part of the image to the other, and the sequence the viewer uses to interpret visual information. These MP4 recordings can be played back and graphically enhanced with coloured dots and lines to point out this natural and fluent eye behaviour to learners. These recordings can form effective pedagogical tools for learning how to look at images through the eyes of experts by mimicking the patterns and rhythms of expert eye behaviour. This paper provides a meta-analysis of studies of this kind and also provides the results of a cross-disciplinary project which involved five different subject areas. The consensus arising from our meta-analysis reveals an emerging field with broad concerns in need of more integrated research. None of the studies cited in this article are interdisciplinary across the sciences and arts and, while some of them address higher education in medicine and computing, there are no interdisciplinary studies of how eye tracking is important for teaching in arts and science subjects at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. In addition, none of the studies address how learning practitioners find these eye recordings useful for their own understanding of learning processes. This establishes the unique contribution of this project.

AB  - This study explores the relationship between engagement with an online, free-to-use question-generation application (PeerWise) and student achievement. Using PeerWise, students can create and answer multiple-choice questions and can provide feedback to the question authors on question quality. This provides further scope for students to engage in discussion about the question with their peers. Data on PeerWise use and examination performance were collected from over 3000 students across six large undergraduate courses (in physics, chemistry and biology) over three academic years in three research-intensive UK universities. A reliable and valid measure of overall PeerWise activity was created and a multilevel model developed describing the relationship between PeerWise activity and student performance in end of course examinations. Using this approach, a significant positive association was found between students' engagement with PeerWise and their academic attainment in end of course exams, even controlling for prior ability. The implications of these findings for educators are discussed.

AB  - The aim of this study is to understand and explore interdisciplinarity in geography and undergraduate geography courses in geography teaching departments in Turkey. There is a growing literature in science underscoring the importance of interdisciplinary approach and its beneficial outcomes. Increasing body of knowledge on social theory, on philosophical and theoretical movements and paradigms have made easier communication among disciplines which give rise to more perceptible interdisciplinarity specifically in social sciences and humanities. At the second part of the present study we focused on relationships between geography courses, interdisciplinary approach and course selection. Because in the study course selection is seen as the most important point to analyze and understand the extent to which whether interdisciplinarity finds a place in geography teaching. Lastly, it is given some conclusions by making suggestions.

AB  - Technological advancements are pushing new simulation and analytical tools, driving the research fields in design forward. In this environment, for introducing new modeling, simulation, and analytic tools, the pre-training aspect becomes important, presenting the ideas behind the tools and preparing the students to structure their already grasped knowledge and future learnings. This study aims to address the potential of efficient workshops for pre-training activities via active learning methods for introducing new concepts and tools in advanced computer-aided design. The students participate in the workshops after lectures and before their exercise session to enhance learning and reduce the ambiguity of the newly introduced topics and tools. For performing the study, a design research methodology is followed to design an efficient workshop based on research clarification, descriptive, and prescriptive study phases. The study results are assessed by direct student feedback and quantitative analysis of the student performance followed by a qualitative teacher evaluation compared to previous years. The results show that active learning workshops support pre-training, impacting the students' performance on comprehension of the utilized tools and reducing ambiguity on the related topics.

AB  - Contribution: While design project courses offer first-year students a practical introduction to engineering, a portion of class time is usually spent on lecturing foundational knowledge instead of practicing engineering design. This article presents a blended design-based learning (bDBL) approach that makes class time more efficient and explores the changes in students' design competencies and intrinsic motivations. Background: Current approaches to cornerstone courses face challenges, such as heavy faculty involvement and heterogeneity of design projects. bDBL draws on the self-directedness of blended learning and the open-ended nature of design-based learning which may be a worthwhile instructional approach for cornerstone courses. Intended Outcomes: bDBL was applied in a cornerstone course that intended to let students understand what engineers do and motivate them in the field. Students' design competencies and intrinsic motivations were examined through pre- and post-self-reported surveys. Focus group interviews were conducted to elicit students' views on bDBL. Application Design: Online self-paced learning modules were created to deliver knowledge-based content. Students transfer what they learned from the online modules through launch-level demos. Then, students spend most of the class time working on team design projects to learn through mistakes and receive first-hand feedback from peers and instructors. Findings: From Fall 2018 to Spring 2020, 201 first-year students experienced bDBL. Quantitative results demonstrated increases in students' design competencies and intrinsic motivations. Four themes representing both positive and negative views of bDBL were elicited. A conceptual framework that connects the theoretical foundation, design elements, examined effects, and students' perceptions, is proposed.

AB  - Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are at an increased risk for developing obesity when compared to their typically developing peers. Given higher prevalence of obesity in youth with ASD, understanding factors relating to success in obesity treatment provides insight into implementing efficacious treatments for youth. The current study examines age, sleep, and metabolic factors potentially affecting success in 74 youth (M[subscript age] = 11.66) attending a multidisciplinary weight management treatment program over a year. Multilevel modeling indicated that higher baseline BMI class category, medications at baseline, and absence of sleep difficulties predicted greater reduction in BMI after a year of treatment.

AB  - Academic interdisciplinarity has become a powerful means of addressing challenges facing contemporary society as well as offering opportunities to advance knowledge. To better understand the role of university interdisciplinary organizations (IDOs), the authors studied 18 IDOs at Stanford University in the USA. They propose that IDOs not only enhance researchers' interdisciplinary collaboration but, counterintuitively, also serve departmental and disciplinary interests. While IDOs are traditionally believed to threaten traditional disciplinary departments, the authors find a "more the more" dynamic in which, by bringing shared university resources and faculty to bear on new themes, significant new resources are generated to the benefit of both actors. Traditionally, the relationship between departments and IDOs has been seen as a zero-sum game with winners and losers. This research suggests, to the contrary, a win-win dynamic in which the two formats are mediated by the research group. Some faculty members are alternately departmental chairs and IDO organizers as well as start-up founders, industrial consultants and holders of high governmental advisory positions during their careers, integrating Triple Helix university-industry-government interactions with IDOs and IDOs with departments. The authors examine how these two entities coexist and benefit one another in a cooperative academic ecosystem and consider the implications for the future of the university.

AB  - This article reports on a study that followed up on an initial interdisciplinary project and focused specifically on the experiences of researchers involved in practice-based interdisciplinary research. We share an approach to research evaluation that focuses on the experiences of those conducting the research rather than the outputs. The study allowed those involved in the initial successful project to reflect "post hoc" on their experiences. We show that neglecting fundamental conceptions about how the research is conceptualized can lead to challenges with the research itself. In addition to alternative understandings of research and concepts, practical and logistical issues, whilst seeming trivial, feed into communication issues such as misunderstanding of terms and language. We argue that tensions and confusions around the very nature of the research--what was being researched, and what was valued as research, epistemological differences between the disciplinary perspectives--need to be explored and interrogated in order to maximize the benefits of interdisciplinary research. We conclude with considerations of the relationship between interdisciplinary research in a team and identity work of team members, and the implications this may have for research design, an area of research evaluation that certainly needs further exploration.

AB  - Life is a set of relationships in which countless factors interact and go on together. Each of the interacting factors is handled and used as a different discipline when the time comes. Depending on the spirit of the times and the structure of societies, the importance of some discipline areas may change and their place in the agenda may decline. However, this does not apply to mathematics. Because mathematics has served as a constant reference tool for the development of all other scientific fields. Activities that are put forward by ignoring this relationship of mathematics with other disciplines, turn out to be a waste of time and energy. This situation is also valid for educational activities. When mathematics is isolated from other disciplines, ambiguity of meaning and purpose emerges, loses its importance, and becomes a source of concern. The resulting confusion causes mathematics to be perceived as an academic obstacle to be overcome, rather than as a useful tool. It is in the hands of teachers to eliminate this perception and to teach mathematics as the common language of all disciplines. To achieve this, understanding must be changed, and mathematics must be taught based on an interdisciplinary approach.

AB  - Whereas economists do not traditionally address social harmony, and sociologists or political scientists do not usually tackle economic development, the interaction of social harmony and economic development has recently become an object of intense concern. In their aim to foster evolved rather than uprooted cultural values, the authors of this research note suggest an educational approach to promote the concept and the implementation of what they refer to as "authentic development." They propose interdisciplinary courses that include notions of history, sociology and economy. Their methodology is based on two main resources: (1) a textbook providing a broad historical survey tracing the development of 28 nations in the Americas; and (2) analytical parameters related to the extent of social interaction and income generation. Students carry out digital and group research and elaborate the conditions that generate social harmony, economic well-being and a better balance between them. The authors have already piloted their educational approach in four secondary schools in Antigua, Guatemala with 50 students aged 17-19. Most of them are now enrolled at local universities, but the impact of this course on their performance will only emerge over time.

AB  - Financial literacy is ideally suited to be integrated into mathematics courses and taught in an interdisciplinary manner. Students learn best and are motivated when tackling real-world meaningful questions. This article shares how elementary mathematics was applied to better understand the debate about raising the minimum wage and the United States National Debt. To serve as a guide for other teachers who wish to incorporate financial literacy into their mathematics courses and take an interdisciplinary approach, this article suggests readings, data sets, and pedagogical practices. Students were engaged and enthusiastic to work on problems that challenged their thinking about financial issues.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to examine whether, and how, an asynchronous online learning community pedagogical approach can address students' challenge of integrating disciplinary ideas into an interdisciplinary understanding. A quasi-experimental research design was conducted in which 51 undergraduate students were allocated into two groups who learned a similar asynchronous online interdisciplinary course. The two groups differed in the learning mode in which the courses were designed and taught: a learning community (LC) mode for the experimental group, versus an individual learning (IL) mode for the control group. We used a designated rubric to compare the quality of students' interdisciplinary understanding, as expressed in a synthesis essay each student wrote. Findings show that students' abilities to synthesize disciplinary ideas were significantly higher in the LC group. Since synthesis of disciplinary ideas is the goal and essence of interdisciplinarity, we view these findings as indicating a higher quality of interdisciplinary understanding among the LC mode students. This work demonstrates and delineates the potential of the LC approach to promote the development of interdisciplinary understanding in higher-education asynchronous online environments.

AB  - This book provides an international platform for educators from different STEM disciplines to present, discuss, connect, and develop collaborations in two inter-related ways: (1) sharing and discussing changes and innovations in individual discipline-based education in STEM/STEAM, and (2) sharing and discussing the development of interdisciplinary STEM/STEAM education. Possible relationships and connections between individual disciplines (like mathematics or physics) and STEM education remain under explored and the integration of traditionally individual discipline-based education in STEM education is far from balanced. Efforts to pursue possible connections among traditionally separated individual disciplines in STEM are not only necessary for the importance of deepening and expanding interdisciplinary research and education in STEM, but also for the ever-increasing need of reflecting on and changing how traditional school subjects (like mathematics or physics) can and should be viewed, taught, and learned. Scholars from eight countries/regions provide diverse perspectives and approaches on changes and innovations in STEM disciplinary and interdisciplinary education. Disciplinary and Interdisciplinary Education in STEM will be a great resource to students and researchers in STEM education as well as STEM curriculum developers and teacher educators internationally.

AB  - Student-created videos engage students' interests, creativity, and content knowledge and enrich collaborative learning in STEM education. These videos enhance critical thinking and analytical skills, which are essential tools in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This study presents the results of such an assignment across several STEM areas (biology, chemistry, exercise science, information technology, and mathematics) at a minority-serving, liberal arts higher education institution in the southeast region of the United States. Undergraduate students (n = 557) across varied, online course modalities (synchronous and asynchronous) were required to create four problem-solving videos 3-8 min in duration. Assessment tools included a self-assessment of learning gains survey given to control and experimental groups and a post-video creation survey given only to experimental groups. Grade data was also collected from all sections. Comparing the experimental and control groups, students showed a statistically significant gain in their ability to give oral presentations, create videos, and edit videos. Qualitative data from free-response questions corroborate these gains and suggest that students also grew in content knowledge and conceptual understanding through these assignments. Our study implements a multimedia theoretical framework which suggests students learn more effectively from consuming presentations with both auditory and visual components. Our results suggest students see similar gains from producing presentations with both auditory and visual components. Further our results suggest that multimedia production enhances students' presentation skills. From a practical perspective, this study suggests that faculty should incorporate student-created videos in online classes, which typically require oral presentations in person. Faculty are also advised to require oral and visual components within these videos to maximize learning gains from the perspective of a multimedia theoretical framework.

AB  - This article examines the ways in which interdisciplinary small groups were used in a school setting in order to drive students' "joyful engagement and" literacy instruction. Drawing from the work of Dr. Gholdy Muhammad in "Cultivating Genius" (2020) and "Unearthing Joy" (2023) we designed and implemented a summer program built around bolstering foundational literacy skills, with an intentional focus on helping students experience joy and making each and every child feel special. In keeping true to the work of Dr. Muhammad, we designed learning opportunities to develop students' intellect, skills, and criticality, and grounded those competencies in their identity. The program design--including structured small groups, texts chosen to empower and resonate with our specific population of students, multiple opportunities to connect with the same texts--fostered an experience in which students were immersed in literacy in an authentic and meaningful way. Throughout this article we discuss how we implemented this work with rising first through third graders in a collaborative effort with the Netter Center and Penn GSE and share teacher feedback as well as student data.

AB  - Launched in 2021 by a team of undergraduate students, university faculty, associate researchers, and community partners collaborating as genuine equals in a diverse team, the Together Time Story Sacks intergenerational literacies program forms part of an ongoing action research project aimed at understanding and addressing barriers that residents of rural regions face in accessing literacies programming. In this paper, six team members who co-imagined, co-designed and co-implemented Together Time but occupy different roles on and beyond university campuses reflect on the ways the students-as-partners (SaP) model, through which we brought Together Time to life, shaped both our process and our outputs during the project's pilot phase (September 2021-August 2022). We suggest that empowering humans with diverse academic and lived experiences through the SaP model is an Invigorating, messy, and, at times, nerve-racking process but an eminently fruitful enterprise that, in our opinion, produces rich research with and for our community while transforming our understanding of education and ourselves.

AB  - This study reports an empirical case study about using interdisciplinary approach in business English courses with 41 English majors in the Chinese university context. The methodologies are two-stage surveys, teacher reflection and participant observation. The results show that participants most preferred using specialist vocabulary and cross-cultural business communication as learning activities in using interdisciplinary approach. The challenges and difficulties in interdisciplinary learning included lack of professional vocabulary, business or interdisciplinary knowledge, business thinking skills and inadequate language skills. A majority of the participants perceived the interdisciplinary approach as effective, as they had improvements in business language, knowledge, communication and English ability. For improving and refining the interdisciplinary approach, participants suggested more practical and detailed business knowledge, practice-based activities, oral simulation and role-play activities, more detailed guidance and feedback in the writing tasks, more business cases with interesting videos, increasing Chinese native language explanation and producing a business English language corpus.

AB  - Cyberbiosecurity and workforce development in agriculture and the life sciences (ALS) is a growing area of need in the curriculum in higher education. Students that pursue majors related to ALS often do not include training in cyber-related concepts or expose the 'hidden curriculum' of seeking internships and jobs. Exposing students through workforce development training and hands-on engagement with industry professionals can provide learning opportunities to bridge the two and is an area of growth and demand as the workforce evolves. The objectives of this work were (1) to learn key concepts in cybersecurity, including data security, visualization, and analysis, to name a few, through class activities and engagement with professional partners and (2) to understand what knowledge students gained from participating in the course could transfer over for when they enter the workforce. Three themes emerged from the study where students, through direct engagement with industry partners, gained more insight about the industry applicable to their studies; they established work environment expectations for entering internships and official job placements and established ways in which the workforce development training informed their future careers.

AB  - The first step to access information; it is possible to perceive it by hearing, seeing and touching. It is necessary to make sense of this gained knowledge. Therefore, having some basic skills forms the basis of all disciplines. The purpose of this research is to determine skills through activities prepared with an interdisciplinary approach. The research was designed as a case study. Purposeful sampling method was used to determine the study group of the research; the study was conducted with third grade primary school teaching students as the study group. As data collection tools in the study; skill target list, in-class skill observation form, semi-structured interview form and student products were used. At the end of the research, the students' skills were determined and in terms of science skills; it was revealed that life skills and innovative thinking skills were sufficient, but scientific process skills were not sufficient. In terms of language skills, reading and writing skills were found to be at an intermediate level. However, speaking skills, which are self-expression skills, were found to be at a low level. In terms of mathematical skills, it was observed that their problem solving skills were high, but their level of using basic mathematical skills was low. Technology skills; it has been found that it is sufficient in terms of algorithm creation, but not in the context of science acquisition. In addition, it has been observed that the activities prepared through the task-oriented teaching method make the lesson interesting and are effective in revealing creativity.

AB  - Drawing on a social identity framework of mathematical development, the authors present a model, Improving Girls' Math Identity (IGMI), designed to address two key "leaks" in the female STEM pipeline: undergraduate and middle school. IGMI involves a supportive professional development network for undergraduate women preparing to transition into mathematics-related careers, and a mentorship program connecting middle school girls with these undergraduates to develop metacognition, problem-solving, and spatial skills. Preliminary evidence demonstrates that the model successfully strengthens undergraduates' problem-solving abilities, improves resilience and persistence in pursuing STEM fields, and increases investment in supporting future cohorts of women in mathematics and science.

AB  - Background: Course-based research experiences (CBREs) are highly valued for science learning and research. Most are discipline-centered, but there is a great deal of interest in developing them to promote interdisciplinarity. Yet, we have much to learn about how CBREs work, and even more to learn about how disciplinary diversity operates as an element of design to promote learning and research. Method: This mixed methods case study triangulates data on student experience, research networks, research artifacts and fieldnotes from participant observation to understand how disciplinary diversity factors into productive engagement for learning and research in an interdisciplinary course-based research experience (I-CBRE). Findings: A common boundary object (scientific paper) mediated developmental interactions among individuals both within and beyond the course. The boundary object also facilitated the productive engagement of students as instrumental actors in broader interdisciplinary research networks. Contribution: This study shows how an "object tracing" approach can be used to examine productivity in disciplinarily diverse scientific contexts, and reveals some of the distinctly syncretic moves that participants deploy to make progress as learners and researchers. Extending work by Engel and Conant, the study emphasizes the importance of designing for "productive syncretic engagement" in research experiences characterized disciplinary diversity.

AB  - This article aims to present our experience with transmedia storytelling in the design of materials selection, integrating two disciplines within an undergraduate mechanical engineering curriculum in Brazil. The students' project involved developing a narrative within the fictional universe of superheroes while exploring material properties using Ashby's methodology. The study aimed at answering two key questions: (1) Can transmedia storytelling contribute to student learning and skills development? and (2) What are the difficulties when using this methodology? Three evaluation approaches were used: test scores, students' perceptions, and our observations of students' skills development during this project. It was observed that participating students demonstrated significant test score improvements, indicating enhanced learning, with reported challenges in effort and skill development, particularly in story creation and teamwork. Ultimately, this project allowed students to achieve several cognitive learning objectives, fostering the development of crucial skills like communication and problem-solving. The use of transmedia storytelling in undergraduate engineering courses has the potential to facilitate the cultivation of essential competencies for future engineers across a varied range of cognitive levels, albeit requiring considerable time for planning strategies and creating content.

AB  - The inclusion of socioscientific issues (SSIs) in the science curriculum is a well-established trend internationally. Apart from claims about its innate value, one of the rationales for this approach is its potential for helping to counter declining interest and participation. SSIs involve the use of science and are of interest to society, also raising ethical and moral dilemmas. Introducing such problems presents a significant and usually cross-disciplinary challenge to curriculum developers and teachers. The aim of this paper is to examine how this challenge has been met when judged against contemporary views of the issues concerned. It first explores how SSIs have been interpreted in an important and innovative science course for students aged 14-16 in England, entitled Twenty First Century Science. This paper analyses the Twenty First Century Science textbooks, focusing in detail on two SSIs, reproductive genetic technology and climate change. For each of these issues, the key ideas present in the social science literature surrounding the problems are outlined. This review is then used as an analytical framework to examine how the issues are presented in the textbooks. It is argued in this paper that the perspectives the textbooks take on these issues largely do not include perspectives from social science disciplines. It goes on to suggest that the development of future SSI-based curricula needs to take account of these wider, often interdisciplinary, perspectives.

AB  - Few university students in Italy today possess the necessary skills to read a musical score. Consequently, alternative strategies are needed in order to visualize -- and hence to memorise -- music. This is the main reason underpinning the pilot laboratory of musical architecture, which was launched in 2019 as university workshop thanks to the collaboration of Matteo Pericoli. The educational project's objective did not consist in the investigation of the stylistic analogies between architecture and music, but rather in the utilization of a plastic discipline in order to stimulate students to reflect upon musical writing, and to arrive to the point of creating three-dimensional models of the analysed compositions. The instruction of this teaching unit was based on the principles of brainstorming, peer learning, processing and the drawing up of a report of the acquired knowledge. The models created during the didactic module made it possible for the students to give an architectural form to musical solutions and concepts of a varying complexity, which facilitated their related visualization. The project demonstrated what advantages might be derived from tools which are alternatives to the musical score in order to photograph specific aspects of musical writing.

AB  - The authors describe their approach to teaching a course on finite fields and combinatorial applications, including block designs and error-correcting codes, using a hybrid of lectures and active learning. Under the discussed classroom model, there are two lecture days and two discovery-based discussion days each week. Discussions center around group activities that build intuition for abstract concepts while avoiding excessive technical machinery. Teaching this course presents some unique challenges, as much of the content typically appears in a second course in abstract algebra, yet the students exhibit a wide range of mathematical preparation.

AB  - Advancing learners' agency is a key educational goal. The advent of personalized EdTech, which automatically tailor learning environments to individual learners, gives renewed relevance to the topic. EdTech researchers and practitioners are confronted with the same basic question: What is the right amount of agency to give to learners during their interactions with EdTech? This question is even more relevant for younger learners. Our aim in this paper is twofold: First, we outline and synthesize the ways in which agency is conceptualized in three key learning disciplines (philosophy, education, and psychology). We show that there are different types and levels of agency and various prerequisites for the effective exercise of agency and that these undergo developmental change. Second, we provide guiding principles for how agency can be designed for in EdTech for children. We propose an agency personalization loop in which the level of agency provided by the EdTech is assigned in an adaptive manner to strike a balance between allowing children to freely choose learning content and assigning optimal content to them. Finally, we highlight some examples from practice.

AB  - Mathematics Education Researchers' work in interdisciplinary research groups can be enriching and challenging in terms of communication, work processes, institutional support, and the translation of findings into viable results for existing disciplines. We contend that there is a need to explore practices (i.e., ways of being, operating, and interacting with others) in these groups. We searched Scopus and ERIC databases to find published works of interdisciplinary groups involving at least one Mathematics Education Researcher, which led us to five articles in peer-reviewed mathematics education journals. Thematic analysis of these articles helped us identify three practices: (1) working toward research interests, (2) cultivating trust and open-mindedness, and (3) understanding institutional support. We argue that consideration of these practices can facilitate Mathematics Education Researchers' interdisciplinary collaborations. Further research documenting Mathematics Education Researchers' interactions within interdisciplinary research groups is needed.

AB  - The present paper inquires whether a meticulous program designed to resolve Interdisciplinary Societal Dilemmas through dialogic argumentation advances epistemic practices. To delineate how epistemic practices are manifested in classroom discussions, we adopted the Actor-Network Theory (ANT), which explores the interactions and agencies of human and non-human actors. ANT analyses uncover the power these actors exert on each other and help recognize the networks that these actors create or dissolve. They also delineate how epistemic practices emerge and are shaped in these networks. We identified four epistemic practices in the discussions: (1) taking a reasoned position, (2) integrating knowledge from different disciplines, (3) weighing pros and cons before taking a complex position, and (4) role-playing in a democratic game. We show that the type of discourse developed in the program was mostly dialogic argumentation. In addition, we demonstrate how teachers often inhibit these advancements. Indeed, in the case of integrating knowledge from different disciplines, teachers' role is central, but the emerged actors' network is often nondialogic. Moreover, we show how non-human actors shape the interactions in networks as well as the formation of knowledge and agency. We conclude that: (a) the design of activities for resolving interdisciplinary societal dilemmas provides many opportunities for advancing epistemic practices, (b) these practices are mostly advanced through dialogic argumentation, but (c) more efforts should be invested in affording interdisciplinary argumentation.

AB  - Institutional transformation and inclusion have slowly become more prominent in the strategies of historically white institutions in South Africa. Despite these efforts, progress towards these goals has been limited. In this article, we reflect on our conversations about transforming our curricula and teaching practices as an interdisciplinary Community of Practice. Our conversations grappled with the lack of curricular transformation at Stellenbosch University, despite its aspirational transformation plan. We argue that difficult interdisciplinary conversations are key to interrupting our teaching practices and are crucial in the decolonising process. These conversations must be ongoing and enduring, because through sharing our stories we support agents of curriculum transformation in our different contexts. Our conceptual conversations explored various theories about decoloniality, and here we employ ubuntu pedagogy, as well as the concepts of redistribution, recognition and representation from social justice theory. We harness the collaborative energy of an interdisciplinary Community of Practice, with its associated storytelling, reading, writing and reflecting to harness the diversity of personal and disciplinary perspectives. We include some reflective vignettes to illustrate our process. Contribution: The relevance of this study, beyond our contexts, arises from a gap in the decolonising process, from its theory to its practice. We argue that even a good institutional transformation plan will not guarantee the decoloniality of curricula. More is needed. Systemic change is needed, and difficult interdisciplinary conversations are part of this process. There must be recognition and representation of marginalised voices and specific context-related redistribution of curricula, so that transformation plans and theories can take effect.

AB  - This study explored how the interdisciplinary nature of a Faculty Learning Community (FLC) promoted the professional development of participants' teaching. Participants reported gaining new insights into implementing active learning and mitigating student resistance to learning (the FLC topic). FLC members experienced a connection and affinity with instructors outside their discipline due to the interdisciplinary nature of the FLC. The confidential and collaborative environment of the FLC was promoted by the absence of hierarchy across participants. Key roles that facilitated and leveraged the faculty development within the FLC are discussed. [Note: The page range (7-16) shown via the URL is incorrect. The correct page range is 51-59.]

AB  - To present interdisciplinary teams (IDTs) as foundational to effective assessment for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This conceptual paper encourages IDTs by (a) presenting practice guidelines and research supporting effective IDTs; (b) describing vital team characteristics; (c) introducing a new model of teaming practices with a clinical case example; and (d) discussing IDT implementation barriers and recommendations specific to professionals supporting students with ASD. IDT members (e.g., school psychologists, teachers, behavior analysts, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists) should use assessment results to navigate goal-setting and intervention planning allowing students with ASD to benefit from several therapeutic and educational approaches. Skilled professionals support a student's educational trajectory, increasing the likelihood of meeting developmental and academic milestones, and, ultimately leading to better life opportunities.

AB  - The emotional intensities of gifted students affect not only their learning, but the way they live and see the world. This article examines the Theory of Positive Disintegration of Dabrowski (1964, 1972) to explore the inner world of the gifted. The five levels of development and five overexcitabilities of Dabrowski represent an abundance of physical, sensual, creative, intellectual, and emotional energy which cause inner turmoil, but can result in creative endeavors. The benefits of interdisciplinary learning to meet the emotional needs of gifted students are presented with examples of interdisciplinary studies of justice and forensics. XQ Institute is introduced as a resource for interdisciplinary study and significant learning, and a XQ school Da Vinci RISE High is discussed. Another resource Teachers Network is explored with an interdisciplinary study of Story Quilting. The culminating project of this article is an interdisciplinary study of giftedness as a theme to help advanced learners better understand themselves.

AB  - This article describes methods for operationalizing the concept of interdisciplinarity. The methods respond to the characteristics of giftedness and strategies of differentiation. In selecting and using an interdisciplinary strategy, educators need to consider the compatibility of the purpose or objective of interdisciplinarity to the curriculum and/or instructional objective or goal, readiness of learners, availability of resources, and allocation of time for teaching and learning. Moreover, teachers and students need to value open-ended learning and the value of inquiry.

AB  - The Integrated Concentration in Science (iCons) 4-year program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst was designed to promote interdisciplinary STEM collaboration in the solution of real-world problems and encourage student independence and interdependence through a student-centered teaching approach that structures all projects as group endeavors. Researchers evaluated the first- and second-year courses to determine whether instructors implemented the student-driven curriculum as planned and how students perceived the courses with respect to pedagogy and collaboration experiences. Results of a mixed-methods study that included observations, interviews, and surveys showed that instructors implemented a student-centered approach as planned; provided help only when students asked for it or obviously needed scaffolded support; and answered most student queries with questions intended to promote discussion, research, and reframing. Students expressed satisfaction with the courses and felt their experiences aligned with their expectations of receiving more guidance than direct instruction. At the end of each course, students confirmed that they had, in fact, received good guidance, feedback, and critique from their instructors and little in the way of lectures. Students also expressed that their collaboration skills improved, especially in the areas of group communication and sharing their ideas.

Mathematics students and TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) students from the USA and Germany engaged in a virtual exchange project to reflect upon local and global issues that can be seen from more than one perspective. The topics they chose are all related to the domain of 'values' in the RFCDC. The students created short stories in which they address these issues and collaborated in the production of a multimodal, digital storybook. The aim of this article is to examine how education for democracy can be fostered through interdisciplinary intercultural citizenship projects. The unit of analysis is the teaching concept, with a focus on the results of the interdisciplinary collaborative process and its outcomes.

AB  - The prevailing civil engineering graduates' technical writing and oral presentation-related drawbacks have necessitated the design and implementation of demand-driven courses applying interdisciplinary pedagogy. This study investigates civil engineering academia-industry interdisciplinary contents, methods, and situations needed to design technical communication course. The analysis which engaged students, instructors, and professionals from industries employed sequential mixed methods design which grounds the quantitative analysis with exploratory detailed interviews. This revealed that classroom, internship, and industry contexts are essential foundations of interaction for stakeholders. Oral presentation, writing, reading, and evaluating technical documents infused with engineering design processes of initiating, designing, managing, and evaluating civil engineering projects were the contents selected from the needs analyses. Basic skills, rhetoric analysis, ethical and critical issues, and teamwork were the precedence pedagogical frames preferred to establish the methods of technical communication instruction. These interdisciplinary needs analyses imply how technical communication-related courses should be designed to enhance students' multiple competencies better than solely addressing instrumentally codified skills that deny the author and the discourse community.

AB  - Purpose: Doctoral candidates possess specialized knowledge that could support sustainability transitions. Doctoral education, however, often focusses on discipline-specific topics and working methods, making it difficult to "see the bigger picture". This summer school on wood construction gathered doctoral candidates from different fields to explore how solutions to complex sustainability issues could be found by working together across disciplines and by engaging multiple stakeholders. The purpose of this study is to report the pedagogical approaches taken and to understand whether these fostered the candidates' ability to develop systemic solutions and professional competency. Design/methodology/approach: Twenty doctoral candidates from various backgrounds participated in a two-week summer school organized by a consortium of four universities. Interdisciplinary groups worked on real-life challenges using a systemic approach to co-create tangible solutions. To support the creation of socio-technical innovations, stakeholders and experts from different fields were involved. The participants completed two questionnaires during the summer school to help elucidate their learning experiences. Findings: The doctoral candidates showed strong willingness to cooperate across disciplines, though they found it important to connect this learning experience to their research. The candidates reported that the experience enhanced their ability to work in a multidisciplinary capacity. The experience identified a solid basis for interdisciplinary learning principles that could be replicated. Originality/value: The summer school focussed on an innovative learning experience based on a systems thinking approach and the development of interdisciplinary capacity in the research-business ecosystem.

AB  - Leadership scholar-practitioners seldom need to be sold on the benefits of working together. Rather leadership educators want to know how to teach adult leadership scholar-practitioners how to work together across differences. The aim of this paper is to guide leadership development practitioners on how to nurture leadership that can address the complex problems the changing global arena demand of us today and into the future. We argue when preparing adult leadership scholar-practitioners, using adult learning theories and paying attention to the interdisciplinary roots of the field of leadership might lead to better learning and engagement with real world challenges. In this paper we present a leadership development model we call interdisciplinary leadership. First, we discuss the interdisciplinary roots of leadership. Second, we describe interdisciplinary leadership as a tapestry--an intricate combination of identities, practices, and outcomes used to prepare people to address complex problems. Finally, we describe the mission, structure, curriculum, and instructional strategies that can be used by leadership educators when applying interdisciplinary leadership. This model acknowledges the identity, practices, and outcomes needed to develop scholar-practitioners of leadership and provides practical techniques to help leadership educators prepare leaders to work together across differences to address complex problems.

AB  - This article explores how the past mobilities of academics affect their current research output (and its multidisciplinarity). Five types of mobility are used simultaneously in the analysis. Field mobility and transnational educational mobility are associated with academics' educational path, whereas transnational job mobility, intra-sectoral job mobility and inter-sectoral job mobility refer to their career path. The analysis is based on a representative sample of academics based in Hong Kong and Macau. Results show that intra-sectoral job mobility (up to a threshold) and transnational job mobility positively affect research output and its multidisciplinarity, whereas inter-sectoral job mobility, field mobility and transnational educational mobility exert slight or no effect. Nested analyses of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and non-STEM academics as well as experienced and junior academics offer further insight into the roles of these mobilities. Impacts of mobile experience were stronger among junior than senior academics, and in STEM fields than non-STEM fields. The article discusses these findings along with the significance of considering mobilities rather than mobility when analysing academic trajectories and the determinants of academic research production.

AB  - The increasing complexity of society's sustainability issues requires new educational approaches that facilitate transversal skills and competencies suitable for the 21st century. Students must be equipped with discipline-specific expertise or technical skill; but also competencies to collaborate across disciplines in creating innovative solutions to complex problems. This paper explores whether a problem-based learning environment focusing on creativity facilitates transdisciplinary engagement and creative competencies and to what extent this manifests into transdisciplinary career paths and creative mindsets in a life-long learning perspective. An analysis of interviews with graduates from a transdisciplinary program, Creative Genius, at Aalborg University indicates that a pedagogical approach focusing on the embodiment of creative competencies helps prepare students to transition from student to professional and equip them to engage in transdisciplinary and complex problem-solving in industry and society. Based on the results, the paper proposes a model for creative transdisciplinary thinking and suggests a focus on creative self-efficacy as an essential learning outcome in transdisciplinary PBL environments.

AB  - Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) are a promising integrated educational tool for customizing formal education using intelligent instruction or feedback. In recent decades, ITSs have transformed teaching and learning and associated research. This study examined the evolution and future trends of ITS research with scientometric methods. First, a dataset comprising 1173 relevant publications was compiled from the Web of Science Core Collection databases (including the Science Citation Index Expanded and the Social Science Citation Index). Then, the publication distributions by time, author, institution, country/region, and knowledge sources were analyzed to reveal the multidisciplinary integration paths. Dataset co-occurrence and co-citation analyses were conducted to identify the most popular research issues, the research chronology, and the emerging trends. It was found that: (1) ITS research has been growing in recent years. According to the Price literature exponential growth curve, this field is still in its initial stage while has high potential; (2) computer science, education, psychology, and engineering were the main ITS research knowledge sources, with ITS social science publications since 2007 being higher than ITS natural sciences publications; (3) interactive learning environments, student modeling, teaching/learning strategies, and machine learning have been the most popular research foci; and (4) the Coh-Metrix, problem-centered instruction, and STEM are the current research trends.

AB  - Unprecedented growth has occurred in the development of undergraduate journals over the past 10 years. Yet, despite the numerous benefits that research shows for authors, editors, and faculty mentors involved in undergraduate publications, academic institutions have struggled to sustain student journals over time. Based on the authors' experience with launching and sustaining a journal over six years and data collected from five years of exit interviews, reflective writing, and surveys, they discuss 10 key steps for creating and sustaining an undergraduate journal and overcoming the obstacles linked to such an endeavor.

AB  - Though today's problems are interconnected, complicated, and unpredictable, students continue to gain knowledge in discrete, standardized disciplinary silos. When subject integration is discussed in STEM and STEAM (STEM + Arts) literature, there is little consensus on what constitutes or should constitute integration of the disciplines. Pre-service teachers have been shown to teach in ways that combine the methods and skills they gained during their education with an imitation of the manner in which they were taught. This highlights one of the major institutional barriers underlying integrated STEAM education, as most pre-service teachers are taught, and therefore expect to teach, specialized subjects. This case study used a transdisciplinary approach to problem-based learning and invited pre-service teachers to apply integrated STEAM and practices of making to provide solutions addressing student dropout rates in their local district. Findings show the group struggled to move beyond their initial solution, even though it did not adequately address the problem. Further, this research indicates that students need constructive criticism from an outside voice in addition to support from a mentor to increase their engagement and success.

AB  - Today's global society creates an environment characterised by complex problems, solutions to which require transcendence of traditional discipline-based boundaries, and new forms of knowledge-sharing. Higher education (HE) has a central role in interdisciplinary knowledge creation and dissemination, reinforced by funding councils, professional bodies and government policy. That notwithstanding, there is currently no recognised best practice approach to interdisciplinary working in UK HE institutes. The aim of this paper is to develop a best practice model to facilitate interdisciplinarity within the UK HE sector, focusing on teaching and learning and the student learning experience. Based on the results of an exploratory and empirical enquiry, a HE Interdisciplinary Model (HIM) of best practice is proposed. The HIM is informed by the development of four themes and six ensuing enablers from a synthesis of perceived barriers, possible facilitators and potential solutions to interdisciplinarity within UK HE. However, further research is necessary to validate the proposed model.

AB  - This paper details a new dimension to an existing internship program developed in response to the effects of COVID-19 in a creative industries faculty at a large Australian university. Recent changes to workplace activities, as a result of the pandemic, have offered an opportunity to test a mode of internships in which students work and engage remotely, via on-line modes, with a workplace. Analysis of the offering is conducted using the Community of Inquiry framework. Outcomes confirm the concept of remote internships as appropriate strategies that can not only support improved student retention in the short term, but offer new opportunities for enriched, broadened and more equitable internship experiences. Workplace-based internships, while offering high impact and authentic experiences, are often difficult for many students who are unable to attend workplaces to complete the required hours due to a range of other work, study, and life factors. The new remote internship, seeks to overcome these barriers.

AB  - This article discusses the potential of multidisciplinary peer-mentoring groups to facilitate individual and institutional change. To do this, we view peer mentoring as a form of "critical education praxis" (Mahon et al. 2019), the purpose of which is to create a space for reflexive thinking and asking critical questions. The data were collected by interviewing all thirteen participants -- doctoral students and more established scholars -- of a multidisciplinary peer-mentoring pilot project. The results show a variety of both individual changes and desired changes within the university, which were brought into view as a result of the sharing of experiences, views and ideas in an open, confidential, multidisciplinary space. Based on these results, we argue that multidisciplinary peer mentoring has a high potential to offer an excellent space for collaborative, critical dialogue, which could ultimately facilitate change among individual academics, but also potentially more widely within higher education institutions.

AB  - Background: Although mindfulness and yoga interventions for youth continue to gain support, few studies have proposed a systematic way to study the implementation and fidelity of these approaches. Objective: The current study developed and tested the feasibility of measurement procedures for a yoga and mindfulness curriculum implemented in schools through a community partnership. This was accomplished in two studies. Method: In study 1 we created and analyzed the psychometric properties of a fidelity observation tool using data from 165 observations of students receiving a district-wide school yoga and mindfulness intervention. The findings were subsequently refined and implemented to collect 91 additional observations in study 2. Results: In study 1, a principle components analysis revealed a 3-factor solution across items, with 10 of 17 items reliably rated but only 4 of those 10 items rated as satisfactory or better fidelity. The fidelity observation tool was then revised and implemented in study 2, with 13 of 17 items reliably rated and 5 meeting satisfactory or better fidelity. Conclusions: The findings from both studies indicated that yoga and mindfulness interventions for youth can be feasibly implemented and reliably measured within school settings, although there were some limitations in measuring both the content and process of such interventions.

AB  - In this paper, we report on an intervention across continents and disciplines that brought together differently positioned students in South Africa and the USA. A collaboration between our classes--an introductory Geographic Information Systems (GIS) class in South Africa and a composition class in the United States--was facilitated and investigated by us. The point of departure of the intervention was to service socially just and anti-racist pedagogies through experimentation. Drawing on posthumanist, feminist, and new materialist theory, we investigate the hauntings of several prejudices and stereotypical tropes that foster racism. We link the concept of hauntology to Plumwood's (1993) theorization of dualisms. We then draw a cartography of geomatics education in South Africa, focusing on the subjectification of geomatics graduates in particular and engineering graduates in general. We then zoom to our collaboration, and focus on several interactions amongst the cohorts to show instances of hauntings that perpetuate anti-Black, anti-Muslim, and related silences. We find that analysis of dualisms can highlight racist hauntings, and can also provide guidance on how to flatten hierarchies. Our transdisciplinary activism allows us to harness the positivity of difference to trouble binaries. We conclude with some thoughts on pandemic pedagogy in an unequal world.

In this brief report the author suggests that by shifting the conceptualization of the field from "interdisciplinary" to "transdisciplinary," art therapists will find clarity and strength without needing a new definition or ways of practicing. When examined from a transdisciplinary perspective, the definition of art therapy is not limited by conceptual perspectives or compartmentalized by theoretical approaches. A transdisciplinary perspective embraces diversity, flexibility, and innovation while offering a sense of autonomy, inclusion, and collaboration for the field. This report outlines the characteristics of a transdisciplinary perspective and demonstrates that when we look through a transdisciplinary lens, art therapy--as it stands today--is a well-defined and vibrant field.

AB  - Services to children are often provided through a transdisciplinary model, particularly when students are receiving special education services and supports. Given the individual and diverse needs of these children, professionals often work collaboratively in evaluating students, interpreting results, and making recommendations for appropriate services. Professionals are expected to have prior knowledge regarding the expertise of their trans-disciplinary peers. However, they may have never been presented with this opportunity during their preparation in higher education. Therefore, a project was designed to address this deficiency at two very different locations: a university campus-based child care center, and a residential facility supporting homeless women and young children experiencing poverty. Participants were 109 undergraduate psychology students in an advanced developmental psychology class, 93 exceptional education graduate students, and 24 undergraduate speech/language pathology students. In groups consisting of students from each discipline, students completed developmental screenings on 2-3 children ranging from 1 month to 5 years of age. Results of a pre-posttest evaluation indicated that students were significantly more comfortable working in transdisciplinary collaborative groups and more interested in working in transdisciplinary groups in a future professional capacity after completing this service-learning project.

AB  - Over the past decade, integrated STEM education research has emerged as an international concern, creating around it an imperative for technological and disciplinary innovation and a global resurgence of interest in teaching and learning to code at the K-16 levels. At the same time, issues of democratization, equity, power and access, including recent decolonizing efforts in public education, are also beginning to be acknowledged as legitimate issues in STEM education. Taking a reflexive approach to the intersection of these concerns, this book presents a collection of papers making new theoretical advances addressing two broad themes: Transdisciplinary Approaches in STEM Education and Bodies, Hegemony and Decolonization in STEM Education. Within each theme, praxis is of central concern including analyses of teaching and learning that re-imagines disciplinary boundaries and domains, the relationship between Art and STEM, and the design of learning technologies, spaces and environments. In addition to graduate research seminars at the Masters and PhD levels in Learning Sciences, Science Education, Educational Technology and STEM education, this book could also serve as a textbook for graduate and pre-service teacher education courses.

AB  - Design of Mechanism is a standard subject in Mechatronics and Mechanical Engineering majors. Different methods and tools are used by lecturers to teach the subject. In this work, we investigate the impact on the competencies development by implementing a project-based learning methodology in a mechanism course. For this, we analyze the performance of students from two different groups. The first group is taught in a traditional fashion developing a final project just related to the discipline, and the second group is taught in a multidisciplinary context where the final goal is to develop a complex project where the mechanisms subject is one complementary subject with the others. The development of engineering competencies, declared for this course, is presented for both groups through the evaluation of different aspects; also, a survey of satisfaction from the students of both groups is presented. Overall, the results show that the multidisciplinary project-based learning method, having a nonacademic training partner as sponsor and solving a real nonacademic project, improves the development of competencies related to practical applications and increases the motivation and appreciation of the student towards the mechanism learning discipline.

AB  - Purpose: Collaboration between universities and industry is increasingly perceived as a vehicle to enhance innovation. Educational institutions are encouraged to build partnerships and multidisciplinary projects based around real-world open problems. Projects need to benefit student learning, not only the organisations looking for innovations. The context of this study is a multidisciplinary innovation project, as experienced by the students of an University of Applied Sciences in Finland. The purpose of this paper is to unfold students' conceptions of the learning experience, to help teachers and curriculum designers to organise optimal conditions and processes, and support competence development. The research question was: How do students in higher professional education experience their learning in a multidisciplinary innovation project? Design/methodology/approach: The study took a phenomenographic approach. The data were collected in the form of weekly diaries, maintained by the cultural management and social services students (n=74) in a mandatory multidisciplinary innovation project in professional higher education in Finland. The diary data were analysed using thematic inductive analysis. Findings: The results of the study revealed that students' understood the learning experience in relation to solvable conflicts and unusual situations they experienced during the project, while becoming aware of and claiming their collaborative agency and internalising phases of an innovation process. The competences as learning outcomes that students could name as developed related to content knowledge, different personal characteristics, social skills, emerging leadership skills, creativity, future orientation, social skills, technical, crafting and testing skills and innovation implementation-related skills, such as marketing, sales and entrepreneurship planning skills. However, future orientation and implementation planning skills showed more weakly than other variables in the data. Practical implications: The findings suggest that curriculum design should enable networked, student-led and teacher supported pedagogical innovation processes that involve a whole path from future thinking and idea development through prototyping to implementation planning of the novel solution. Teachers promote deep comprehension of the innovation process, monitor and ease the pain of conflict if it threatens motivation, offer assessment tools and help in recognising gaps in individual competences and development needs, promote more future-oriented, concrete and implementable outcomes, and facilitate in bridging from innovation towards entrepreneurship planning. Originality/value: The multidisciplinary innovation project described in this study provides a pedagogical way to connect higher education to the practises of society. These results provide encouraging findings for organising multidisciplinary project activities between education and working life. The paper, therefore, has significant value for teachers and entrepreneurship educators in designing curriculum and facilitating projects. The study promotes the dissemination of innovation development programmes in between education and work organisations also in other than technical and commercial fields.

AB  - An extensional definition of interdisciplinarity--that is, a definition that identifies the types of practices that are interdisciplinary--is explained, advocated, and developed. The criteria for identifying appropriate interdisciplinary practices are outlined. Such a definition is useful both for interdisciplinary teachers and researchers who reflect on the nature of interdisciplinary practice, and for students and administrators who wish to better appreciate what interdisciplinarity involves. Critically, it facilitates identification of where along a continuum from interdisciplinarity to disciplinarity a particular field, course, or project lies. Some scholars or fields might then decide, and--importantly--know how, to become more interdisciplinary. Such a definition is arguably necessary, though hardly sufficient, in our efforts to advocate for better administrative treatment of interdisciplinarity.

AB  - This paper unpacks ambiguities in the field of interdisciplinarity studies (IDS), explores where they come from and how they inhibit consolidation of the field. The paper takes its point of departure in two central fault lines in the literature: the relationship between interdisciplinarity and disciplinarity and the question of whether integration is a necessary prerequisite for interdisciplinarity. Opposite positions on the fault lines are drawn out to identify sources of ambiguities, and to examine whether the positions are irreconcilable - or disagreements that may continue to coexist in a consolidated field. It is argued that if we envisage a consolidated field of IDS, there is a need to develop common ground which calls for scholars of ID to be more explicit about the meanings they ascribe to ID than we see today when the sliding between the epistemological and political dimensions of the field may go unnoticed. It is suggested that whereas ambiguity may be unwanted in the epistemological dimension, it may be quite useful in the political dimension. A systematic comparison of opposite positions offers a common frame of reference for a more productive dialogue between different positions. The analysis shows that as to integration, the difference between opposite positions can be reconciled, whereas in the relation between interdisciplinarity and disciplinarity, the positions are antagonistic and logically exclude each other. The analysis suggests that it is the premise of integration that creates the conditions of possibility for "relabelling" interdisciplinarity and for using the "silo" for disciplines.

AB  - Researchers typically embark on interdisciplinarity after the acquisition of disciplinary expertise. This article explores the possibility of teaching interdiciplinarity to undergraduate students who have not yet mastered or are in the process of mastering a discipline or disciplines. It focuses on junior-year students in the Whittier Scholars Program at Whittier College and uses the term "interdisciplinary consciousness" to describe their developing awareness of multiple disciplinary perspectives. The authors adapt the Toolbox dialogue approach from its usual use with teams of older researchers trained in disciplines for application to pre-disciplinary undergraduates and examine its effectiveness as a method both for fostering and for measuring interdisciplinary consciousness.

AB  - Despite the often-crucial roles played by music within theatre-based public health promotion strategies, theoretical explorations regarding music within applied theatre literatures remain largely underdeveloped. This article highlights musicking -- a reconceptualization of music from an object to a participatory act that can profoundly influence relationships and spaces -- as an approach to understanding the various roles that music can play within applied theatre programmes. The article draws from ethnographic accounts of an HIV/AIDS applied theatre group in South Africa to advocate for increased recognition of musicking as a robust theoretical and methodological component within applied theatre praxis.

AB  - The reliance on the use of virtual learning environments, particularly computer-supported collaborative learning environments, is increasing in higher education institutions. This paper explores the perceived sociability of a virtual learning environment after it was implemented in an interdisciplinary project-based course in a higher education institute in Norway due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It describes the validation of a sociability scale in a sample of 1,611 students. The paper also reports on differences in perceived sociability according to gender, field of study and personality and the extent to which perceptions of sociability relate to the experience of a sudden change from a real-life learning environment to a virtual one. The results of this large-scale study suggest that the Norwegian version of the sociability scale can be used as a valid and reliable instrument to measure the perceived sociability of a virtual learning environment in the context of self-organized student project teams.

AB  - A growing evidence base has demonstrated the value of Forest School as an outdoor learning approach which supports a range of benefits including improved physical, social and mental wellbeing, increased confidence and self-esteem and the development of problem-solving skills. However, critics of Forest School have argued that a lack of theoretical coherence and detail risks the misinterpretation of Forest School and its pedagogy by both practitioners and researchers. This paper responds to these concerns, establishing a comprehensive and detailed theoretical framework for Forest School. Through a thorough examination of evidence supporting Forest School delivery, we examine the theoretical keystones of this pedagogical approach to inform an interdisciplinary theoretical understanding of Forest School. We argue that Forest School is a particular socially constructed approach to outdoor education, which is informed by social constructivist experiential learning theory. This is driven by two core components. First, play-pedagogy, which includes the opportunity to experience risk and be creative. Next, biophilic interaction, which examines the human innate desire to be in nature. This is informed by the cultural origins of Forest School development as underpinned by Nordic notions of "friluftsliv" and by theories of place attachment. Taken together, this theoretical framework considers the breadth of knowledge that underpins Forest School and recognises its growing evidence base, which positions it as a rich and valuable pedagogical approach.

AB  - Purpose: Historically, graduate education's goal was to prepare academics; now most science, technology, engineering and/or mathematics (STEM) graduate students (GSs) go on to nonacademic careers. STEM GSs must be equipped for success regardless of career aspirations, which can be done by strengthening GSs' professional identities. This study aims to explore an interdisciplinary partnership designed to strengthen STEM GS professional identity. Design/methodology/approach: The STEM Partnership Project (SPP), asked STEM GSs to serve as disciplinary experts and teach STEM content to elementary teacher candidates (TCs) so the TCs could design and teach an elementary science lesson. GSs also enrolled in a one-credit course to support SPP participation and activities. Over five semesters, the authors collected data from 28 STEM GSs across different disciplines and degree programs in the form of course assignments, surveys and interviews. Findings: The SPP supported the development of a professional identity by having GSs serve as and feel like experts; increasing GSs' sense of belonging in their field; increasing GSs' self-confidence that they could (learn to) teach a wide variety of audiences; and raising GSs' awareness of their ability to serve others via their field. Originality/value: The SPP's outcomes were consistent across STEM disciplines, did not require GSs to take on large amounts of coursework, nor did it cost much beyond materials for the various lessons. Furthermore, the key components that strengthened GSs' professional identities could be adapted for different contexts and institutions.

AB  - Co-teaching and an interdisciplinary curriculum are increasingly present in public education, yet teacher candidates often lack appropriate models in teacher preparation coursework. In this article, we used self-study research methods to explore our development and enactment of a co-taught, interdisciplinary instructional unit that spanned two methods courses, and how we negotiated disciplinary differences, the curriculum and instruction of the unit, and instructor status in the co-taught interdisciplinary unit.

AB  - The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) proposes to enhance active learning and student protagonism in order to improve academic performance. In this sense, different methodologies are emerging to create scenarios for self-regulation of their learning. In this study the cooperative, collaborative and interdisciplinary learning methodologies were compared in Spanish universities. The main objectives were to evaluate their effects in higher education and to explore the relationship between perceived group cooperation and self-perceived ability to work in a group, differences between educational Spanish contexts, educational methodologies and gender. To this end, a quasi-experimental design was carried out. Data analysis included the descriptive metrics, correlations and analysis of variance to evaluate the differences among pedagogical methods, their effects on cooperative learning, teamwork outcomes and gender differences, comprising a total of 229 students in Spain from Psychology, Early Childhood Education, Primary Education and Computer Engineering completed the two questionnaires. Results showed that the highest correlation between perceived cooperative activity and self-perceived ability to work in a group was found among computer science students, especially among women, suggesting that the interdisciplinary learning focused on software tool development may be the most effective methodology to improve teamwork and cooperative learning outcomes. Despite these findings concern only to Spanish universities, limiting the generalizability of results, the interdisciplinary methodology seems promising for improving both teaching quality and teamwork skills. The learning methodologies of interdisciplinary projects may therefore need to be implemented within the framework of cooperative and collaborative methodologies.

AB  - Context-based STEM learning has been proven to be useful as interdisciplinary storylines to regulate the flow and sequencing of lessons to obtain expected outcomes. This case study pilot project aims to contextualise scientific learning to local culture. Student groups sampled from two schools in distinct social backgrounds, reflected varied Indian population. Pre-service middle school science and social studies teachers conducted eight lessons as an interdisciplinary storyline with a few natural and social science concepts utilising an artefact representing the cultural history of India for seventh-graders. Data were collected through manually recording of students' responses and products made during class activities; researchers' observations and pre-service teachers' feedback about finding solutions to the difficulties faced. In order to address three research questions about socio-cultural context in science-curriculum design, student adoption of 3D learning, and overcoming teachers' challenges, a thematic analysis of data through the lens of five science practices and one crosscutting concept was performed. This study supported context-based STEM learning for the twenty-first century and strengthened cultural anchoring from an early stage implying the need for teacher professional development, curricular reform, and school infrastructure improvements to support policy implementation. Such researches may be extended to varied sociocultural contexts and discipline combinations to offer broader perspectives.

AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, restricted access to in-person facilities and traditional experiential learning activities meant that new, online solutions were needed to facilitate student learning/development across the disciplines of Allied Health and Engineering. Purpose: This article describes research conducted as part of an interdisciplinary Dietetic/Electronic Engineering project to evaluate student experiences of online problem-based learning (PBL) activities in addressing this necessity. Methodology/Approach: The authors implemented a specific, health technology-based assignment using an online PBL approach to evaluate and develop the effectiveness of this approach for students' experiential learning. Surveys and observations were used to evaluate the project effectiveness. Findings/Conclusions: Participating students reported on their experiences of working in interdisciplinary teams, focusing on aspects such as knowledge gained, collaboration, perspective, facilitation and experiential learning. Students identified enhanced learning and research skills as some key benefits. Drawbacks identified included difficulties associated with the online environment, such as synchronisation and remoteness. Implications: The use of interdisciplinary assignments highlights the many advantages/benefits which experiential pedagogies have in supporting students to integrate and apply their knowledge to a real-world problem space. The ability to connect student engagement and motivation to the development of critical thinking skills appears to enhance problem-solving in the student work.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms through which social media (SNS) addiction influences college students' academic performance. We developed an integrated model of the relationship between SNS addiction and academic performance based on the dual-systems theory. A total of 251 college students participated in this study. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the empirical data. The results indicated that self-control mediated the impact of social media addiction on college students' grade point average (GPA). Moreover, social media addiction had a positive impact on their anxiety and stress, which in turn negatively moderated the positive relationship between self-control and GPA. Educators can use these findings to improve the academic performance of college students with SNS addiction.

AB  - Intercultural dialogue is an essential component of intercultural citizenship, i.e., students' ability to address complex societal issues. With more interconnected problems comes an increased need for students to communicate and collaborate with people from differing backgrounds. This pilot study combined the framework of Intercultural Citizenship (ICit), and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) related to the environment with Virtual Reality (VR) and Virtual Exchange (VE) to investigate the students' application of ICit. Fifteen learners of German, consisting of university students of German in the United States and international students studying at a German university, met in dyads or triads in VR over six weeks and worked on independent projects, each focusing on a societal environmental issue of their choice. Analyses of the data (pre-project and postproject surveys, weekly journal entries, project presentations) revealed that participants applied their intercultural competence. Some students showed a shift of emphasis: While at the beginning they were more concerned with linguistic elements of the German language they were focused on the topic of their project toward the end of the project. Finally, participants appreciated the VR setting for building relationships, communicating, and applying intercultural competence in an authentic setting. This study underscores the potential of advancing ICit and intercultural communicative competence through a VR-VE format, emphasizing VR-VE's potential in fostering relationship-building between students. This format offers students practical experience in navigating and appreciating the complexities of intercultural communication.

AB  - The significance of interdisciplinary learning has been well-recognized by higher education institutions. However, when teaching interdisciplinary learning to junior undergraduate students, their limited disciplinary knowledge and underrepresentation of students from some disciplines can hinder their learning performance. ChatGPT's ability to engage in human-like conversations and massive knowledge grounded in different disciplines holds promise in enriching undergraduate students with the disciplinary knowledge that they lack. In this exploratory study, we engaged 130 undergraduate students in a three-condition quasi-experiment to examine how ChatGPT influences their demonstrated and perceived interdisciplinary learning quality, as measured by their online posts and surveys, respectively. The content analysis results show that overall, students' online posts could be coded into four interdisciplinary learning dimensions: diversity, disciplinary grounding, cognitive advancement, and integration. The means of the first three dimensions were close to the middle level (ranging from 0.708 to 0.897, and the middle level is 1), whereas the mean score of integration was relatively small (i.e., 0.229). Students under the ChatGPT condition demonstrated improved disciplinary grounding. Regarding their perceived interdisciplinary learning quality, we did not find significant differences across the three conditions in the pre- or post-surveys. The findings underscore ChatGPT's ability to enhance students' disciplinary grounding and the significance of further fostering their integration skills.

AB  - While many studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between learning in the arts and students' critical thinking disposition, few studies have investigated the influence of an interdisciplinary art-related teaching approach and its correlation with academic student behavior confidence in anatomy and physiology (A&P). Therefore, this study aims to demonstrate the impact of an interdisciplinary approach -- reading, discussion, and drawing on students' academic confidence in undergraduate A&P. The investigation utilized a self-reported pre- and post-survey design to explore the change in confidence in A&P between course entry and exit. Sixty undergraduate students completed surveys while taking an elective course called Medical Literature, Anatomy, and the Arts, at a public state university in Southwest Florida. Results indicate a statistically significant difference in student-reported confidence levels in knowledge and experience of A&P. Additionally, the students' perceptions of the course were positive, citing more engagement and better support from peers and instructor as a result of this interdisciplinary approach. These outcomes suggest that teaching undergraduate students in A&P using medical arts enhances student academic confidence. This study provides encouraging support to existing scholarly work on higher education course design and instructional methods relative to improving student confidence and class engagement in A&P.

AB  - In this study we explored the experiences of students who completed a project-based, interdisciplinary capstone course that was offered at a large university in Southern Ontario, Canada. To do so, we interviewed students after they completed the course, adopting a constructivist perspective and a phenomenological approach. Interview transcripts were analyzed, resulting in four themes: (1) communication, (2) group dynamics, (3) successes, (4) differences between program requirements. In addition to revealing tension between fostering student autonomy and providing students with support, our findings also demonstrate that students valued the capstone course for the knowledge and experience gained from learning to work as an interdisciplinary unit rather than the tangible output of a given project.

AB  - While higher educational institutions prize interdisciplinary research collaboration, how it is supported is key to its success. In this discussion paper, we explore the evidence base to support interdisciplinary research collaboration in relation to our team's experiences with our project, output and impact. Project end-users are those who educate and support children from defence, veteran and first responder families (service families), who encounter unique stresses. Our team co-designed and co-created free, online, research-based resources to address these issues. Initially, the accessibility of these online web-based educational resources was found to be inadequate. To improve on the webbased resources housed on a digital learning platform, the team connected with a machine vision digital health researcher to co-create a free, anonymous, personalised program for users. Here, interdisciplinary approaches were essential to help solve problems with end-user experience identified in the initial evaluative feedback about the digital learning platform. To address these, a data retrieval system was generated to create personalised programs. Participants were affected communities and partners, including educators, partner providers, parents and support workers. Preliminary results showed an improvement in program engagement. Additionally, the team has received positive qualitative feedback about the end-user experience showcasing the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in elevating online educational support. These outcomes will be of interest to researchers, management and policymakers.

AB  - Whereas hackathons are widespread within and outside academia and have been argued to be a valid pedagogical method for teaching interdisciplinarity, no detailed frameworks or methods are available for conceptualizing and organizing educational hackathons, i.e., hackathons dedicated to best achieving pedagogic objectives. This paper is dedicated to introducing EDUCational Hackathons for learning how to solve Interdisciplinary Challenges (EDUCHIC) through: (1) defining the fundamental principles for framing an activity as an EDUCHIC, integrating principles from pedagogical methods, hackathon organization, and interdisciplinarity processes; (2) describing general properties that EDUCHIC possess as a consequence of the interaction of the fundamental principles; (3) developing operational guidelines for streamlining the practical organization of EDUCHIC, including an exhaustive end-to-end process covering all the steps for organizing EDUCHIC and practical frames for carrying the key decisions to be made in this process; and (4) a demonstration of these guidelines through illustrating their application for organizing a concrete EDUCHIC.

AB  - Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) is an autoimmune disorder associated with sudden onset of behavior changes. The prevalence of PANDAS is increasing in schools and interdisciplinary collaboration, knowledge, and the use of referrals to the school nurse are important for supporting students. This project sought to provide education on PANDAS to the interdisciplinary school team and implement a referral process for students exhibiting behavior changes. A self-directed online educational intervention was employed. A pretest-posttest design was utilized to assess knowledge before, immediately after, and six-weeks after the educational intervention. A referral log was implemented to track the number of referrals to the school nurse. The final sample size included 19 participants. Mean scores increased from pretest to posttest, and the implementation of a referral system produced 12 new school nurse referrals. Further strategies are needed to enhance interdisciplinary collaboration and support students experiencing health-related issues.

AB  - Purpose: This study explores the extent of undergraduate students' engagement in interdisciplinary learning experiences across their academic journey and its potential correlation with elevated levels of self-efficacy in learning. Furthermore, the research investigates how the clarity of career decisions and future goals contributes to the perception of relevance, value and alignment of interdisciplinary learning experiences among undergraduate students. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected using a self-report questionnaire in a longitudinal survey administered annually to undergraduate students at a university in northern Taiwan over four waves from 2018 to 2021. The sample analyzed for this study consisted of 123 undergraduate students who willingly and continuously participated in the research throughout the specified period. Findings: The results showed that self-efficacy within interdisciplinary learning experiences could be classified into three clusters: high efficacy, moderate efficacy and fluctuating efficacy. The determinants influencing these clusters include career decisions and years spent in university. Undergraduate students who have determined their career decisions and are in their latter two years of undergraduate studies demonstrate higher self-efficacy in interdisciplinary learning. Conversely, students who have yet to determine their career decisions exhibit a fluctuating pattern of self-efficacy across the three interdisciplinary learning categories. Research limitations/implications: Two key limitations of this research include a small sample size and a confined university-specific context, potentially constraining the applicability of the results to a broader population. Originality/value: This study contributes to the interdisciplinary learning experience in higher education by explaining the significance of undergraduates' self-efficacy and career-related factors. Whereas most research has focused on the effects of self-efficacy, this study investigated the factors that influence undergraduates' self-efficacy.

AB  - In the context of global educational reform, science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education, as an interdisciplinary educational model, has become increasingly central to foundational pedagogical reforms. However, research on the impact and development of STEM teachers' interdisciplinary teaching abilities is relatively limited. This meta-analysis explored STEM education's impact on elementary and secondary school teachers' interdisciplinary teaching abilities. The review encompassed 21 empirical studies published between 2010 and 2023 and aimed to quantify the effect size of STEM interventions on teachers' interdisciplinary abilities. A moderately positive correlation (r = 0.452) was found between STEM education and teachers' interdisciplinary teaching abilities. The role of potential moderating variables, including demographic traits, gender, academic qualifications, subject specialization, pedagogical tenure, and prior exposure to interdisciplinary learning, was scrutinized. The findings highlighted a substantial improvement in teachers' interdisciplinary teaching abilities through STEM education, emphasizing the critical role of knowledge integration. STEM programs significantly aided educators in bridging and amalgamating diverse disciplinary insights. Variations in the efficacy of STEM education across different educational tiers, subject domains, levels of teaching seniority, and interdisciplinary familiarity were identified, indicating that the benefits of STEM training were contingent upon individual teacher profiles. Notably, gender disparities in the enhancement of interdisciplinary teaching abilities through STEM education were not observed. Despite the methodological diversity of the included studies, which encompassed various research paradigms, sampling strategies, and evaluation instruments, the integration of findings across these diverse methodologies added intricacy to the interpretation of the meta-analytic results. The study's potential limitations, such as the risk of sample selection bias and the use of potentially imprecise assessment tools, were acknowledged as possibly having influenced the meta-analytic outcomes. The findings had two implications. First, they provided a roadmap for the strategic design and execution of STEM initiatives aimed at fostering excellence in interdisciplinary teaching. Second, they highlighted the imperative for tailored approaches to the development of STEM teachers, which recognize the heterogeneous needs and potential based on their unique professional and experiential backgrounds.

AB  - This paper explores service-learning as a mode of cultivating student stakeholders in university education. Previous studies have examined increasing student engagement through experiential learning, writing across the curriculum, and recognizing the interdisciplinarity of general education classrooms, but few have brought these elements into conversation as contexts that might foster students' sense of ownership of their education. While students are recipients of carefully planned faculty-designed curricula, this study suggests that cross-curricular programs, such as writing in the disciplines, could benefit from student input given their direct experience of writing assignments and expectations in multiple classroom environments. This study investigates, in hybrid mode (intersectional pedagogy and auto-ethnographic case study), a plan aimed at developing cross-campus knowledge about writing instruction through an inter-campus service-learning project. The featured project underscores the importance of experiential learning that enhances student estimation of writing as a mode of learning, involves students in the evaluation of campus writing curricula, and develops a sense of writing as highly valuable to university education and integral to all fields in subsequent professional lives.

AB  - The professional high school by the federal schools in Brazil requires an integrated curriculum itinerary. There is a lack of information about how to achieve that in a practical conception of integration. This article aimed to investigate the interdisciplinary approach of the content "transformation of energy" involving the relationship among Science, Technology, Society, and Environment (STSE) in integrated high school. The applied research procedure was a pedagogical intervention in which research subjects were the third year high school students, integrated into the technical course in food (n = 36) at the Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Norte, municipality of Pau dos Ferros, Brazil. The process of planning, execution, and evaluation of the interdisciplinary teaching sequence was carried out by teachers and researchers from different areas i.e., forest engineering, chemistry, physics, and physical educational. The data were compiled and evaluated through thematic analysis. The results showed that interdisciplinary learning favors scientific and environmental literacy, conceptual changes, expanded discussions, and the integration of the curriculum.

AB  - National undergraduate research conferences have been commonplace in the US for many years e.g. the National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR), and are becoming more frequent elsewhere. Alongside national conferences many universities hold their own events, which are often institution-wide, so as to appeal to a large proportion of their student body. These multi-disciplinary "public" conferences offer students broader experiences than class-based, subject-level presentations, and motivations to participate will be different i.e. based on professional and personal development, forging research contacts, and enhancing employability, rather than securing assessment grades. This is the first of two articles that offer guidance to help the reader maximise the benefits from participating in multi-disciplinary conferences. In this paper, the authors discuss reasons to participate, identify the usual conference format and preparation process, and describe how to prepare an effective verbal or poster presentation.

AB  - "Cannabis sativa" is a species of plant with a rich, yet controversial history. Although the utility of cannabis has been documented for thousands of years; during the last century, research has led to a more advanced understanding of its mechanism of action and therapeutic potential. Accordingly, there has been an explosion of interest and attention; particularly from researchers, investors, academics, and those in the medical field. The relevance of cannabis spans many educational disciplines; sociology, economics, pharmacology, biology, and especially chemistry. There was a need in the undergraduate science curricula to include and reflect this revolution in cannabis' perception and application by providing a knowledge base to students. Therefore, in an effort to contextualize cannabis' inextricable connection to chemistry, the interdisciplinary undergraduate course "Chemistry of Cannabis" was developed and implemented. The goal was to increase student awareness, enhance the scope of their general education, and present a scientific foundation for potential further study. Due to the 2020 pandemic-related school closures, the second half of the course was presented online. The successful transition from in-person to remote learning illustrates the versatility of the course content and structure. Assessment of student feedback revealed that the course was well received and that students finished the semester with a greater interest and appreciation for both chemistry and cannabis. This article presents the design and delivery for the course "Chemistry of Cannabis."

AB  - Interdisciplinary learning (IDL) features heavily within Scotland's Curriculum for Excellence and is promoted as a way to develop skills building and conceptual creativity in students, factors which are now seen as crucial for the twenty-first century education system (Khadri, 2014; Kolmos, 2016). Recent studies suggest, however, that although teachers welcome the idea of IDL in principle, there is a serious policy implementation gap (Harvie, 2018, Graham, 2019). While it is recognised that the structure as well as the culture of organisations can hinder policy enactment (Thorburn, 2017), this article focuses on the issue of conceptual clarity as a barrier to implementation and aims to address this by considering an epistemology and conceptual framework through which IDL can be better understood. Factors which promote IDL are explored along with examples of practice which match the conceptual model. A structure for planning IDL tasks is also suggested with the intention of opening discussion around this topic and providing teachers with practical ideas.

AB  - This paper explores the developments and trends in higher education from a pedagogical perspective (specifically, multidisciplinary curricula) and research perspective (the interdisciplinary approach), and traces them from a last resort option to their recognition as a legitimate development with added value. The paper focuses on a case study that integrates two disciplines, art and literature, based on the poem by the Israeli poet Rachel entitled "My Book of Poems" and the painting "The Scream" by Norwegian artist Eduard Munch. The interdisciplinary approach opens up possibilities of enriching, expanding horizons, and breaking boundaries, and can grant graduates of the higher education system a cultural perspective suitable for the current generation of students, who typically use multiple interactive media and platforms, often simultaneously. This paper may shed light on teaching and learning of many diverse fields. The case study illustrates the joy of interdisciplinary learning and its academic benefits, despite the fact that for years, higher education institutions have tended to refer to researchers' specializations in specific academic disciplines. This case study may serve as a model or source of inspiration for multidisciplinary learning involving motifs and topics that traditionally represent specific disciplines.

AB  - Background: Patients with schizophrenia present with both cognitive impairment as well as language difficulties. There are similarities in the language output of patients with schizophrenia and patients with aphasia, thus a differential diagnosis of patients who present with a question of dual diagnoses can be a clinical challenge. This case report highlights the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to a patient with schizophrenia who benefitted from intervention from both psychiatry and speech--language pathology services due to the patient's unique verbal output. Aims: The primary aim of this case report is to highlight the critical importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in this patient population. The secondary aim is to disseminate an interesting and unique clinical phenomenon whereby the patient demonstrated an awareness of two distinct speech patterns and the unique ability to 'code switch' between them, something not commonly appreciated in this clinical population. Methods & Procedures: This case report describes a patient seen as part of routine clinical care. Information shared was solely observational and involved dissemination of information regarding case history, assessment and treatment plan. No interventions were implemented as a part of this study. Outcomes & Results: Interprofessional communication was critical in order to diagnose a patient with schizophrenia with an atypical speech pattern. The patient's language output did not manifest as a true aphasia but rather as two distinct language patterns that the patient could use at will. This ability to 'code switch' between languages is a unique clinical profile that is atypical of patients with schizophrenia.

AB  - This generation of students enters a workforce that increasingly demands interdisciplinary thinking to solve complex problems and create sustainable value. The global pandemic, climate crisis, and state of social inequality call for future business leaders to practice a broader intellectual vision to "see" across domains and apply diverse lenses. However, the traditional silos within universities, business colleges, and marketing curriculum constrain student exposure to narrower paradigms. To help address this challenge, this paper introduces a field-based exercise called "Designing a Greenspace for Sustainable Value." The exercise promotes learning objectives for interdisciplinary mind-sets, sustainable innovation, and developing value propositions in teams. Experimental results reveal positive effects on a scale measuring students' Interdisciplinary Competence. Moreover, qualitative feedback uncovers students' experiences, perceived barriers for interdisciplinary thinking, and reflective paths forward. The exercise can be incorporated into a variety of marketing courses, and it has been effectively implemented in both undergraduate and graduate contexts as well as in-person and digital modes of delivery. To promote retention, students are encouraged to literally and metaphorically "take a hike" to other fields to develop their interdisciplinary mind-set for solving complex problems.

AB  - Out-of-field teaching is a global educational challenge. In particular, many teachers whose academic background and main teaching experience is in biology are called to teach middle school physics and have limited opportunities for productive professional development. Based on previous studies, we expect these teachers to hold different epistemic cognitions from the in-field teachers. The present study builds on this epistemic diversity and offers dialogic argumentation as a means to promote mutual learning among physics teachers from different disciplinary backgrounds. We describe guidelines for designing "interdisciplinary dialogic argumentation" activities that aim to encourage teachers to express their disciplinary perspectives in the context of inquiry-based physics and to facilitate a deliberative discourse among them. We demonstrate in a case study the ways in which the discourse of a group of in-field and out-of-field teachers unfolds under the proposed design guidelines. Using the Actor-Network methodology and an analysis of power relations, we uncover a complex interplay between the social and the epistemic in the discourse: when interactions become more dialogic and power relations more equalized, the out-of-field teachers take an active role in the discussion, foregrounding their epistemic practices and enhancing the epistemic practices of the group, including the in-field teacher.

AB  - The medical fields of anesthesiology and otolaryngology (ENT -- ears, nose, throat) are defined by overlapping clinical expertise as it relates to the management of airway issues. As a result of this shared clinical domain, interdisciplinary educational experiences provide an opportunity for collaboration and a broadened experience for resident physician learning. Our institution developed a two-week rotation in otolaryngology for first-year anesthesiology interns with the goal of utilizing interdisciplinary coaching to develop both technical and non-technical skills in airway management. The purpose of this project is to perform a formal evaluation of this rotation and share our training methods and processes.

AB  - Purpose: The goals of this research study included evaluating the outcomes of Interdisciplinary Science Threshold Experience (InSciTE) on student experience of science discipline, level of sense belongingness to a large Faculty of Science (FoS), outcomes in learning science literacy skills and whether a student's background played a role in the differences of effects of the high-impact teaching practices. InSciTE was designed to facilitate the transition from high school to a large research-intensive university, and specifically to a FoS with over 6,000 undergraduate students. Design/methodology/approach: The FoS in a Canadian university engaged in the development of a *9 credit program bundling foundational statistics and chemistry courses with integration of aspects of mathematics and biology or physics to create a new first-year, academic interdisciplinary experience called InSciTE. This project-based curriculum emphasized teamwork and leadership, and presented complex interdisciplinary challenges facing today's world. A team-teaching environment consisting of instructors, a lab coordinator and teaching assistants was instrumental for the core InSciTE courses. In addition, the authors utilized a variety of learning practices with interdisciplinary themes to meet the learning outcomes. Course activities included field experience and tours, blended learning and flipped lectures, guest speakers, discovery-based lab activities, group discussions and projects, a capstone research project, and a combination of formative and summative assessments. The authors proposed two hypotheses for the evaluative study; first that the high-impact practices (HIP) will improve students' experiences and belongingness to science faculty, and second that InSciTE facilitates learning of scientific literacy skills. To assess the effectiveness of InSciTE, the authors used two surveys, the first being the Test of Scientific Literacy Skills (TOSLS), which measures skills related to major aspects of scientific literacy: recognizing and analysing the use of methods of inquiry that lead to scientific knowledge and the ability to organize, analyse, and interpret quantitative data and scientific information. The second survey examined student belongingness, motivation and autonomous learning, combined with demographic data questions. Findings: The results suggest that InSciTE students reported higher feelings of relatedness, group membership, and career aspirations and performed better on the TOSLS compared to students in other science courses. Originality/value: As a leader in interdisciplinary science, the FoS at a Canadian university developed a full-year course bundling foundational statistics and chemistry courses with integration of some aspects of mathematics and biology or physics to create a new first-year, academic interdisciplinary experience called InSciTE. This project-based curriculum emphasized teamwork and leadership, and presented complex interdisciplinary challenges facing today's world aiming to facilitate transition from high school to a research-intensive university.

AB  - When the Learning Sciences emerged in 1991, there was an ethos of studying learning in humans and machines in conjunction with one another. This ethos reflected three decades of prior work on the interdisciplinary study of learning; however, in the three decades since the emergence of the Learning Sciences, it seems to have largely disappeared. I begin by describing the ethos that was prevalent in 1991 using quotations from the inaugural editorial of the "Journal of the Learning Sciences." I then describe how this ethos was prevalent decades before the Learning Sciences in four distinct approaches to cognitive science research, which I call the "Four C's"--cognitivism, constructivism, cybernetics, and connectionism. I suggest three reasons why the Learning Sciences moved away from the use of artificial intelligence as a central tool for thinking about learning, noting that these reasons do not suggest a fundamental incompatibility between the two. I end by discussing how Learning Scientists might once again embrace artificial intelligence and computational modeling and use them as tools for gaining insight into the constructivist, situated, and socio-cultural nature of learning.

AB  - This qualitative study examined the interplay between teacher facilitation, children's uptake of vocabulary and reasoning strategies, and the roles children assumed as learners as they experienced instruction grounded in Connected Teaching and Learning ([CTL] an interdisciplinary instructional framework that leverages key practices from culturally responsive pedagogies and meaningful use of multimodal text sets. Analyses suggest (1) students assumed more active roles in their learning as they "enacted" the work of scientists and (2) varied teacher facilitation practices and children's vocabulary and reasoning uptake were key factors in children's shift to more active roles. Although findings suggest CTL is a promising instructional framework, findings also underscore the significance of how teachers act on the instructional framework.

AB  - This paper is about interdisciplinary collaboration in a higher education context. The authors have investigated their own experiences of interdisciplinary collaboration through reflexive autobiographical narrative writing and co-generative dialogue. The experience of working in a project which brought together students from different parts of the university was analysed with reference to critical readings about interdisciplinary work. The authors have identified moments of boundary crossing or 'nodes of tension' through which relationships were being negotiated and knowledge was being produced. The analysis of these moments shows that interdisciplinary work is intensely relational and dialogic; it takes time and involves significant labour. The authors contend that this labour is essential to building trust and openness to what is unfamiliar, and that universities which seek to promote interdisciplinary collaboration must acknowledge the significant additional work necessary to negotiate nodes of tension.

AB  - This article presents a synopsis of an interdisciplinary literacy-science, cross-country, fully remote service-learning (S-L) project prompted by and executed during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The article shares discussions, analyses, and evaluations from both community partners (staff of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences at Whiteville) and university faculty (education studies professors from Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas) to highlight how the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic created unique opportunities for S-L. With summary of the S-L partnership's fully online development and comparisons to other, more traditional S-L projects completed pre-COVID-19, we offer readers logistical tips for navigating their own virtual S-L partnerships. The article concludes with student learning outcomes from pre- and postproject reflections and identification of interdisciplinary work benefits from both the professors and community partners.

AB  - In 2015, a multidisciplinary group of academic researchers and extension personnel was awarded a US Department of Agriculture Coordinated Agricultural Project grant. The team's goal was to understand human decision-making in the context of potential livestock disease outbreaks, investigating the impediments to increased adoption of biosecurity practices by producers from multiple perspectives. Counting publications and presentations was not deemed adequate evidence of growth of interdisciplinary collaboration. Instead, we took a developmental evaluation approach, collecting data to illuminate patterns of interconnectedness across disciplinary boundaries. These data, mapped annually on a baseline framework, reveal the team moving from disciplinary groups with disparate epistemologies and interests to a cohesive interdisciplinary team involved in many unexpected and emergent projects.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine whether students' self-assessment (SSA) could be used as a significant attribute to predict students' future academic achievement. Design/methodology/approach: The authors address how well students can assess their abilities and study the relationship between this ability and demographic properties and previous study performance. The authors present the study results by measuring the relationship between the SSA across five different topics and comparing them with the students' performance in these topics using short tests. The test has been voluntarily taken by more than 300 students planning to enroll in the School of Business Informatics and Mathematics master's programs at the University of Mannheim. Findings: The study results reveal which attributes are mostly associated with the accuracy level of SSA in higher education. The authors conclude that SSA, it can be valuable in predicting master's students' academic achievement when taking specific measures when designing the predictive module. Research limitations/implications: Due to time constraints, the study was restricted only to students applying to master's programs at the Faculty of Business Informatics and Mathematics at the University of Mannheim. This resulted in collecting a limited data set. Also, the scope of this study was restricted to testing the accuracy of SSA and did not test using it as an attribute for predicting students' academic achievement. Originality/value: Predicting students' academic performance in higher education is beneficial from different perspectives. The literature reveals that a considerable amount of work is published to analyze and predict academic performance in higher education. However, most of the published work relies on attributes such as demographics, teachers' assessment, and examination scores for performing their prediction while neglecting the use of other forms of evaluation such as SSA or self-evaluation.

AB  - Faculty in the Chemistry and Environmental Science programs at St. Mary's University in San Antonio, Texas, collaborated to develop an undergraduate course in Field-Based Environmental Chemistry. The course was developed and implemented as a 2-semester, 1-semester, and online, synchronous course offered during the 2020/21 COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the course, chemistry and environmental science majors designed and executed a sampling and laboratory analysis plan for monitoring the physical and chemical conditions of soil and/or water in a local, urban setting. As part of a goal to help students develop communication skills, they presented their work to stakeholders from the local community. Through participation in an active learning model, students demonstrated significant gains in the student learning outcomes. Students in the 2-semester sequence showed gains in their understanding of the scientific process, more comfort with the uncertainty and the ambiguity of natural environments, and appreciation for the importance of statistics in data analysis. The online course and COVID-19 pandemic restrictions did not allow for student field or laboratory work but did engage students in a project typical of a work environment.

AB  - This study presents perceived advantages of thematic, team-taught interdisciplinary seminars for first-year honors students. Two student cohorts (n = 174) surveyed in two subsequent years (2018, 2019) weigh in on the challenges and benefits of different team-teaching models. Three first-semester offerings on the themes "Food," "Creativity," and "Social Justice" are evaluated. Results indicate that most students (70.1%) recognize the understanding of multiple perspectives to be the greatest benefit of the team-taught seminar. Other perceived benefits include the acquisition of additional information (21.3), cultivation of critical thinking (13.2), and the ability to make transdisciplinary connections (10.9). Data suggest that the degree of difference between disciplines combined in a class might place restrictions on the choice of team-teaching modality. Authors conclude that while team teaching offers a varied array of benefits to students, there is no one best model.

AB  - Theories of learning developed in education and psychology for the past 100 years are woefully inadequate to support the design of schools and classrooms that foster deep learning and equity. Needed is learning theory that can guide us in creating schools and classrooms where deep learning occurs, where learners' full selves are engaged, and that disrupt existing patterns of inequality and oppression. In this article, we build on recent research in education, neuroscience, psychology, and anthropology to articulate a theory of learning that has the potential to move us toward that goal. We elaborate four key principles of learning: (1) learning is rooted in evolutionary, biological, and neurological systems; (2) learning is integrated with other developmental processes whereby the whole child (emotion, identity, cognition) must be taken into account; (3) learning is shaped in culturally organized practice across people's lives; and (4) learning is experienced as embodied and coordinated through social interaction. Taken together, these principles help us understand learning in a way that foregrounds the range of community and cultural experiences people have throughout the life course and across the multiple settings of life and accounts for learning as set within systems of injustice.

AB  - Purpose: During the contemporary art lesson, it is important to have trainee teachers who are worthy individuals with an artist identity in society, experience education that makes them ask questions and think in life. In this research, the aim was to explain as meaning or information, how all the participants experience the interdisciplinary situation in contemporary art instruction. Method: This research was structured with qualitative research techniques and phenomenological design. The participants of the study were 13 students who follow the lesson consistently, the instructor of the lesson, and four guest instructors from various fields. To clarify the phenomenon, in addition to reviews, observation data, and various documents related to the lesson were collected and thus a variety of data was obtained. All the acquired data were analyzed with the thematic analysis method. Findings: After analyzing the data, four distinct categories emerged under the main category of Selecting and Organizing the Content. These are Key Concepts, Chronology Identification, Milestones, and Interdisciplinarity. Implications for Research and Practice: According to the outcomes, it can be said that the interdisciplinarity content organizing approach includes some fundamental characteristic qualities. The content of the contemporary art lesson has a body that includes the knowledge of various fields, multiculturality, one hundred-broad and milestones, and a complex and paradoxical knowledge structure including modern and postmodern perspectives. The instructor converted the knowledge into interdisciplinary content by including various experts from various disciplines as a disciplinarian and utilizing an integrated content approach during the contemporary art lesson.

AB  - This essay gives a broad overview of a team-taught course on Alexander Hamilton that merges discourses in music theory and political science. Authors describe pedagogical approaches to teaching both the musical "Hamilton" to non-musician students and Hamilton's history and politics to students not majoring in these fields. Contrasting challenges and outcomes of the seminar's first (2017) offering with its second (2020), authors consider the scope and implications of cultural intelligence and scholarly interdisciplinarity, maintaining that courses team-taught by instructors of different disciplines make connections across disciplines more explicit for students and enhance the transdisciplinary nature of the honors experience. Pre-course assessments are included, and future directions for team-teaching are discussed.

AB  - Central to positive learning outcomes for students with disabilities is the ability of the individualized education program (IEP) team to work collaboratively. Within the IEP team, effective service delivery involves direct and related service providers working in an interdisciplinary capacity as they share professional responsibilities to implement the student's program and achieve the common goal of improved student outcomes. With support from the literature, this paper discusses the core components of Bronstein's Interdisciplinary Collaboration Model (2003); and elucidates how professionals share their content knowledge and technical skills with each other, collaborate in instructional design, and gain a firm understanding of each other's discipline in practice. Practical applications that promote interdisciplinary collaboration between adapted physical educators, special educators, related service providers, and parents to improve service delivery and learner outcomes are shared.

AB  - In Finland, technology education is a multidisciplinary field where team teaching serves as a basis for the integration of technology across different school subjects. However, Finnish teacher education does not adequately prepare the student teachers for multidisciplinary technology education, and the professional competency is often gained through voluntary participation in professional development courses. The resulting individual differences in teachers' technology education competency hinder their ability to plan such educational offerings together. While previous studies have identified multidisciplinary team teaching as a way of balancing out individual differences in teachers' professional competency, the ability to leverage it depends on the availability of social support. Previous studies have examined the effect of social support in teachers' professional well-being, but further research on its role in organising multidisciplinary technology education is needed. This study explores what kind of social support is involved in the co-planning of multidisciplinary technology education. Eleven experienced in-service teachers representing different school subjects participated in interviews carried out in 2019--2020. The data were analysed by applying the principles of qualitative content analysis. The findings revealed that instrumental support in the form of new ideas, tools, and methods was emphasised in the teachers' experiences. The perceived needs for more social support were mainly related to making joint decisions during the co-planning process. The findings indicate that co-planning in multidisciplinary teams increases the versatility of possible implementations of technology education. However, leveraging multidisciplinary team teaching would require more support for pedagogical leadership.

AB  - Nowadays one of the main focuses of the Spanish University system is achieving the active learning paradigm in the context of its integration into the European Higher Education Area. This goal is being addressed by means of the application of novel teaching mechanisms. Among a wide variety of learning approaches, the present work focuses on peer review, understood as a collaborative learning technique where students assess other student's work and provide their own feedback. In this way, peer review has the overarching goal of improving the student learning during this process. Peer review has been successfully applied and analyzed in the literature. Indeed, many authors also recommend improving the design and implementation of self and peer review, which has been our main goal. This paper presents an empirical study based on the application of peer review assessment in different higher education BSc and MSc courses. In this way, six courses from different studies at the University of Malaga in Spain are subject to the application of peer review strategies to promote student learning and develop cross-wise skills such as critical thinking, autonomy and responsibility. Based on these experiences, a deep analysis of the results is performed, showing that a proper application of the peer review methodology provides reliable reviews (with close scores to the ones from the teacher) as well as an improvement in the students' performance.

AB  - Although many studies have investigated students' perspectives towards Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL), few studies have actively involved learners when creating research-based materials. The scarcity of such studies also stems from the limited number of research projects that operationalize scientific insights for classroom implementation in the first place. This paper is connected to such a study, set within a design-based research (DBR) framework. Apart from investigating theoretical underpinnings of content and language integration, this ongoing PhD study also involves the development of research-based transdisciplinary content-and-language-integrative teaching materials over several cycles. Amongst other forms of data collection, focus group interviews with students before and after each intervention formed a central element of the design process. This work-in-progress article is concerned with the students' role in shaping content-and-language-integrative materials, shedding light on their concerns and needs at various stages in the design process. Initial results suggest that the learners' voices were crucial in the development of these materials. Moreover, in line with the overall thrust of DBR, it appears that a one-time intervention does not suffice even when considering the students' beliefs and needs. Instead, several cycles of development are needed to create an approach that works for the learners.

AB  - Liberal arts programs encompass a range of academic disciplines, and their effectiveness relies not only on what these disciplines are, but also on how they are integrated. The natural sciences are one important component of liberal arts programs that may be difficult to assimilate with the rest of the curriculum. In this paper, the topic of neglected tropical diseases is provided to illustrate an innovative approach to bridging transdisciplinary connections across and through disparate academic disciplines. This approach is supported by evidence from prior studies demonstrating the effectiveness of transdisciplinary teaching at promoting creativity, knowledge retention, and student motivation.

AB  - Building upon the genre-based research in literacy and English as a Second language (ESL) education developed in Australia in the past three decades, this paper reframes a genre-based approach to teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language (CFL) in a primary classroom. Grounded in Bernsteinian sociology while also working in transdisciplinary dialogue with systemic functional linguistic perspectives, this approach to genre is illustrated with respect to CFL curriculum genres built in steps through power and control relations as well as phasal shifts in ideational, interpersonal and textual meanings. The paper identifies four CFL curriculum genres in a particular classroom and instantiates a curriculum genre of Chinese language learning through song that inducted disadvantaged students into the knowledge about language and subject contents. I argue that the reframed genre-based pedagogy, as a pathway to educational and social justice, can help teachers chart their lessons and has important implications for theory and practice.

AB  - This article proposes a translingual/transdisciplinary rhetoric that aims to complement, rather than confront, current discipline-specific discursive, linguistic, and cultural conventions. Specifically, the article reviews various lines of inquiry on translingualism in composition scholarship and identifies and accounts for the challenges and resistance to this orientation in practice. After defining translingual/transdisciplinary rhetoric and conceptualizing what it means to practice it across disciplines, the author proposes tentative directions for achieving a translingual/transdisciplinary rhetorical norm in pedagogical spaces.

AB  - Wider parts of society-at-large are not fluent in the language of numbers, and financial literacy in particular is low in many countries (OECD, 2014). This paper shows how research on financial communication with and for practitioners (Cameron, Frazer, Rampton, & Richardson, 1992, p. 22) can foster intra-lingual translation in the financial sector, which increases financial texts' communicative potential and finally enables laypersons to better understand the language of numbers. Transdisciplinary Action Research (TDA) offers a framework and procedures to approach such goals through close collaboration of scholars and practitioners throughout research projects. Following TDA core concepts, a cyclic process of research and development has been established in the last two decades (e.g. Perrin, this volume; Whitehouse, 2014). Whereas applied linguists involved aimed at better understanding practices of writing and intra-lingual translation at the interface of technical and everyday language, stakeholders from the financial industry wanted to improve their communication. The representatives of society-at-large, finally, were interested in contributing to sustainably increasing financial literacy. In the first part of the present paper, I sketch the suitability of transdisciplinarity in general and TDA in particular in financial communication (Section 1). Then I define the key concepts of intra-lingual translation, communicative potential, and financial literacy (Section 2). Next, I outline the data corpus and explain how TDA was applied in a series of research projects (Section 3). The presented results on a macro-level shed light on the financial analysts' situation and practices in their multilingual workplace: the findings on the micro-level suggest that financial analysts' texts pose a risk of partial communicative failure (Section 4). The article concludes by indicating empirically based measures to develop financial literacy, intra-lingual translation across stakeholders and texts' communicative potential in finance (Section 5).

AB  - The study investigates the transdisciplinary teaching of education for sustainable development (ESD) with a global dimension at an upper secondary school in Sweden. The purpose was to analyse and describe variations in how nine teachers in different subject matters experienced collaborative teaching in the context of a whole school educational development project. A total of 27 semi-structured interviews were conducted and analysed using phenomenographic method and contextual analysis. Two main approaches to transdisciplinary teaching were identified among the teachers: one where teachers contributed but struggled with transdisciplinarity, and the other where they displayed ownership and were able to reconceptualise the project as a whole. Overall, teachers worked in the project with deep-level processing for learning ESD in an integrated manner in the transdisciplinary framework. However, they also experienced tensions between their resources and capabilities, and the challenges they faced in the project.

AB  - In interdisciplinary education, metaphors often provide the epistemological clarity that is lacking in our definitions and theories of interdisciplinarity. The problem is that ineffective and unsubstantiated metaphors proliferate. We lack a root metaphor or shared world view of interdisciplinarity. Is it time that we move away from thinking in terms of metaphors? Some instrumentalists in interdisciplinary studies argue yes and propose a pragmatic constructionist approach for interdisciplinary education. This theoretical study determines that this proposal is incomplete. It reveals that an intertextual view of interdisciplinarity is not only more appropriate, but it integrates the competing theoretical and pedagogical approaches in the field. This article also identifies "the matrix" as the metaphor best positioned to sustain this integration and to bridge the widening gap between disciplines.

AB  - When introduced around 1925, interdisciplinarity, grounded in the notion of the unity of knowledge, was meant to reconnect the fragmented and specialized disciplines of academia. However, interdisciplinary research became more and more challenging as the plurality and heterogeneity of disciplinary perspectives and insights increased. Insisting on this divergence and diversity, Julie Thompson Klein has nevertheless contributed in important ways to convergence in interdisciplinarity with her work on the process of integration as interdisciplinarity's defining feature. Of course Klein is aware that the increasing inclusion of extra-academic stakeholders in "trans"disciplinary research constitutes a fundamental challenge to integrative interdisciplinarity. Along with academic contributions, experiential knowledge, interests, and norms must be recognized as valuable to the process, and stakeholder expectations of applicable results must be met. Exploring the future by extending this crucial development further, this article focuses on the actionability of knowledge as an additional criterion for effective interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity, as it is in Action Research. With action options for stakeholders being an important goal for such research, it is argued that joint deliberation about these options must be part of the process, aiming for reflective equilibrium. At the same time, an important role for imagination is defended, enabling adequate consideration of action options with their ramifications and implications. The future of interdisciplinarity, it is concluded, will entail an important role for the actionability criterion and for the related role of imagination of potential outcomes, much greater roles than these now have.

AB  - We introduce a new metric for interdisciplinarity, based on co-author publication history. A published article that has co-authors with quite different publication histories can be deemed relatively "interdisciplinary," in that the article reflects a convergence of previous research in distinct sets of publication outlets. In recent work, we have shown that this interdisciplinarity metric can predict citations. Here, we show that the journal "Cognitive Science" tends to contain collaborations that are relatively high on this interdisciplinarity metric, at about the 80th percentile of all journals across both social and natural sciences. Following on Goldstone and Leydesdorff (2006), we describe how scientometric tools provide a valuable means of assessing the role of cognitive science in broader scientific work, and also as a tool to investigate teamwork and distributed cognition. We describe how data-driven metrics of this kind may facilitate this exploration without relying upon rapidly changing discipline and topic keywords associated with publications.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity is becoming a critical issue of concern for design schools across East Asia in their attempts to provide industry graduates with the skills and competences to make creative contributions in a global economy. As a result, East Asian higher education institutions are aggressively endeavouring to provide interdisciplinary undergraduate curriculum that combine traditional designerly skills with engineering knowledge and methods. The current study takes an interdisciplinary undergraduate course as case-study to examine how the pedagogic strategy of team teaching influences student learning experience. Two surveys of student learning were conducted for this research purpose. The first provided an indication of the holistic student learning experience, while the second explored the conditions of team and non-team teaching as influence upon learning experiences specifically. Results showed how students taught by a single instructor provided a more positive overall opinion of course quality and experienced significantly more encouragement to participate compared to team taught respondents. However, findings also indicated how team teaching significantly increased the students' experience of a balanced contribution from different disciplinary perspectives and how the team teaching approach was significantly more effective in providing students with greater opportunities to understand the relevance of the different disciplines to the course subject. We conclude with a discussion of results in terms of the effective use of team teaching at undergraduate level as strategy for interdisciplinary learning experiences.

AB  - The literature on interdisciplinarity identifies several forms of collaboration: multidisciplinary, transdisciplinary, and interdisciplinary (as bridge building or integration). To assist vocational psychology translate its interdisciplinary discourse into action, this paper uses that literature to identify the benefits, challenges and conditions for success. It indicates that the form of collaboration needed must be decided, and the cognitive, social, organizational and institutional aspects of the collaborating disciplines considered. It highlights the significance of interpersonal relationships when establishing and maintaining collaboration.

AB  - Background: Schools provide an ideal setting for promoting healthy lifestyles in youth, but it has proven difficult to promote the adoption and implementation of evidence-based programming by school leaders. The SWITCH® ("School Wellness Integration Targeting Child Health") intervention is a capacity-building process designed to help school leaders learn how to plan, implement, and sustain school wellness programs on their own. Objective: The present study evaluates the transdisciplinary approaches used in establishing an integrated research-practice partnership with the state-wide 4-H/Extension network to support broader dissemination. Method: The study used a mixed methods approach to evaluate the degree of engagement and motivation of 4-H leaders (N = 30) for providing ancillary support for local school wellness programming. Engagement from 4-H Staff was logged over a year-long period through tracking completion of training and ongoing engagement with aspects of SWITCH. They completed checkpoint surveys and an interview to provide perceptions of supporting school implementation of SWITCH programming. Data were analysed through Pearson bivariate correlations and constant comparative analysis. Results: County-level 4-H staff demonstrated high engagement in SWITCH by attending training sessions and hosting structured checkpoint sessions with schools. Interview data revealed that 4-H Staff valued connections with schools and emphasized that training on SWITCH was consistent with their existing roles related to youth programming. Conclusions The results demonstrate the value of the sequential capacity-building process used to train 4-H Staff to facilitate school wellness programming. The transdisciplinary approaches built transferable skills and fostered relationships that directly support the broader goals of 4-H.

AB  - In this paper, the dissolution of the silos between geography and business faculty to form a teaching partnership with a common set of questions and goals and how that partnership changed their academic perspectives will be explored. Faculty deepened the challenges for students, re-thought pedagogical models, and re-thought grading and evaluation. Business provides a wide range of messy or "wicked" problems where many decisions are unclear or uncertain for the actors. Quantitative methods and GIS help in their own way and often leave different aspects of uncertainty on the table for students. Integrating geography and business in teaching and student research, and exploring some of the early "academic territoriality" that gave way to build experiences for students is discussed. This evolution of teaching methods within the partnership moved to a more problem-based approach that evolved to affect courses outside the partnership. These changes eventually led the faculty to develop Course-embedded Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) to pose messy, unstructured projects to students. Many of these projects resulted in external student conference presentations. Another outcome was a re-framing of grading and development of assessment that focuses on students engaging in the work. Finally, we identify the artificiality of our disciplinary divisions.

AB  - This study investigates teachers' perceptions and practices of designing and teaching transdisciplinary STEAM curriculum using online authentic assessment. Aligning the transdisciplinary STEAM curriculum to authentic assessment is a conceptual framework that guided this study to focus on the three learning domains (cognitive, psychomotor, and affective). The participants are middle and high school teachers (n = 37) in a private school in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). An exploratory mixed method was adopted as a research design. The qualitative data (document analysis) was gathered through analyzing STEAM lesson plans. An online questionnaire was used to collect the quantitative data from teachers. The study's results reveal that teachers' perceptions and practices about the design of STEAM curriculum using authentic assessment were positive with regards to the three learning domains (cognitive, psychomotor, and affective). The highest agreement of teachers' responses was found to be in the affective domain.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to examine the positive and negative experiences of teachers through a model in the process of designing a transdisciplinary integrated curriculum within the framework of IB-PYP. The design of the study included a holistic, multiple-case approach. The study was carried out with 50 teachers, among which 7 (14%) are male and 43 (86%) are female, in the IBEC teacher curriculum at a university in Turkey in the 2018-2019 spring and 2019-2020 fall academic terms. IBEC was given in Istanbul, Ankara, and Gaziantep cities in Turkey. The data were collected with researcher diary, focus group interviews and reflective writings, and analyzed through content analysis. In the study in which the transdisciplinary integrated curriculum was designed using a model, it was observed that the model brought systematic approach to teachers. The integrated curriculum design was realized through the cooperation of teachers from different branches, which proved to be efficient to cooperate with different disciplines. Emphasizing that they had difficulty in selecting practices for planning and evaluating the teaching process, the participant teachers also affirmed that specifically these stages developed them professionally. In designing the program, teachers also developed coping skills. It is understood that the brainstorming technique relieved teachers' challenges. It was found that teachers' experiences were of significance in effective design of the integrated programs. School-based program development, collaborative work, and the ability to meet the needs of different disciplines with a common mechanism were become evident over time.

AB  - Background: There is a growing body of evidence showing the value of community singing-based rehabilitation on psychosocial well-being and communication for people with post-stroke communication impairment (PSCI). However, there has been little consideration of the potential value an inpatient aphasia-friendly choir may have through the perspective of the stroke multidisciplinary team (MDT). Aims: To explore the experiences and views of the MDT on the role an established inpatient aphasia-friendly choir, at a stroke rehabilitation centre in South Wales, UK, may play in the rehabilitation of people with PSCI. Methods & Procedures: Eight participants were recruited from the stroke rehabilitation centre's MDT. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and the verbatim transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis according to Braun and Clark's work of 2006. Outcomes & Results: Four main themes were identified: (1) breaking down social isolation barriers; (2) patient voice and patient choice; (3) collective well-being and engagement; and (4) the therapeutic benefits across the MDT. The experiences and perceptions overlap, highlighting the wide-reaching therapeutic benefits of singing collaboratively. Conclusions & Implications: This research enables us to discover more about how the inpatient aphasia-friendly choir may enhance an individual's well-being, communication and confidence, and their overall rehabilitation from the MDT's perspective. By increasing our understanding of which aspects of the aphasia-friendly choir are most valued, future choir sessions can be better tailored to patients' needs. Additionally, the findings presented here could be taken forward and included in future speech and language therapy interventions, leading to increased patient ownership, not only of the choir but also of their other therapy goals.

AB  - This article discusses two multidisciplinary courses created at the Colorado School of Mines that were developed to integrate ethics into the first-year engineering curriculum: "Nature and Human Values" (NHV) and "Innovation and Discovery in Engineering, Arts, and Sciences" (IDEAS). In both NHV and IDEAS, our objectives are to meaningfully integrate personal and professional ethics within a larger context of integrating humanities and social sciences with engineering curricula. We teach students how to apply ethical reasoning in support of engineering solutions through user empathy, problem definition, stakeholder engagement, communication of outcomes, and analysis of contexts and impacts. In the process, we emphasize personal morals, professional ethics, and environmental ethics via literary readings and case studies that have a strong central narrative of engineering and/or environmental impacts. Students practice close reading and analysis, communication in many rhetorical modes, and evaluation of and reflection about the wider contexts and effects of design solutions. These practices, as well as course assessments, enable a focus on synthesis across learning outcomes. Collaboration between faculty from many disciplinary areas as well as student teamwork and group projects also supports this synthesis, and reflective portfolios encourage students to explore their ideas at different learning stages and to review their own perceptions and decisions over time. Our overall theory of change is to simultaneously infuse engineering problem solving with values-sensitive analysis and design, requiring communication skills and ethical reasoning at every step.

AB  - The complex nature of remote interpreting (RI) demands a multidisciplinary approach. The present article focuses on telephone interpreting (TI) in the light of the most relevant disciplines to suggest a coherent theoretical and methodologic framework. This approach will contribute to analysing TI components and mechanics, both for research purposes and for TI training. From the most general to the most fine-grained relevant paradigms, the authors will discuss the relevance of the following disciplines. The Ethnography of Communication will frame TI as a social activity. The sociology of Technologised Interaction will consider TI as the interaction between the social and the technical, where humans are constrained by the technical but also orient themselves towards the affordances offered by technology. In addition, Conversation Analysis will focus on talk as interaction. The role of Prosody and Phonetics in interpreter's positioning and agency and as a facilitator for a better coordination in turn-taking will also contribute to a more comprehensive approach to the study and training of TI. All these analytical paradigms need to be factored in when studying TI with a view to make RI trainees aware of the discursive mechanics -- both linguistic and paralinguistic- and of their potential to become effective technologised communicators.

AB  - Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs) have gained a lot of attention in higher education. Research has shown that they support student learning, faculty development, and congenial relations among faculty. This paper will shed light on a successful, multidisciplinary FLC comprised of nine faculty members who engaged in Flipped Classroom pedagogy over a two-year period. Guided by Cox's (2015) recommendations, the FLC members sought to improve their students' learning while at the same time enhance their instructional practice. Participation in the FLC led to (1) course redesign, (2) instructional redesign, (3) professional growth, and (4) a sense of community.

AB  - This paper discusses a practical, multidisciplinary approach used to embed employability skills in a new postgraduate (PGT) Engineering course at the University of Bath. Informed by relevant professional bodies, key transferable skills were identified and embedded in the curriculum with discipline-specific content. Students worked on a series of hands-on activities in which they integrated and applied principles and methodologies from various areas (linguistics, information, etc.), complementary to their technical expertise, as in the working environment. This was facilitated by a multidisciplinary team comprised of Academic and Professional Services staff at the University of Bath. The organisational context and rationale for the approach presented, including the practical implementation and initial outcomes in the new PGT course, are provided.

AB  - There is growing recognition of the importance of engaging postsecondary students in experiences that challenge them to solve complex socioscientific problems, transdisciplinary in nature, requiring students to integrate and synthesize knowledge, skills, and ways of thinking across disciplinary boundaries. Yet these student experiences are atypical. One possible reason is that the cross-disciplinary collaborations of faculty needed to create meaningful transdisciplinary student experiences are likely to be challenging. Lacking insight into these novel collaborations, we conducted a phenomenological study that describes faculty experiences across multiple disciplines and institutions to develop a transdisciplinary curriculum. Faculty were motivated by their professional development needs and a desire to improve their teaching practices and to develop curricula that would enhance student learning, all around a topic of personal interest. Yet faculty experienced tensions related to navigating norms, practices, and language across disciplines, the suitability of transdisciplinary curricula to their courses, and confidence in teaching across disciplines. Project leaders were essential facilitators and codevelopers, helping to alleviate some tensions. We discuss implications for faculty, academic leaders, administrators, and other stakeholders interested in involving faculty working across disciplines to develop transdisciplinary curricula, notably around a timely and important topic in the biological sciences.

AB  - To fully prepare college graduates to function competently and productively in their career, it is important to examine employers' views of technology competency and graduates' readiness. Using a qualitative approach by interviewing employers in South-eastern United States across a range of fields, the authors describe the major functions and dimensions of technology competency, compare similarities and differences across the disciplines, and integrate the results to inform theory and pedagogy. The main purpose of this research is to investigate how well new graduates from selected disciplines can transfer technological skills, how they learned and/or used these skills during their program of study. Investigators also introduced how a multi-disciplinary approach, which involved faculty from different backgrounds (Civil Engineering and Construction, Education and International Studies/Trade) through the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL)--Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs), was used to explore perceptions of technology competency. Results showed that all participants were dependent on the use of technology, but the degree of sophistication varied widely. Study is providing valuable information to the investigators for use in improving or revising educational curricula and pedagogical strategies to advance outcomes involving technology skills of the respective fields.

AB  - Students often experience difficulty in connecting knowledge from different college courses to solve complex problems such as ocean acidification, a pressing concern within the ongoing climate crisis. Here, we introduce a multidisciplinary activity in which students use their chemistry knowledge of change and stability in chemical systems through Le Chatelier's principle and equilibrium of coupled reactions to explain the biological phenomenon of how changes in CO[subscript 2] concentrations can impact shelled organisms and ecosystems more broadly in the ocean. In this activity, we build on prior literature and emphasize Three-Dimensional Learning (3DL) to support students in developing a deeper understanding of this complex problem. This Ocean Acidification activity asks students to explain (1) the relationship between CO[subscript 2] concentration and ocean pH and (2) how and why changes in ocean pH could weaken shelled organisms. Among 136 students in a second-semester general chemistry course at a large institution, 93% were able to correctly predict the relationship between CO[subscript 2] and pH (chemistry-biology connection). Additionally, 43% of the students were able to then further apply this knowledge correctly to explain an unfamiliar situation in which the decreased pH could lead to less available carbonate ion for the shells (biological phenomenon). This result highlights that while some students were able to correctly explain the biological phenomenon and make meaningful connections, others would require additional in-class scaffolding and student-instructor interaction to be able to integrate their knowledge to explain this unfamiliar complex biological phenomenon. Implications for teaching and future implementations are also discussed.

AB  - Academics at Griffith university envisioned a complementary learning and supportive relationship could be developed between Bachelor of Information Technology (BAIT) students and Master of Social Work (MSW) students. Discussions between discipline specific staff highlighted that each discipline had strengths and expertise that could assist students to overcome challenges brought about by systemic changes in tertiary education, gaps in skillsets and curriculum, and workforce expectations. Pressures included students attending university from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, the increasing importance of information technology (IT) in the classroom and workplace, as well as the requirement to communicate effectively across a range of disciplines. Working, interacting, and communicating effectively in cross-discipline and culturally diverse environments is a requisite for all graduates, however academics found there were few opportunities for students to partner across disciplinary silos. Staff from both disciplines collaborated to develop a conversational pedagogical framework to underpin a pilot program to support peer learning, using active problem-based learning with IT and social work students. The pilot program evidenced a complementary transdisciplinary, learning partnership and enabled students from IT to help students from social work develop IT skills, while social work students assisted IT students to become more confident in their interpersonal communication skills.

AB  - This paper presents the description and analysis of a didactic experience involving the participation of a university and a community school, developed as part of the National Science and Technology Week, at a public university in northeastern Brazil. For this purpose, the use of learning station rotation enabled innovation in the teaching of physiology integrated with biochemistry and health education contents. The didactic approach consisted of creating a learning circuit comprising seven stations. The central theme of the stations emphasized physiology, with specific foci on biochemistry and cardiorespiratory and endocrine health. Each station provided unique activities related to the central theme, including a station concerning digital technology in physiology. The school students were divided into small groups (6 or 7 people) that rotated through the stations, with a total of 81 students visiting each station. A qualitative assessment was performed using a Likert-scale questionnaire to measure the level of satisfaction of the students. It was found that this didactic approach increased the receptivity of the students to the contents, facilitated student-teacher dialogue, and provided an excellent tool for establishing an interface between the university and the community school. Overall, 76.5% of the students rated the activity as excellent.

AB  - In order for English majors in Iran to be sustainable for the future world of emerging dynamic changes, moving towards the paradigm of complexity (CP) seems to be a promising option for academic settings. However, any renewal should be carefully studied before it is ready to be implemented. The present analytical paper, therefore, elaborates on some key characteristics of CP, suggests a type of instruction that may be best compatible with the goals of CP: creativity and sustainability, and considers some positive and negative aspects of putting CP into effect. In addition, CP is shown to be a future-focused, transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary, open, dynamic system in which anti-monopolistic ideas, and cross-cultural tolerance and peace are highlighted. On the other hand, it is capable of raising some arguable sociocultural and psychological concerns such as national identity issues and information overload that need to be carefully addressed. Finally, it is proposed that CP is a novel research niche that invites future researchers, material developers, and language policy makers to explore it from different perspectives.

AB  - The 21st century STEM researcher is increasingly called upon to work collaboratively on large-scale societal challenges. In this setting, disciplinary methods and methodologies may function as starting points, but they lack a focus on the metacognition and inquiry-based thinking required to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize diverse global problems. Transdisciplinary theories of learning push researchers and students to make just such a move beyond the boundaries of disciplinarity and toward the co-creation and co-use of knowledge that is the result of interactions between the academic disciplines and society: government, industry, and civil society. For graduate programs with limited financial resources, faculty resources, and collaborative working spaces, cohort learning models may ameliorate the practical "costs" of transdisciplinary research and education while providing precisely the environment in which it may flourish. This article presents the rationale, structure, and assessment plan for one such STEM cohort learning community.

AB  - Interdisciplinary learning has become prevalent as a means of solving problems encountered in everyday life. Yet, there is a lack of experimental studies investigating strategies to facilitate interdisciplinary learning. This study explored the impacts of timing and types of instructional materials on the study of interdisciplinary subjects. A 2 × 2 quasi-experimental design was conducted in which the first independent variable was the timing of instructional materials (prior versus after) and the other was the types of gameplay (digital versus non-digital game). The dependent variables were learning outcomes and academic emotions. A sample of 134 seventh graders participated in the study. The results indicated that the timing of instructional materials resulted in significant differences on students' learning outcomes. Moreover, the effects of the timing of instructional materials in conjunction with the types of gameplay improved interdisciplinary learning outcomes and induced positive emotions. Discussions of the findings and pedagogical implications are provided.

AB  - Over the past decade, a newer class of interventions has emerged specifically designed for young children with or at high likelihood of autism, which are called Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBIs). NDBIs are particularly well-suited as a discipline agnostic, primary intervention for young children with autism and other social communication challenges; however, community providers from multiple disciplinary backgrounds who serve these children typically do not develop competencies in areas crucial for effectively implementing NDBI. The goal of this commentary is to: (a) describe the interdisciplinary competencies needed to deliver NDBIs effectively and (b) provide recommendations for moving the field of early intervention for autism and social communication delays forward. Resources for building these competencies for providers at the pre- and in-service level are also provided.

AB  - Natural phenomena and scientific issues are intrinsically interdisciplinary. Students need to study a variety of academic disciplines in the natural sciences to explain a phenomenon or its related problems. Our goal in the current study was to examine the epistemological foundation of students' interdisciplinary understanding of carbon cycling using the supervised latent Dirichlet allocation model. The 454 students in this study were from a public high school and a public research university in Texas. The students' interdisciplinary understanding was shown in each of the constructed response items. In the relationship between the proportion of interdisciplinarity in students' answers to the constructed response items and students' scores on interdisciplinary understanding, all integrations of disciplines were statistically significant in explaining students' interdisciplinary understanding. Moreover, one particular integration set had advantages for obtaining a high score. We found that science coursework contributed to students' interdisciplinary understanding in different ways, and this interdisciplinary understanding was influenced by the number and type of science courses taken. Characterizing interdisciplinarity based on the clusters of science disciplines provided insights into how students synthesize their knowledge. The significance of this study lies in its potential impact on diverse curricular and instructional approaches in interdisciplinary science education.

AB  - Emergent programs or newly established areas of study are often viewed as interdisciplinary. But how is interdisciplinarity defined or measured? The identification of research methods and the selection of objects of inquiry are significant elements in this definition. Citation analysis, however, also plays a role. Citation patterns in master's theses in the field of LGBTQ studies at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada, indicate, at first glance, that the field is highly interdisciplinary. The field cites from different disciplines or areas of study as defined by the Library of Congress Classification (LCC) system. A closer examination reveals that 43.3 percent of all classified citations are about LGBTQ topics, leading to the conclusion that LGBTQ studies shows an average, rather than a high, level of interdisciplinarity, and that the field has a distinct disciplinary focus. This finding informs reference work, research assistance, and bibliographic instruction.

AB  - Communication center clients come in various forms. Many centers work with individuals and groups while some work with entire classrooms, departments, or colleges. Very few centers "both" partner with other campus consulting services "and" interact with large units. While a considerable amount of literature focuses on one-on-one consultations and some work focuses on collaboration between similar centers (McCall, Ellis, & Murphy, 2017), little, if any, research deals with these unique partnerships "and" how they collaborate to serve groups. This article examines how one communication center partnered with two other campus consulting services to create a purposeful and collaborative relationship with three sections of a communication course for an entire semester each. The goal of this work is to test effectiveness value of communication and similar consultants in the classroom, and to understand if one approach to consultant inclusion in the classroom is more empowering than another. To accomplish these goals, three groups, or classes, of students were used. The control group excluded all consultant participation. One experimental group had consultants embedded themselves into each class meeting. The other experimental group had consultants provide service-specific workshops during select class meetings. The collaborative partnership for this study included speaking, writing, and research center consultants and pre-and post-semester scales were used to compare empowerment levels and subject knowledge values between groups. Results suggest the workshop group produces higher empowerment and learning levels than other groups.

AB  - This study examined the experiences of three new online instructors supported by a multidisciplinary, team-based model of course development and how their experiences may transform their knowledge of teaching and learning. In-depth, individual interviews with instructors during the course development process provided insights into participants' perspectives. Analysis reveals faculty reflected positively on the overall development process and that they intend to incorporate new understandings in future course design, suggesting that the model provides a solid foundation for online course development and faculty support. Based on a cross-case analysis using Cranton's (2002) adaptations to transformative learning theory, findings indicated the importance of critical reflection and discourse during the course development process. Lastly, the need for development teams to acknowledge time-management concerns and to consider instructors as novice learners is recognized as an essential requirement to online course development.

AB  - There are still many unanswered questions regarding the application of response to intervention (RTI) to making eligibility decisions for specific learning disabilities (SLD). Both U.S. federal regulations and research support that students identified with SLD using RTI should be deficient in both level of academic functioning and rate of growth in response to scientifically based instruction. To date, there is little research examining whether these eligibility criteria are predictive in identifying students with SLD by evaluation teams in schools. Two studies conducted in different U.S. states examined if level of academic performance and rate of improvement (ROI) using curriculum-based measurement in reading (CBM-R) predicted student eligibility for special education. Logistic regression results indicated that level of performance predicted special education eligibility across sites and that ROI did not. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Few studies have explored student perceptions of participating in STEM multidisciplinary students-as-partners (SaP) projects integrated into the curriculum. We conducted content analysis on focus groups to determine partner perceptions of a STEM and liberal arts SaP project and used a mixed methods concurrent triangulation design to explore the degree to which partners thought the underpinning SaP values had been enacted. Four staff and seven students participated in the study. Perceptions of the project were aligned to four themes: outstanding student experience, development of student employability skills, a transformative change in the student-to-staff relationship, and barriers to success and enabling strategies. Qualitative and quantitative data indicated strong inclusion of the partnership values. This paper provides new insights into STEM and liberal arts SaP projects, indicating they may be well-suited to the embodiment of the underpinning SaP values, and help students prepare for the world of work.

AB  - Understanding and working with the complexity of second language learning and use in an intercultural orientation necessitates a re-examination of the different theories of learning that inform the different schools of second language acquisition (SLA). This re-examination takes place in a context where explicitly conceptualizing the nature of learning in SLA has not been sufficiently foregrounded. It also necessitates understanding how language itself, as the substance or object of learning a second language, is conceptualized. Neither the theorization of learning, nor of language on its own is sufficient to provide an adequate account of second language learning for contemporary times. In particular, this paper argues that views of language and learning derived solely from the field of (applied) linguistics are not sufficient to address the complex language learning needs of contemporary times and that a more interdisciplinary approach to language and learning is required. It is this interdisciplinary understanding that provides the basis for views of both language and learning that we consider to be necessary within an intercultural orientation. In particular, the paper will emphasize the interpretative nature of learning and the ways that such a view contributes to our understanding of learning in language education. From this perspective, the process of learning to communicate in a second language can be characterized as involving both a "moving between" linguistic and cultural systems and an acknowledgement of the role of mutual interpretation in exchanging meanings through the acts of both communicating and learning.

AB  - Continuous developments in the electronics industry have led to constantly changing career roles and graduate skills requirements. Students in the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) have complained that numerous courses in electronic engineering are heavily focused on theoretical knowledge that is disconnected from the needs of the industry. Thus, in an effort toward delivering student-centered educational programmes that meet the needs of the industry, this article introduces an innovative course that was developed using the project-based learning (PBL) method and situated in the electronic engineering undergraduate programme at UESTC. Since real-world engineering projects require teams to collaborate on ill-defined problems, we focused this innovative course on developing professional and technical skills, drawing from a range of more typical electronic engineering courses. We provide full details of two projects that were created for this PBL approach and evaluate them as practice examples that demonstrate the impact of this practical pedagogic innovation in UESTC. According to our evaluation, completed by all 40 of our enrolled students, our innovative course based on interdisciplinary PBL exercises demonstrated a significant improvement in student satisfaction and 65% of students preferred the interdisciplinary PBL course in comparison to traditional lecture-based courses.

AB  - This convergent parallel mixed-methods pilot study explored the collaboration of preservice teachers (PSTs) in a university reading clinic. PSTs from a reading course and special education course were paired and shared responsibility for tutoring one child. Tutor surveys and focus group interview transcripts were used as data sources. Topics addressed by tutors related to benefits and barriers of collaboration, including the influence of collaborative relationships on their personal growth and on the growth of their tutee, strategies for establishing relationships and trust, and the ways they perceive collaboration as practice for future teaching. This study has implications for how teacher preparation program faculty prepare teachers to work alongside colleagues of various disciplines in future school settings.

AB  - In interdisciplinary education, students find out that even basic concepts such as time, freedom or control mean different things for different disciplines and individuals. Through such encounters, students develop an ever-richer conceptual toolbox for making sense of the world. But, how do concepts travel (Bal, 2002) in an interdisciplinary classroom? I address this question from the perspective of behavior settings theory, which shows how the concrete spatiotemporal characteristics of an environment structure and guide the behavior of its participants. By means of a case study, I analyze the interdisciplinary classroom as a behavior setting and argue that concepts can travel when the setting stimulates students and teachers to spend time and interact with each other in specific ways.

AB  - This article brings together interdisciplinary perspectives from three artist-scholars. More specifically, we examine the impact of performances of listening and care in works addressing connections to personal identity, trauma, and violence and the anxieties that these can provoke in our roles as artists, researchers, and pedagogues. We ask: how can embodied witnessing help to reimagine the concepts of agency and risk when engaging with stories of trauma, violence, and suffering? How do these concepts help us to foster critical self-reflexivity and care in our relationships with others, the materials we use, and the spaces we inhabit?

AB  - During recent decades, educational reform in the U.S. has favored standards-driven curricula with the purpose of improving education. However, national assessments have not demonstrated significant improvements in educational outcomes, especially among economically disadvantaged and minoritized populations. To mitigate these outcomes, youth-serving organizations provide children from these populations with out-of-school time programs to enhance their academic and social skills. This study highlights the significance of programs offered by nonprofit organizations like the Boys & Girls Clubs and the need to establish partnerships with universities to foster systematic collaboration. The program described in this article is a one-week summer science camp for students entering grades 4-7. The authors created an instructional unit that integrated literacy and mathematics into a science unit focused on water quality and related environmental issues, while also exploring student outcomes. The interdisciplinary project-based instructional unit focused on culturally responsive practices. Through these practices, students developed awareness of environmental issues and increased their understanding and use of scientific vocabulary related to water quality.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to understand the learning outcomes of students who participate in interdisciplinary hands-on advanced technology courses and the factors influencing their outcomes as well as to determine whether learning outcomes and cognitive development are affected by students' motivation for selecting the course with regard to their learning abilities. The subjects of this study are students who were enrolled in interdisciplinary advanced technology courses at a university located in Northern Taiwan from 2020 to 2021. We recruited 171 students to complete measures of their motivation for selecting the course and to complete a prelearning outcome scale during the first week; a learning abilities scale was completed during the ninth week; and a postlearning outcomes scale was completed during the sixteenth week. We recruited 96 students to participate in interviews after they completed the course to determine their cognitive development. The results showed that participants' average learning outcomes scores on the posttest were significantly higher than those on the pretest. After students participated in the course, 66.7% of them were in the "Apply" stage, indicating they could apply the knowledge they learned to other situations, while 25% were in the "Analyze" stage, indicating they could deconstruct the course knowledge based on its structure and understand the correlations among various items of course knowledge.

AB  - In some European countries inquiry-based learning (IBL) has become popular in primary and secondary mathematics education, especially for scienceconnected content. On the other hand, problem-based learning (PBL) and project-based learning (PjBL) have a longer history in mathematics, science, technology, engineering (STEM) and in some other fields in higher education. We analyse a selection of n=112 high quality research articles about the use of IBL, PBL or PjBL in mathematics, and its interdisciplinary connection with other subjects, level of education, type of research method, research design and participants for each study. Based on these characteristics, we identify the differences between the approaches in mathematics education. Finally, detailed examination of a subsample of experimental studies, where effect size is or can be measured, describes differences in interdisciplinary connections between the target approaches and indicate what kind of studies are still missing in mathematics education.

AB  - This case study piloted an interdisciplinary Problem-Based Learning course, utilizing Hung's (2006) 3C3R model. We explain the course design, curriculum, and implementation. We collected qualitative written questionnaires from students who participated in the course to investigate their learning experiences. As a result, students shed light on lessons they learned throughout the course, which led to the creation of a lessons learned guide for future instructors. This guide encompasses 8 lessons that were gleaned by both qualitative student feedback and instructor reflections from the course. These lessons include allocating in-class time to work on projects, using a modular approach in the course design, presenting students with real-life problems related to the topic of the course, providing in-class case studies for students to get acquainted with examples of previous work, grouping students from diverse academic backgrounds together when possible, utilizing online and librarian resources, surveying the classroom on their comfort with self-directed learning beforehand, and including a self-reflection piece at the end of the course.

AB  - The global COVID-19 emergency disrupted educational systems and created internship crises for universities and students. In response, one west coast social work program's practicum education department developed virtual, interactive labs that addressed the Grand Challenges (GCs), increased interdisciplinary collaboration, and ensured the continuation of student practicum. The Experiential Learning Labs (ELLs) created an organic collective of academics, students, and practitioners who invested in student learning while advancing their pedagogy. Additionally, the ELLs aligned with the GCs by engaging with students virtually (Eradicate Social Isolation) and adapting practicum education standards to meet expectations (Create Social Responses to a Changing Environment). Finally, this conceptual article describes how skills were built and strategies identified for faculty members and students to increase interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - Developing social workers' capacity and engagement in collaborative community-based innovations to climate-driven and other environmental hazards better ensures progress on the Grand Challenges. Such inclusive solutions value community leadership and are culturally responsive and justice-centered. Multisolving, pioneered by Dr. Elizabeth Sawin, offers a framework to pair social work goals from the Grand Challenges with climate-responsive interdisciplinary solutions by tackling multiple problems simultaneously with a single investment of resources. Exploring multisolving case studies that align closely with the Grand Challenge to create social responses to a changing environment, the authors consider collaborations and share experiences teaching courses and workshops that integrate multisolving into the social work curriculum and align with professional ethics to achieve these goals.

AB  - The community engagement project described in this article took the form of the re-invention and re-interpretation of a historic symbol (Diana the elephant) on the Potchefstroom Campus of North-West University (NWU), South Africa. In 2015, the Faculty of Education Sciences invited staff and students to reinterpret the elephant (a symbol of education, longevity, wisdom, care, stamina, memory) in a new and more multicultural, multilingual, inclusive and environmentally conscious South Africa. The participatory process described, and the related outcomes, involved learning by students and academics across disciplines (the conceptualisation, design, engineering and creation of the structure) and collaboration between academics, children and adults from the community, all with a strong service-learning dimension in relation to teacher education.

AB  - This research presents results for the design and creation of supporting teaching materials using additive manufacturing. The materials are inspired by selected artwork of four animal species, which belong to a collection from the museum of the University of Antioquia. The topic selected was fauna in Colombia, and the animals in question were chosen based on important roles they have in areas like health, the environment, and food. These animals will complement science education given to several age groups visiting the museum. In addition to the 3D-manufactured objects, a study was conducted using several age groups that are very relevant to the museum: children, teenagers, and first year undergraduate students. A video showing technical information cards about the manufacturing process was also developed. This project was multidisciplinary, involving collaboration between the engineering school, the museum, and a local high school. The results showed that young visitors want complete information on the animals and to have interaction with the animal models, which is not always possible. This project serves as a local strategy not only for taking arts and knowledge out of the museum but also for planning first year courses in the university and thus reducing problems like school dropout, low motivation, and poor performance in national exams.

AB  - Background: Transforming the culture of STEM higher education to be more inclusive and help more students reach STEM careers is challenging. Herein, we describe a new model for STEM higher education transformation, the Sustainable, Transformative Engagement across a Multi-Institution/Multidisciplinary STEM, (STEM)[superscript 2], "STEM-squared", Network. The Network embraces a pathways model, as opposed to a pipeline model, to STEM career entry. It is founded upon three strong theoretical frameworks: Communities of Transformation, systems design for organizational change, and emergent outcomes for the diffusion of innovations in STEM education. Currently composed of five institutions--three private 4-year universities and two public community colleges--the Network capitalizes on the close geographic proximity and shared student demographics to effect change across the classroom, disciplinary, institutional, and inter-institutional levels. Results: The (STEM)[superscript 2] Network has increased the extent to which participants feel empowered to be change agents for STEM higher education reform and has increased collaboration across disciplines and institutions. Participants were motivated to join the Network to improve STEM education, to improve the transfer student experience, to collaborate with colleagues across disciplines and institutions, and because they respected the leadership team. Participants continue to engage in the Network because of the collaborations created, opportunities for professional growth, opportunities to improve STEM education, and a sense that the Network is functioning as intended. Conclusion: The goal to increase the number and diversity of people entering STEM careers is predicated on transforming the STEM higher education system to embrace a pathways model to a STEM career. The (STEM)[superscript 2] Network is achieving this by empowering faculty to transform the system from the inside. While the systemic transformation of STEM higher education is challenging, the (STEM)[superscript 2] Network directly addresses those challenges by bridging disciplinary and institutional silos and leveraging the reward structure of the current system to support faculty as they work to transform this very system.

AB  - This article presents the application of the problem-based learning (PBL) methodology for introducing the civil engineering task of bridge design and construction to high school students with a multidisciplinary approach. The materials (toy construction system) and methodology of the workshop are first presented. Then, three examples of arch typology proposals are detailed, as an example of the evolution of the students' designs in time while retrofitting the successive editions. A selection of the built structures along with some pictures of their most representative details in the decks and arches are included. Finally, the different experiences obtained from this activity are also reviewed. The objective of this paper is to present the observations of the authors after several years of conducting this workshop with the hope that colleagues from other institutions might benefit from the strategies exposed and adapt them to different disciplines or focus on specific topics. The key observation was that the use of construction toys, which are not usually used by teachers, proved to be a powerful learning tool, the limitations of which can be overcome, and the method used was improved annually to realize the objective.

AB  - A responsibility of faculty at liberal arts colleges is to help students make connections between bodies of knowledge through interdisciplinary programs. One opportunity for faculty to create interdisciplinary learning opportunities is with a short-term study abroad course. The purpose of this article is to provide a model of an interdisciplinary course that brought together two disparate non-language disciplines--biochemistry and communication--to study human longevity in a short-term study abroad experience. Providing course design and three overarching guidelines as they bridged the science of diet and nutrition and relational communication, the authors offer an interdisciplinary model for those interested in creating more meaningful short-term study abroad courses.

AB  - A phenomenon from the natural world, cricket chirping behavior in relation to ambient temperature, is used as the springboard for engaging the curiosity of gifted students in an interdisciplinary classroom curriculum. Mathematics and science standards and disciplinary practices are prominent in the investigation, while other disciplines deepen the experience. An analysis of the cricket project in terms of the Parallel Curriculum (core, connections, practice, and identity) provides an interesting lens for examining interdisciplinarity (see Tomlinson, C. A., Kaplan, S. N., Renzulli, and J. S., et al. (2009). Parallel curriculum: "A design to develop learner potential and challenge advanced learners." Corwin Press).

AB  - Purpose: Despite federal legislation requiring youth engagement in their transition planning, students with disabilities continue to be passive partners in this transition process, under informed about the process and future possibilities, and with goals misaligned with their hopes. Students with specific disabilities and those who are English learners, Black, Indigenous, and from communities of color are even more impacted by the lack of active opportunities to provide direction on their futures. Method: The authors conducted a scoping literature review of youth engagement in the transition process for students served under Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Results: A shift towards active engagement for students in the transition process is critical. Inequitable experiences in that process exist for students based on individual and environmental characteristics. Active engagement will require direct, deliberate instruction and amelioration of structural barriers. Conclusions: As a bridge between school years and adult environments, vocational rehabilitation counselors have an important role in supporting the engagement of students in transition planning as they learn and practice self-determination and self-advocacy skills to lead planning towards their future.

AB  - The literacy design collaborative (LDC) was created to support teachers in implementing college and career readiness standards. Teachers work collaboratively with coaches to further develop their expertise and design standards-driven, literacy-rich writing assignments within their existing curriculum across content areas. The current paper reports on early student academic outcome results from a multi-year mixed methods study of the implementation and effect of LDC using a quasi-experimental design, as implemented in one large urban school district. We found LDC had statistically significant effects on Cohort 2 middle school students' English language arts (ELA) performance, an effect size of (d = 0.15) for students receiving LDC instruction in the three core content areas LDC focuses on: ELA, science, and social studies/history.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to reveal learning potential in crossing disciplinary boundaries in facilitated workshops by exploring the research goal definition process of interdisciplinary research teams. It uses multilevel boundary crossing as a theoretical framework to illustrate the multilevel nature of team learning mechanisms in interdisciplinary research. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a qualitative case study approach. The data was collected from semi-structured interviews and collaborative workshops of interdisciplinary researchers. The data analysis is based on pre-existing theory and the process of analysis is both data and theory driven. Findings: The results indicate that although defining interdisciplinary research goals is a complex and demanding task, collaborative and facilitated workshops may support boundary crossing on intrapersonal, interpersonal and institutional levels. The team members efforts in defining their shared research interest revealed dialogical learning mechanisms of identification, coordination, reflection and the first phases of transformation, particularly at the interpersonal level. However, the transformative actions seemed to require intentional team facilitation. Originality/value: This case study enriches the existing literature and allows better understanding of how team facilitation can promote agenda setting, transformative learning mechanisms and the definition of joint research goals in interdisciplinary settings.

AB  - Research Reproducibility: Educating for Reproducibility, Pathways to Research Integrity was an interdisciplinary, conference hosted virtually by the University of Florida in December 2020. This event brought together educators, researchers, students, policy makers, and industry representatives from across the globe to explore best practices, innovations, and new ideas for education around reproducibility and replicability. Emphasizing a broad view of rigor and reproducibility, the conference touched on many aspects of introducing learners to transparency, rigorous study design, data science, data management, replications, and more. Transdisciplinary themes emerged from the panels, keynote, and submitted papers and poster presentations. The identified themes included lifelong learning, cultivating bottom-up change, "sneaking in" learning, just-in-time learning, targeting learners by career stage, learning by doing, learning how to learn, establishing communities of practice, librarians as interdisciplinary leaders, teamwork skills, rewards and incentives, and implementing top-down change. For each of these themes, we share ideas, practices, and actions as discussed by the conference speakers and attendees.

AB  - Research impact on various societal spheres has been increasingly demanded for funding purposes and as a form of demonstrating the relevance of scientific research for societal problems. In this context, interest in interdisciplinary research and knowledge coproduction has grown as a path to achieve this expected impact, but few studies have considered its conjoint association with societal impact. This article investigates how academic research undertaken in interdisciplinary groups impacts public policies. To this end, we used a multiple case study strategy (involving three broad interdisciplinary research groups) to understand how the differences regarding knowledge coproduction with policy actors were relevant to explain differences in research impacts: instrumental, conceptual, symbolic and capacity-building. All the groups studied presented some type of impact in public policies, with emphasis on conceptual impact. The importance of knowledge coproduction was highlighted in two broad interdisciplinary groups since they stood out with more instrumental impacts compared to the other one. We argue that the combination of broad interdisciplinarity of the group together with the coproduction of knowledge with policymakers as co-researchers produces research that has more impact on the public policy community, especially translated as instrumental impact.

AB  - This study addresses the views of teachers about the benefits of interdisciplinary teaching practices in primary and secondary school education curricula, the level of the use of interdisciplinary approach and the place of interdisciplinary approach in the curriculum. The study seeks to examine the views of teachers about the interdisciplinary approach and their level of use of this approach in primary and secondary education curricula. To this end, the explanatory mixed design was employed in the study. A descriptive scanning model was employed for the quantitative dimension of the study. In the quantitative dimension, the phenomenological method was used. The Interdisciplinary Teaching Approach Questionnaire was utilized to gather quantitative data, and qualitative data were gathered through a semi-structured interview form. The sample of the research is composed of 413 classroom and branch teachers working in official primary and secondary schools in the central districts of Denizli. Consequentially, it can be argued that teachers have positive views on the interdisciplinary approach. Further, the teachers found the interdisciplinary approach relatively useful, however, they did not effectively implement it in in-class activities as this approach was not sufficiently incorporated into the curriculum. Teachers' views on the interdisciplinary approach differed by the variables of professional seniority and teaching level, whereas the gender variable was not found to be a significant predictor.

AB  - Although there has been a recent surge of interest in financial literacy some inadequacies based on interdisciplinary approach in teachers' instructional practices within the scope of financial education draw attention. This research focused on improving the teaching process of elementary school teachers by integrating financial literacy into an interdisciplinary approach to social studies teaching. Research was conducted in three elementary schools with low socioeconomic status in three different cities in Türkiye. The data obtained from reflection forms, student products, and semi-structured interview forms were analyzed using MAXQDA 2020 program. As a result of examining views on the instructional practices implemented, participants indicated that they contributed to developing various instructional competencies, such as the acquisition of interdisciplinary skills, the effective use of information technologies, observing the effects of interdisciplinary, and preparing original materials and activities. In addition, participants indicated that the activities implemented provided students with opportunities to learn new financial concepts, new skills, sustained and meaningful learning, active participation, transfer to real life, positive feedback from parents, learning, and reinforcement with fun.

AB  - The Common Problems Project (CP2) is an interdisciplinary, problem-based pedagogy that was launched in 2015 by four partner colleges in the State University of New York (SUNY) system (Cortland, Oneonta, Oswego, and Plattsburgh). Since its inception, 100 faculty have participated in CP2 and integrated the pedagogy into 134 courses to implement 47 collaborative projects. CP2 is based on a simple but innovative approach in which instructors from different disciplines identify a real-world problem they have in common. They pair their relevant existing classes so that students can work in interdisciplinary teams to propose solutions to the problem. This paper describes CP2 and its theoretical underpinnings, provides the results of a three-pronged approach to assessment, and outlines recommendations for faculty and institutions who may be interested in replicating CP2 on their campuses. CP2 model holds promise for a future of collaborative problem solving as a pedagogical approach, and, as such, this article will be of interest to a wide range of scholars, practitioners, educators, and administrators.

AB  - International service-learning provides opportunities to explore concepts of social justice with students. In this study, we describe the structure of a summer international, interdisciplinary service-learning experience for undergraduate and graduate students. We describe the ways in which these students engaged in social justice education and the experiences which the participants felt were most meaningful. Finally, we examine how experiences influenced four undergraduate students' beliefs and understandings of social justice. The participants reported increases in the five components of social justice education identified by Hackman (2005): multicultural group dynamics, their ability to engage in personal reflection, their content understanding, their ability to enact social change, and their ability to engage in critical analysis. Through their experiences, participants shifted their concept of social justice towards a more process focused conception (Rawls, 1985).

AB  - The European School for Interdisciplinary Tinnitus Research (ESIT) is an EU-funded doctoral training network. ESIT is a consortium of 12 universities, over 30 commercial and not-for-profit organizations, and 15 PhD students providing cutting-edge education across 10 European countries to develop highly knowledgeable and innovative experts in the field of tinnitus research. The ESIT consortium is composed of multidisciplinary researchers and academics engaged in supervising culturally diverse students from nine countries. Over the span of 4 years, ESIT students demonstrated transformational growth in academic and personal spheres and overcame multiple challenges. This case study documents the meaningful partnerships developed between students and the ESIT support network and some of the challenges faced by ESIT in training 15 international students during a global pandemic. It documents the co-creation of knowledge achieved by those engaged in a global shared learning journey and the conflicts and cultural dimensions that they navigated.

AB  - In moves to fortify the discipline and articulate its value, does writing studies risk perpetuating narrow views of disciplinarity and academic writing? Drawing from an analysis of the intersections between WAC/WID [Writing Across the Curriculum/Writing in the Disciplines] and transfer scholarship in popular rhetoric and composition journals, I call for more direct engagement between these two areas of specialization. I argue that bringing transfer and WAC/WID together can craft models of academic writing that embrace--as opposed to erase--the complexities of students' lived experiences. I conclude by suggesting avenues for engagement between WAC/WID and transfer that can promote richer understandings of the relationship between writing and learning across transdisciplinary spaces.

AB  - The recent movement to include art and design in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education has made Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) an increasingly common acronym in the education lexicon. The STEAM movement builds on existing models of interdisciplinary curriculum, but what makes the union of art and design with the STEM disciplines so persuasive? In this article, I draw from research on interdisciplinary curricular projects that fit into the category of STEAM, but may also be considered inquiries into the role of art and design in the creative inquiry process, in order to sketch a transdisciplinary curriculum model that may be applied across disciplines.

AB  - Complexity is among the main drivers that justify and guide the genesis and establishment of multi-, inter- and transdisciplinary approaches to the production and application of knowledge. Complexity can be read in the relatively canonical taxonomy of these concepts that structure epistemological reflections on the dynamics of knowledge production lying between and beyond disciplinary boundaries, a taxonomy that Julie Thompson Klein and other leading interdisciplinarians have proposed. The introduction of the concept of postdisciplinarity into this conceptual evolution allows for further reflection on more or less likely scenarios for the development of university institutions, scenarios more or less transgressive of the disciplinary status quo. These possible epistemological and institutional mutations would require actors who are cognitively available and open to change, or even frankly "undisciplined," with the goal of transforming academic institutions into the university of the future by fostering breakthrough innovation.

AB  - The objective of ESD is to make people think differently about lifestyles as well as economic and political structures, to raise awareness for complex problems, to sharpen political judgment and to empower people to act. A means to achieve these objectives is to engage students in action-oriented learning. The ESD courses aimed at implementing transdisciplinary projects to go beyond the acquisition of knowledge about sustainable development but to make students act. The courses were in line with ESD objectives but came with specific challenges particularly with regard to implementing real life projects.

AB  - The article examines the complexities associated with effectively and comprehensively tackling the climate change crisis. Focusing on the need for education, the authors discuss a model of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) that supports the development of competencies, coalition building and the capacity to support and maintain positive action. Drawing upon principles highlighted by the United Nations, the paper outlines the breadth and depth of knowledge required to support transformative ESD. Firstly enhancing comprehensive knowledge that develops cognitive, affective and axiological dimensions and proficiency. This enhances critical engagement with information and enables individuals to act responsibly and align with others in coalition building. The second element refers to collaborative partnership that is crucial for changes to be effective. This has been one of the most challenging barriers preventing positive action on the catastrophe pf climate change. Finally, the paper emphasizes the need to develop the competencies for supporting collective action, which will enable sustained action across transnational, transdisciplinary and transnational boundaries.

AB  - The Center for Cybersecurity Education and Research at Old Dominion University has expanded its use of high impact practices in the university's undergraduate cybersecurity degree program. Strategies developed to promote student learning included learning communities, undergraduate research, a robust internship program, service learning, and electronic portfolios. This paper reviews the literature on these practices, highlights the way that they were implemented in our cybersecurity program, and discusses some of the challenges encountered with each practice. Although the prior literature on high impact practices rarely touches on cybersecurity coursework, the robust evidence of the success of those practices provides a sound rationale for applying them across the curricula. Challenges confronted included developing partnerships, introducing students to new learning strategies, and gaining buy in from faculty. Despite these challenges, the authors' experiences with the efforts also support using high impact practices in cybersecurity programs. Recommendations for other cybersecurity programs seeking to expand the use of high impact practices include integrating experiential learning throughout the curricula, developing campus-wide partnerships, embracing the interdisciplinary nature of cybersecurity, demonstrating the purpose of the practices, providing faculty development, emphasizing writing, and embracing failure.

AB  - This paper sets out to identify the ways in which academic libraries can further interdisciplinary scholarship on campus. The medical humanities is presented as an example to interrogate the current practices in academic libraries and to inform future efforts in support of interdisciplinarity. Text mining was employed to illuminate trends in this interdisciplinary field using program descriptions from universities with "very high research activity" as a data set for analysis. Based on these data, this article proposes best practices and opportunities for engagement in the medical humanities that may be applicable to other interdisciplinary fields served by research libraries.

AB  - Interdisciplinary project teams are increasingly vital in organizations that are focused on providing successful technical solutions that include a positive user experience. In response to the need for experience in this area, some higher education institutions have created interdisciplinary project-based experiential learning opportunities. In this research, we examine an interdisciplinary computing capstone course and present results from a qualitative study of student participants. We investigate how teams in an interdisciplinary capstone course self-organize, what convictions drive these decisions, and how they assess and value the expected contributions from disciplines other than their own. We analyze students' attitudes, beliefs, and motivations as gleaned from interviews and offer suggested improvement strategies for future interdisciplinary capstone courses.

AB  - Concept mapping facilitates the externalisation and internalisation of knowledge by individuals during collaborative knowledge construction. However, not much is known about the individual and collaborative learning processes during collaborative concept mapping (CCM) in interdisciplinary knowledge construction. Premised on literature on collaboration scripts to scaffold the collaboration process, this study investigates the effect of an individual preparation phase prior to collaborative work on the epistemic and social processes of knowledge co-construction, as well as the degree of interdisciplinary knowledge integration in collaborative concept mapping. A total of N = 42 third year university students were put into one of the two experimental conditions: with individual preparation phase (WIP) and without individual preparation phase (WOIP). Students worked on a collaborative assignment to integrate interdisciplinary knowledge in collaborative concept mapping. Data for analysis was derived from audio recordings of the collaborative discourse in both experimental conditions. Chi-square test was conducted to investigate if there were significant differences between the effects of WIP and WOIP on the epistemological and social dimension. Findings showed that groups in the WIP condition showed significantly more verification, clarification and positioning statements in the epistemic dimension and also significantly more integration-oriented and conflict-oriented consensus building in the social dimension as compared to groups in the WOIP condition. On the degree of interdisciplinary knowledge integration, independent sample t-tests showed that there was no significant difference for concepts, domains and cross-links between the two experimental conditions. However, there was significant difference in types of cross-links for the CCMs in the WIP condition.

AB  - Creativity, giftedness, and leadership are complex, important phenomena, especially in the threatening turbulence of 21st-century conditions; consequently, there is an increasing need to understand how to strengthen them. We can learn much about these phenomena from within the borders of specialized disciplines; however, they are too complex and multifaceted to fit within the walls of disciplinary silos. Interdisciplinary explorations can reveal theories and research findings that expand our knowledge bases about creativity, giftedness, and leadership. This analysis includes the rationale for engaging in interdisciplinary investigations for these purposes. It includes examples of the ways in which interdisciplinary thinking invigorates creativity and cognitive diversity; illuminates the benefits of visual--spatial gifts that strengthen the development of important talents in gifted students who can go on to become creative leaders; and shows how human rights can be strengthened by constraining economic and political corruption. It also describes the benefits of using interdisciplinary navigation through different levels of analysis, each of which includes a number of academic disciplines.
