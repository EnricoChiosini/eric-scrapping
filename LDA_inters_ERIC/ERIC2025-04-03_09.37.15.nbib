AB  - On January 18, 1803 President Thomas Jefferson asked Congress to fund an expedition to the source of the Missouri River. This expedition would become known as the Corps of Discovery, which would spend twenty-eight months exploring, studying, and documenting the wonders of the western frontier. Led by Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, the expedition is a landmark of American history. It exemplifies the challenges of westward expansion (which included issues in international relations, economic competition, cross-cultural communication, and physical endurance) as revealed through the journals of several members of the Corps. In January of 2003, the celebration to commemorate the bicentennial of the Corps of Discovery's expedition began at Jefferson's Monticello home in Charlottesville, Virginia. Many celebrations and commemorations of the expedition will be held over the next three years. One of them could be held at your middle school. Kristy Brugar, teaches seventh grade American Studies and is the Social Science Subject Coordinator at Cranbrook Kingswood Boys Middle School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. In this article she shares the excitement, empathy and many learning opportunities her 7th grade classes experienced as they participated in the annual "Lewis & Clark Day" celebrations.

AB  - One question of interdisciplinary education is how to encourage students to draw connections between disciplines and to engage in critical thinking. The authors developed a team-taught interdisciplinary course examining the history and literature of modern revolutions. The first time the course was given, students had difficulty making interdisciplinary connections and did not critically re-examine their assumptions. The authors restructured the course, re-thinking its emphasis, procedures, texts, and assignments, with substantial positive results. They also learned that teachers need to reassess their own ideology and teaching strategies to make interdisciplinary education effective.

AB  - The role of interdisciplinary teaming in the induction of new teachers was examined at two middle level schools through the perceptions of three participant groups: new teachers, mentors, and principals. Data collected through a mixed-method design indicated that participants perceived inter disciplinary teams as an integral part of the induction process of new teachers that supported their personal and professional needs. Teaming was most helpful in meeting new teachers' professional needs chiefly through supporting the management practices of new teachers.

AB  - As universities move towards more vocationally oriented courses, students expect pedagogic practices that make closer ties to potential workplaces. The pedagogical approach of authentic learning is well suited to this purpose as it proposes an apprenticeship-type model and a model that brings simulated work tasks into the classroom. In the social sciences, authentic learning is under-utilised and under-theorised as these subject areas do not fit easily into these models. An alternative model of authentic learning aims to offer students opportunities to "enmind" the requirements of a discipline, be critically reflective about that discipline, and to develop the skills to bring the discipline into their subjective experience. Using this model for authentic learning as a starting point, the authors have examined the applicability of authentic learning to the social sciences, derived relevant design principles and applied these to produce a learning design for a sociology subject that can be tested and critiqued. The purpose of this paper is to present this learning design as a starting point for discussion about a new form of authentic learning. (Contains 1 figure.)

An essay covering three aspects of Native American history was evaluated for content and critical thinking. Significant differences were seen between classes in describing cultural differences that lead to conflict between Native Americans and Euro American settlers. Additionally, regardless of instructor approach, many students tended to maintain common stereotypical views of Native American cultures. (Contains 2 figures and 3 tables.)

AB  - Studies of protein function increasingly use multifaceted approaches that span disciplines including recombinant DNA technology, cell biology, and analytical biochemistry. These studies rely on sophisticated equipment and methodologies including confocal fluorescence microscopy, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography that are beyond the scope of traditional laboratory courses. To equip the advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students with an enabling base of knowledge and initial experience with advanced protein research methodologies, a laboratory course entitled "Plant Cells and Proteins" was developed in a partnership between Washington University and the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis. In this one semester course, 10-12 students obtain hands-on experience with plant tissue culture, gene transformation, subcellular localization of fluorescent recombinant proteins using confocal microscopy, purification of affinity-tagged recombinant proteins, isolation of total protein extracts, enzymatic assays, one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, MALDI-TOF and ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometry, protein crystallization, and X-ray diffraction. The course is taught as a series of modules, each led by an expert researcher. Students are evaluated based on a series of graded written reports and tests of their mastery of key concepts, interpretations, and the limitations of the experimental methods.

AB  - Background: Many scholars have called for physical education to be part of interdisciplinary units at the elementary level. The study of Native American cultures is required in most North American elementary schools. Folk dance, however, has traditionally included Western European folk dances, square dance, and, more recently, line dancing. In our opinion, the omission of indigenous dance forms from the USA (Hawaiian and Native American Indian Tribal) and from other world cultures is problematic and perpetuates a curriculum that privileges White dance forms. With the call for pluralistic education and interdisciplinary units at the elementary level, it is incumbent on physical education and classroom teachers to collaborate in designing these units. Folk dance is undoubtedly a place where physical education can make a substantial contribution to the children's experience of the content. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe a research project focused on teaching a Native American folk dance unit integrated with a classroom unit called "People and the Land: Native Americans and their Environments" and to interrogate our curriculum decisions. We studied the meanings the children made in response to the subject matter we taught about Native American culture. We attempted to apply Cornelius' theoretical framework for respectfully teaching about cultures. Undergirding our instruction was our desire to honor the children's culture, Native American culture, and the children's developmental levels. Participants and setting: The unit was taught by the researchers, two White women, to a third grade class at a predominantly African American elementary school. Data collection and analysis: We followed standard qualitative research methods. We collected evidence from multiple sources, induced coding categories, and identified themes and critical incidents. Finally, we reflected on the themes and interrogated our teaching in relationship to the theoretical framework. Findings and interpretation: We describe the unit and provide evidence that the children learned the skills and information we taught. As we reflected on the unit, we came to recognize the ways in which our own cultural and subject matter ignorance limited the effectiveness of our teaching and even our ability to reflect on the quality of our unit. We discuss the roles our ignorance and our choices played in designing and teaching the unit.

AB  - Sense of place is lauded as critical to developing an environmentally conscious and responsive citizenry. Calls for place-based education have often arisen from an emotional plea to reconnect to the land, become rooted, and conserve natural places. However, in reality, sense of place encompasses a multidimensional array that is not only biophysical, but also psychological, sociocultural, political, and economic. This paper reviews the sense-of-place literature and argues for an integrated, holistic view of place, particularly as it applies to environmental education. Recognizing these interconnected dimensions encourages environmental education that more effectively, practically, and honestly integrates sense of place with real-world issues of environmental learning, involvement, action, and community-based conservation.

AB  - This paper distinguishes among "contextualizing", "conceptualizing", and "problem-centring" as three basic approaches to interdisciplinary curriculum. This typology is based on the type of inquiry that takes place in the classroom. For example, if the guiding epistemology in the interdisciplinary work is that of the humanities, the mode of connecting disciplinary material is likely to be "contextualizing", or embedding the facts and ideas in the cultural, historical, or ideological fabric. If the scientific method guides and sets the standard for integration, "conceptualizing" work typically takes place. Finally, if the spirit and mode of inquiry is that of the applied sciences or creative product-development, the integrative process will take the form of "problem-based" investigation of urgent or tangible issues. Using empirical data from exemplary university, pre-university, and professional programmes in the US, I describe three integrative strategies and comment on their strengths. This basic typology provides alternative approaches to interdisciplinary material based on the purpose of the class inquiry. In the hands of a good instructor, several interdisciplinary strategies could be used together for mutual benefit. (Contains 4 notes.)

AB  - Theories and treatments of mental illness reflect the social, philosophical, and historical context in which they developed. This article describes ways to invite students to grapple with complex questions about "madness" from an interdisciplinary perspective. Looking at the construct of madness through multiple lenses (e.g., literature, anthropology, medicine) brings depth and breadth to the study of abnormal psychology. I discuss resources relevant to 6 themes: (a) the construct of mental illness; (b) diagnosis as a form of social control; (c) the role of the psychiatric patient; (d) the search for solutions; (e) madness and popular culture; and (f) contemporary issues in mental health. I also describe pedagogical strategies to encourage reflective thinking and critical inquiry.

AB  - Given the widespread use and success of cross-functional teams in industry and the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business's focus on the importance of interdisciplinary education, many business schools have incorporated interdisciplinary elements into their curricula. This study examined current student and alumni perceptions of the value of interdisciplinary, team-taught, undergraduate business courses. Of specific concern was the impact of perceived integration. Overall, the courses were perceived to have value. In addition, the more integrated the course, the more positively it was evaluated on every dimension. Practical and research implications are discussed. (Contains 6 tables and 3 notes.)

The program utilizes multiple levels of care (inpatient, partial day hospital, intensive outpatient, and traditional out patient) to provide continuity of care during the recovery process, which often spans 2 to 3 months of intensive treatment. Details about the expectations of staff, patients, and family members are provided. Also, special protocols for refeeding, weight gain, and motivation for eating are described. The costs of treatment can be managed by greater utilization of the partial day hospital level of care, as opposed to lengthy inpatient hospitalization.

AB  - One of the traditional problems in courseware development that is recognized as hard to solve, is the communication and co-operation between various disciplines in project teams that are working on a courseware product [Alber (1996) "Multimedia: a management perspective." California: Wadsworth; Boyle (1997) "Design for multimedia learning." UK: Prentice-Hall; Chambers & Whiting (1990) "Communications of the ACM," 23(6), 332]. It is only recently that research about using computers in education also focuses on the project team operational processes [van Aalst & van der Mast (1998) In A. Sutcliffe, J. Ziegler, & P. Johnson (Eds.), "Designing effective and usable multimedia systems." Proceedings of the IFIP Working Group 13.2 Conference. Stuttgart: Kluwer]. Most existing research addresses the added value of the product for the end-user (the learner), or development methods for courseware products. However, in our view both of these (important) aspects partly rely on the way in which the various courseware development disciplines can communicate and co-operate. In other words, facilitating and improving these processes is likely to result in higher quality courseware that is more satisfactory to learners. We present an instrument that facilitates courseware development teams in sharing each other's knowledge and experiences. Statistical measurements have shown significantly more positive experiences within the development teams, on a number of multidisciplinary themes.

AB  - SOPHE leaders continue to challenge us to be true to the call for an "open society." SOPHE has supported the Healthy People 2010 goal of eliminating health disparities through its Strategic Plan. SOPHE held an Inaugural Health Education Research Disparities Summit, Health Disparities and Social Inequities: Framing a Transdisciplinary Research Agenda in Health Education, August 8 and 9, 2005. This article explains the process used at the Summit where more than 80 researchers, academicians, practitioners, and students from across the country convened to ask fundamental questions about health disparity associated with race and ethnicity and how a health education research agenda could help in eliminating these disparities. From this Summit, about a dozen questions and/or recommendations have been developed to frame our future discussions about health disparities. Through its Research Agenda Committee, SOPHE has developed a process of translation and dissemination, including community participation, review, dialogue, and action.

AB  - This paper assembles innovative ideas from several disciplines and offers an integrated discussion for improving TESL/TEFL curriculum design, specifically for individuals from peripheral social contexts and to address the global demand for ESL/EFL teachers. Overall, the suggested innovations serve to: 1) increase program accessibility to individuals who might not otherwise pursue professional development and/or continuing education, and 2) enhance instructional effectiveness by including instructional topics and techniques which support novice and nonnative English teachers. Adjustments to admission practices, instruction practices, and long-term professional support allow the program to reach a greater population of teachers to serve the ever-increasing worldwide demand for English teachers. A website available prior to, during, and after instruction allows participants to continue research projects, learn about professional development opportunities, and participate in a virtual community of TESL/TEFL professionals, regardless of their current teaching placement environment. More practically-focused instruction which is delivered via both on-site instruction and DL (distance learning) technology results in more competent teachers completing TESL/TEFL programs. The more practically-focused instruction incorporates recent language research and language teaching innovations from applied linguistics, multicultural literature, conflict communication strategies, and educational leadership. The language research innovations include descriptive grammar, pragmatics, and discourse analysis. These give teachers a substantially more accurate understanding of English language structures and functions at clause, sentence, and discourse levels. They provide essential tools to more accurately analyze and thus more effectively teach English in a variety of educational contexts. The language teaching innovations include participatory language teaching, sheltered language instruction, and authentic assessments) which extend the learning benefits of communicative language teaching (CLT) methods. These TESL/TEFL methods are incorporated with multicultural literature, conflict communication strategies, and educational leadership to form an interdisciplinary program which provides scaffolded instructional content and techniques which may better serve the needs of TESL/TEFL teacher training program stakeholders.

AB  - Canadian universities are struggling to address seemingly contradictory challenges pertaining to undergraduate education: high demand and underfunding. A number of instruments, including the National Survey of Student Engagement (National Survey of Student Engagement, n.d.), have led to greater priority being placed on the undergraduate experience. Yet, strategies to ensure student satisfaction with their education, through initiatives such as small classes and personal contact with faculty, seem at odds with the large classes necessitated by fiscal imperatives. We carried out a systematic investigation of the impact of one problem-based learning course on first year students' experiences. We also investigated the persistence of skills and attitudes learned in this single exposure to problem-based learning. The results of our investigation show that this course had very positive effects on the immediate and persistent behaviours of students. Our research provides empirical evidence of the effectiveness of problem-based learning and leads us to suggest how a problem-based approach might help universities enhance the quality of education and the undergraduate experience.

AB  - This study examines 11 interdisciplinary teams involving 30 teachers and 542 students in New York and California. The teams represented an array of approaches to interdisciplinary curricula, ranging from simple correlation to major reconstrual of the contributing disciplines. Teams that engaged in the most reconstrual of traditional content also tended to use instructional approaches that emphasized cognitively engaging instruction, including an emphasis on envisionment-building activities and extended discussion of significant ideas, but individual members of teaching teams still varied considerably in teaching style. The study concludes that interdisciplinary coursework is neither a problem nor a solution in efforts to increase student achievement; rather, it involves a number of tradeoffs that need to be considered at the school site.

AB  - If instruction's primary goal is helping students understand present experience, the traditional, highly fragmented secondary curriculum is inadequate. The disciplines might help segment reality for specialized study, but are inappropriate organizers for general education curricula and teacher education. Disciplines should remain healthy, but students need opportunities for grasping the totality of experience. (MLH)

AB  - This paper discusses the implementation of an intergenerational service-learning (IS-L) project with a mentorship component for graduate students at Western Michigan University's Gerontology Program. Two classes of students, one graduate and one undergraduate, taking introductory gerontology courses were brought together to complete IS-L projects of their own designs. Graduate students were asked to act as mentors to undergradute team members. To guide development of mentorship skills, eight Seifter and Economy (2001) teachable principles of good team management were used: (1) put power in the hands of the people doing the work; (2) encourage individual responsibility; (3) create clarity of roles; (4) share and rotate leadership; (5) foster horizontal teamwork; (6) learn to listen, learn to talk; (7) seek consensus; and, (8) dedicate passionately to your mission. While challenging, most of the graduate students found the process of developing mentorship skills personally insightful and valuable.

AB  - Training for interprofessional collaboration is important because professionals are increasingly required to work together in a coordinated and collaborative manner to meet the complex needs of clients. However, few published reports exist on interprofessional training for community counselors and marriage and family therapists. The authors discuss the use of a mock interdisciplinary staffing with students who are training to be counselors and marriage and family therapists. This method of instruction holds promise as an effective means of introducing students to a range of issues, including the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed for interprofessional practice.

AB  - One of the most important functions of a teacher is to help students make important connections between the subject matters they study. Too often, the different curricular subjects, such as social studies, language arts, math, and science, are presented to students in a vacuum. Accordingly, many students leave school without ever noticing the vital relationships among all areas of knowledge. Interdisciplinary planning is a great tool for confronting this challenge. There are well-known drawbacks to such planning, of course. These include the time it takes to plan across the curriculum, the need for faculty colleagues who are willing to cooperate, and the constant schedule interruptions for nonacademic activities such as pep rallies or assemblies. This article presents a lesson contributed by James A. Bryant, Jr., Assistant Professor at the University of New Orleans, which he did while team teaching 6th-grade social studies in North Carolina. With this lesson he had shown to his class how each subject was connected to the others.

AB  - "We are on the eve of total contamination," said an eighth grade "toxicologist" at a mock town meeting at Mount Baker Middle School in Mount Vernon, Washington. The meeting was the culmination of a month-long investigation by students to determine why some of the townspeople were getting sick. During the unit, students used skills from several disciplines to pinpoint, assess, and address the environmental damage and health threat posed by a fictitious pesticide spill they uncovered. Students also gained insight into what it takes to respond to a community crisis and worked together to solve it. This article describes the details of the unit such as: the set up; researching the cause; water data; preparing to present; the town meeting; and assessment and conclusions. A brief list of resources is also included.
