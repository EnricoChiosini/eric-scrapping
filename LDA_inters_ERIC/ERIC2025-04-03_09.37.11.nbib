AB  - Work in the new area of Mind, Brain, and Education (MBE) raises epistemological and ethical issues. With respect to epistemology, the norms of the component disciplines must be honored and the resulting amalgam must be more than a mere sum of the parts. With respect to ethics, the roles of scientist, educator, and practitioner each raise ethical dilemmas and the MBE worker must be cognizant of each set of dilemmas and the possible strains among them. Only if both of these spheres are confronted can good work be achieved in MBE.

AB  - Questions regarding the proper role of the arts in education have occupied many thinkers throughout the ages, no less than the likes of Plato and Rousseau. Like them, several have argued that paintings, for example, are mere re-presentations of and certainly not, to borrow a term from Kant, the "thing-in-itself." From a Platonic and Rousseauian perspective, those who behold images and conclude that the "thing-in-itself" (on all occasions) and its rendition on canvas in sundry lines and colors are indistinguishable would be led astray from the truth in pursuit of shadows, or would contribute to the moral collapse of the polis. In this article, the author proposes to employ film to release the imaginations of preservice teachers. More precisely, the author rejects Plato's claim that art is imitation of what "is." The author explains why professors of education should help preservice teachers to develop their skills and capacities to support the rational analysis regarding the "reminiscences of the suffering and . . . complaints" of the downtrodden, lest the latter's future students assimilate images uncritically at their peril.

AB  - In order to write successfully, students need to understand what it is they are expected to write, why it is written in a particular way and the form that the final text should take. Linguistics research indicates that the ubiquitous essay and report conceal significant disciplinary variation. Educational research reveals variation with regard to assessment and marking of written work within disciplines, between lecturers, across departments, nationally and internationally. We present an interdisciplinary, genre-based model that we have piloted and tested in History at the University of Portsmouth. Our aim is to bring disciplinary, applied linguistic and academic skills expertise to the point where students are taught to write particular assignments. We offer the model for testing in other genres, disciplines and institutions. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Indigenous academic researchers are involved in Indigenist, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research, all of which present problems and opportunities for Indigenous knowledge traditions. "Transdisciplinary" research is different from "interdisciplinary" research because it moves beyond the disciplinarity of the university and takes into account knowledge practices which the university will never fully understand. Indigenous knowledge traditions resist definition from a Western academic perspective--there are Indigenous knowledge practices which will never engage with the academy, just as there are some branches of the academy which will never acknowledge Indigenous knowledge practices. In this paper I present the story of my own non-Indigenous perspective on Indigenous research and what happens to it in a university. I am not concerned here with the knowledge production work Aboriginal people do in their own ways and contexts for their own purposes, but rather turn my attention to some of the issues which emerge when transdisciplinary research practice involves Australian Indigenous communities.

AB  - This article presents a snapshot of the authors' first restoration project with young children which grew out of a fourth- and fifth-grade forestry curriculum. The restoration project was part of a long-term plan for enhancing the wild areas of the campus for wildlife habitat and for educational use. It is a native oak woodland and riparian habitat, but with substantial areas of invasive, non-native plants. Plans included the expansion of the current restoration area, upgrade of the old nature trail, restoration of riparian habitat along the creek, and creation of a butterfly garden outside of the Environmental Center. All of these projects require the ability to accurately map the campus and then to input the data. This is also key to documenting the habitat's changes over time--both natural changes and those caused by the activities. In this article, the authors describe the students' process of restoring the habitat and what the students learned from it.

AB  - In this study, engineers and educators worked together to adapt and apply the ecological footprint (EF) methodology to an early learning centre in Brisbane, Australia. Results were analysed to determine how environmental impact can be reduced at the study site and more generally across early childhood settings. It was found that food, transport and energy consumption had the largest impact on the centre's overall footprint. In transport and energy, early childhood centres can reduce their impact through infrastructure and cultural change, in association with changed curriculum strategies. Building design, the type of energy purchased and appliance usage can all be modified to reduce the energy footprint. The transport footprint can be reduced through more families using active and public transport, which can be encouraged by providing information, support and facilities and appropriate siting of new centres. Introducing the concept of ecological footprint in early childhood education may be an effective way to educate children, staff and parents on the links between the food they eat, land usage and environmental impact. This study responds directly to the call in this journal for research focused on early childhood education and for more to be made of interdisciplinary research opportunities.

AB  - Purpose--Training multimedia projects often face identical knowledge-transfer obstacles that partly originate in the multidisciplinarity of the project team. The purpose of this paper is to describe these difficulties and the tools used to overcome them. In particular, the aim is to show how elements of cognitive psychology theory (concept maps, semantic networks) and instructional theory (the Gagne taxonomy) combined with mainstream epistemological research help formalise and transmit industrial knowledge through the design of training multimedia. Design/methodology/approach--The paper reports on action research spanning over ten years, taking stock of the experience gathered through 15 training multimedia projects in three large European organisations and their subsidiaries. Knowledge formalisation and transfer methods are illustrated with various examples and industrial applications. Findings--Provided certain conditions and criteria are respected, these tools help unlock various knowledge transfer barriers specific to multidisciplinary training multimedia projects, not only by contributing to tacit knowledge elicitation and codification into the training multimedia resource, but also by providing an interdisciplinary communication vector. Research limitations/implications--The paper is not concerned with issues such as collaborative use or multidisciplinary support for remote learning platforms, which offer a possible way to extend the analysis. Practical implications--The knowledge formalisation methods presented in this paper can be applied to any form of project aimed at   transferring intra-disciplinary industrial knowledge within an organisation. In addition, education and training professionals (ETPs) constitute the pivotal element in this process and as such are indispensable to the successful implementation of training multimedia projects. Originality/value--There is little existing research on knowledge transfer problems intrinsic to multidisciplinary team working in training multimedia projects. The article sheds light on these issues by putting together hitherto unconnected elements of conceptual analysis, which arose from fieldwork. (Contains 4 figures, 2 tables, and 12 notes.)

AB  - Documenting treatment integrity is an important issue in research and practice in any discipline concerned with prevention and intervention. However, consensus concerning the dimensions of treatment integrity and how they should be measured has yet to emerge. Advances from three areas in which significant treatment integrity work has taken place--psychotherapy, substance abuse treatment, and prevention science--are summarized and integrated with recent advances in treatment integrity in school psychology. Innovations discussed include broadened models of treatment integrity, generic treatment integrity measures that assess common and unique elements of multiple interventions, and experimentally validated strategies for enhancing treatment integrity. Building on innovations across disciplines is one means for advancing treatment integrity technology in educational settings. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Introduction: We describe an example of simulation-based interprofessional continuing education, the multidisciplinary obstetric simulated emergency scenarios (MOSES) course, which was designed to enhance nontechnical skills among obstetric teams and, hence, improve patient safety. Participants' perceptions of MOSES courses, their learning, and the transfer of learning to clinical practice were examined. Methods: Participants included senior midwives, obstetricians, and obstetric anesthetists, including course faculty from 4 purposively selected delivery suites in England. Telephone or e-mail interviews with MOSES course participants and facilitators were conducted, and video-recorded debriefings that formed integral parts of this 1-day course were analyzed. Results: The team training was well received. Participants were able to check out assumptions and expectations of others and develop respect for different roles within the delivery suite (DS) team. Skillful facilitation of debriefing after each scenario was central to learning. Participants reported acquiring new knowledge or insights, particularly concerning the role of communication and leadership in crisis situations, and they rehearsed unfamiliar skills. Observing peers working in the simulations increased participants' learning by highlighting alternative strategies. The learning achieved by individuals and groups was noticeably dependent on their starting points. Some participants identified limited changes in their behavior in the workplace following the MOSES course. Mechanisms to manage the transfer of learning to the wider team were weakly developed, although 2 DS teams made changes to their regular update training. Discussion: Interprofessional, team-based simulations promote new learning. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - An essential difficulty in solving practical problems that are not like the ones a student has solved before is discerning the core of the problem. It is claimed that discernment has to be trained by variation--by varying the context of the assignments in which students have to identify and grasp their "underlying form". A decisive challenge in engineering education--and also medicine, veterinary and pharmacy--is that there are many and very different kinds of subjects students study, some with thoroughly scientific content, others centred on more practical knowledge. How to provide a coherent program keyed on discernment? Another challenge is what's required to apply theory to practice; i.e. theory needs to be restructured and often integrated with parts of other theories and with more practical knowledge before it can be applied in real-life problem solving. What we propose is to let the variation of assignments transcend subject borders. Give assignments in the same subject that vary in context, e.g. from theoretical and "closed" to practical and "open". And give assignments in different subjects embodying the same concept, principle or method, thus training discernment and at the same time demonstrating relations between theoretical and more practical subjects.

AB  - The present article describes some activities performed with high-school students in the "Solar Physics" course developed in a Brazilian science centre. The topics of chemical composition, temperature and stellar evolution were taught in a room totally dedicated to study of the Sun, a solar room, designed with simple and inexpensive equipment. The course strongly emphasized practical, observational and enquiry-based activities, such as estimating the solar surface temperature, observation of the visible solar spectrum, identification of solar absorption lines, and understanding how they are produced and what kind of information can be extracted from the observed spectral lines. Some of the course goals were to foster the comprehension of the key role played by spectroscopy in astrophysics, to contextualize contents with practical activities, and to allow interdisciplinary approaches including modern physics and chemistry in physics teaching.

AB  - Virtual environments can resolve many practical and pedagogical challenges within higher education. Economic considerations, accessibility issues, and safety concerns can all be somewhat alleviated by creating learning activities in a virtual space. Because of the removal of real-world physical limitations like gravity, durability and scope, virtual space allows for an expansion of possibilities and approaches to knowledge transfer and discovery learning and becomes an "environment for information" rich with collaborative possibilities. Experimentation and participation in conceptual as well as applied projects is encouraged for both students and instructors. One of these virtual environments, Second Life, was used in a cross-disciplinary project for the creation of a Marine Science virtual class environment as an assignment for design students at a major southwestern research university in the United States. This paper reports on the findings from a project that utilized Second Life as a medium for enhancing and extending design education using a process of interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - The study examined 2500 business degree students from 21 countries, enrolled at an Australian university, using a survey to assess learning style, which was integrated into a global culture taxonomy. The research hypothesis was that academic outcome could be explained through an interdisciplinary model, by integrating proven theories from educational psychology (learning style) and anthropology (culture). The literature review included interdisciplinary and rival theories to make the research useful for global practitioners. Technical discussion was minimized, focusing on the pedagogical implications of a generalized least squares regression model, which was statistically significant (r[squared] = 0.87; chi[superscript 2] = 0, df = 0, p less than 0.0001; n = 715). Four factors dominated the model in predicting higher multicultural student academic outcome: collectivist and risk-taking cultures, along with visual-input and active-processing learning styles.

AB  - A university-community collaborative initiative to provide an interdisciplinary approach to personnel preparation is described. Twelve students (i.e., undergraduate, graduate) from various academic disciplines participated in early intervention coursework and practical experiences. Specifically, students were prepared to provide early intervention to infants/toddlers who were premature/medically fragile and their families. Courses were developed and co-taught by parents, early intervention providers, and medical professionals recruited from the community. The interdisciplinary steering committee developed intensive practical experiences to facilitate the translation of knowledge into sustained daily practice. Outcome measures indicated increased knowledge and acquisition of skills related to early intervention, and intervention specific to the high-risk population. Employment outcomes and increased opportunities for professional collaboration are also described. Implications are discussed. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - "BIO2010" put forth the goal of improving the mathematical educational background of biology students. The analysis and interpretation of microarray high-dimensional data can be very challenging and is best done by a statistician and a biologist working and teaching in a collaborative manner. We set up such a collaboration and designed a course on microarray data analysis. We started using Genome Consortium for Active Teaching (GCAT) materials and Microarray Genome and Clustering Tool software and added R statistical software along with Bioconductor packages. In response to student feedback, one microarray data set was fully analyzed in class, starting from preprocessing to gene discovery to pathway analysis using the latter software. A class project was to conduct a similar analysis where students analyzed their own data or data from a published journal paper. This exercise showed the impact that filtering, preprocessing, and different normalization methods had on gene inclusion in the final data set. We conclude that this course achieved its goals to equip students with skills to analyze data from a microarray experiment. We offer our insight about collaborative teaching as well as how other faculty might design and implement a similar interdisciplinary course. (Contains 5 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - Creativity often has been associated with the arts, although creativity also is essential for innovative discoveries and applications in science and engineering. In this article, a pilot study is presented about an investigation concerning how creativity is fostered in an art education course in conjunction with an undergraduate engineering course, through visual arts experiences and instruction using creative problem solving strategies. Through emphasizing creative strategies and ways of thinking developed through art, such as resistance to closure, tolerance of ambiguity, visualization, and use of metaphor, interdisciplinary collaborations of art with other disciplines, such as engineering, can become very successful. In addition, this project is relevant for art teacher preparation as well as K-12 art education with its focus on creative problem solving, considered an important 21st-century skill, and in regard to increased interest in making engineering a part of high school curricula.

AB  - The authors draw on two families of theories--developmental networks and sociocultural perspectives on learning--to develop an interdisciplinary approach to the study of doctoral education as a path to the professoriate. This approach seeks to elucidate the connection between doctoral students' developmental networks, what they learn during their graduate experience (including their learning about the faculty role) and how they develop a professional identity. The authors first discuss the key tenets of the developmental networks and sociocultural perspectives, before exploring their alignments and explaining how the combination might remedy the limitations inherent in each approach. Finally, they offer some research propositions and directions for further study of the preparation of doctoral students for academic careers. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - The author examines the role of culture in education in historical perspective to suggest the conditions required to promote generalized educational reform. Although deliberate instruction appears to be a ubiquitous characteristic of human beings, schools arise only when large numbers of people begin to live in close proximity, using technologies that create economic surpluses. Schooling is associated with the development of institutionalized hierarchies, modes of cultural transmission associated with writing and record keeping, and increased political-economic disparities within societies. The author examines several strategies for seeking change in the cultural foundations of schooling. He offers suggestions for why such strategies appear to have limited impact, and he discusses changes in global conditions that might lead to generalized educational reform. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Current theoretical models support the existence of interactions between the individual and socio-environmental forces when it comes to the formation and enactment of life plans (Friedman & Scholnick, 1997; Shanahan & Elder, 2002). In this investigation, we examine the social, economic, and psychological forces that impact financial planning for retirement. The collective force of these three broad sets of influences was examined from developmental and cross-cultural perspectives, among respondents from two countries with very different retirement financing systems. Participants were 419 American and 556 Dutch working adults, 25-64 years of age. Path analysis models were created to examine differences in planning associated with age and national origin. Compared to younger individuals, older respondents in both countries were more involved in nearly all aspects of the financial planning process. Differences across cultures were also observed in the social support mechanisms that underlie planning and the impact economic forces have on perceptions of saving adequacy. The discussion focuses on the value of developing interdisciplinary theoretical models of planning, and how such models can inform the development of savings-oriented intervention and public policy initiatives.

AB  - Interdisciplinary higher education aims to develop boundary-crossing skills, such as interdisciplinary thinking. In the present review study, interdisciplinary thinking was defined as the capacity to integrate knowledge of two or more disciplines to produce a cognitive advancement in ways that would have been impossible or unlikely through single disciplinary means. It was considered as a complex cognitive skill that constituted of a number of subskills. The review was accomplished by means of a systematic search within four scientific literature databases followed by a critical analysis. The review showed that, to date, scientific research into teaching and learning in interdisciplinary higher education has remained limited and explorative. The research advanced the understanding of the necessary subskills of interdisciplinary thinking and typical conditions for enabling the development of interdisciplinary thinking. This understanding provides a platform from which the theory and practice of interdisciplinary higher education can move forward.

AB  - In this chapter, the author offers a historical overview of constructions of risk in the context of schooling for nondominant groups and how communities have organized schooling in ways that support resiliency in the face of these risks. She discusses an expansive orientation to understanding how people learn to respond to risks that is rooted in a cultural and ecological perspective, with examples of programs of research in and about schools that address the inequities in educational outcomes and opportunities. She concludes the chapter with a discussion of the implications of such an expanded framework for research on educational risks and schooling as well as educational policy.

AB  - The integration of ideas, methods, and data from diverse disciplines has been a transformative force in science and higher education, attracting policy interventions, program innovations, financial resources, and talented people. Much energy has been invested in producing a new generation of scientists trained to work fluidly across disciplines, sectors, and research problems, yet the success of such investments has been difficult to measure. Using the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) program of the U.S. National Science Foundation as a strategic research site, we conducted an experiment to determine whether and how the process and products of research of IGERT-trained scientists differ from those of scientists trained in disciplinary graduate programs. Among scientists in the early years of graduate study we found substantial and consistent differences suggesting that interdisciplinary training improved the quality and process of research, but this pattern was equally strongly reversed among students in the latter years of graduate study. Using systematic observation and other data we suggest why this might be so, then discuss the implications of these results for the design and conduct of graduate education and research.

AB  - This paper examines how separate behavioral science disciplines can be brought together to more fully understand the dynamics of contemporary careers. We adopt one interdisciplinary framework--that of the "intelligent career"--and use it to examine how separate disciplinary approaches relate to one another. The intelligent career framework suggests careers unfold through three interdependent "ways of knowing" reflecting why, how and with whom people work. Breaking this framework down into six unidirectional links, we examine the contributions made by a variety of behavioral science approaches. Our review suggests that separate bodies of career-relevant theory reflect separate links from one way of knowing to another. We offer several lessons concerned with (a) the intelligent career framework; (b) evidence underlying separate theories; (c) differing definitions of career; (d) research methodologies; (e) time; and (f) interdependence among variables. We conclude with some ideas on how to better promote future interdisciplinary careers research. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - In this paper, the authors introduce the "Targeted Assessment Rubric for Interdisciplinary  Writing," an empirically-tested instrument designed to assess interdisciplinary writing at the collegiate level. Interdisciplinary writing presents unique challenges to students, calling upon them to mediate the rhetorical, theoretical, and methodological differences inherent in multiple disciplinary discourses. The rubric proposes four distinct dimensions to be examined: a paper's "purposefulness," "disciplinary grounding," "integration," and "critical awareness." For each criterion, four qualitatively distinct levels of student achievement are described: "naive," "novice," "apprentice," and "master." The rubric builds on a clear definition of interdisciplinary work, a related assessment framework, and recent scholarship on interdisciplinary writing. Here, the authors review the assessment literature and the rubric's conceptual foundations. They introduce the rubric through an example of student work and describe the methods by which they developed and tested it. They conclude with concrete recommendations for practice.

AB  - Today's growing business competition demands that design and technology must be seamlessly integrated. Designers should be employed increasingly as in-house in the industry, in addition to entrepreneurship and consultancy employment. How to realise this aim? Industry training is a tradition in engineering studies, but that is rarely the case in the field of design [Vanhamaa, M. 2006. "Harjoittelu osana teollisen muotoilun yliopisto-opetusta Suomessa". Thesis (MA) TAIK]. This causes severe challenges for both industries and the designers themselves; employing industrial designers is perceived as difficult, as is applying for industry positions. The Murjottelu training campaign was launched by Helsinki University of Technology. The original idea behind Murjottelu was to form pairs, consisting of one industrial design student and one engineering student and offer the pair to industrial companies. In other words, to 'smuggle' the design student into the organisation. Training pairs typically work within manufacturing and product-development tasks, similar to traditional engineering trainees. As the campaign has expanded, interdisciplinarity in general has grown to a more important role. Including this year, altogether 91 companies with 188 trainees have joined the programme. Employing the first in-house designer has proved to be easier when arriving with an engineer. Another key conclusion is that both the practical deliverables and learning outcomes are of increased value. The student pair is more creative, effective and autonomous than singular trainees in the traditional training format. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - The goal of this volume is to provide an overview of interdisciplinarity and American higher education. It focuses on the impact of interdisciplinary work related to the functions of teaching, learning, and research. The landscape of higher education contains multiple areas where such a process might run afoul. For example, how does interdisciplinary research affect standards of faculty tenure and promotion? How do colleges and universities encourage integration among students and faculty located in separate, often isolated departments? How do institutions construct an interdisciplinary course of study that requires students to interact with faculty and areas of knowledge from multiple disciplines? What cognitive, cultural, and social challenges exist as scholars seek to achieve an integrative synthesis? To consider these questions, this special issue discusses interdisciplinary education, research, and practice. This special issue includes the following chapters: (1) Defining Interdisciplinarity; (2) The Disciplines, Interdisciplinarity, and the University; (3) Interdisciplinarity, Learning, and Cognition; (4) Interdisciplinarity and the Practice of Research; (5) Faculty and Institutional Structure: The Conflict of Interdisciplinarity; (6) Best Practices Related to Interdisciplinary Education; and (7) Implications for Practice and the Future of Interdisciplinarity.

AB  - Newcomers often underestimate the challenges of interdisciplinary work and, as a rule, do not spend sufficient time to allow them to overcome differences and create common ground, which in turn leads to frustration, unresolved conflicts, and, in the worst case scenario, discontinued work. The key to successful collaboration is to facilitate the creation of a climate that will stimulate awareness of such challenges. Differing perceptions of quality and credibility among disciplines are major obstacles to successful collaboration. Some of these differences are incommensurably rooted in different epistemologies while other differences are more a question of culture. In the present paper, a framework is proposed which is designed to initiate a process necessary for success. First, the framework is designed to stimulate discussions about quality and credibility, and second it is designed to help separate epistemological differences from differences in culture. The framework takes its point of departure in five questions that deliberately include terms, such as "sufficiently", "coherently", and "reliable", which are unproblematic in a group with shared norms but become increasingly ambiguous as diversity increases. Experience suggest that pondering these questions, alone or in a group, stimulates reflection, leads to increased awareness of one's own perspective, and facilitates dialogue, collaboration, and creation of common ground.

AB  - Establishing interdisciplinary academic departments has been a common response to the challenge of addressing complex problems. However, the assumptions that guide the formation of such departments are rarely questioned. Additionally, the designers and managers of interdisciplinary academic departments in any field of endeavour struggle to set an organisational climate appropriate to the diversity of their members. This article presents a preliminary analysis of collaborative dynamics within two interdisciplinary university departments in Australia focused on sustainability. Social network diagrams and metrics of coauthorship and cosupervision are analysed qualitatively. A "vicarious interdisciplinarity" was identified among key academics working narrowly in order to earn the resources that allow them to support others working interdisciplinarily. Those supported in this way appear to benefit from the esteem and nonredundant collaborative connections their mentors provide via this strategy, but they experience uncertainty about their own career opportunities in similar settings. This article thus unearths a conundrum of succession for interdisciplinary academic environments, and suggests that simple colocation of diverse academic stars is an inadequate strategy to achieve effective intradepartmental collaboration.

AB  - Industrial ecology education is being developed and delivered predominantly within the domains of engineering and management. Such an approach could prove somewhat limiting to the broader goal of developing industrial ecology as an integrated knowledge base inclusive of diverse disciplines, contributing to sustainable development. This paper hypothesizes that industrial ecology could be optimally delivered across broader disciplines if it were to be delivered as a supplemental knowledge among disciplines that engage with sustainable development education. Based on this hypothesis, a pedagogical experiment was devised and is presented here. This paper is descriptive, reflective and exploratory in approach, highlighting the challenges embedded in an interdisciplinary industrial ecology education, and recommending an inclusive pedagogical model to address the challenges. The intention is binary, to contribute towards the advancement of industrial ecology as an integrated knowledge base, and to introduce the concept of industrial ecology to the discipline of landscape architecture.

AB  - Within academe, there is much interest in the workings of the academic marketplace. Efforts to understand how the process unfolds occupy both researchers and participants. Clearly, the search process is complex. This article contributes to one's understanding by systematically examining how teaching is valued and assessed by search committees. As part of this examination, the authors pay particular attention to the use and evaluation of statements of teaching philosophy. Use of such statements is common, but little is known about how they are viewed and evaluated by search committees. The authors' involvement in the Preparing Future Faculty movement led them to create programs to help advanced doctoral students consider their place in the academy. Of particular importance to this effort was helping doctoral candidates consider the range of institutions that exist in higher education and exposing them to information and pedagogies that would enable them to be successful teachers in these varied environments.

AB  - I explore in this essay an ethically grounded method for structuring a program of study. Rather than attempt to delimit a discipline or to reinforce disciplinarity, I suggest a means of creatively narrowing the scope of research, namely by focusing on inner necessity and conscience. The art of rhetoric as self-discipline is an extension of inner necessity and a framework in which scholars may come to integrate the more rational and more artistic,  more public and more private elements of their personalities by exploring the influence of symbols on their lives. By conceptualizing the art of rhetoric as a "self-discipline," I affirm the significance of all these elements and suggest that their harmonious blending will enhance the pleasures and utilities of discourse.

AB  - Although interdisciplinary efforts in teaching and research are promoted as a possible antidote to increasing disciplinary separatism in colleges and universities, evaluations of interdisciplinary efforts in the classroom, particularly those spanning the traditional science-humanities divide, are not frequently documented. This article describes the development, execution, and assessment of a unique effort in interdisciplinary teaching in which four doctoral candidates from widely varying home disciplines collaborated to create and teach a "truly interdisciplinary" course for first-year students centered on the pervasiveness of humankind's quest for immortality. Assessment of the course indicates several desirable student outcomes, including the development of a more mature world view and appreciation for different epistemologies, which recommend the continuation of this and similar interdisciplinary efforts. While students at times found the enormous number of disciplines potentially related to the central topic overwhelming, at the conclusion of the course, they largely identified the exposure to new perspectives as an exciting and worthwhile academic experience. Similar interdisciplinary efforts in the classroom are encouraged, though ample course development time is recommended to maximize success. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - Human geography students face changing qualification requirements due to a shift towards new topics, educational tasks and professional options regarding issues of spatial development. This "practical turn" raises the importance of inter- and transdisciplinary work, management and capability building skills, with case study projects and student-centred learning providing suitable approaches. This paper introduces the example of the teaching and research project "Leben 2014": Students, faculty and local actors have collectively worked out future development scenarios for a rural region in Austria, actually creating impact. The project may thus serve as a model that inspires similar schemes in other countries. (Contains 4 tables, 1 figure and 2 notes.)

AB  - Since 2001, the International Institute of Women in Engineering (IIWE) at EPF, Ecole d'ingenieurs generaliste, Sceaux, France, has conducted a 3 week short course for culturally and discipline diverse, recently graduated and final year engineering students. The aim of this course is to introduce young engineers to broad global concepts and issues relating to their future professional practice, through intercultural learning. The initial course programme provided examples of engineering practices in various countries throughout the world. However, to achieve an intercultural, multidisciplinary learning outcome, a specific course theme and a project focussing on sustainable engineering and the inclusion of a variety of industrial visits were introduced in 2006. This paper will discuss the success of the strategies used to engage international students in the IIWE course activities, and after consideration of the results of participant surveys, the curriculum initiatives that followed.

AB  - In a 1991 report, the Indian Nations at Risk Task Force documented a lack of Native educators as role models for Native American students and set a goal of doubling their number by the year 2000. Under-representation of Native American educators remains an issue today particularly with regard to school leaders (Planty et al. 2009; Snyder and Dillow 2010). In order to increase the number of Native American educational leaders serving Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) schools, and other schools with high concentrations of Native American students, the Educational Leadership and Policy Studies program and School of Special Education at the University of Northern Colorado developed a two-year online multidisciplinary Master's of Arts degree program for Native American teachers to obtain both principal and special education administrative licenses. This article describes the context, design, and evaluation of this new degree program. In addition, drawing upon the experiences of program staff, faculty members, and participants (students), it presents the challenges and lessons learned in the areas of recruitment and retention; program structure and online delivery; and cultural accommodation and enhancement.

AB  - Service provision for adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is lacking, particularly post high school. We report on a music intervention program, outline our program model, and report some initial pilot data evaluating the program outcomes. We also discuss implications for undergraduate and graduate students who were involved in the project. Overall, outcomes were positive and highlighted the need for such interventions among the ASD community. We hope our observations focused on the strengths and weaknesses of the program will be helpful to others who may be considering implementing a similar intervention. (Contains 2 tables and 4 notes.)

AB  - The focus of this Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) project was on RNA secondary structure prediction by using a lattice walk approach. The lattice walk approach is a combinatorial and computational biology method used to enumerate possible secondary structures and predict RNA secondary structure from RNA sequences. The method uses discrete mathematical techniques and identifies specified base pairs as parameters. The goal of the REU was to introduce upper-level undergraduate students to the principles and challenges of interdisciplinary research in molecular biology and discrete mathematics. At the beginning of the project, students from the biology and mathematics departments of a mid-sized university received instruction on the role of secondary structure in the function of eukaryotic RNAs and RNA viruses, RNA related to combinatorics, and the National Center for Biotechnology Information resources. The student research projects focused on RNA secondary structure prediction on a regulatory region of the yellow fever virus RNA genome and on an untranslated region of an mRNA of a gene associated with the neurological disorder epilepsy. At the end of the project, the REU students gave poster and oral presentations, and they submitted written final project reports to the program director. The outcome of the REU was that the students gained transferable knowledge and skills in bioinformatics and an awareness of the applications of discrete mathematics to biological research problems.

AB  - With the rising popularity of digital games, a growing number of universities are developing programmes in various areas of digital design and interactive media to meet the needs for game-related courses. Faculty of this emerging field are grappling with the complexity of developing curricula which integrate art, design and technology and of finding methods of integrating students from these diverse fields. The purpose of this article is to present a case study of an interdisciplinary undergraduate course in game design and to highlight some of the unforeseen challenges and issues that arose when attempting to integrate diverse students from various art, design and media fields with students from computer science. Specifically, this article addresses issues of (a) power, (b) conflict and (c) gender that arose among students during the development of a student-created game.

AB  - In the context of increasing support for interdisciplinary modes of research, many in the policy, scientific, and academic communities propose that universities should change structurally to reduce the barriers to investigation that involves researchers from multiple disciplines. This paper examines "interdisciplinary strategies" in U.S. research universities--deliberate efforts to spur collaborative research across traditional departmental and disciplinary boundaries, including the creation and adaptation of university policies, practices, and structures. It identifies and analyzes the use of incentive grants to initiate new interdisciplinary units, the establishment of "campus-wide institutes" that steer campus investments in interdisciplinary areas, and new modes of faculty hiring and evaluation. Illustrative examples are provided, and the implications of these strategies are discussed.

AB  - The field of biomechanics has grown rapidly in the past 30 years in both size and complexity. As a result, the term might mean different things to different people. This article addresses the issues facing the field in the form of challenges biomechanists face in the future. Because the field is so diverse, strength within the different areas of biomechanics also varies. Although the term might not always appear in the curriculum, principles in biomechanics are felt to be highly integrated into the broader fields of kinesiology, exercise science, etc. The major challenges facing the field, as suggested in this paper, include the development of significant hypotheses, integration with other disciplines such as psychology and motor control, "cross training" our graduate students so they might bring a richer perspective to collaborations with colleagues in other subdisciplines, and the development of funded postdoctoral experiences to support this aspect of student development. Because of the integrative nature of our work, questions are also posed related to the use of particular names, which at times places us in possibly more-restricted categories then we wish. These issues are, of course, open to debate. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - This article reports on a study of senior academics' views of their disciplinary and interdisciplinary affiliations. It questions the idea that academics have a firm and fixed disciplinary identity from which they then act and suggests that academic work in the contemporary university challenges and changes how individuals view their disciplinary affiliation. The article provides empirical data that lends weight to critical questioning of anthropological metaphors, which have tended to dominate discussions of disciplinarity. It suggests that contemporary understandings of disciplinary and interdisciplinary identity need more fluid metaphors and models; ones that can capture the shifting and questioning uncertainties that give expression to the rhetorical and reflexive nature of academics' disciplinary affiliations. The article explores the implications of a dominant emphasis on disciplinary relationships for understanding disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity and examines the practical implications for structures and systems that are designed to enhance and evaluate research and teaching within higher education.

AB  - Nanotechnology is viewed by those in favor of its development in two different ways, and the divide is not recent. This article describes the origins of the differing visions of nanotechnology and examines their broader impacts. The typical history of the field tells nothing about these differing visions, which perhaps misleads. At least two distinct camps among scientists and engineers pursue work on the nanoscale, but they rarely interact, and when they do, they get nowhere. This article looks first at definitional issues in the field; then turns to the common history of nanotechnology, the history's shortcomings, and one particular episode that highlights the divide; and then examines the broader impacts of this dispute. The divide among those interested in nanotech tells something about the way different groups of people see technology and the application of science. This historical review clarifies controversy over societal issues and terminology in nanotechnology. (Contains 2 figures and 17 notes.)

AB  - The interdisciplinary survey inherits from more traditional survey courses the weaknesses embodied in the survey textbook. The standard textbook presentation gives students the impression that each figure's music, art, or literature is the product of the "spirit of the age." Well-chosen biographies temper that presentation by drawing attention to actual acquaintances and collaborations. In addition, biographies help overcome aliteracy, encourage critical thinking, and, perhaps surprisingly, show the traditional textbook in its best light: as a resource to be consulted rather than literature to be pored over.

AB  - Engineering education, like many fields, has started to explore the benefits of concept maps as an assessment technique for knowledge integration. Because they allow students to graphically link topics and represent complex interconnections among diverse concepts, we argue that concept maps are particularly appropriate for assessing interdisciplinary knowledge integration. The results from a year-long study of a design course in green engineering demonstrate the viability of this approach. However, this research also highlights important issues in faculty scoring of interdisciplinary concept maps that may not be present when maps are used in traditional single-discipline settings. The interdisciplinary setting revealed differences in (1) evaluation criteria, (2) expertise, and (3) investment. We conclude with suggestions for selecting and training scorers to address these issues.

AB  - Yuan Ze University targeted Biomaterials Science and developed a curriculum related to Biotechnology, Biochemical Engineering, and Biomaterials for engineering students to cultivate talents for both engineering and biotechnology. After several years of operation, recruiting students has succeeded, and students are satisfied with the course design of the curriculum. The majority of professors advising students' special topic studies have evaluated student performance commendably, and most of the first-year graduates have chosen to pursue a higher degree or work in relevant field. Thus the interdisciplinary program shows the potential to foster and extend engineering students' vision while enabling them to consider different options for post-graduate study or work.

AB  - Despite the long history of the study of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), two facts remain obvious. First, there are almost as many conceptions regarding the definition of PCK as there are researchers interested in it. Second, it is largely unclear which methods enable teacher educators to best prepare teacher candidates to use PCK. Recently, two themes have emerged strongly as mechanisms for helping teacher candidates become more accomplished practitioners. These two ideas, reflective practice and teacher as researcher, can be seen in a variety of teacher preparation programs. However, prevailing systems for preparing and accrediting teachers seem to have a strong enough hold over the process that completely different approaches to preparation, centered on these ideas, may have difficulty getting started. The authors offer a working model of a transferable teacher preparation program that is founded upon the concepts of reflective practitioner and teacher as researcher. They offer a study of the Graduate Program in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education (GMST) at their school as an example of one way in which the ideas can be used to reorganize teacher preparation programs with the explicit goal of preparing teachers to become reflective practitioners and creating teachers as researchers. The master's curriculum of GMST program is designed and organized around putting into practice educational theory and research relating to the ways that students learn mathematics, science, and technology. The mission of the program is to prepare teachers of grades 1-12 by endowing them with a strong background in the content of mathematics, science, and technology, as well as understanding of the particular needs of diverse learners with respect to teaching mathematics, science, and technology. The authors discuss the GMST program and its historical development.

AB  - Bioinformatics education for undergraduates has been approached primarily in two ways: introduction of new courses with largely bioinformatics focus or introduction of bioinformatics experiences into existing courses. For small colleges such as Kalamazoo, creation of new courses within an already resource-stretched setting has not been an option. Furthermore, we believe that a true interdisciplinary science experience would be best served by introduction of bioinformatics modules within existing courses in biology and chemistry and other complementary departments. To that end, with support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, we have developed over a dozen independent bioinformatics modules for our students that are incorporated into courses ranging from general chemistry and biology, advanced specialty courses, and classes in complementary disciplines such as computer science, mathematics, and physics. These activities have largely promoted active learning in our classrooms and have enhanced student understanding of course materials. Herein, we describe our program, the activities we have developed, and assessment of our endeavors in this area. (Contains 7 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - The purpose of this article is to report on the importance of providing pre-service and in-service teachers with experience and specific training in critical thinking skills. The essential concepts in elementary mathematics curricula can be augmented to include and cultivate critical thinking skills that have tremendous ramifications for future leaders and for those who move on to more technical training. A sample problem, along with pre-service teacher responses, is used here to show the necessity and importance of this kind of training as the responses show clear evidence of a certain naivete on the part of these college level students. The responses do show evidence of budding social conscience in the students, but the level of expertise in critical thinking is not at all sophisticated. We discuss and explore the implications of our approach.

AB  - This paper describes a three-year curriculum innovation project on teaching about climate change. The innovation for this study focused on a socio-critical approach towards teaching climate change in four different teaching domains (biology, chemistry, physics and politics). The teaching itself explicitly aimed at general educational objectives, i.e., fostering students' communication and evaluation abilities as essential components for preparing young people for active participation in society. Participatory Action Research has been used as a collaborative strategy of cyclical curriculum innovation and research. Using past experiences and selected results from accompanying research, this project and its methodology will be reflected upon from the viewpoint of the chemistry group taking part in the project. Core issues reflected upon include how the project contributed to the creation of feasible curriculum materials, how it led to innovative structures in practice, and whether it supported experienced teachers' ongoing professional development. General considerations for the process of curriculum innovation will also be derived.

AB  - This theory-to-practice article focuses on interdisciplinary classroom activities based on principles of minimalism in modern music, art, and poetry. A lesson sequence was designed for an inner-city Grades 4 and 5 general classroom of English language learners, where the unit was taught, assessed, and documented by the authors. Included in the article is a detailed teaching script for use by classroom teachers, music teachers, and related arts specialists for Grades 4-8. Readers are guided through lesson materials, instructions, interactive hands-on activities, and assessments for young students with little or no background in music or other arts.

AB  - This study reviews extant measures of cultural competence from many disciplines and evaluates their suitability for social work education based on 8 criteria: validity, reliability, relevance to social justice, item clarity, definition of diversity, coherence, social desirability, and appropriateness for social work. Nineteen instruments met inclusion criteria. Of these, 4 are recommended for social work education. Points of discussion include the ability of scales to transcend disciplinary boundaries, scales as cultural artifacts, and emerging tensions in scale construction. This study calls for interdisciplinary collaboration to develop instruments, pool knowledge, and work toward a socially just world. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse and describe the learning that takes place in the interaction between academics from different disciplines and perspectives in collaboration with practitioners. Design/methodology/approach: The research draws on theories of learning that view it in relation to context, where the most significant features of the learning process concern discerning new aspects of a phenomenon. The study focuses on the workplace learning of researchers in a multidisciplinary programme at the National Institute for Working Life in Sweden (NIWL). Data was collected from semi-structured interviews. In the analysis the learning experienced was discerned by identifying how the participants spoke of developing and changing in their work as researchers. Findings: The investigation identified five categories of learning of the academics in the multidisciplinary research programme, namely: deepened awareness of perspectives and concepts; practical development; new awareness of one's competences and professional learning process; flexible professionalism and practical usefulness; insights into research and development processes. Practical implications: The study contributes to an increased understanding of how knowledge production and academics' workplace learning is constituted in multidisciplinary contexts and research programmes involving practitioners from outside academia. Originality/value: In organising and supporting learning and knowledge exchange in inter- or multidisciplinary research programmes with (or without) practitioners, it is essential to be aware of the importance of relational and contextual implications for academics' learning processes.

AB  - Emotional and behavioral difficulties often interfere with children's acquisition of academic, career, and social skills. Counselors assume an important role in the mandated multidisciplinary evaluation of children with emotional disturbance (ED), but the field lacks a standard battery of assessment procedures for working with children who have ED. The authors review the current issues related to students with ED, describe instruments and procedures used to assess ED, and discuss the counselor's role in the assessment process.

AB  - The study of mentoring has generally been conducted within disciplinary silos with a specific type of mentoring relationship as a focus. The purpose of this article is to quantitatively review the three major areas of mentoring research (youth, academic, workplace) to determine the overall effect size associated with mentoring outcomes for proteges. We also explored whether the relationship between mentoring and protege outcomes varied by the type of mentoring relationship (youth, academic, workplace). Results demonstrate that mentoring is associated with a wide range of favorable behavioral, attitudinal, health-related, relational, motivational, and career outcomes, although the effect size is generally small. Some differences were also found across type of mentoring. Generally, larger effect sizes were detected for academic and workplace mentoring compared to youth mentoring. Implications for future research, theory, and applied practice are provided.

AB  - The authors describe an interdisciplinary course team-taught by an economist and a sociologist. Historically mindful of the less than amicable relationship between these disciplines, these colleagues developed a course that attempted to illuminate the different perspectives of economics and sociology in relation to selected health themes. Such a course is either rare or unique. It served as a general social science (core) requirement and as a major elective for sociology majors. The article describes course mechanics, pedagogy and assessment, course content, and institutional barriers. In particular, the article highlights some of the unique problems that exist in offering such a course--problems that are either less severe or nonexistent in more traditional courses.

AB  - Social workers are actively engaging in the practice of interdisciplinary community collaboration (ICC) with the goal of bringing diverse groups together to improve the conditions of communities and enhance the quality of life of population groups. Yet, collaborations are challenging and require great skill and commitment. The pedagogy and the content of curricula have become a more prominent part of teaching to macro practice students and practitioners the art of effectively convening and moving collaborative efforts forward. This article adds to the literature on the content and methods of teaching students and novice practitioners the competencies embedded in ICC. It provides empirical data from six focus groups of experienced community practitioners (social workers and others) in New York City who identified components of a core curriculum for this work. Eight months later, these 33 community practitioners were asked to reprioritize the topics and concepts that they had collectively identified at the earlier time. Skills such as the ability to share power, manage differences, include the constituency and diplomacy are among those discussed. Core curriculum themes, the pedagogy and process, and the attributes and values necessary for training an ICC practitioner are presented. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - This paper discusses the findings of a search for the intellectual tools used by Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) in his chemistry, education, and theology documents. Priestley's enquiring democratic view of knowledge was applicable in all three areas and constitutes a significant part of his lifework. Current epistemological issues in science education are examined from the point of view of the nature of theory and experiment as observed in Priestley's writings and as espoused in modern philosophy of science. Science and religious faith issues in the context of science education are examined from the point of view of one's understanding of sacred texts, and the suggestion is made that a Priestleyan model of "the liberty to think for oneself" and "to hold knowledge with humility and virtue" could prove helpful in dealing with the known divergent opinions in relation to science, education, and religion.

AB  - In view of the complex problems of this age, the question of the socio-ethical dimension of science acquires particular importance. We approach this matter from a philosophical and sociological standpoint, looking at such focal concerns as the motivation, purposes and methods of scientific activity, the ambivalence of scientific research and the concomitant risks, and the conflict between research freedom and external socio-political intervention. We then point out the impediments to the effectiveness of cross-disciplinary or broader meetings for addressing these complex problems and managing the associated risks, given the difficulty in communication between experts in different fields and non-experts, difficulties that education is challenged to help resolve. We find that the social necessity of informed decision-making on the basis of cross-disciplinary collaboration is reflected in the newer curricula, such as that of Greece, in aims like the acquisition of cross-subject knowledge and skills, and the ability to make decisions on controversial issues involving value conflicts. The interest and the reflections of the science education community in these matters increase its--traditionally limited--contribution to the theoretical debate on education and, by extension, the value of science education in the education system.

AB  - Previous research has highlighted the effectiveness of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) in multiple disciplinary settings, including medicine, teacher education, business, allied health, and the social sciences. Yet interdisciplinary educators have very little information about how to implement PBL in classrooms where multiple disciplines are represented. This paper offers practical strategies for the successful implementation of PBL in an interdisciplinary context in which learners have a limited knowledge base. In this paper we will a) highlight challenges to interdisciplinary teaching, b) demonstrate how PBL and traditional teaching techniques can be used in an interdisciplinary context, and c) discuss strategies to engage students in making scientific discoveries of their own.

AB  - Interdisciplinary concepts and methodology are increasingly common in today's secondary schools. However, many interdisciplinary lessons combine courses in related areas (e.g., English with history or science with mathematics). This article examines the use of mathematical ideas in the teaching of literature and writing. Employing mathematical knowledge in the instruction of literature and writing provides another means of illustrating literary and writing concepts. (Contains 7 figures.)

AB  - The purpose of this article is to describe innovatory online teaching carried out in the inter-university master's "Educational Innovation Policies and Practices for the Knowledge Society", with the participation of Malaga, Almeria and Internacional de Andalucia Universities. The master's focuses on the exploration of a problem-based learning model, which was specifically developed and directed to reflect the basic assumptions of action research. The online teaching model, developed particularly by Internacional de Andalucia University, is the background for the development of an interdisciplinary core investigated in this study. The principles that sustain the problem-based learning model, particularly the full involvement of students in situated problems, have led to the application of action research's assumptions and premises by placing problems within the professional practice of the students, their reflections and their possible modifications. The results suggest that the interdisciplinary core is a collaborative innovative opportunity that can turn real innovation processes into study content, from the educational practice of students.

AB  - A diverse range of social structures, for instance teacher teams, professional communities and teacher learning communities, are established to advance collaboration among teachers. In Norway, Interdisciplinary Teacher Teams (ITTs) have become a common way of organising teachers in schools, recommended in a national curriculum reform in 1997. This study explores the internal structure, social meaning and potential resources for learning and development inherent in the planning and coordination of work in ITT meetings. Most studies of teacher teams as well as teacher learning communities are based on teachers' experiences, expressed in interviews or surveys. The focus of this study is not on what teachers say "about" teams, but on what teachers say "in" teams. While most studies have addressed within-department, subject-specific teams, this study focuses on interdisciplinary teams. Team-talk in two ITTs in two different lower secondary schools in Norway has been videotaped and analysed. Four patterns of interaction have been identified--preserving individualism: renegotiating individual autonomy and personal responsibility; coordination: assuring the social organisation of work; cooperation: creating a shared object or enterprise; and sharing: clarifying pedagogical motives. The study illustrates patterns in team-talk, conceptualises the processes of decision-making that take place in these ITTs and identifies resources for learning and development inherent in certain forms of interaction. The study contributes to the research literature by both focusing on the details of the interaction in team meetings and analysing the dynamics of the group interaction in the perspective of the situatedness and the object-orientation of team-talk.

AB  - To meet the ever-changing needs of students in the modern world, forward-thinking educators are crossing the traditional borders of their own disciplines to work with colleagues from other fields to develop novel approaches to teaching. Examples of cross-disciplinary efforts illustrate both the creativity of their participants and the promise and excitement that they hold for students: Biochemists are working with business faculty (Keller and Cox 2004), philosophy teachers are collaborating with physicists (Jordan 1989), and mathematics instructors are teaming up with music teachers (Bamberger 2000). Similarly, English language teaching (ELT) professionals are reaching out to colleagues from other disciplines (including health, history, humanities, math, psychology, science, social studies, and sociology) at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels to develop innovative courses, materials, and instructional approaches. This article shares insights gained from the authors' interdisciplinary work in the hopes that other ELT professionals might benefit from them. The authors discuss specific steps that can be taken to ensure successful partnerships as they focus on three key areas: (1) initiating an interdisciplinary project; (2) establishing an interdisciplinary team; and (3) working successfully with other disciplines. The discussion is organized around nine ELT scenarios and numerous English idioms that illustrate many issues that could arise in the course of interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - To help writing faculty learn the language of discourse communities across campus, we conducted faculty interviews as a first attempt to describe knowledge about disciplinary cultures, specifically with regard to writing. Based on the data received from the interviews about disciplinary definitions and characteristics of good writing and how writing is learned, we advocate (a) awareness: recognizing that the particular beliefs and practices of a discipline may differ from those of other disciplines; (b) knowledge: learning about others' values, particularly regarding the definition and practice of writing; and (c) skills: altering perceptions and even communication strategies based on awareness and knowledge. Our interview data suggest that when writing faculty limit cross-disciplinary discussion to characteristics of good writing only, discipline stereotypes are reinforced, and communication may be restricted. However, when writing faculty discuss learning-to-write strategies with faculty in other disciplines, the results reveal commonalities about writing ideology.

AB  - This study adopted Jarzabkowski's (2005) qualitative, activity-based strategy as practice method to investigate leadership and management of interdisciplinary work. Interviews were conducted with 10 academics in Australia and the United Kingdom. Challenges raised by leaders of academic work can be grouped at various levels according to which problems arose. First, faculty in both countries spoke of the influence of national policy context on facilitating and impeding interdisciplinary research, particularly how interdisciplinary research is quantified under assessment schemes. At the institutional level, policies related to promotion and tenure greatly affected researchers' attitude towards interdisciplinary research, particularly for junior academics. Third, leaders at the department level and in research centres had a significant influence on the ability to create management structures to foster and promote interdisciplinary research. This study provides indicators of effective practices, suggests a number of key institutional challenges and proposes a future research agenda.

AB  - This article synthesizes neuroscience findings with long-standing criminological models and data into a comprehensive explanation of the relationship between drug use and crime. The innate factors that make some people vulnerable to drug use are conceptually similar to those that predict criminality, supporting a spurious reciprocal model of the drugs-crime relationship. Simultaneously, police pressure and penalty severity, the principal tools of the drug war, inflate the cost of drugs, which drives most drug-related crime. Concluding that much drug war rhetoric is the misleading product of a moral panic, this perspective supports a harm reduction approach to ameliorating the drug war.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research and education (IDRE) holds center stage in current academic discussions. Despite the widespread agreement on the promises of IDRE, barriers for effective IDRE implementation remain significant. This study explored the opportunities and challenges of IDRE in integrated soil and water sciences at the Pennsylvania State University through a faculty survey and an educational project. The study revealed that: (1) co-advising graduate student is a common practice as a means of IDRE, and the overall positive aspects out-weigh the negative aspects; (2) joint faculty appointments receive mixed reactions, and are viewed by some as advantageous for the university but difficult for the faculty; (3) people issues are absolutely a critical aspect of successful IDRE; however, IDRE could also be accomplished by small groups or individuals; (4) synergistic approaches have not yet been commonly implemented, because IDRE collaborations often consist of faculty continuing piece-meal contributions independent of one another; (5) a new/renewed interdisciplinary undergraduate program in integrated soil and water sciences remains questionable as a viable solution to the declining undergraduate enrollment; (6) a potential new and broader graduate program appears to be promising, with a possible target on the emerging Critical Zone science (an interdisciplinary science that advocates the holistic studies of the Earth's near-surface environments, which extend from the top of vegetations to the bottom of aquifers); and (7) reward system needs to be enhanced to truly facilitate IDRE, and should be considered as a focus from both administration and practicality points of view. It is hoped, through such a study, that more true synergies can be realized through enhanced IDRE in academic environments. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)

AB  - The University of North Carolina Mobile Student Health Action Coalition (UNC MSHAC) at Chapel Hill, North Carolina is a voluntary service-learning program in which interdisciplinary teams of graduate level health professional students provide monthly home visits to isolated, community-dwelling elders with complex medical and social issues. Students are mentored by UNC clinical faculty and retirees from the local community. Together, mentors and students generate action plans to improve the health and well-being of the participating elders. We report here the qualitative and quantitative results from our program evaluation demonstrating UNC MSHAC as an effective, service-learning model that compliments curricula, is satisfactory to students, and is a vehicle for academic institutions to serve elders in the local community.

AB  - One can extrapolate from the art of language instruction to discover methods applicable across the disciplines in higher education. The paradigm presented by language instruction is applicable throughout the arts and sciences. If cultivated--and there are institutional pressures working against it--such an art can impact the languages and codes of the individual disciplines so as to advance the research mission of scholars in those fields; it can also favor the interrelationships between the disciplines. How the student learns another language (L2) is comparable to the process of learning a scientific discipline.

AB  - Transdisciplinarity has been a veritable mantra, especially in the humanities and social sciences, for twenty years or more. Yet academic structures and research application requirements still struggle to come to grips with cross-boundary research and teaching. Making universities more trans-discipline-friendly is a tricky task, however. As Wendy Russell explains, trans-disciplines require disciplines, and disciplinary boundaries, too.

AB  - In this article we attempt to complicate traditional--and, we argue, limited and exclusionary--definitions of interdisciplinarity as the bringing into dialogue of established disciplines without questioning the parameters and practices of those disciplines. We propose that interdisciplinarity instead might mean teaching and learning among, between, and in the midst of those of innate or learned capacities--not only college faculty but also students and  staff. To illustrate this more radical iteration of interdisciplinarity, we draw on a range of definitions of the key terms, "discipline" and "faculty," and we offer a case study of a workshop we co-facilitated in which we brought differently positioned individuals together to engage in the educational process and the production of knowledge. We hope that this discussion contributes to expanding the notions and practices of interdisciplinarity.

AB  - Drawing upon five years of experience with an interdisciplinary initiative, colleagues in biology, literary studies, and physics offer a framework by which to understand the nature and value of interdisciplinary work. Effective interdisciplinary exchange depends on a dynamic and mutual interplay that challenges normally unexamined disciplinary assumptions. Effective interdisciplinary exchange can not only reinvigorate the disciplines but also engage them more effectively in a common intellectual enterprise, one that in turn is able to engage more effectively with a wide range of human concerns beyond the academy.

AB  - The integration of student research into a general chemistry laboratory and an environmental geology course has been evaluated for its effectiveness to improve (i) student attitudes about science and chemistry, (ii) student understanding of the nature of experimental science and the scientific method, and (iii) student perceptions of the application of science and the interdisciplinary nature of science. Students in introductory science courses frequently devote all or most of their time and effort to learning basic laboratory techniques by following predefined procedures that have intentionally predictable outcomes. Though this longstanding model of laboratory structure is an important means of effectively preparing students for future chemical study, it often neglects items i-iii. Students were guided through a research experience by an interdisciplinary team of faculty so that students could begin the research "and" bring it to an appropriate conclusion, including formal presentations, within a single semester. Evaluation of this instructional strategy indicated that students believed they were doing work similar to a research scientist, that they appreciated this opportunity to do research, that it increased how much they like science in general, and that they were more likely to consider majoring in chemistry. The advanced instrumentation, personal relevance of the research, and collaborations (within and outside the department) contributed significantly to the overall success of the project.

AB  - Modern biological sciences require practitioners to have increasing levels of knowledge, competence, and skills in mathematics and programming. A recent review of the science curriculum at the University of Queensland, a large, research-intensive institution in Australia, resulted in the development of a more quantitatively rigorous undergraduate program. Inspired by the National Research Council's "BIO2010" report, a new interdisciplinary first-year course (SCIE1000) was created, incorporating mathematics and computer programming in the context of modern science. In this study, the perceptions of biological science students enrolled in SCIE1000 in 2008 and 2009 are measured. Analysis indicates that, as a result of taking SCIE1000, biological science students gained a positive appreciation of the importance of mathematics in their discipline. However, the data revealed that SCIE1000 did not contribute positively to gains in appreciation for computing and only slightly influenced students' motivation to enroll in upper-level quantitative-based courses. Further comparisons between 2008 and 2009 demonstrated the positive effect of using genuine, real-world contexts to enhance student perceptions toward the relevance of mathematics. The results support the recommendation from "BIO2010" that mathematics should be introduced to biology students in first-year courses using real-world examples, while challenging the benefits of introducing programming in first-year courses.

AB  - During the phase of developing new technologies and models to be used in education and for their integration, not only the technical studies and research but also the human factor which is a significant factor for the education system should be taken into consideration. Hence, a reflection concerning the answer to the question of "To what extent should the interdisciplinary studies complement each other?" should be made. The purpose of this research is to reflect on the importance of interdisciplinary cooperation between Faculties of Engineering and Education. The study was carried out during 2007-2008 academic year. Total 57 academicians of various universities of Turkey were participated in the study (22 of them were selected from Faculties of Engineering and 35 of them were selected from Faculties of Education). Survey method is employed and a likert type questionnaire which included open-ended questions, was used as data collection tool in the study. The data analyzed by calculating mean scores of responses. Findings illustrate that cooperation between two Faculties and its share in increasing the quality of current education is essential for interdisciplinary cooperation. In addition, the significance of combining theoretical information with implementation and evaluating the outputs of these practices has been emphasized in the study. It is suggested that both disciplines should go hand in hand paving the way for educational and technological innovations. (Contains 9 tables.)

AB  - This theory-to-practice article focuses on interdisciplinary classroom activities based on principles of collage in modern music, art, and poetry. A two-lesson sequence was designed for an inner-city Grade 4 and 5 general classroom of English language learners, where the unit was taught, assessed, and documented by the authors. Included in the article is a detailed teaching script for use by classroom teachers, music teachers, and related arts specialists for Grades 4 to 8. Readers are guided through lesson materials, instructions, interactive hands-on activities, and assessments appropriate for young students with little or no background in music and other arts.

AB  - In response to calls for discourse that builds on the substantive structure of environmental education in efforts to further the scope of the field, this article reexamines key principles of environmental education through the multidisciplinary lenses of critical pedagogy, the environmental justice movement, and more recent definitions of place-based education. Understanding that environmental education's key concepts of environment and environmental literacy are culturally specific--not universal--ideas opens the field for more diverse, locally appropriate, and inclusive pedagogies. By reflecting on environmental education's shortcomings in the field, revisiting its foundational concepts and themes, and integrating multidisciplinary methodologies, the author makes a case for broadening the scope of what is included in environmental education discourse and continuing to challenge the present and future of its theory and practice.

AB  - The introduction of liberal studies is a new curriculum reform initiative in Hong Kong starting from 2009. It is a kind of formal interdisciplinary curriculum built on decades of experiences garnered from the implementation of various integrated subjects with similar nature. Through the method of documentary analysis that brings all official policy papers, curriculum guides/documents, stakeholders' feedback, and prior research into critical scrutiny, this article aims to analyze the phylogeny of formal interdisciplinary curriculum in Hong Kong from historical, sociological, ideological, and curricular perspectives, with a view to delineating the changes and continuities in the development of interdisciplinary curriculum and identifying the problems and possibilities for its implementation.

AB  - This article describes the development, implementation, and evaluation of an online professional development course designed to develop an understanding of the foundations, perspectives, and strategies used by key disciplines (e.g., occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech-language pathology, early childhood special education, visual impairment, and hearing loss) that provide services for infants with multiple disabilities and for their families. A total of 110 early interventionists in California completed the online course successfully. An overview of the course content, structure, assignments, and online instruction is provided. A discussion of outcomes includes feedback from participants on (1) their perception of changes in their own professional competencies based on pre- and post-test data, (2) their satisfaction with the overall course design, (3) challenges and benefits of online instruction, and (4) the impact of what they learned on their professional practice. Implications for future professional development efforts are identified. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - The present study takes an interdisciplinary mathematics-physics approach to the acquisition of the concept of angle by children in Grades 3-5. This paper first presents the theoretical framework we developed, then we analyse the concept of angle and the difficulties pupils have with it. Finally, we report three experimental physics-based teaching sequences tested in three classrooms. We showed that at the end of each teaching sequence the pupils had a good grasp of the concept of angle, they had truly appropriated the physics knowledge at play, and many pupils are enable to successfully grasp new physics situations in which the angle plays a highly meaningful role. Using a physics framework to introduce angles in problem situations is then pertinent: by interrelating different spaces, pupils were able to acquire skills in the domains of mathematics, physics, and modelling. In conclusion, we discuss the respective merits of each problem situation proposed. (Contains 22 figures and 6 tables.)

AB  - Preparing students in the early childhood field to work with children both with and without disabilities and to collaborate with different professionals is an important endeavor for colleges and universities. The purpose of this paper is to articulate a unique model of program collaboration between early childhood special education and early childhood regular education that demonstrates a cohesive preservice teacher education program across two departments within one university. This unique 10-year history of interdisciplinary collaboration and team teaching provides insights into many of the benefits and challenges of this type of program. This paper presents an historical overview of the development of this collaborative program and describes the logistics of operating an interdisciplinary program at the administrative level. Information collected from faculty and students illustrates the benefits and challenges of team teaching. Finally, strategies for developing a successful program are discussed. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - The polygraph (lie detector) may be an ideal vehicle for converting aspects of a physiology course into an interdisciplinary course, enabling discussion of interrelationships between science, technology and society (STS) and social dilemmas arising from technological developments. The authors present a way of incorporating the polygraph into a pre-service teacher education physiology course. They briefly present the scientific, technological and social aspects of the polygraph as well as a suggested sequence of suitable lessons and activities. Some of the activities presented here are laboratory experiments using "hands on" approach and ICT. (Contains 4 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - As the result of an extensive self-study for the purpose of reaccreditation, the Department of Theology at The University of Portland began offering a new series of courses called Theological Perspective Courses (THEP). THEP courses are upper division and offered by theology faculty in conjunction with another department that has required core courses in the College of Arts and Sciences. They are intended to be interdisciplinary, with two faculty members from different disciplines collaborating on new course design and implementation. THEP 482, Theology in Ecological Perspective, was one of the first two THEP courses taught. This article describes and reflects on the nature of this religion and science course in terms of subject matter, learning theory, and development of community. Several additional appendices to this article appear online at: http://www.wabashcenter.wabash.edu/journal/article2.aspx?id=12397.

AB  - Physical education is a prime content area for interdisciplinary learning. The movement components of physical education can be used as a medium through which children are provided with opportunities to practice and strengthen language skills. Cone, Werner, Cone, and Woods (1998, p. 4) agree: "interdisciplinary learning is an educational process in which two or more subject areas  are integrated with the goal of fostering enhanced learning in each subject area." The interdisciplinary curriculum benefits students by enriching student learning across academic disciplines, while appreciating the knowledge and expertise brought on by other teachers. One specific interdisciplinary learning curriculum is the connected teaching model which can be used as a foundation to integrate language arts into a quality physical education program. The basis for integrating physical education and language arts into one program derives from the fact that movement and learning are linked and that quality physical education can contribute to a child's alertness, energy, clearer thinking in class, and academic achievement. This article discusses how to design an integrated lesson for physical education and language arts whereby physical activities are augmented with language arts. It presents a Physical Education and Language Arts sample lesson which offers an example of how the NASPE standards 1 and 4 and National Council for Teachers of English (NCTE) standards 3 and 6 were addressed.

AB  - A novel experiment for the extraction of lycopene from tomato paste without the use of an organic solvent is described. The experiment employs polymer, green, and analytical chemistry. This environmentally friendly extraction is more efficient and requires less time than the traditional approach using an organic solvent. The extraction is accomplished using an aqueous emulsion. The emulsifying agent CPS, which is a co-polymerization product from acrylic acid, n-butyl acrylate, and styrene monomers, is generated as a part of the experiment. The emulsion can be reused by simple basification. This experiment acquaints students with a polymerization reaction, the extraction of a natural product, and provides experience with thin-layer chromatography and UV-vis spectroscopy, which are used for purity determination and identification, respectively. During the experiment, students gain an understanding of the overlap among the different fields of chemistry and the concept of green chemistry. The experiment is suitable for upper-level chemistry laboratories. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - The aim of this experiment is to study and calculate the kinetic constant of a Heck reaction: the arylation of but-3-en-2-ol by iodobenzene catalyzed by palladium acetate in presence of triethylamine in DMF. The reaction leads to a mixture of two ketones. Students use GC analysis to quantify reagents and products of reaction. They control the global order of the reaction and prove that the two products are formed by two reactions that are in parallel. Finally, they calculate the rate constant for each reaction. Students calculate iodobenzene conversion, each product selectivity, yield, and catalyst turn over number (TON). These calculations are controlled using an internal standard, (-)-fenchone. This experiment is completed by students during their second-year kinetic laboratory and is done in pairs in a four-hour laboratory. This work allows students to work in the fields of organic and analytical chemistry, catalysis, and kinetics at the same time. (Contains 5 schemes.)

AB  - In January 2006, the College of Business at Eastern Michigan University (EMU) instituted a cross-disciplinary program in international business (IB). Business communication is a major component of the program. Moreover, the need for business communication in other languages contributed greatly to the cross-disciplinary nature of the program. This article explains how faculty members from a diverse range of fields have been involved in the design and implementation of the IB program. The synergy resulting from this interdisciplinary initiative has strengthened not only individual courses but the IB program as a whole. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - After seeing growing frustration among inexperienced undergraduate researchers  searching a popular aggregated interdisciplinary database, the authors questioned whether the  leading interdisciplinary databases are serving undergraduates' needs. As a preliminary exploration of this question, the authors queried vendors, analyzed their marketing materials, surveyed librarians and students, and examined what titles were being downloaded at 14 liberal arts institutions. Although librarians are satisfied with these databases, and vendors intend to continue the trend of adding more content, actual usage patterns suggest that these databases are not serving the purpose one might expect. Librarians should learn more about user experiences in order to influence the development of these products. (Contains 9 tables and 29 notes.)

AB  - Health care professionals working with the elderly have opportunities through research and clinical practice to shape public policy affecting the older driver. This article describes DriveWise, an interdisciplinary hospital-based driving assessment program developed in response to clinical concerns about the driving safety of individuals with medical conditions. DriveWise clinicians use evidence-based, functional assessments to determine driving competence. In addition, the program was designed to meet the emotional needs of individuals whose driving safety has been called into question. To date, approximately 380 participants have been assessed through DriveWise. The following report details the DriveWise mission, DriveWise team members, and road test results. We continue to refine the assessment process to promote safety and support the dignity and independence of all participants. The DriveWise interdisciplinary approach to practice is a concrete example of how gerontological education across professions can have direct benefits to the older adult.

AB  - This qualitative research project focused on the impact of service-learning experiences on an interdisciplinary college freshman course. The research included the impact on academic learning, the application of concepts into a public school educational environment, and the perceptions regarding the contribution to the school being served. Participants were college freshmen students who received pre and post surveys and participated in both verbal and written reflections. Analysis of the survey responses and reflection data indicated the service-learning experiences enhanced student learning. Analysis of data also indicated a disconnect between recognized community needs and college student involvement toward fulfilling the needs.

AB  - Since the mid-1980s, health service restructuring in New Zealand has strengthened managerialism, arguably detracting from professional considerations. Professional leaders without line-management responsibilities have replaced social work departments headed by a professional social worker. An emerging social work contribution to interdisciplinary leadership in mental health settings aims to advance quality of service and fill social work leadership gaps resulting from structural changes created by health policy initiatives. In the context of limited research into these changes, this paper presents an action learning organic approach examining how social work professional leaders implemented Kouzes and Posner's "exemplary leadership" in a District Health Board. This examination integrates indigenous Maori approaches to leadership with Western models. Findings suggest both caution and optimism about the professional leader "role". The paper suggests further research to explore the relationship of professional leadership and clinical governance in public health services. (Contains 1 table and 6 figures.)

AB  - Most educators have a love-hate relationship with field trips. On the one hand, field trips are a great way to get students out of the building, enhance learning, and have some fun. On the other hand, field trips are a lot of work and worry. Especially now, with the increased cost of transportation and the need for curricular ties, field trips must make the best possible use of time spent away from school. A photographic scavenger hunt as part of an interdisciplinary field trip provides curricular relevance, captures student interest, promotes critical-thinking, and capitalizes on the time spent outside the classroom.

AB  - The activity of tag may be one of the most widely played games in elementary physical education programs. It comes in many shapes and sizes and can be morphed to meet many needs. For example, tag is used as a general body warm-up for young children (Rosengard, Mckenzie, & Short, 2000), to teach chasing, dodging, and fleeing skills (Graham, Holt/Hale & Parker, 2004), and to even improve aerobic fitness levels (NASPE, 2005). The versatility of tag also provides opportunities for the integration of multidisciplinary concepts within physical education. Donnelly (2002) states, "reinforcing classroom concepts in physical education is an exciting way to make the world come alive for students." The authors agree and believe that tag games can serve as a platform for meeting the needs of physical education while simultaneously reinforcing classroom concepts. This article suggests a few tag games that integrate classroom concepts.

AB  - This paper describes the development process of an evaluation framework for describing and comparing web survey tools. We believe that this approach will help shape the design, development, deployment, and evaluation of population-based health interventions. A conceptual framework for describing and evaluating web survey systems will enable the developers of health interventions to identify, select, and use the most appropriate and relevant survey tools. The primary contributors included survey methodologists, computer scientists, informaticians, technical communications specialists, educators, evaluators, clinical practitioners, and health services researchers, who together developed a comprehensive ontology to describe the electronic survey domain. This paper will describe the survey ontology development process and detail lessons learned in the creation of the web survey system evaluation framework. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - The overall goal of the Swiss Virtual Campus project Dealing with Natural Hazards and Risk (NAHRIS) is to create a common educational course program that compiles the most recent knowledge in the field of natural hazards and risk management. Several higher education institutes from all parts of Switzerland were involved in the realization of this Internet course platform presenting a total of 87 learning units available online at www.nahris.ch. NAHRIS is primarily targeted at university students at the bachelor of science level. The main novelty of NAHRIS lies in the holistic examination of the natural hazard and risk management domain including technical, environmental and social aspects. Therefore, it enjoys growing popularity among researchers and practitioners employed in these working areas. (Contains 6 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims at a better understanding of expert roles in transdisciplinary projects. Thus, the main purpose is the analysis of the roles of experts in transdisciplinary projects. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis of the ETH-UNS case studies from the point of view of the psychology of expertise and the sociology of professions is based on findings and considerations from the psychology of expertise and the sociology of professions--as both lines of research are concerned with experts and the use of expertise. This paper focuses on projects in the framework of the so-called transdisciplinary case study approach that has been developed at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich in the 1990s. Findings: It is claimed that, firstly, system experts provide important information on the local human-environmental system and have to be regarded as serious experts, that is knowledge specialists with a certain responsibility for information. Secondly, decision-making experts run into problems integrating other professionals into transdisciplinary projects and should, therefore, professionalize themselves. Practical implications: The paper encourages the use of residents, etc. as system experts in transdisciplinary projects. Originality/value: The roles of experts in transdisciplinary project are clarified. (Contains 1 figure and 2 tables.)

AB  - This paper shows how the knowledge structures and traditions of the amalgamated multi-discipline of social studies at once help and hinder the use of constructivist instructional models. I interpret the planning process of two "Fostering a Community of Learners" units and examine how these two units are implemented by four teachers, given their domain-specific knowledge and modes of thinking. The data suggest that the pragmatism of social studies, as well as the idea of multiple perspectives constituting social scientific and social studies knowledge, makes this field a prime candidate for constructivist modes of thinking and the design of expert and jigsaw sequences. But the weak relationship of the subject to referent disciplines and the pragmatic reliance on proven activities makes for weak conceptual synthesis in the teaching units.

AB  - In the traditional Chinese curriculum, subjects are learned separately since students start their formal schooling. Students usually neglect the connection among different subjects, which, to some extent, restricts their way of thinking. In order to change the status quo, the focus of this paper is to explore the feasibility of introducing an interdisciplinary approach into the current curriculum of urban primary schools in China. Also, this paper predicts the problems when the interdisciplinary approach is implemented, and provides some suggestions and solutions for school leaders and teachers to adopt.

Findings and implications should be relevant to elementary teachers, administrators, art specialists, and teacher educators. Our findings illustrate the power of art-integrated education to support student learning at high levels and in meaningful ways. (Contains 7 figures.)

The authors organised this conference in March 2007 at the American University, Washington, DC, to expand scholarship on surveillance and policing in an egalitarian forum. We discuss how students can engage their departments and faculty in building the students' knowledge of both anthropological theories and methodology through shared scholarship. We show how students can "apply" anthropology to audiences, which will in turn influence policy decision making. In addition, the authors explore how academics can transform knowledge sharing into tools that shape broader political and social dialogue. (Contains 3 notes.)

AB  - In this article the aim is to challenge essentialist ontological assumptions surrounding the impairment category of "learning difficulties" as it was previously conceptualized in social theory and practice. I ground my knowledge production in self-advocates connected to the self-advocacy movement in Flanders (Belgium) and in critical feminist disability studies. Drawing upon the post-structuralist feminist Rosi Braidotti, who introduced nomadology as a new figuration of layered, embedded and embodied subjectivity, I bring the illustrative nomadic subjectivity of the president of the self-advocacy network to the public eye. In order to allow disability scholars and activists re-inscribe new scenarios in our contemporary discourse and shared culture, I appeal for an interpretation of the impaired body and mind as a socio-political field.

AB  - While many reports espouse the potential impact that 3-D virtual worlds are expected to have on teaching and learning in higher education in a few years, there are few empirical studies that inform instructional design and learning assessment in virtual worlds. This study explores the nature and process of learning in Second Life in a graduate interdisciplinary communication course in fall 2007. Literature suggests that 3-D virtual worlds can be well suited for experiential learning environments. In this study, the actual instructional effectiveness of Second Life as an experiential learning environment for interdisciplinary communication is empirically examined using mixed research methods of journal content analysis, surveys, focus group, and virtual world snapshots and video.

AB  - A team-taught interdisciplinary undergraduate unit in Sustainable Development has been developed and run over the past two years at the University of Bristol. This has been a unique initiative for this university to take. As in most other research-intensive higher education institutions, teaching generally follows rather traditional disciplinary conventions, operating within departmental bounds. The initiative was unusual--and indeed ambitious--enough to gain the Higher Education Environmental Performance Improvement (HEEPI) Green Gown Award in teaching for 2007 (HEEPI is a project supported by the Higher Education Founding Council for England; http://www.heepi.org.uk/green_gown_awards.htm). There are both challenges and pleasures in designing and delivering a team-taught unit in a traditional university setting. This experience is outlined and evaluated here, giving consideration to both the practical and the more fundamentally philosophical issues encountered in the process. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - Despite desegregation, and educational policies calling for increased inclusivity in higher education, students in South Africa generally continue to have homogenous social and learning experiences. This article reports on a collaborative student learning community across three disciplines at two universities. The e-learning project aimed to provide students an opportunity for collaborative learning across differences. Feedback and comments from the students revealed that students had the opportunity to learn about socio-economic difference in South African communities, but that there was some avoidance in engaging with issues of race and apartheid. What students most benefited from was learning about the different disciplines. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Despite receiving increased professional and public awareness since the initial American Speech Language Hearing Association (ASHA) statement defining Auditory Processing Disorders (APDs) in 1993 and the subsequent ASHA statement (2005), many misconceptions remain regarding APDs in school-age children among health and academic professionals. While many disorders account for why a child has difficulty understanding auditory content, this article will provide an overview of the history of APDs, current clinical presentations, distinguish between the common and often coexisting disorders seen in school-age children, and discuss how an audiological evaluation is used to detect the presence of APDs. Using a case method approach, a clinical case scenario describing the elusive nature of APDs, the importance of comprehensive audiological testing, and the interdisciplinary role of health professionals, with emphasis on the distinct role of the school nurse will be highlighted.

AB  - The Center for Economic and Workforce Development (CEWD) at Kingsborough Community College (KCC) is currently working on a workforce development project that contains innovative teaching tools that proved successful in overcoming issues of academic isolation facing the student body. The CUNY Young Adult Program (CYAP) is a partnership of three City University of New York (CUNY) colleges--LaGuardia Community College (lead organization), KCC's CEWD and New York City College of Technology (City Tech)--that have worked together on several workforce development projects. The existing partnership already serves the priority target population of out-of-school youth, provides vocational training in the program's two priority sectors (construction trades and health), combines all the desired program elements (i.e., career planning, work readiness, GED preparation, and post-secondary occupational training), and already encompasses other priorities of importance to the Department of Labor (i.e., green components, collaboration, leveraged resources, support from a broad range of business and community-based organizations, and service within environmental justice zones). Among the CEWD recruits are some of the estimated 12,000 disconnected young adults residing in New York City. The current cohort is comprised of 25 students who are completing the 12-week Food Service Operations program. The current training cohort (as of May 1, 2010) at CEWD saw a comprehensive infusion of social networking in the program. CEWD is building institutional respect for social networking in an educational setting by connecting students, faculty, and external mentors. In this article, the authors first provide a glance at one of these networks, www.cunyive.ning.com, as it is currently used by CEWD and then explain how social networking sites such as this can provide the right blend of familiarity and professional appearance to put students at ease with its content yet make them professionally accountable for their online persona.

This paper focuses on the first of these, arguing that public policy students can and should be exposed to a comprehensive classification of types of ethical analysis. It then briefly addresses the two other deficiencies, again with recourse to recent interdisciplinary scholarship. Students can and should be exposed to the full range of types of ethical evaluation, theories, methods, and possible side effects of policies.

By conceptualizing faculty work as a learning process that is both cognitive and social, sociocultural perspectives highlight the ways in which faculty learning and work are enabled and shaped by the contexts in which they occur, but also how learning and work, in turn, shape existing contexts and enable new practices.

AB  - Given the low turnout among younger voters, it is important to seek innovative ways of engaging students in the electoral process, and a presidential year like this one offers exciting opportunities for doing so. In this article, the author describes her experiences with a schoolwide project designed by herself and colleagues that simulates the election campaigns by having students run as the presidential and vice-presidential candidates of each party. The project engages several school departments as well as social studies: English (which provides a press corps and media coverage), math (which conducts surveys and tallies results), science (which identifies candidates' policies on the environment), and foreign languages (for a review of candidates' policies toward countries associated with a designated language).

AB  - The NASPE standards for physical education programs stress that students should not only achieve competence in physical skills but also acquire and integrate the underlying concepts that can lead to effective movement. Physical educators can successfully embed these underlying concepts into the daily skill instruction and guided practice in their classes by designing lessons that teach key scientific bases of movement. This article discusses Newton's laws of motion, as a scientific basis for movement skills, from an elementary school physical education perspective. It also includes guided questions designed to help the elementary physical educator to apply these laws in daily instructional activities. (Contains 2 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - Interdisciplinarity has become the model of scholarly inquiry generally espoused by many who seek federal research funding. Interdisciplinary research centers pose challenges to academic settings and to investigators. In a conference of directors of diverse research centers at a single research university we found that the challenges facing centers and their universities fell into three major categories: fiscal sustainability, recruiting and retaining faculty, and leadership sustainability. These challenges are discussed, and institutional recommendations are proposed to address these challenges. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Problem solving, interpersonal skills, information literacy, and critical and independent thinking are essential qualities that employers seek, yet many undergraduates lack. We structured an interdisciplinary classroom and experiential learning environment where students from three undergraduate courses (Hospitality and Tourism Management, Landscape Architecture, and Forestry and Natural Resources) designed a sustainable community master plan by investigating the economic, social, and environmental components of a U.S. highway relocation project. Interdisciplinary teams of students were charged with a "problem" that was articulated in the form of a Request for Proposals (RFP). This RFP served as the basis for the group work, which required an interdisciplinary approach. The ability of students to work together to complete the project was analyzed using the construct of synergistic knowledge development (SKD), a process by which a group constructively integrates diverse perspectives of individual group members. We posited that SKD would increase over the semester and that SKD would be influenced by various team dynamics such as task conflict, psychological safety, social interaction, attitudes toward problem-based learning (PBL) in a team setting, and behavioral styles of team members. Assessment of SKD and the variables hypothesized to influence it were assessed via a survey administered after the initial phase of the project and a post-project survey. Results confirmed how social interaction, psychological safety, and attitudes toward PBL in a team setting influence SKD.

AB  - The authors--a second grade classroom teacher and a university professor of education--decided to collaborate. Melanie wanted to find out if she could help her students increase their reading and writing comprehension by presenting a sequence of events in an activity (for example, the steps in building a house) and then have the students write the steps in proper order. Robert wanted to study whether the notion of "cultural universals" was a useful basis for developing lessons in the second grade in East Texas (as it had been in a Michigan classroom). In this article, the authors aim to describe how they went about this collaboration, to report their results, and to provide elementary teachers with instructional strategies for creating an interdisciplinary unit of study (involving social studies and language arts) on the topic of shelter.

AB  - Finding solutions to complex health problems, such as obesity, violence, and climate change, will require radical changes in cross-disciplinary education, research, and practice. The fundamental determinants of health include many interrelated factors such as poverty,  culture, education, environment, and government policies. However, traditional public health training has tended to focus more narrowly on diseases and risk factors, and has not adequately leveraged the rich contributions of sociology, anthropology, economics, geography, communication, political science, and other disciplines. Further, students are often not sufficiently trained to work across sectors to translate research findings into effective, large-scale sustainable actions. During the past 2 decades, national and international organizations have called for more effective interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary, and translational approaches to graduate education. Although it has been difficult to work across traditional academic boundaries, some promising  models draw on pedagogical theory and feature cross-disciplinary training focused on real-world problems, linkage between research, professional practice, community action, and cultivation of leadership skills. We describe the development the Doctor of Public Health program at the University of California, Berkeley, USA and its efforts to improve transdisciplinary and translational research education. We stress the need for international collaboration to improve educational approaches and better evaluate their impact.

AB  - A wide range of biotechnological and biomedical processes and products involves the design, synthesis, and analysis of biological interfaces. Such biointerfaces mediate interactions between living cells or intracellular species and designed materials or biologics. Incorporating the experiences of a NSF-­sponsored IGERT (Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship) program at Rutgers University (www.igert.rutgers.edu), this paper reviews the foundations and implementation of a graduate curriculum focused on biointerfaces. The curriculum is designed to build laterally beyond the current core curriculum of graduate engineering programs in chemical and biomolecular engineering or bioengineering, while accommodating cross-disciplinary graduate students from allied engineering programs as well as physical sciences and life sciences. The biointerfacial curriculum comprises three core courses: (1) Integrative Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, (2) Microscale and Nanoscale Biointerfacial Systems, and (3) Biointerfacial Characterization. By virtue of integrating principles based on phenomena that span multiple scales, compositions/components, and biological properties, this curriculum could impact graduate educational opportunities for researchers studying biomaterials, biomolecular science and engineering, tissue engineering, and nano­- and microsystems bioengineering.

AB  - The provision of choice making is frequently cited as an indicator of developmentally appropriate practice for young children with and without disabilities; however, there is little empirical evidence regarding the rate of delivery of choices within the preschool classroom. The delivery of intervention strategies by a classroom-based interdisciplinary team also is not well documented. This study provides a description of 804 observed choices provided to young children (2 and 3 years of age) in 2 inclusive preschool classrooms by interdisciplinary team members from the disciplines of education, speech and language pathology, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. Choices provided to children were analyzed by rate, type, presentation method, location in the classroom, and discipline of the staff member providing the choice. The discussion includes implications of the study for practice and future research.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe experiences with the initiation of transdisciplinarity in academic case study teaching with special reference to regional planning, based on the case study "Leben 2014 (Life 2014)--perspectives for regional development in the national park region Ober-pinz-gau, Salzburg". Design/methodology/approach: The methodology used, was the evaluation of process steps of the project, based on the general project concept, protocols and questionnaires. Findings: A key for successful transdisciplinary cooperation is the integration of non-academic actors at an early stage of the project. Important principles are the implementation of a structure of communication and networking in the case study region and the definition of rules of collaboration. The establishment of personal relations and network building is indispensable in order to guarantee a constant and broad exchange between all participants. Joint decision-making processes are essential for stable cooperation, which includes a joint problem definition process at the outset of the case-study phase as well as joint responsibility for decisions and joint ownership of ideas during and after the case-study phase. Practical implications: Transdisciplinarity in case-study teaching also requires thorough preparation of academics. A constant discussion of different approaches to inter- and transdisciplinarity, the adaptation of existing conceptual frameworks to the specific requirements of the current case, the building of a committed teaching team and joint teaching of classes are all important. The careful selection of students and their specific preparation with respect to methodology and content are prerequisites for a successful outcome of a transdisciplinary case study. Originality/value: The paper describes the experience of initiating transdisciplinarity in academic case study teaching. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - This article describes a method for attributing research expenditures directly to assigned space that avoids the difficulties with traditional approaches that have arisen from the growth of interdisciplinary research activities where the attribution of research to the faculty member or unit is not strongly correlated with the location where the research is performed. The emergence and growth of new transdisciplinary research activities that not only connect research from traditional disciplines but also form the unifying theme around which a whole new area may form depends in part on reducing traditional barriers to space allocation and encouraging the creative efforts of everyone contributing to meet research space needs. Projects may be distributed across several rooms, some of which are shared with other projects. We seek to attribute credit for such efforts using approximations from existing data to avoid exacerbating an already onerous data collection challenge. The pilot version and a second iteration of the project have been completed with worthwhile results. A new analysis is currently underway with further improved data collection, an enhanced database, and a more systematic process. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - Funded by innovative programs at the National Science Foundation and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Richmond faculty in biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and computer science teamed up to offer first- and second-year students the opportunity to contribute to vibrant, interdisciplinary research projects. The result was not only good science but also good science that motivated and informed course development. Here, we describe four recent undergraduate research projects involving students and faculty in biology, physics, mathematics, and computer science and how each contributed in significant ways to the conception and implementation of our new Integrated Quantitative Science course, a course for first-year students that integrates the material in the first course of the major in each of biology, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, and physics.

AB  - Information use patterns by doctoral students are studied for selected years in the pre-web (1990-1993) and post-web (2003-2006) time periods. Over 55,000 citations from dissertations in ten disciplines were analyzed. The results show that there was some increase in journal use in most of the disciplines in the post-web era, and that the use of monographs, dissertations, and technical reports declined over the period of the study.

AB  - Background: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability. Since the identification of the responsible gene ("FMR1") and its protein (FMRP), there has been enormous progress in both clinical and pathogenetic research on the neurobehavioural aspects of the condition. However, studies regarding other medical problems anticipated in individuals with FXS are limited. A multidisciplinary study evaluating various causes of morbidity in the same group has not been published yet. Methods: Twenty-four boys with FXS full mutation were recruited out of a larger group of 103 diagnosed in one centre over the past 10 years. Ear nose and throat, eye and cardiac examinations were performed in addition to routine cognitive, behavioural, neurological and speech and language assessments. Results: The average IQ score was 49.8 plus or minus 20 (range 25-90). There were four patients (18%) with IQ above 70. Using DSM-IV, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was diagnosed in five boys out of 22 examined (23%), while 32% were diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder. The seizure frequency was 17%. A psychiatric disorder was diagnosed in six out of eight boys with electroencephalogram abnormalities (75%). Minimal conductive hearing loss was found in five (522) patients. There was significant delay in both expressive and receptive language skills. Ocular findings were refractive errors (13%) and strabismus (4.4%). Mitral valve prolapsus (MVP) was observed in 322 (13.7%) patients and aortic annulus dilatation was present in 222 (9%) patients. Conclusions: Frequency of psychiatric diagnoses made with DSM-IV were in parallel to those reported in the literature. Comorbidity of seizures and psychiatric disorders was noteworthy. The percentage of high-functioning full mutation males supports the previous observations. Ear nose and throat and eye examination revealed remarkably lower prevalence of abnormal findings than reported. MVP was slightly less frequent compared with the single study in the literature. Age at the time of examination had an effect on the outcome of cardiac evaluation. These findings will guide us in future management of the group of patients followed in our institution. The protocol applied provides an applicable outline for multidisciplinary institutional settings dealing with individuals with FXS.

AB  - Information technology (IT) has the potential to improve the clinical learning environment. The extent to which IT enhances or detracts from healthcare professionals' role performance can be expected to affect both student learning and patient outcomes. This study evaluated nursing students' satisfaction with a novel compartmental Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS) for the automatic object-oriented integration and visualization of heterogeneous biomedical data. The compartmental PACS was specially designed to support client assessment and clinical education in the integrative health clinic of a university, which is run by a multidisciplinary service team. The sample was 63 nursing students, who were asked to complete a series of realistic tasks using the compartmental PACS. Upon completing the tasks, the Computer System Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ) was administered to assess their satisfaction with the system. Results from data analysis showed that nursing students who completed the evaluation had a satisfactory experience with the system. The Information Quality subscale mean was the highest mean of the CSUQ subscales. This is an important finding as the multidisciplinary data visualization feature of the system provides a technology-enhanced learning environment that can support nursing students' efforts to both organize and represent knowledge. Through the compartmental PACS, students are assisted in connecting relevant knowledge via various representations of medical data for the clinical conditions under study.

Transdisciplinarity means constituting disciplines less around a single core than around multiple knots in a netlike structure. Women's studies must trace the paths of these intersections, continually reflecting on artificially drawn and contingent boundaries and what they exclude. (SM)

AB  - This paper examines innovations in strategic faculty hiring emphasizing interdisciplinarity at two major public research universities in the USA. The research investigated how and why the Pennsylvania State University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison chose to pursue interdisciplinary faculty recruitment, how it was structured, and how it was intended to cause changes in academic work at each university. The paper analyzes how the interdisciplinary aims of those innovations intersected with competitive pressures, resource acquisition strategies, and organizational problems. Implications are discussed in the last section. (Contains 14 notes.)

AB  - In this article, the author discusses how it is time for higher education to think seriously about alternatives to the traditional undergraduate "major," which, in the large majority of cases, tends to be focused on just a single field of inquiry. The author observes that the current idea of a major (or minor) subject may have made more sense in a less complex and interconnected world in which the perspective and method of one discipline could be applied to a fairly confined and narrow problem. However, in today's world, few problems of any significance are either confined or narrow. In order to prepare students to have the skills in facing the outside world after they graduate, the author suggests adoption of problem-based learning. The author also presents six principles for the construction of a problem-based major or minor curriculum.

AB  - This article argues that certain philosophically devised quality control parameters should guide approaches to interdisciplinary education. We sketch the kind of reflections we think are necessary in order to produce epistemologically responsible curricula. We suggest that the two overarching epistemic dimensions of levels of analysis and basic viewpoints go a long way towards clarifying the structure of interdisciplinary validity claims. Through a discussion of how best to teach basic ideas about numeracy in Mind, Brain, and Education, we discuss what it means for an interdisciplinary curriculum to respect both the minds of students and the complexity of the subject matter.

AB  - The authors discuss the challenges of creating an integrated, interdisciplinary team-taught course. This case study focuses on conflict arising from interdependency, when interdisciplinary teams determine course content and negotiate identity, relationship, and process issues. Although no formulaic solutions can resolve such conflicts, the study makes suggestions that can help achieve integration and collaboration when disciplines join forces. (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - The University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) General Education "Clusters" are innovations in student-centered undergraduate education focused on complex phenomena that require an interdisciplinary perspective. UCLA gerontology and geriatric faculty recognized the opportunity to introduce freshmen to the field of aging through this new initiative. In 2000, with support of the College of Letters and Science, the School of Medicine Multicampus Program in Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology created "Frontiers in Human Aging: Biomedical, Social and Policy Perspectives." The active and cooperative student-centered teaching of aging that is integral to this course has successfully contributed to the development of intellectual skills needed for academic and life success in over 1,200 freshman honors students.

AB  - One of the important themes that emerged from the CAL'07 conference was the failure of technology to bring about the expected disruptive effect to learning and teaching. We identify one of the causes as an inherent weakness in prevalent development methodologies. While the problem of designing technology for learning is irreducibly multi-dimensional, design processes often lack true interdisciplinarity. To address this problem we present IDR, a participatory methodology for interdisciplinary techno-pedagogical design, drawing on the design patterns tradition [Alexander, C., Silverstein, M., & Ishikawa, S. (1977). "A pattern language: Towns, buildings, construction (Center for environmental structure series)." New York, NY: Oxford University Press] and the design research paradigm [DiSessa, A. A., & Cobb, P. (2004) Ontological innovation and the role of theory in design experiments. "Journal of the Learning Sciences, 13"(1), 77-103]. We discuss the iterative development and use of our methodology by a pan-European project team of educational researchers, software developers and teachers. We reflect on our experiences of the participatory nature of pattern design and discuss how, as a distributed team, we developed a set of over 120 design patterns, created using our freely available open source web toolkit. Furthermore, we detail how our methodology is applicable to the wider community through a workshop model, which has been run and iteratively refined at five major international conferences, involving over 200 participants.

AB  - Middle school students with insecure attachment histories present a particular challenge for school personnel. These students frequently cause behavioural disruptions and fail to academically engage in course content. This paper draws from attachment theory, as well as literature in the fields of education, neurobiology and psychology, to establish a theoretical framework for future research on teachers and attachment. The framework illustrates conceptual linkages between research from these academic disciplines to show that teachers can play a role in the rehabilitation of students' internal working models and attachment strategies, especially during this key developmental period.

AB  - As networked digital information proliferates and modern society's need to have access to information irrespective of location rises, the education needed for the digerati, defined loosely as the digital intelligentsia, the whole class of "expert" digital information professionals, becomes an important area about which all information professionals should stay informed. This paper describes the three concepts--interdisciplinarity, interactivity, and interoperability--that are an integral part of digital library research and their use in the curriculum development, teaching, and learning of a specific area of study within Library and Information Science (LIS), namely knowledge organization (KO). KO, studied intellectually, self-referentially, and immersively, it is argued, can provide the foundation for the modern digerati. (Contains 3 tables and 5 footnotes.)

AB  - We report on a two-year NSF-funded project to strengthen connections among science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. One component of this project was to produce some initial data on the effectiveness of Interdisciplinary Lively Applications Projects (ILAPs) in teaching science and engineering undergraduates. ILAPs are interdisciplinary group problem solving projects, co-written by mathematics faculty and science/technology/engineering faculty. These small group projects are designed to foster student interest by being lively, real world applications of mathematics in science and engineering. ILAPs are intended to assist students in learning to communicate across disciplines and in developing problem-solving skills. We summarize our development and use of ILAPs in the calculus courses and, in particular, describe our assessment data and results on the effectiveness of ILAPs in learning and related results.

AB  - Experience in the workplace represents a significant domain for the analysis of learning. Based on many years of research on high-school and college interns, the article proposes a set of interdisciplinary ideas and strategies for conducting such an analysis. The core argument is that learning is the construction, enhancement or reorganization of knowledge and knowledge-use in an activity system, and that it happens through an interactional process involving participants, their joint actions and their material and informational resources. Understanding learning as a situated process requires an investigation of the way activities are established, accomplished, and processed, and of the social, cultural, political, and technological factors that shape them. The analyst must examine the ways knowledge is defined, distributed and used in the setting; learning, or the ways that knowledge-use changes over time; and pedagogy, or the social organization of the process by which learning is made possible.

The data presented here highlight the challenge of such programs. I review the purpose, organization, and content of the interdisciplinary curriculum, noting those challenges that arise. Not only do such programs require collaboration among faculty who traditionally has been highly invested in their individual discipline or department, but they also require an active, deliberate process to foster interdisciplinary integration and student learning.

Often, a lot of effort is required to avoid pitfalls such as misunderstandings, judgemental discussions or just the inability to understand each other's professional, social or cultural way of thinking. This paper introduces the creative platform as a didactic approach for enabling a group to apply and share their knowledge without limitations coming from professional, social or cultural patterns of thinking and doing. In that sense, the creative platform is a mental meeting place where people with different professional, social and cultural backgrounds can meet and create new thoughts and actions together. The key in developing the creative platform as a learning environment is the use of 3D cases, which are learning exercises where the simultaneous use of brain, body and attitude constitutes a 3D access to learning. The core of a 3D case is an uncompromising use of three fundamental principles: parallel thinking, task focus and no judgement. At the end of the paper, we give examples of implementing the creative platform using 3D cases. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - Teacher Student relationship;This article examines the relationship between interdisciplinary curriculum and student outcomes. In this inquiry, the author uses data collected during a two-year ethnographic study of six courses in a general education reform at  Southwestern University (all names are pseudonyms), a research university with a diverse student population. It is a case study of a team-taught, interdisciplinary course, Movements of the 1960s, which examines the institutional context, the curriculum, and samples of student writing in order to address the question, "What is interdisciplinary curriculum in practice?" This question is informed by a sociocultural perspective of the curriculum (Erickson, 1986). What the author seeks to understand is the meaning that is produced in the day-to-day interactions among students, teacher, and knowledge. The faculty who designed Movements of the 1960s intended to provide breadth, depth, and synthesis. However, the outcomes differed significantly from the claims made by the reform proposal and those appearing in the literature on interdisciplinary curriculum. The author's argument is that the course's outcomes were the product of an institutional culture that privileges research over teaching.

AB  - Faculty have long incorporated students into interdisciplinary research projects to meet increasingly common demands for collaborative research by federal funding agencies. Despite the critical role of experiential learning in building student research skills and capacity, few have explored social interaction mechanisms used to facilitate student experiential learning in an interdisciplinary research team. Drawing upon the New Rural Economy project as a case study, interviews with 13 students from eight Canadian universities were conducted to explore these social interaction mechanisms. While findings revealed an array of social interaction mechanisms used to develop student learning networks, the quality of these mechanisms were mixed; thereby influencing the utilization of these networks for guidance and feedback. As faculty organize social interaction mechanisms, they should consider factors such as previous experience, student and faculty relationships, finances, language, gender, ethnicity, and other issues, that will have an impact on student engagement with experiential learning.

AB  - This study examines how adding strength-based data to traditional data for a student with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) impacts multidisciplinary team (MDT) members' perceptions. The participants received either a mock Traditional Report, which included only traditional data, or a mock Combined Report, which included traditional and strength-based data. They were asked to make predictions about educational placement and short- and long-term outcomes. Report type did not have an impact on educational placement or long-term outcomes. Respondents receiving the Combined Report predicted more positive academic, social, and overall outcomes than did respondents receiving the Traditional Report. Strength-based information may improve perceptions of short-term outcomes, which may have a role in cultivating a more positive educational environment for students with EBD. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework for integrating social responsibility within the accountability context now prevalent across the regular and special education contexts of Canadian and American schools while exposing readers to many of the different theories that exist concerning transdisciplinary forms of inclusive education. Design/methodology/approach: The author uses her experience as superintendent to create a system of inclusive and authentic collaboration amongst educators, parents, and specialists in the hope of creating a more complete plan for special education in her district. She introduces these collaborative teams to numerous various theoretical frameworks hoping to expand their views of what constitutes "acceptable" educational knowledge. Findings: Results from the full-scale implementation of the new transdisciplinary model indicate that emergent collaborative sensibilities among team members are beginning to characterize educational work which reflects a transition towards a more socially responsible learning community characterized by qualities of transparency, honesty, inclusivity, interdependence, respectful reciprocity, trust, and caring. Originality/value: The study furthers our understanding of special education programs and the different ways in which it is possible to improve the current special education system. The study introduces us to one specific study (related to special education and done by the author herself) while continuously relating that study to grounded and established educational and ethic-related theory.

AB  - Academics in higher education institutions are members of disciplinary communities by virtue of their qualifications and research activities, and as teachers of particular disciplines (or professions) they are (or need to become) members of a community of educational practitioners. In this paper, I analyse the ways in which a small group of lecturers in a professional engineering discipline negotiated their academic identities in the process of attaining a Masters degree in Engineering Education. A series of narrative interviews was used to track shifts in the lecturers' identity trajectories during the Masters programme. The findings indicate that academic identities, even within a single engineering discipline, are flexible, multi-layered, and susceptible to different degrees of change. Despite these differences, all participants experienced similar stages in the process of shifting from engineering to engineering educator identities. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)

AB  - A metaphor of "riding the wave" is used as a means of envisioning the future of sport and exercise psychology given what we know about past and present waves in the field. First, I review the waves of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s to understand critical issues in the field and to evaluate the waves as smooth, choppy, or turbulent today. Second, Christina's (1989) model that views basic and applied research as interdependent and reciprocal is used to situate sport and exercise psychology research. Third, discussion revolves around misperceptions of the term "applied sport psychology" as synonymous with performance enhancement, and a case is made for dropping the term "applied" to be more inclusive of all types of applied research that sport and exercise psychologists do. Fourth, integration among theory, research, and practice is featured as a central and recurring theme that must be sustained for the field to survive and thrive. Finally, I advocate for transforming sport and exercise psychology within an interdisciplinary vision over the coming years in an effort to elevate impact on scientific research and professional practice. This interdisciplinary vision, I believe, is the "wave of the future" for advancing knowledge, translating research to applications, and maximizing professional development of our students.

AB  - In this paper we describe an interdisciplinary course on dynamics that is appropriate for nonscience majors. This course introduces ideas about mathematical modeling using examples based on pendulums, chemical kinetics, and population dynamics. The unique emphasis for a nonmajors course is on chemical reactions as dynamical systems that do more than simply come to equilibrium. By presenting chemical systems that can undergo either periodic or chaotic behavior we provide the basis for understanding how chemistry can underlie complex natural systems. By describing these systems in the common language of dynamics in an interdisciplinary setting, we acquaint students with the motivations and methodologies behind the more mathematical aspects of chemistry. Students learn about the nature of measurement and prediction through the use of spreadsheet software for solution of equations and experimental data collection. (Contains 1 textbox and 3 lists.)
