AB  - Cognitive behavioral therapists may have a unique and growing role in orthopedics departments. In helping patients cope with pain, particularly where there is no specific biomedical treatment or cure, cognitive behavioral practitioners can help prevent, early on, the transition from an acute pain complaint to a costly, disabling, and interfering chronic pain syndrome (CPS; see Singh, M. K., Patel, J., & Galagher, R. (2005). "Chronic pain syndrome." "Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation." Retrieved April 25, 2008, from. http://www.emedicine.com/pmr/topic32.htm for a thorough description). Idiopathic hand and arm pain is a prevalent, costly, and distressing condition. It is defined as pain in the hand or arm that is vague, diffuse, with unclear pathology, or pain that is over and above what is expected based on an objective medical finding ([Ring, D., Katzielsky, J., Malhotra, L., Lee, S. G., & Jupiter, J. B. (2005). "Psychological factors associated with idiopathic arm pain." "Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery," 87, 374--380]). Diagnosing and treating pain in general is challenging, and it is particularly challenging when there is no clear objective pathology, as in idiopathic pain. Patients with vague, diffuse, nonspecific pain complaints often present to orthopedic departments in hope of pain relief or cure via surgical procedures, yet surgeons are poorly equipped to deal with situations where pure medical management is unwarranted. This may be detrimental to patient care and lead to chronic pain syndrome. This article reviews research and common clinical issues in patients with idiopathic hand and arm pain who present to orthopedic departments; presents a multidisciplinary team approach in coordinating and providing care for these patients; and describes two case examples of the use of cognitive and behavioral interventions as part of this team approach. Utilizing cognitive and behavioral approaches may be a way to increase the quality of life of patients presenting with idiopathic arm pain, prevent transition to chronic pain syndrome, and circumvent costly and largely ineffective surgical procedures.

AB  - The University of Texas at Austin has developed an upper-division undergraduate laboratory called "NANOLAB" to introduce undergraduate science and engineering students to nanoscale science and engineering (NSE) concepts. The NANOLAB is not a stand-alone course offered by a specific department, but rather a laboratory station--or hub--that interfaces with existing "traditional" laboratory courses across both the Colleges of Engineering and Natural Sciences. The chemical engineering department played a central role in developing the NANOLAB, which is designed to provide close to 1,000 undergraduate students per year with a hands-on introduction to NSE fundamentals.

AB  - The number of interdisciplinary, degree-granting fields in American colleges and universities has grown rapidly, with socially incorporative programs (women's studies, ethnic studies, and non-Western area studies) accounting for a large share. These fields have diffused widely over time, while other interdisciplinary fields have not. Variables based on ecological features of academic organizations provide a better guide to the location of interdisciplinary fields than variables based on student demographic composition or organizational stratification. Most studies of interdisciplinary change have focused on external resource providers and new technology development, but this study suggests that social movements are another important source.

AB  - In the summer of 2007, the authors had the opportunity to lead a group of Hofstra University students, pre- and inservice, undergraduate and graduate, elementary and art teachers, to Sorrento, Italy, for interdisciplinary courses in both literacy and art education. The culminating project, a shadow theater play and performance, brought together students from both courses. The teachers assumed a dual existence during the course: They learned to think like teachers of the arts and, as proxies for their students, they experienced learning as a student does. Although taught in an inspirational venue, in Sorrento across from Mt. Vesuvius, this interdisciplinary project is easily adaptable to more prosaic settings (say, an elementary school classroom). The art and literacy components of this project highlight many key elements of successful interdisciplinary curriculum development. It makes sense to integrate art, specifically puppetry, and literacy, as knowledge gained in art strengthens the understanding of concepts that are not only related, but also important to literacy. The puppetry project described in this article is a part of an ancient art form called shadow theater. This type of puppetry, which integrates drama, art, music, and movement, offers rich multicultural teaching opportunities. Students are further engaged in their own magical performance of puppets, which come to life as they are illuminated from behind a screen. Folktales conveyed by the mysterious art form of shadow theater tell the history of humankind. (Contains 5 online resources.)

AB  - Despite widespread support for interdisciplinary curricula, there is little evidence that such courses are particularly efficacious or that they are superior to disciplinary courses in promoting student learning. To understand how and why interdisciplinary courses might promote specific learning outcomes, the authors apply cognitive and learning theories in an analysis of two undergraduate interdisciplinary courses. This exploration of theoretical warrants for interdisciplinarity leads to a proposed research agenda on interdisciplinary curricula, teaching, and learning.

AB  - This paper focuses on the scholarship of integration in the field of education and argues that although it has gradually been moving into the mainstream of educational research, it is all too often judged on the basis of criteria more applicable to assess the scholarship of discovery. First, I examine the questions: what constitutes original research in education and what makes the scholarship of integration "original". I assert that the reluctance on the part of many educators to consider integrative scholarship as original research is in part a result of the prevailing conception of originality that is too limiting and often not relevant to evaluate this form of scholarship. Such a conception is incompatible with the valuable lessons that constructivism has taught us about knowledge and learning. Finally, I propose a number of criteria to evaluate integrative research studies, ones which are different from those that apply to other forms of scholarship.

AB  - This study describes how a physical education teacher collaborated with a second-grade teacher to plan and implement an interdisciplinary unit, and it identifies factors that contributed to the teachers' actual collaboration. One accomplished elementary physical education teacher, one experienced second-grade classroom teacher, and 35 students from two second-grade classes voluntarily participated in this study. The data were collected by audiotaping the two planning sessions, videotaping eight integrated lessons taught by the physical education teacher and three integrated lessons taught by the classroom teacher, transcribing the taped lessons, and interviewing the teachers. The findings indicated that the teachers' collaborative planning focused on providing students with integrated and relevant learning experiences. Throughout the collaboration, the two teachers shared leadership roles and teaching responsibilities. The teachers attributed their effective interdisciplinary teaching to their long-term collaborative working experiences, common teaching philosophy, and mutual respect and trust.

AB  - This article addresses the interrelated questions of why it is important to teach students about the nature of interdisciplinarity and how this material might be best communicated to students. It is important to define for students what is meant by disciplines and interdisciplinarity. Having distinguished interdisciplinarity from the disciplinary approach, the advantages and disadvantages of each can be discussed. It is useful to discuss the history of both disciplines and interdisciplinarity. It is also useful to discuss the complex relationship between interdisciplinarity and other intellectual currents: postmodernism, unity of science, complexity analysis, feminism, and others. Critically, students should be guided as to how interdisciplinary research might be best performed. Some potential objections to teaching interdisciplinary research practice are addressed.

AB  - The belief that students can make valuable contributions to course design through continuous feedback leads to the consideration of alternative methods of learning that involve students in this process and inspire the development of a new relationship: student-teacher partnership in course evaluation and revision. In this partnership, students provide continuous oral and written feedback to the teacher who is interested in revising the course content and methodology in response to students' views. This article discuses the rationale, procedures, techniques, and findings of a case study carried out in the freshman English program of an English medium university in Ankara, Turkey. In this study, the students and  teacher evaluated and revised a multidisciplinary sustained-content English language course. The results show that student-teacher partnership model led to better meeting the students' needs, wants, and interests, and improved the communication between the students and the teacher.

AB  - This article discusses continuing education and the implementation of clinical practice guidelines or best evidence, quality improvement, and patient safety. Continuing education focuses on the perspective of the adult learner and is guided by well-established educational principles. In contrast, guideline implementation and related concepts borrow from the fields of quality improvement and patient safety and from health services research. Relative to the question of improved clinical outcomes, both to some extent afford only partial understanding of a complex issue. Knowledge translation (KT) is a transformative concept that links the best elements of both broad fields and, in particular, adds educational elements to the work of health services researchers and others. Interdisciplinary in the extreme, KT is explored in some detail: its major elements (information, facilitation, context, the clinician-learner, among others) considered as variables in an equation leading to knowledge uptake and improved health care outcomes and an improved functioning health care system.

AB  - Entrepreneurship programs and courses are offered by many business schools to support students who aspire to start, own, and operate businesses. Although these offerings are directed primarily toward business majors, based on data the authors collected from over 700 students, many nonbusiness majors also possess entrepreneurial characteristics and perceive the need for entrepreneurship curricula. The findings suggest that although business majors regard their traditional education as adequate preparation to start a new business, the greatest need for entrepreneurship courses and curricula exists within academic disciplines outside of the business school.

AB  - Resources for interdisciplinary studies (IDS) appear in a multitude of print publications, online forums, and the "fugitive" or "gray" literature of conference papers, reports, and curriculum materials. The quantity is not surprising, since interdisciplinary discussions have expanded as new fields and approaches emerged across all domains of research and education. This review is aimed at helping faculty, curriculum committees, and administrators find resources for course design and teaching, with emphasis on works that have appeared in the past 10 years. Part I defines a basic collection of materials; Part II deepens the search for more specialized resources; and Part III highlights important new print and Web-based material with an emphasis on the past five years.

AB  - There has been much research that has identified an increased prevalence of Dementia in adults with Down's syndrome when compared with the general population. Neuropathological changes associated with Alzheimer's dementia in the brain have been found in most people with Down's syndrome who die over the age of 35 years. Given the limitations of many assessments for dementia in relation to people with Down's syndrome for a single completion, it has been recommended that all people with Down's syndrome are assessed at least once in early adulthood in order that they have their own baseline which can be compared with in the future if changes in skills and abilities occur. The authors have had many requests from other services enquiring about this project and how a similar initiative could be set up in their area which is what has led us to write this article. Therefore, this article focuses on the way the Manchester Learning Disability Partnership approached screening 135 adults with Down's syndrome and details the assessments used, practical considerations, what has been learned and future service implications.

AB  - A framework of operating models for interdisciplinary research programs in clinical service organizations is presented, consisting of a "clinician-researcher" skill development model, a program evaluation model, a researcher-led knowledge generation model, and a knowledge conduit model. Together, these models comprise a tailored, collaborative approach to enhancing research-informed practice in community-based clinical service organizations. The models place different degrees of emphasis on the development of research-related skills in practitioners, the generation of knowledge tailored to clinical practice, and knowledge sharing. The nature, philosophical basis, roles of research staff members, outputs and impacts, and strengths and limitations of each model are described, in the context of a long-standing, interdisciplinary research program in a children's rehabilitation service organization. The use of the model framework as a tool for the design of interdisciplinary, community-based research programs is discussed. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)

AB  - Marking major changes in professional role performance, response to intervention (RTI) is now in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, 2004) as a possible method to improve the identification of specific learning disabilities. Moreover, RTI and related concepts and initiatives have fundamentally influenced more general methods of prevention, instruction and intervention services, and decision making in schools. Although RTI will continue to evolve, core characteristics of RTI that form the basis of state initiatives are well founded in intervention and instructional research and practice. These core characteristics (i.e., data-based decision making, evidence-based intervention, teaming, and problem solving) represent skills immediately needed by professionals-in-training. This article reports collaboration between school psychology and special education faculty in designing and implementing an integrative field experience in RTI. Training, student, and program outcomes are used summatively for accountability. (Contains 3 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - The author reports on various aspects of teaching economics in an interdisciplinary, team-taught course, including reflections on a unique experiment in teaching economics to nonmajors. By the incorporation of selected topics of gender economics into the interdisciplinary course about the changing economic statuses of women throughout history, the students are introduced to the fundamentals of economic thinking and encouraged to become economically literate. Faced with the constraints of no prerequisites and the presence of two instructors at all classes, the author implements pedagogical models of teaching adopted from the education field to achieve a desirable level of comprehension and integration. The author outlines the course design, the challenges, and suggestions about how to improve the course. (Contains 5 notes.)

AB  - As the world has grown more interconnected, many political science programs have added courses on international law, international organizations, the laws of war and peace, international human rights, and comparative judicial politics. While in many cases these are relatively new offerings within international studies, all of these subjects have long been part of the law school curriculum. There is, therefore, a long pedagogical history to be examined in terms of the techniques and content used in law schools to teach these courses. This paper examines a number of these techniques and discusses how they may be used in political science courses to enhance student learning opportunities.

AB  - Logic models are based on linear relationships between program resources, activities, and outcomes, and have been used widely to support both program development and evaluation. While useful in describing some programs, the linear nature of the logic model makes it difficult to capture the complex relationships within larger, multifaceted programs. Causal loop diagrams based on a systems thinking approach can better capture a multidimensional, layered program model while providing a more complete understanding of the relationship between program elements, which enables evaluators to examine influences and dependencies between and within program components. Few studies describe how to conceptualize and apply systems models for educational program evaluation. The goal of this paper is to use our NSF-funded, Interdisciplinary GK-12 project: Bringing Authentic Problem Solving in STEM to Rural Middle Schools to illustrate a systems thinking approach to model a complex educational program to aid in evaluation. GK-12 pairs eight teachers with eight STEM doctoral fellows per program year to implement curricula in middle schools. We demonstrate how systems thinking provides added value by modeling the participant groups, instruments, outcomes, and other factors in ways that enhance the interpretation of quantitative and qualitative data. Limitations of the model include added complexity. Implications include better understanding of interactions and outcomes and analyses reflecting interacting or conflicting variables.

AB  - Objectives: The University of Iowa Child Protection Program collaborated with Turkish professionals to develop a training program on child abuse and neglect during 2002-2006 with the goals of increasing professional awareness and number of multidisciplinary teams (MDT), regional collaborations, and assessed cases. This paper summarizes the 5-year outcome. Methods: A team of instructors evaluated needs and held training activities in Turkey annually, and provided consultation when needed. Descriptive analysis was done via Excel and SPSS software. Results: Eighteen training activities were held with 3,570 attendees. Over the study period, the number of MDTs increased from 4 to 14. The MDTs got involved in organizing training activities in their institutions and communities. The number of medical curriculum lectures taught by MDTs to medical students/residents, conferences organized by the MDTs, and lectures to non-medical professional audiences increased significantly (R[superscript 2]=91.4%, 83.8%, and 69.2%, respectively). The number of abuse cases assessed by the MDTs increased by five times compared to pre-training period. Conclusions: A culturally competent training program had a positive impact on professional attitudes and behaviors toward recognition and management of child abuse and neglect in Turkey. The need to partner with policy makers to revise current law in favor of a greater human services orientation became clear. Practice implications: Pioneers in developing countries may benefit from collaborating with culturally competent instructors from countries with more developed child protection systems to develop training programs so that professional development can improve recognition and management of child abuse and neglect.

Found that perceptions of community are synonymous with friendship, involvement, cohesion, communication, and trust. These feelings were affected more by campus location, program area, and credits earned than by age, race, or sex. Students value this as part of their professionalization process. (EV)

AB  - This article presents an overview of measuring science based on a bibliometric methodology. The 2 main lines of this methodology are discussed. First, the measurement of research performance is addressed, including aspects such as interdisciplinarity, collaboration, and knowledge users. It is demonstrated that advanced bibliometric methods are an indispensable element next to peer review in research evaluation procedures, particularly at the level of research groups, university departments, and institutes. Problems involved in the application of bibliometric analysis in the social sciences are discussed. Next, an introduction to the mapping of science is presented, focusing on basic concepts and issues of practical application of science maps. These maps are unique instruments to discover patterns in the structure of scientific fields, to identify processes of knowledge dissemination, and to visualize the dynamics of scientific developments. Their potential for unraveling interdisciplinary developments and interfaces between science and technology is discussed. The article concludes with an indication of the limitations and possible problems of bibliometric analysis. (Contains 3 figures, 1 table and 5 footnotes.)

AB  - This article presents the author's critique of "Measurement of Central Aspects of Scientific Research: Performance, Interdisciplinarity, Structure," by Anthony F. J. van Raan. The author states that van Raan's article provides an excellent, if tightly compressed, introduction to key findings and innovative methods of the accumulating and impressive body of work van Raan and his collaborators at Leiden University's Centre for Science and Technology Studies have been conducting. The larger body of work, as listed in the extensive references--itself a valuable contribution to those who are users rather than contributors to the bibliometric literature--provides important, empirically well-grounded insights into the dynamics of science and new, administratively tantalizing means of evaluating the performance of research organizations. An unbundling of the article, and obviously of the more extensive treatments of methodologies, data sets, findings, and policy implications on which it is based, leads in several directions. The author states that van Raan's article embodies the longstanding dualism found in the origins of bibliometrics. Methodologically, among its descriptions of several innovative "advanced bibliometric methods," the author highlights the article's account of the mapping of the structure of interdisciplinary research on the basis of "coconcept analysis." This technique extends the construction of scientific networks through the use of cocitation analysis by mapping "the organization of science according to concept." The author notes that changes in the structure of maps may be used to indicate the impact of Research and Development programs. Finally, Feller states that perhaps the most striking (and confirmatory) statement in the article is van Raan's observation that bibliometrics is least useful in measuring the performance of individual researchers, especially those in the social sciences.

AB  - Objective: To determine how often and for what reasons a hospital-based multidisciplinary child abuse team concluded that a report of alleged or suspected child abuse was unnecessary in young children with fractures. Methods: A retrospective review was completed of all children less than 12 months of age who, because of fractures, were referred to the hospital multidisciplinary child abuse team for consultation regarding the need to consider child abuse. Results: The team received 99 consultations, reported 92 (93%) children as alleged or possible victims of physical abuse, and did not report 7 (7%). Age at presentation of those who were reported was 4.2 months compared to 3.0 months in the non-reported group. The average number of fractures in the reported group was 2.9 (SD 3.53) compared to 3.4 (SD 4.6) in the non-reported group. Factors that led to cases not being reported included: (a) a trauma history consistent with the fracture (n=4), (b) a diagnosis of bone fragility secondary to genetic, nutritional or medical therapy etiologies (n=2), and (c) iatrogenic fracture (n=1). Conclusions: Seven percent of the children less than 12 months of age and with at least one fracture referred to the multidisciplinary team for evaluation of possible child abuse were not reported as alleged or suspected physical abuse. The involvement of the hospital multidisciplinary child abuse team may have prevented unnecessary investigation by the county social services agency and/or police, and possible out-of-home temporary placement.

AB  - This article addresses multi-disciplinary writing groups in supporting writing for publication for higher degree by research candidates in the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences. Drawing on focus group discussions with postgraduate research students from the Faculty of Arts at Monash University in Australia who participated in the writing groups, it investigates the participants' perceptions of the multi-disciplinary nature of the groups and some of the benefits of sharing writing with fellow postgraduate research students from different fields of study. Discussing both the strengths and weaknesses of the multi-disciplinarity of the groups as identified by participants, the authors suggest that such groups can provide a forum for postgraduates to develop their "professional" academic identity and develop their writing beyond the context of their theses and can have some unexpected benefits to participants' sense of themselves as disciplinary proponents. The multi-disciplinary context is thus considered as providing a level playing field in which postgraduates may approach the writing process as a shared methodology, encompassing a suite of specialised but generic skills that cross-disciplinary boundaries.

AB  - Modern society is characterized by complexity, uncertainty and fuzziness, and people need to re-examine their strategies as well as their way of thinking as a whole in order to cope with the problems that emerge. This project attempts to reinforce syneducational transactions among people (students, parents, educators, policy makers) who are interested in educational issues and are actively involved in them. Its aim is to actively support the implementation of a transdisciplinary program (SYNTHESIS) from a "mutual mentoring" perspective in an interactive learning environment. Within this framework we can develop the timeless principles of Socratic dialogue together with the modern concepts related to systems theory and knowledge management. A certain research model is suggested for the implementation of the above as well as a protocol for the overall evaluation of the program. (Contain 4 tables, 4 figures and 17 notes.)

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims at presenting the theoretical concepts of the transdisciplinary case study approach (TCS), which is a research and teaching approach developed and elaborated at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), as a means of transition support. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reveals the historical roots of case studies, transdisciplinarity and sustainable development as teaching and research paradigms. The TCS approach is presented, which has been developed at ETH for supporting transition management of regional, urban, and organizational systems. This approach is entrenched by an ontology that reveals the basic characteristics of ill-defined transition problems, an epistemology that refers to Probabilistic Functionalism and distinguishes between multi-layered systemic and normative epistemics, a methodology that includes a set of methods for case representation (including modelling and projection), assessment, and strategy building, and a project management model that refers to more than a dozen TCSs in the field of sustainable development. Problems of validity of TCSs as a research methodology are discussed. Findings: Three major strengths of the TCS approach presented in the paper are: that it is based on three sound paradigms, which focus on different, relevant characteristics of complex, human-environment systems; i.e. the case study approach, transdisciplinarity and sustainable development, that it is strictly organized according to an elaborated and consistent theoretical framework that includes ontological, epistemological, methodological, and organizational considerations, and that it is itself subject to an ongoing inquiry and adaptation process. All theoretical considerations of the paper are clarified be elaborated examples from the more than 10 years experience with TCS of the authors. Practical implications: The paper gives a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundation of TCS that might assist other scientists engaged in case study research and teaching to further develop their approaches. Additionally, relevant topics for further research in the field of TCS are presented which hopefully induce an inspiring discussion among case study researchers. Originality/value: As far we know, this paper is one of the first that presents a comprehensive and theoretically sound overview of applying transdisciplinary case studies as means of sustainability learning. Thus, it can be seen as a first, crucial step for establishing the new research field of TCS research and a sound research community of complex, transdisciplinary problem solving towards sustainability learning.

AB  - This article focuses on the design and implementation of an interdisciplinary geriatric educational project at a small New England University. A novel, affective teaching approach of Readers Theater is highlighted as a beginning classroom instructional strategy for interdisciplinary students. The physical and psychosocial considerations for health are complex with geriatric clients, and the successful construction of intervention plans is enhanced through an interdisciplinary approach. This pedagogical technique served as an effective method to initially engage health profession students, promote interprofessional collaboration, and support the creation of a compassionate, holistic approach to the care of elders.

AB  - The study reported in this paper has explored the use of an electronic forum facility in order to provide support for problem-based learning (PBL). A Web-based course involving the use of PBL (called "Drug and Nutrient Interactions") was implemented and was augmented with interdisciplinary expert support using electronic forums. As part of their PBL experiences, students interacted with their peers, the teacher, the facilitator and experts (a dietician, a doctor, and a librarian) in order to enhance their knowledge and complete a group project. Students' online interactions and their written reflections were used to identify the types of online support which contributed to self-directed, Web-based learning in a PBL context. The study concluded that both "cognitive support" (guidance, clarification, suggestion, inquiry, information) and "affective support" (comment, confirmation, reminding and encouragement) are needed in order to facilitate the process of learning. Overall, students were positive about this approach. (Contains 1 figure and 7 tables.)

AB  - We sought to examine the growth of an interdisciplinary center using social network analysis techniques. Specific aims were to examine the patterns of growth and interdisciplinary connectedness of the Center and to identify the social network characteristics of its productive members. The setting for this study was The Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (CIRAR) at Columbia University. Periodic surveys and social network analysis comprised the study design. The data for this study included a relational survey taken by all members of the Center at three time points over one year. Respondents confirmed whether or not they had "heard of," "met," or "know the work of," or had "worked with" each of the other Center members. Data were analyzed using the social networking software program Organizational Risk Analyzer (ORA). Over time the social network increased in size, density, centralization, and complexity. The density of connections among and between different disciplines in the Center varied from Time 1 to 2 to 3; some increased, some decreased, while others stayed the same. Finally, the total degree centrality and the betweeness centrality of Center members were highly correlated to productivity. The study shows that a number of characteristics of an interdisciplinary research center can be quantified and described using social network techniques. Data from these analyses can be used to evaluate a center's progress, identify important indicators of leadership, identify areas of strength and need for improvement, and inform decisions on strategic direction.

AB  - Children's literature can play a significant role in integrating math and science concepts into real-world applications. One particularly delightful selection is "Cucumber Soup" (Krudwig, 1998). This book can create a context--making cucumber soup--for weighing and for a real-life on adding fractions. This kind of learning context takes children away from viewing math and science as rules and formulas, and encourages them to explore ideas in a more natural and informal manner that will help them discover connections and interrelationships among content and concepts. This article describes the use of "Cucumber Soup" as a powerful tool for teachers at the elementary level to engage students in actively doing math and science, and in investigating and exploring measurement and number concepts.

AB  - This paper presents results from a July 2005 workshop and course aimed at developing an interdisciplinary course on modeling aquatic ecosystems that will provide the next generation of practitioners with critical skills for which formal training is presently lacking. Five different course models were evaluated: (1) fundamentals/general principles of interdisciplinary modeling; (2) modular course; (3) survey of various interdisciplinary models; (4) seminar series of case studies; and (5) the art of modeling. Options 1 and 2 were most popular among workshop participants, while option 4 was the least popular. (Contains 2 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - Manufacturing engineering provides a relevant context from which to envision interdisciplinary learning experiences because engineers integrate their knowledge and skills of manufacturing and algebra processes in order to plan the efficient manufacture of products. In this article, the author describes an interdisciplinary learning activity that was originally implemented as a Tech Prep project at Norview High School, Norfolk, Virginia. The project occurred over three days within 1 1/2-hour blocks; total activity time was 4 1/2 hours. This cooperative learning project required students enrolled in Manufacturing Technology and Algebra I to share their technical and mathematical expertise for the purpose of demonstrating how this knowledge and skill applies in real-world contexts.

AB  - Computer games are increasingly being considered as a means of promoting learning, especially the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) games in the classroom. This article extends this idea by proposing an innovative method of fostering interdisciplinary collaboration through the design of computer games. The game to be developed, "On the Case," is based on William Gibson's seminal "Neuromancer," and will be used to augment and enhance the learning experiences of literary studies students studying this text. However, these users will also assist in the design process before a prototype version of the game is developed by peers on game-design degree programmes. The article offers an overview of the design considerations behind the game, primarily in terms of the intellectual engagement such a game will promote, the learning it is designed to foster, and the mechanisms--game-play, environment, and learning design--through which it will do so.

AB  - Game theory has been one of the most prominent theories in the social sciences, influencing diverse academic disciplines such as anthropology, biology, economics, and political science. In recent years, economists have employed game theory to investigate behaviors relating to fairness, reciprocity, and trust. Surprisingly, this research has not found much resonance in psychological research on social development, even though the two disciplines share a common interest in explaining similar social behaviors and phenomena. We argue that combining economic game theory with developmental psychology can prove to be valuable for both disciplines: developmental psychology can contribute its knowledge about the ontogenesis of social abilities and competencies to economic research, thus providing economists with new theories and understanding. Game theory, on the other hand, can offer developmental psychologists new methodologies and tools for investigating social development.

AB  - Interdisciplinary teaming has been described as the pivotal component of blended, interdisciplinary teacher preparation for early childhood. A survey was conducted as a second national examination of the practices of faculty teams in blended teacher preparation programs. A time intensive search using diverse mechanisms and sources led to the nomination of 55 potential participant programs. A final pool of 24 teacher education programs in 12 states met a specific definition for the blended approach to teacher preparation. Programs had been in operation from 1 to 12 years. Results revealed that characteristics and practices of teams have remained consistent over the last 6 years and, thus, can be described as current practice. Findings supported conclusions that frequency of team meetings is related to effectiveness and to interpersonal relationships among team members. Results confirmed that barriers to interdisciplinary teaming in higher education are related primarily to the culture of the workplace. Major findings were instrumental in constructing a set of recommendations for interdisciplinary teaming that address significant barriers. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - There has been a great deal of discussion about the need for interdisciplinary, applied research to service the needs of the knowledge economy and to solve the broader complex theoretical problems of the twenty-first century. This is known as "Mode 2" knowledge production. Yet, university research higher degree programs continue to be largely disciplinary-based. While there has been a rise in the number of research students working on industry-related, applied projects, very few research students gain exposure to interdisciplinary research processes. This paper explores several examples of interdisciplinary doctoral programs based in North America and Australia and seeks to draw upon examples of undergraduate interdisciplinary learning and epistemology. In reviewing this theoretical work and a number of strategies implemented at an Australian university, the paper begins to imagine an interdisciplinary doctoral pedagogy.

AB  - This article analyses interim findings of an ongoing action research project into the use of assessment criteria and grade descriptors in the assessment process. The project is multidisciplinary and covers areas as diverse as Sports Sociology, Economics, Youth and Community Studies, and Education. The idea is to equip first-year students with the tools necessary for raising achievement and for matching their own aspirations with what is expected of them in higher education. This is seen as particularly important with widening access attracting a higher proportion of non-traditional entrants with little exposure to higher education. Assimilation into higher education culture is often a fraught encounter and research (Yorke 2001; Yorke and Thomas 2003) suggests that induction into the requirements of individual subjects, curriculum innovation and the integration of academic skills can aid retention. The project offers a variety of methodologies emphasizing the "situated" nature of academic literacy. The immediate benefits from the pilot study of Sports Studies students have already been demonstrated (Bloxham and West 2004) and the longitudinal research now being undertaken will indicate whether the type of intervention discussed below can have lasting effects.

AB  - This article considers developments and directions for environmental gerontology drawing on the three papers in this Forum. The multidisciplinary field came of age during the 1960s with Powell Lawton's powerful environmental press paradigm and its applications to empirical research and building design. Recent theoretical developments in Europe and America have advanced and integrated concepts in psychology, geography, and related disciplines. Time dimensions and active use of space are essential for understanding aging individuals and microenvironments as well as changing populations and macroenvironments. Research on residential environments by health professions is informing community care that is enhancing the independence and well-being of older people. With its proven responsiveness to social and policy priorities, environmental gerontology is now providing strong conceptual and empirical bases for advancing healthy aging and age-friendly societies.

AB  - With focus on interdisciplinary education models, social work and physical therapy faculty from two proximate universities partnered to create an evidence-based geriatric assessment and brief intervention research, training, and service project for community-dwelling older adults. Assessment tools and interventions were selected from the literature to develop the service protocols. These selected protocol skills were taught to interdisciplinary teams of students and professionals in social work and physical therapy, and learning outcomes were evaluated. This article describes the process of implementing this innovative multipartner project, the obstacles faced, and lessons learned. Adult learning theory and social cognitive theory served to underpin the project. The objectives were achieved, and evaluation noted many positive experiences in training and service delivery. This multipartner, interdisciplinary project concept can be replicated to improve educational outcomes for students and professionals as they prepare and learn to serve community-dwelling older adults.

AB  - An interdisciplinary, semester-long project is presented in which students grow Cucumis sativus (cucumber) plants from seeds and study the ability of the plants to remediate a heavy metal from contaminated soil or water or both. Phytoremediation strategies for environmental cleanup are presented as possible alternatives to chemical based clean-up methods. The project is presented to the students as a general topic, and the students or instructor can choose which experimental variables to study. The results of the projects presented here focused on the remediation of Cr(III) from aqueous media and Cr(II), Cr(III), and Cr(VI) from contaminated soil. This project introduces students to the concepts of phytoremediation, the use of atomic absorption spectroscopy for the analysis of metals ions, and research methodology. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - Bridging disciplines have much to teach regarding how to combine analytical tools to tackle problems and questions that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries. This article explores interdisciplinary aspects of two long established bridging disciplines--geography and anthropology--in order to consider what the relatively young undertaking labeled "interdisciplinary studies" can learn from their long existence. It considers the fallacy of nomothetic claim as well as the fruitful production of solutions by viewing process (methodology), not domain (academic turf), as the key to interdisciplinary success. Staking claim to interdisciplinarity is shown to be unproductive while finding the need for  interdisciplinary approaches and following the mandates of that need strengthens both the disciplines and interdisciplinary studies.

AB  - In this action research study, 24 preservice middle level educators participated in simulated interdisciplinary teams for a semester. The impact this authentic pedagogy had on preservice teachers' developing knowledge of middle school teaming is documented through student artifacts (e.g., journals, assignments), tape-recorded interviews, and field notes. The data were analyzed using techniques from grounded theory and constant comparative methods. Findings indicated that preservice teachers (a) built cohesiveness and community, (b) developed skills necessary for working on effective teams, and (c) recognized and valued the authenticity of the experience. The study offers a number of implications for middle level educators. First, virtual teaming created an authentic non-clinical setting for preservice teachers to take risks, learn about themselves, and explore middle level organizational principles. Second, time taken to build community in the class was invaluable, allowing teams to overcome conflicts, trust one another, and enhance learning.

AB  - The author presents a content integration that focuses on social studies and science knowledge and skills. The idea of using folk crafts to help elementary students learn social studies extends from John Dewey's laboratory school to the twenty-first century. Meaningful content is applied to skills, such as blacksmithing, found in the community, and students make connections between school knowledge and their lives outside of school. In this activity, blacksmithing helped students integrate ideas from multiple academic subjects, incorporating content from the social sciences and humanities. The guest content expert with a specialized knowledge base played a large role in making this experience occur for the students and teachers. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - Background: A prosthetic approach to velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) is not new. However, a collaborative interdisciplinary team approach by a speech-and-language therapist, dental specialist and maxillofacial technician, including accurate fitting using nasendoscopy, has provided an opportunity to define the clinical care pathway, and audit the outcomes of this intervention. Systematic outcome studies of the effectiveness of prosthetic appliances are few and largely anecdotal. Aims: The aim is twofold: first, to provide a description of the process including diagnosis, clinical and technical fabrication; and second, to determine the effectiveness of this intervention with nasendoscopy, objective blind perceptual analysis of speech data and nasometry. Methods & Procedures: The selection criteria, age, aetiology and process of fabrication are described. Thirty-one patients embarked on the programme, but seven patients after initial failure or refusal were re-entered into the programme for a second time resulting in 38 interventions. At the time of audit, 20 patients had completed the treatment, but four of these were inadequately documented. This study reports on the 16 patients who successfully completed the programme and who had comprehensive records. Outcomes & Results: Significant differences were found between the pre- and post-treatment evaluations on the speech parameters of hypernasality, audible nasal emission and nasometry. Conclusions: In our centre surgery is the first choice of treatment for VPD, but prosthetic management can be a useful alternative when this is contraindicated, can be a useful temporary solution and can be used to evaluate the potential benefits of surgical intervention in some cases. This treatment requires the combined expertise of an interdisciplinary team involving the speech-and-language therapist, orthodontist/prosthodontist, maxillofacial technician and endoscopist.

AB  - Problematic school absenteeism in youth has long been a complex and vexatious issue for psychologists, educators, and researchers from other disciplines. An examination of problematic school absenteeism from different perspectives over many decades has led to poor comparability across publications, policies, and assessment and intervention protocols. This article briefly reviews literature from psychology, social/criminal justice, and education to outline important factors that influence school absenteeism. An interdisciplinary model is then proposed with an emphasis on common terminology and definitions, comprehensiveness with respect to proximal and distal influences, fluidity and flexibility to account for rapid changes in this population, and user-friendliness to generate suggestions regarding assessment and intervention. Implications of the model are then drawn for professional practice and public policy, including recommendations for individual and systemic intervention at multiple levels of risk and severity.

AB  - Physiology as a discipline is uniquely positioned to engage undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research in response to the 2006-2011 National Science Foundation Strategic Plan call for innovative transformational research, which emphasizes multidisciplinary projects. To prepare undergraduates for careers that cross disciplinary boundaries, students need to practice interdisciplinary communication in academic programs that connect students in diverse disciplines. This report surveys policy documents relevant to this emphasis on interdisciplinary training and suggests a changing role for physiology courses in bioscience and engineering programs. A role for a physiology course is increasingly recommended for engineering programs, but the study of physiology from an engineering perspective might differ from the study of physiology as a basic science. Indeed, physiology laboratory courses provide an arena where biomedical engineering and bioscience students can apply knowledge from both fields while cooperating in multidisciplinary teams under specified technical constraints. Because different problem-solving approaches are used by students of engineering and bioscience, instructional innovations are needed to break down stereotypes between the disciplines and create an educational environment where interdisciplinary teamwork is used to bridge differences.

AB  - The recent focus on joint training programmes to support the development of interagency/interdisciplinary collaboration places considerable emphasis on interprofessional education at undergraduate and postgraduate level. It is therefore important to ensure that interprofessional learning is embedded in Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and that professionals across health and education who work together to support children with communication problems can develop a better understanding and appreciation of each other's roles (Wright et al., 2004). This paper presents the findings from a study of interdisciplinary training for early years practitioners aimed at improving identification, understanding and practical support for children at risk of language and literacy difficulties (Wood, Wright and Stackhouse, 2000). Specific activities designed to facilitate interdisciplinary learning are presented and what the practitioners on the courses took away in terms of knowledge, skills and attitude is discussed.

AB  - Dance is often positioned in contrast to more "academic" disciplines. Its marginalized status in pre-collegiate education means that it is too often absent from schooling. When taught at all, it is often used for the purpose of increasing student engagement or advancing understanding in another subject. In such a role, the standards, concepts, and methods of dance are not usually upheld. An alternative approach to combining dance with another subject can be found in interdisciplinary learning where dance and another discipline are brought together, with each discipline equally valued for its contribution to understanding a complex topic. The two disciplines come together to complement and challenge each other, and to provide insights into a multifaceted phenomenon that cannot adequately be understood through a single disciplinary perspective. This article introduces a framework for interdisciplinary teaching and learning, grounds it in a portrait of practice at the intersection of dance and anthropology, and explores the role of dance in this type of integration. Simply stated, interdisciplinary education, as proposed here, provides unique opportunities for learning about dance as well as through dance.

AB  - Communication is a major problem in the management of patients. Miscommunication occurs frequently in populations with low reading skills, illiteracy does not completely account for the observed low rates of recall of communicated information. Transmission of the message also plays an important role. Successful strategies to improve communication with patients include the use of videotapes, videotape modeling or cartoon illustrations. Do these products communicate effectively because they overcome illiteracy or because they also transmit a very clear message? Can good transmission of messages overcome illiteracy? In this study, we compared the effectiveness of a printed message about polio vaccinations with the same message converted into a production of animated cartoons using marketing and advertising techniques. The production that resulted from using this strategy showed that in the setting of this study, a well-designed animated cartoon is more effective in delivering a message than the same information provided in written instructional materials.

AB  - Objective: To investigate an existing Trust-based osteoporosis service's preventative activity, determine any issues and problems and use this data to reorganise the service, as part of a National Health Service Executive/Regional Office-commissioned and funded study. Setting: A UK Hospital Trust's Osteoporosis Service. Design & Method: A Participatory Action Research (PAR) methodology was adopted, using PAR group sessions and reflective journals to collect and analyse qualitative data. Results: The service was investigated and found to be lacking in preventative osteoporosis-related activity. Subsequently, the research participants identified and implemented a range of preventative activities. Conclusion: Osteoporosis is a preventable disease that is known to place both a huge economic and social burden on societies worldwide. Despite this, evidence suggests that preventative osteoporosis activity is afforded a low priority within health services. This was the case with the osteoporosis service at the beginning of this study, but demonstrates how a service can be reorientated to accommodate a programme of preventative activity.

AB  - This study explored cooperation between members of two interdisciplinary teams of educators within the agricultural field in a northeastern state. A researcher-developed instrument was used to explore individual perceptions regarding interdisciplinary cooperation. Using qualitative methods, the researchers intended to bring to light the thoughts, feelings and perceptions of educators regarding both the benefits and successes they had encountered, as well as the barriers they had come across during their cooperative experiences. Results indicated several areas of overlap for the disciplines. Recognized advantages included programmatic improvement, time saved, workload reduction and an increase in available resources. Barriers mentioned include time constraints, lack of awareness combined with perceived programmatic differences, and the lack of relationships and networks across disciplines. Suggestions include further research on the subject of cooperation, as well as possible combined in-service training sessions, encouraging the development of relationships through pre-service means (i.e., a combined undergraduate course) and administrator education.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the use of virtual learning environments in multicultural higher education of two different subjects: foreign language and marketing. Design/methodology/approach: The paper describes the aims, development and results of an interdisciplinary collaboration project was held between two European universities through a webCT system, where students had to work on linguistic aspects and economic and management topics. Findings: Univariate analysis shows students to have a great interest in the project. Different multivariate techniques determine a strong positive relationship between students' participation, implication and motivation in the project and their individual final grades in the course. Regression also proved that the more exciting and challenging the class activities, and the higher the student's active participation, the better the results obtained by the student. Research limitations/implications: Even if it is an exploratory research that should be replicated in other contexts, both the qualitative and quantitative results seem to confirm the positive contribution of this interdisciplinary e-learning activity to the multicultural teaching-learning process. Originality/value: Results support the positive influence of interdisciplinary activities in the students' performance and the use of learning methods that facilitate active and cooperative learning through audiovisual pedagogical resources in multicultural contexts.

AB  - A novel approach to the Chemical Engineering curriculum sequence of courses at West Point enabled our students to experience a much more realistic design process, which more closely replicated a real world scenario. Students conduct the synthesis in the organic chemistry lab, then conduct computer modeling of the reaction with ChemCad and Mathematica, analyze chemical separation processes, and design a reactor system. This interdisciplinary learning approach demonstrated to students that all of their courses are meant to complement each other, their learning, and experiences. (Contains 7 figures and 4 tables.)

AB  - GeoJourney is an interdisciplinary field trip in geology, Native American studies, and environmental studies designed for introductory-level undergraduates. The program travels 23,345 kilometers by van to national parks, industrial sites, museums, and Indian reservations in 24 of the United States. During the day, students carry out hands-on projects, field investigations, and hikes. At night, campfire lectures and discussions, along with reading assignments and written exams, enhance the educational experience. Assessment of student conceptual change in the geosciences shows statistically significant improvement beyond that seen in the traditional geoscience classroom setting.

AB  - Scholars in teaching and learning value student research and program assessment as strategies to promote excellence in undergraduate education. Yet, in practice, each can be complex and difficult to sustain. This case study demonstrates how undergraduate research, mentoring of junior faculty, and assessment can be integrated in ways that enrich the educational experiences of students and the professional development of faculty and improve research on teaching and learning. The authors describe a lively undergraduate research project that became tied to the mentoring of assistant professors and then to program assessment. We conclude with recommendations for implementing such a project in other academic settings.

AB  - Purpose: To describe a cognitive neuroscience model of memory that can be used to guide assessment and promote consistent terminology among members of the rehabilitation team, and to relate the model to frequently used assessment measures. Method: Description of a model of memory, description of how frequently used memory measures relate to the model, and presentation of case studies to exemplify the application of the model to the clinical assessment of memory. Conclusions: Use of a theoretical framework is important for choosing assessment instruments, interpreting the results of test performance, and communicating with patients, their family members, and other members of the interdisciplinary team. Understanding where in the memory process a breakdown occurs can guide treatment recommendations and feedback to patients and family members. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - We describe the development and evolution of an interdisciplinary introductory course in psychology and sociology. Such a course benefits students by encouraging a wider view of the social sciences and interdisciplinary critical thinking. The challenges of a combined course include reduced content for each discipline, the selection of appropriate texts, and the negotiation of course processes between two professors. Course evaluations indicated that students appreciated thinking beyond the bounds of 1 discipline. Additionally, statistical analyses suggested that our students received similar grades in upper level psychology courses as a cohort of psychology majors who completed the traditional introduction to psychology course.

AB  - This study examined the impact of a training programme which aimed to support language-, literacy- and social-communication-promoting strategies for professionals working with children with language delay. Sixteen teachers, special needs assistants and therapists based in services for children with mild to severe learning difficulties attended workshops and took part in six video-feedback sessions from the Hanen "Learning Language and Loving It" Programme (Weitzman, 1992). Video analysis found that participants' language and social interaction skills significantly improved on most of the targeted skills. However, the majority of skills needed further development as indicated by a rating scale. There was also a significant improvement in how participants rated their skills in working with children with speech and language difficulties and in their attitudes towards their role in remediating speech and language difficulties. There was no significant change in their opinions towards collaborative working practices. The findings suggest that with appropriate training, allied education and health professionals can produce measurable changes in behaviour and attitudes towards implementing speech- and language-promoting strategies.

AB  - In this article, the authors present a study of experienced faculty's beliefs about the assessment of interdisciplinary student work. The study focuses on faculty's close analysis of student work produced in interdisciplinary courses, such as integrative final papers, written examinations, and capstone presentations. The authors begin by reviewing relevant literature on assessment and interdisciplinary learning in higher education and proceed with a description of the study and introduce their framework for targeted assessment. Building on their analysis of interviews and student work and in conjunction with the epistemic principles described in the paper, the authors highlight three core dimensions of students' interdisciplinary work: (1) disciplinary grounding; (2) advancement through integration; and (3) critical awareness. These three dimensions organize the presentation of faculty views of quality interdisciplinary work and the assessment challenges that they encountered. The results shed light on the qualities the faculty associated with more and less accomplished interdisciplinary student work and on the particular assessment challenges posed by work at disciplinary crossroads. Building on an educational research tradition that favors the development of "usable knowledge" (Lageman, 2002), the findings are integrated into a framework designed to focus evaluators' attention on the key qualities of interdisciplinary work worth attending to in assessment. In conclusion, the authors revisit the challenges and possibilities of more rigorous assessment and pedagogical support of interdisciplinary work. (Contains 1 figure and 4 notes.)

AB  - This qualitative study analyzed the English language learning difficulties of 13 purposively chosen Korean students relative to their sociolinguistic competence, motivation in using the English language, and cultural factors. Interview responses were transcribed, categorized and thematised according to saliency, meaning and homogeneity. The findings of the study disclosed that, on the whole, while the subjects never had the opportunity to use the English language in Korea, they use it almost everywhere in the Philippines. Their difficulties exist both in daily conversation and in the academic setting. Such difficulties are attributable to both the subjects' and the Filipinos' different entry points in the learning and use of English. Despite cultural barriers in communication, however, the Koreans studying in the Philippines are instrumentally motivated to learn the English language. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - The growing trend of the internationalization of universities has provoked an interest in the academic participation of students coming from non-English speaking universities. Fashioned by theory and research as a group with "problems", nonnative English speakers are depicted as in constant need for help, and unsatisfied with Western academic practices. Consequently, the researchers interested in the potentials of computer technologies have turned toward the ways computer technologies might facilitate students' participation. By taking for granted the nonnative English speaking students' dissatisfaction with traditional academic practices because of students' cultural/linguistic differences, this approach fails to explore how the differences between the nonnative English speakers and other students have been established and maintained in traditional classrooms in the first place. This paper argues that we need a better understanding of the complex nature of relations between students and academic spaces that would challenge the approach that offers computer technologies as a "solution" to the problems of classroom participation by nonnative English speakers and develop a new framework to consider all aspects involved in the process. Empirical component of the paper offers several possible approaches in the analysis of nonnative English speaking students' academic participation.

AB  - Is spiritual diversity a neglected dimension in preparation for multicultural competency? The authors present an interdisciplinary overview of research related to multicultural training in spirituality and religion to address this issue. Findings indicate that counseling program leaders have minimal preparation in spiritual and religious diversity and interventions. In addition, spiritual and religious themes appear to be minimally included in counseling program curricula. Some evidence also indicates that religious and spiritual diversity is not considered as important in multicultural training as are other kinds of diversity. A movement to include spirituality and religious content in accreditation guidelines, however, points to a possible shift to expand preparation for religious and spiritual competency. The article concludes with implications for counselor preparation and supervision.

AB  - The Akshaya project in the rural Malappuram district of Kerala, India is home to the first and largest district-wide e-literacy project in India, and one of the largest known Internet Protocol-based networks. Through a network of 600 kiosks, the project has been designed to reach computer literacy into over 600,000 households, and bring 3.6 million residents of the district into regular affordable access to computer use. This study uses a regional analysis of Malappuram, and its parent state, to understand the context within which the project is situated and consider questions of generalizability from inferences drawn here. Second, the authors examine the technical network itself and read logs of how residents of the district are actually using the kiosks to discuss the case for content tailored to low-income users, and the larger case of state-underwritten shared-access computer centers.

AB  - It can be a challenge to introduce students to a world region with the cultural diversity and rich history of Latin America. In this article, the author suggests four thematic units that enable teachers to identify both general trends and important differences in the region: (1) race/ethnicity; (2) progress and civilization; (3) conflict and violence; and (4) migrations. She recommends readings, music, or art that can assist with lessons based on each of these themes. (Contains 19 notes.)

AB  - Mentoring is an important aspect of professional development, but can it advance substance use disorder skills in a national, interdisciplinary fellowship program? This evaluation study used a telephone survey to examine the influence of distance mentoring, interdisciplinary mentoring, and mentor functions on fellows' satisfaction, learning and academic achievements. Based on responses from 36 fellows (92%), this study found high rates of satisfaction with mentors, learning, skill acquisition, and indications of changes in teaching practice. Group comparisons showed geographic distance was not a significant factor in mentoring outcomes, while same-discipline matches and select mentor functions were associated with more positive outcomes.

AB  - Little is known about the organization, characteristics or services offered by academic interdisciplinary gerontology centers located in higher education institutions. This article presents a description and an emerging typology of academic interdisciplinary gerontology centers based on information collected from the Websites of 47 centers. The emerging typology comprised three dimensions: focus, functions and specialty areas. Significant relationships were found between the center's function and focus as well as function and number of specialties. The newly developed typology is useful for classifying and learning about academic interdisciplinary gerontology centers. Students who have an interest in gerontology might use the classification system to select a school that matches their academic goals. Educators and educational administrators might apply the typology's dimensions in program development. The typology might also serve as a useful framework for future research and policymakers could use the information from the typology and center's Websites to support proposed policies. Furthermore, older adult consumers, their families and professional caregivers can use the information to learn about services and resources. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - Calls for teaching and learning that cross subject boundaries have been making themselves heard in recent Higher Education literature in different national contexts. Communication is pivotal in any such learning encounter: it is in the process of negotiating meaning across disciplines that its rewards and challenges lie. And yet, the question of what characterises interdisciplinary classroom communication in the sector is little researched and little understood. How such interaction differs from that in the monodisciplinary university classroom is under-theorised. Adapting Applied Linguistic theory in Intercultural Communicative Competence (Byram, M. (1997). "Teaching and assessing intercultural communicative competence." Clevedon: Multilingual Matters.) and drawing on a taxonomy of academic disciplines (Becher, T., & Trowler, P. R (2001). "Academic tribes and territories." Buckingham: Society for Research in Higher Education/Open University Press.), the article proposes a model of Communicative Competence as a conceptual tool to shape thinking in developing and researching interdisciplinary teaching and learning in the university classroom.

AB  - This article offers a multidisciplinary analysis of the structure of persuasive arguments. Following an introduction, the article contains five main parts, each of which is discussed extensively: (1) descriptions of ideas from the fields of law, communication theory, and argumentation theory that analyze the nature of persuasion and the structure of persuasive messages; (2) discussion of the work of the informal logician, Stephen Toulmin, and his model for persuasive arguments; (3) exploration of ideas about argumentation and argument structure in the literature of cognitive psychology and computer science; (4) discussion of "rebuttals" as potent argumentative devices; and (5) the proposal of a new model for persuasive arguments which simultaneously builds on and modifies  Toulmin's model. An appendix presents a full-text argument. Contains 79 notes and seven figures. (CR)
