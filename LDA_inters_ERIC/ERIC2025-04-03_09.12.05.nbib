AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among pre-service science teachers' global scientific literacy and various variables within the scope of the structural equation model. Since the relations among the variables were investigated in the structural model established for this study, correlational research methodology was applied. The application was carried out with 294 pre-service teachers studying in the departments of chemistry, physics, biology and elementary science education of a state university. The data of the study were obtained with the scales of global scientific literacy, the perception of science process skills, the inquiry skills, the self-directed learning readiness in laboratory, the attitude scale towards the laboratory and the personal information questionnaire. Within the framework of structural equation modeling, the causal and relational analyses of the data were examined. The results showed that the proposed model of the relationship among global scientific literacy and the variables predicting global scientific literacy was also found to be compatible with the data, and the entire model was confirmed except for the attitude towards the laboratory. In this context, it can be claimed that these variables play an essential role in pre-service teachers' being global scientifically literate.

AB  - The students' attitudes towards school subjects may influence their behaviour and various educational outcomes. The research aimed to test students' attitudes towards the subjects of Biology, Chemistry, and Physics, and to examine the associations between those attitudes and students' learning strategies and grades achieved. The study included 245 eighth-grade students from five schools in Koprivnica-Križevci County in the Republic of Croatia. Attitude scale towards science subjects and Learning strategies scale were employed. The results of the analysis of variance showed a significantly higher assessment of interest for Biology and Physics than for Chemistry, while the assessment of importance for Biology was significantly higher than for Chemistry and Physics. Attitudes toward Biology, Chemistry, and Physics were positively correlated with the grades achieved in those subjects. Results of the mediation analysis indicated that the learning strategies were mediators between the attitude towards the science subject and the grades achieved in those subjects. Students with a more positive attitude towards a subject employ a deeper approach to learning, which ultimately results in a higher grade.

AB  - Virtual laboratories are transformative tools in science education, yet comprehensive reviews of their prospects are limited. This study addresses this gap through a bibliometric analysis of 218 articles published between 2013 and 2023. Key findings included: (1) research has evolved from initial exploration to rapid expansion; (2) virtual labs have demonstrated adaptability across various scientific disciplines, including chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, and medicine; (3) five research trajectories focus on virtual labs, science education, and computer-based learning; and (4) eight research topics, such as comparisons with physical labs and student performance, have gained prominence. These findings had implications for educational practices, research methodologies, and policy considerations. For educational practices, virtual laboratories offer benefits by removing the need for physical resources, providing flexible delivery, enabling safe exploration, fostering engagement through hands-on experimentation, and enhancing understanding with immersive experiences. For research, virtual labs improve learning and analytical skills, generate detailed data on student behaviors and learning patterns, and lead to innovations in teaching methods and curriculum design. For policymakers, strategic planning is needed to create supportive policies for the effective adoption of virtual labs, including teacher training, infrastructure development, and curriculum integration, making science education more accessible and equitable for all students.

AB  - In secondary school, where students begin to be more interested in physics, chemistry and biology, it is an important issue how their interests are in terms of all three subject areas according to grade levels. The aim of this study was to examine and evaluate the interest of secondary school students in the concepts of physics, chemistry and biology taught in science classes by grade level. The participants included 251 students enrolled in 16 different classrooms in the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th grades in a boarding secondary school located in the Eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey. The study was carried out as a developmental study in single screening model. For compliance with the research pattern, study data were collected with a questionnaire consisting of four open-ended questions, and the questionnaire was given to the students in order to find out their thoughts on the matter under consideration. In addition, the students were asked to draw a picture depicting the place and importance of science in their life and to explain their drawings briefly in writing. The data obtained from the open-ended questionnaire and drawings were analyzed through content analysis. The collected data were classified in categories and themes, and matrices were generated accordingly. In addition, frequency and percentage analysis was performed. As a result, science was found to be mostly associated with concepts regarding biology discipline by the students. Also, overall interest level was found to be higher with physics and biology topics at all grade levels studied here.

AB  - In the last decade, game-based learning has received growing attention in educational contexts in general and science education in particular. A recent game trend, which has also found its way into STEM classrooms, is escape rooms. In this type of game, players have to work through several puzzles to achieve a specific goal (mostly to escape from an actual room). We conducted a systematic literature review to find out whether the "market" for such games is already saturated or if there is still potential for further development. After searching the common databases (ERIC, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, as well as the German database FIS Bildung), we analyzed 93 journal articles, book chapters, and conference papers in English and German from the following domains: chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, computer science, general science (interdisciplinary), environmental science, and medicine. We selected the ones that targeted a specific educational level (primary, secondary or tertiary education) and were designed for formal educational settings. It transpired that there is a need for more easily adaptable escape rooms as well as for more empirical evidence on their actual effects.

AB  - This study was to asses pre-service teachers' perception of thinking, acting and living (TAL) from 21st century skills. The participants who have filled out this questionnaire were 321 pre-service teachers, consisting of 38 men and 283 women from a population of 403 pre-service teachers of mathematics, biology, physics and chemistry. The goodness level the research participants was in the range of 3.70 - 5.40%. The questionnaire consisted of aspects of thinking, acting and living (TAL) of the 21st century skill, and it included 16 indicators and 78 statements. The quality of the instrument was achieved use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and alpha Cronbach tests. This study used the multiple comparisons with Tukey HSD and LSD test for factor of the 21st century skills. The result shows that the quality of instrument was valid and reliable. The TAL profile of the pre-service teachers was at the level of able tier, there is a different score of TAL for pre-service teachers, and there is a effect of gender and department for TAL. The other findings indicate that the level of TAL for pre-service teacher in mathematic is related to physics, and biology is related to chemistry. Finally, this study confirms the use of appropriate learning methods to bring 21st century skills to pre-service teachers in mathematic, biology, physic and chemistry.

AB  - Games are a proven tool for learning at all ages and in many contexts. They increase the attractiveness of learning processes through arousing interest and enhancing motivation, and aid with the development of social skills. Educational games provide teachers with different approaches to teaching. 'The Game of the Sea' is an interdisciplinary board game, specifically designed to teach its players about the marine environment, regardless of their age. Through its 68 sections, coloured according to particular topics and organised as a fish shape, players encounter a wide range of questions and activities. Through playing this game, players acquire a broad knowledge of science, the marine environment and its importance, and literature. The game uses an interdisciplinary approach with question cards on a variety of topics (including maths, physics, biology, chemistry, art, etc.). A total of 222 players (111 children, aged 11-15, and 111 adults, aged 18-72) tested the game. These players were enrolled in different formal and non-formal educational contexts and had different educational backgrounds. For a qualitative analysis of game sessions (participant observation), researchers acted as game moderators and, while doing so, made subtle observations of players playing the game. On top of this, the value of the game, as a didactic tool, was evaluated with a test that players took before and after the game. After playing the game, knowledge of the marine environment, increased in both children and adults, with a slightly higher increase in children. Therefore, 'The Game of the Sea' is suitable for teaching all ages about the marine environment. Further, this game can impart to its players the importance of the marine environment and the importance of protecting this environment.

AB  - This article discusses a study carried out to investigate scientific reasoning skills among 82 science pre-service teachers at the Faculty of Education, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), one of the public universities in Malaysia. Undeniably, the development of general scientific abilities is critical to enable students of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to successfully handle openended real-world tasks in their future careers. Teaching goals in STEM education include fostering content knowledge and developing general scientific abilities. One such important ability is scientific reasoning. Scientific reasoning encompasses critical thinking skills as a vital learning outcome in modern science education. Lawson (1978) categorized scientific reasoning into four domains: Conservative Concept, Proportional Concept, Control Variable and Probabilistic Thinking, and Hypothetical-Deductive Reasoning. An instrument by Lawson (1978) was adapted for this study. The findings show that a majority of the science pre-service teachers possess low ability in scientific reasoning. It is also found that there was no significant difference among the science pre-service teachers of the physics, biology and chemistry disciplines when examined. The findings showed that Physics students had developed a higher ability in Conservative Concept, Proportional Concept, and Hypothetical-Deductive Reasoning and chemistry students had a higher ability in Control Variable and Probabilistic Thinking, whereas biology students had a moderate ability in the four scientific reasoning patterns.

AB  - The objective of this study was to adapt the Teaching Engineering Self-Efficacy Scale (TESS) to Turkish through comprehensive validity and reliability assessments and to analyze science teachers' (specializing in science, physics, chemistry, biology) Teaching Engineering Self-Efficacy (TES) beliefs concerning various variables. The study employed the TESS, originally developed by Yoon, Evans, and Strobel (2014), alongside a personal information form, and followed a descriptive survey model as its research methodology. The adapted TESS's validity and reliability were evaluated using data from 476 science teachers in schools under the Ministry of National Education (MoNE) in X province, and the main study involved 221 science teachers from Y province. The assessment of teachers' TES beliefs in relation to different factors was executed using independent samples t-tests, One-Way ANOVA, and the Scheffe test. It revealed that science teachers' TES beliefs significantly varied based on factors such as their involvement in providing engineering education, the integration of engineering education into their teaching, and their specific teaching subjects, but not gender. The study contributes a valid and reliable scale to the academic literature.

AB  - The present study aims to demonstrate, by means of a meta-analysis, the effectiveness of Project-Based Learning in the context of academic performance and various study characteristics. For this purpose, the relevant literature was reviewed to identify studies using Project-Based Learning in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, and science. Following the literature review, the study characteristics and the criteria for their inclusion were determined. A total of 48 studies were included and, by means of the analyses conducted, the general effect size of Project-Based Learning in science education was found to be 1.063. This is quite a large effect size by Cohen's criteria and it shows that Project-Based Learning is 86% more effective in science education compared to traditional learning approaches. Project-Based Learning was found to have a great effect size in different subjects (physics, chemistry, biology, and science), at different levels (primary, secondary, and tertiary), and with samples of various sizes (small, medium, and large). Project-Based Learning can thus be deemed more effective compared to traditional learning approaches.

AB  - In recent years, efforts to transform scientific information produced in basic sciences into technology to facilitate daily life have been increasing. In this sense, the perspective of entrepreneurship gains importance in basic sciences. This study aims analyze documents published on entrepreneurship in basic sciences (physics, chemistry, biology) using a bibliometric review. For this aim, the bibliometric analysis method based on the systematic literature review approach was used. Systematic review was carried out in the WoS database. A total of 428 documents (1994-2020) on entrepreneurship in basic sciences in the WoS were retrieved. The bibliometric analysis results were presented under two main categories as descriptive (numbers of documents according to year, author, country, organization, source, research area, WoS category area) and evaluative results (co-occurrence, co-authorship, citation analysis). Descriptive results were displayed with frequency values, and evaluative results were displayed using VOSviewer visualization software. As a result, it was determined that there is an important increase in the number of documents towards 2020. In addition, it was determined that the most productive, influential, and collaborative author is Jardim-Goncalves R, the most productive country is the USA, the most productive journal is Journal of Technology Transfer, and the most productive organization is Old Dominion University. Moreover, it has been determined that the most influential area in terms of research area is "business economics" and the most keyword co-occurrences are "entrepreneurship", "design science" and "academic entrepreneurship".

AB  - This study aims to ascertain academicians' opinions about out-of-school learning, awareness of it, and competency to plan learning activities in such situations for the purpose of teaching in out-of-school learning environments (OSLEs). The research group of this study, which was conducted as a case study, consists of 56 academics in the physics, chemistry, biology, and science education programs of education faculties in Türkiye. The Out-of-School Learning Environments Regulation Scale and a form containing four questions were used to data collection. The results from the scale, the average score was calculated as 4.41 for academics with experience in teaching OSLEs and 3.82 for academics without such experience. The qualitative results indicate that academics mostly prefer to focus on environmental education, astronomy, living things and life, and recycling issues through out-of-school learning activities and use different types of OSLEs such as science center, recycling facility and observatory. To conclude, despite the academics' high level of competency in performing out-of-school learning activities, it is evident that they underutilize these activities in their teaching.

AB  - Chemical educators are facing a new generation of instructional technologies that impact classroom teaching. New technologies, like smartphones, cloud computing and artificial intelligence take learning beyond the classroom; 3D printing, virtual reality, and augmented reality provide new ways to teach the virtualization skills that are important for chemists. These technologies cause students to become more isolated, so students may not develop the social skills that they will need for today's workplace. Individualized learning may be beneficial to many students, but it will create challenges for faculty. Although this article focuses on chemistry education, it should be apparent that a similar argument could be made for other sciences, like physics and biology.

AB  - STEM education plays a key role in influencing and orienting students' interests towards STEM fields and careers. This influence is multifaceted, involving not only STEM content and experiences but also teachers, schools, and personal factors. The purpose of this study is to explore the factors impacting the academic performance of 951 tenth grade students in STEM subjects (physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and information technologies) who are attending public and private schools in two provinces of Turkey. Using a correlational research model, the study assessed how students' personal characteristics, teacher effectiveness and school characteristics affect achievement in STEM courses. Data were collected using the 'Factors Affecting STEM Achievement Questionnaire (FA-STEM-A)', a 20-item questionnaire divided into three sub-dimensions. Analyses focused on the relationships between student characteristics, teaching quality, school infrastructure and STEM performance. Structural equation modelling revealed that positive student characteristics, especially fondness for STEM subjects and confidence in STEM abilities, moderately increase achievement. In contrast, negative factors attributed to teachers and schools, such as inadequate classroom activities, lack of educator expertise, inadequate technological resources, and large class sizes, hindered student performance. These findings emphasize the important influence of both inherent student qualities and external educational conditions in determining STEM education.

AB  - This study aims to prepare a scale to determine the creativity levels of prospective teachers studying at the undergraduate level of science teaching. In this context, 15 questions, suitable for student's level from physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy and ecology sub-branches were prepared. The questions were assessed by 5 lecturers who were experts in their fields for their opinions. After the expert opinion, the number of questions was determined as 13 and pilot study was carried out with 95 pre-service teachers studying in Inonu University Faculty of Education Science Teacher Education. The data obtained from the pilot study were analyzed by using SPSS 21.0 statistical program according to Multi Surface Rasch Model. In order to determine the reliability of the scale, internal consistency coefficient of Cronbach's alpha was calculated and found 0.758. At the end of the research, the data was analyzed and the question number of the scale was determined as 10 according to the analysis results. Studies conducted on scientific creativity generally aimed to measure the scientific creativity of secondary school students. We believe that a deficiency in measuring the scientific creativity of undergraduate students at the academic level will be eliminated with the scale we developed.

AB  - The instruction of Natural Science subject in junior high schools, as regulated by 2013 Curriculum, is to be taught in an integrated way, combining Biology, Physics, and Chemistry subjects. The assessment of which is called authentic assessment. This current study described the instructional system especially the assessment system of Natural Science subject in Batu City. This study was conducted by employing descriptive-qualitative design, recruiting teachers and students as the subjects of the investigation. The data were collected by means of interview, observation, documentation, and triangulation; the researchers were the instruments themselves. The collected data were analyzed descriptively-qualitatively. The yielded results were as follows: 1) There was no teacher with relevant study discipline, bachelor in Natural Science Education, teaching the subject. Most of them were holding degree in Biology, Physics, and Chemistry Educations, as well as Industrial Engineering and Building Engineering; 2) 76.5% of the class was taught by a single teacher; while 17.6% of which was taught by means of team teaching; 3) The investigated schools were implementing 2016 school-based curriculum; 5 hours within a week were allocated for Natural Science subject: 2 hours for Biology, 3 hours for Physics, and Chemistry was taught by any available teachers. For the schools implementing 2013 Curriculum, the materials have been integrated and composed into teachers' book, but Chemistry materials were included into Biology/Physics, or even taught separately; 4) The final score of Natural Science subject was taken from the average scores of Biology, Physics, and Chemistry; the standard of assessment depended on the teachers; 5) Assessment techniques varied considerably but they have not developed meta-cognition, such as: not evaluating article analysis, study journal, self-assessment, nor student-made tests; 6) The teachers mostly assessed the aspects of C1, C2, and C3; while aspects of C4, C5, and C6 (Evaluation and Creativity), affective and psychomotor assessments were rarely administered. The other challenges were the teachers still found it hard to administer those assessments properly; this was also applicable for remedial and reinforcement.

AB  - The aim of this study is to compare 2018 Science Course Curriculum (SCC), 2015 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and 2018 High School Entrance Examination (HSE) in terms of content domains, cognitive domains and learning objectives. Qualitative research method, was used in this study. Data were analyzed using document review matrices to determine the similarities and differences between the objectives of SCC, TIMSS and HSE. SCC outcomes and HSE science questions were also classified according to TIMSS cognitive domains. Results show that the learning objectives of the fields of Physics, Biology and Earth Sciences of TIMSS are compatible with those of all grade levels of SCC and that the objectives of Chemistry are compatible with those of the seventh and eighth grades. Most of HSE questions are compatible with the objectives of SCC, however, the latest revision in the curriculum has introduced some eighth grade objectives to other grade levels. HSE science questions measure higher-level skills than TIMSS science questions. The subject domain of the "Organisms and Life" of SCC has the most learning objectives in the levels of "knowing" and "reasoning" while the subject domain of the "Physical Events" has the most learning objectives in the levels of "applying." Besides, the seventh-, fifth- and eighth-graders have the most objectives in the levels of "knowing," "applying," and "reasoning," respectively. It is hoped that the results will contribute the literature in improvement of science curricula and interpretation of national and international exams.

AB  - This paper deals with the interaction pattern between teacher and students in the real classroom lessons. This study was primarily conducted to determine the patterns of classroom interaction produced by the teachers and learners during the class sessions in the bilingual middle-school classrooms in Medan City, Indonesia. The data were spoken texts of teachers from five videorecorded classes (Mathematics, Physics, Biology, English and IT/TIK) during the period of even semester, and were then analyzed by applying the "Flanders Interaction Analysis Categories System (FIACS)" 'Interaction Model' following the frame works proposed by Flanders (1970). From the data analysis, it was found that the talk was dominated by teachers, particularly on the categories of no. 4, 5, and 6, while students practiced no. 8 mostly, and it also indicated that instructor expressions were very overwhelming in each example of assignments amid the class sessions, while understudies reactions or different properties were moderately low in rates in an educator centered classroom aside from in the scene no. 5 (IT Lesson) where understudies took the greater part of the cooperation among peers. The examination likewise demonstrates that elicitation, reaction, and input were deliberately utilized by instructor, and understudies were a piece of the structure of classroom talk exercises. The example, notwithstanding, could be changed relying upon the educator expectation or the times of lesson that understudies learn.

AB  - Limited studies investigate the high school teachers' challenges and strategies while teaching science and mathematics in English as the target language through the content and language integrated learning (CLIL) approach. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the challenges that science and math teachers encounter and the strategies they employ while fostering students' development of proficiency in English as the target language in physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics courses in the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) and International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP). The study utilized various qualitative tools such as semi-structured interviews, open-ended questionnaires, and lesson observations to analyze science and math teachers' strategies and challenges at a case school in eastern Turkey. The study revealed that as part of the CLIL approach, the participant teachers indicated various challenges such as a lack of vocabulary repertoire, translation problems, and weak foundational knowledge. They used common strategies such as group work interactions, interdisciplinary activities, individualized feedback, the promotion of higher-order thinking skills, inquiry-based learning, and reinforcement of language used to deal with these challenges. The study presents further implications for good practices and recommendations to resolve challenges.

AB  - Science identity, encompassing perceptions of competence, interest, and recognition in science, alongside learning self-efficacy reflecting confidence to master science skills, are key drivers of outcomes. However, developmental patterns likely vary across contexts. Participants were 512 Chinese students spanning grades 1-3 who completed the Science Identity Scale and Science Learning Self-Efficacy Scale, with physics, chemistry, and biology achievement scores gathered. A Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model assessed relationships. Results substantiated psychometrics for motivational measures. The model indirectly predicting achievement via first-order discipline-specific paths explained more variance than direct second-order effects. Effects significantly varied across groups stratified by grade and region. Interest and conceptual knowledge drove physics and chemistry success, while higher-order skills enhanced biology achievement overall. However, relationships differed within subgroups, suggesting personalized motivational support needs--self-belief/competence foundations for struggling learners, conceptual development for those with high prior achievement, and intrinsic enrichment for disinterested students. Results detail complex motivational profiles underlying science achievement requiring tailored identity safety and self-efficacy scaffolding alongside conceptual and skill-building for excellence across scientific disciplines. Motivational support systems may spur more equitable and optimal science outcomes among diverse adolescent learners.

AB  - Science process skills (SPS) are considered essential for scientific and technological eras nowadays. This study aims to provide information on how SPS in Indonesia have been researched from 2016 to 2022, including the number of studies conducted, research designs used, frequently addressed science topics, interventions, assessment instruments used, and data analysis techniques applied. We applied content analysis across numerous science education journals authored in Indonesia over 7 years. The analysed articles were filtered from 14 Indonesian science education journals selected from the SINTA database with SINTA 1-6 index ratings. Articles were searched using keywords such as "Science Process Skills and Science Education" and the selection resulted in the review of 86 articles. This up-to-date research has revealed a fluctuation in the number of articles mainly focused on SPS from year to year. Among those articles, quantitative research was the researchers' most popular method for examining SPS. 8th grade Junior High School (JHS) and 10th grade Senior High School (SHS) pupils were frequently chosen as study participants. The most frequently selected topic for the study of SPS were physics (38%), biology (33%), chemistry (9%), and unidentified topics (20%). Inquiry-based learning was the most common research focus, with test sheets and t-tests being the most frequently utilised for analysing data. This SPS review research is important to provide results to identify future areas of research and promote the development of SPS in science education. Several suggestions for future studies on SPS have been made based on the study's outcomes.

AB  - Pigments are light-absorbing substances that are abundant in nature, serving roles in coloration, camouflage, mate/pollinator attraction and photosynthesis among higher life forms. Among microbial organisms, pigments can also be found in a wide range of phyla. While some of these pigments function in photosynthesis, namely among algae and some bacteria, the great majority of microbial pigments play entirely different roles. The exploratory study presented here will stimulate students to think about the cost and benefit of a heritable trait (pigment production) of microscopic organisms and its effects on survival in a competitive and hostile environment. Exploring and understanding the roles these pigments play allows for a number of cross-disciplinary learning opportunities that combine physics, chemistry, biology and even art, and can be set up as an inquiry-based learning module suitable for small-group and active learning experiences.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate and compare pre-service teachers' self-confidence in technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) concerning their gender, department, and owned digital technologies. To achieve this goal, the survey method was conducted as part of a quantitative method design. Participants of the study consisted of 252 pre-service teachers from four different concentrations: physics, chemistry, biology, and German language teaching. TPACK Self Confidence Scale (TPACK-SCS), which was constructed by Graham, Burgoyne, Cantrell, Smith, and Harris (2009) and adapted to Turkish by Timur and Tasar (2011), was used as the data collection tool. TPACK-SCS is a scale with 4 sub-dimensions as Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK), Technological Knowledge (TK), and Technological Content Knowledge (TCK). The Cronbach's Alpha internal reliability coefficients of the scale were calculated between .78 and .94. Since the data obtained did not show normal distribution it was analyzed by Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis - H tests. According to the results, significant differences were found in the level of self-confidence and sub-dimensions of students' TPACK according to gender, department, and owned digital technologies for education.

AB  - Many current curricula, in going beyond traditional goals, increasingly foster creativity in science classrooms, declaring creativity a core skill of the 21st century. For enhancing creativity in science classrooms, the subject Arts is considered to offer a potential way from STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) to STEAM (STEM with Arts)). The Horizont-2020 project Creations prepared more than 100 creativity-enhancing STEAM modules based on the 5E instructional model. STEM subjects were mathematics, biology, physics, chemistry or technology, and often interdisciplinary for different school and class levels between the ages of nine and nineteen. All modules provided a social environment fostering creativity where students imagine, explore, experiment, test, manipulate, and speculate. Exemplarily, five modules including physics, math, and biology, were selected, for monitoring motivation and creativity. The first was measured on the level of career-motivation and self-efficacy, the latter focused on two sub-constructs: active cognition such as idea processing (ACT), and a mental state of creative immersion (FLOW). Subjects were a sample of 995 students (9-18 years). In summary, no gender impact or age effect appeared in any of the monitored variables. Participation intervened with Self-Efficacy and ACT, while Career Motivation or FLOW did not. Act as a cognitive variable associated with creativity might be more sensitive to changes, whereas Flow as a parameter measuring a state of mind related to emotion appears more stable. Path analysis supported the role of creativity for Career-Motivation by promoting Self-Efficacy. Conclusions for appropriate educational settings to foster STEAM environments are discussed.

AB  - The study aimed at investigates the science students' satisfaction level of using e-learning and virtual classes in exceptional condition COVID-19 Crisis, in light of three demographic variables: students' specialization, educational level, and GPA. The population consisted of all science students (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Mathematics) in the college of science at a university from Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. The sample comprised of 116 science students. The researcher developed a questionnaire and verified its validity and reliability for collecting data. Some statistical analyses such as mean, standard deviations, and ANOVA tests were conducted to analyze the questionnaire. The results indicated that the satisfaction level of using e-learning and virtual classes by science students is medium in general but with varying degrees from one item to another. The results did not show significant statistical differences at the level ([alpha] = 0.05) of the use of e-learning and virtual classes for all independent variables: students' specialization, educational level, and GPA. The study included several recommendations; the most important of which is the necessity of providing infrastructure in the university (all colleges) concerning e-learning and educational technology, providing training programs for all university professors and students on how to use e-learning efficiently to boost their competences and skills in utilizing these innovative models.

Analogies are particularly effective in teaching science concepts that are not very apparent in the students' everyday lives due to their abstract nature. For this reason, it is essential to adapt analogies to teach new concepts effectively in science education. Analogy-related studies published between 2009 and 2020 were examined in this manuscript to determine the use of analogies as a teaching technique in science education (Physics, Chemistry, Biology). To reach the studies about "Analogy," ERIC, EBSCO, Springer LINK, Taylor & Francis, Wiley Online Library Full Collection, Science Direct, ProQuest Dissertations, Theses Global, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases were searched. Then, Turkish databases, including ULAKBIM and YÖK (National Thesis Center), were also searched. A total of 80 research papers published between 2009 and 2020 that met the study's criteria were examined. Within the scope of the study, the subject areas, purpose, sample, results, and suggestions of compiled analogy studies were focused on. Based on the analysis, it was determined that most of the analogy research was conducted in the field of chemistry, the most employed methodology was qualitative research, and the most common purpose of these studies was to see the effects on academic achievement. When the studies were conducted to examine academic achievement, it was seen that the use of analogy applications as a teaching technique in science teaching has positive results on student achievement.

AB  - Stratified teaching is an effective method and means to implement teaching students per their aptitude. Domestic and foreign scholars have carried out many experimental and quasiexperimental studies to observe the impact of stratified teaching on students' academic performance, but the results are quite different. So, can stratified teaching effectively help Chinese students improve their academic performance? How big is its impact? Which model is more suitable for Chinese students? To answer these questions, this article uses meta-analysis to quantitatively analyze 22 Chinese studies on the impact of Stratified teaching on student academic performance. We found that (i) stratified teaching has a positive effect on students' academic performance, and the overall combined effect size is 0.53; (ii) among the seven subjects of mathematics, English, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and information technology, stratified teaching has had a positive effect on their learning. Stratified teaching's order of effect on different subjects was English > Physics > Geography > Information Technology > Mathematics > Biology > Chemistry; (iii) stratified teaching is suitable for students of different sizes of classrooms. However, the smaller the number of students in the classroom, the better the learning effect, and (iv) stratified teaching is more suitable for improving their learning in the mobile learning system.

AB  - The present study elaborates on a domain-specific approach to NOS (Nature Of Science) and employs a NOTSs (Nature Of The Sciences) agenda to investigate how Greek in-service physics teachers understand the unique features of school physics and biology. Our theoretical framework focuses on the notion of worldview and important differences that exist between the Newtonian and the neo-Darwinian worldviews, whereas our methodology involves questionnaires and mainly individual interviews. The empirical findings indicate that participants understand the nature of the sciences from the perspective of how they understand their own science and tend to share homogeneous NOTSs conceptions that mostly stem from how they have assimilated positivistic tenets. As a result, they have serious misunderstandings regarding (a) the nature of biology because they project upon biology epistemological characteristics that biology does not possess and (b) several NOS items because they erroneously consider domain-specific NOS (or NOTSs) conceptions to be domain-general and disregard important NOTSs conceptions that underpin the understanding of domain-general NOS items. The implications of all such findings for synergies that may exist between the NOTSs agenda and the current domain-general approach to NOS are also discussed.

AB  - Brazil is a country that does not invest enough in basic education, thus leaving a gap in the knowledge of young people studying in public schools and jeopardizing their future. One of the main ways to get into college in Brazil is through the National High School Exam (ENEM), a multiple-choice test administered by the National Institute of Educational Studies and Research. In the project: Popular Course: a preparation for ENEM, students from the Federal University of Technology-Paraná, Apucarana campus volunteered to offer online tutoring of basic content in: biology, physics, geography, history, mathematics and chemistry, from Monday to Friday, during thirteen weeks. The main objective of these virtual meetings was to help interested students enrolled in the program to prepare for ENEM, in a dynamic and freeway. The volunteers were free to use the means they considered most appropriate for each content, from online physics experiments to game-based learning platforms, which contributed positively to the learning of the students enrolled in the project and consequently to a better performance in the tests.

AB  - In the present study, the effects of the body language of physical education, Turkish, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Music and Art teachers, which is one of the most determining dimensions among communication skills on students' attitudes towards the lesson were examined. The study was applied to 371 students, 244 of whom were female and 127 male, in 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades, studying at four different high schools in the Palandöken County of Erzurum City center in the 2018-2019 academic year. The group that was selected as the sampling of the study consisted of these students. It is considered that this study will contribute to the accurate interaction between the teacher and the student with the dimension of communication skills and to the studies to be conducted in this field. As it was understood from this study that high school students responded "I like it a lot" to item 9, "She/he mostly smiles while teaching"; and "I like it" to items 2, 3, 27, 28 and 31. The response "I do not like it at all" did not affect the average score. Among the remaining 29 items, 15 responded as "I am indecisive", and 14 as "I do not like it". When the results of the present study are evaluated, it is seen that the teacher, who manages the teaching and learning experiences and guides the learning of students actively and participative, manages the process much more effectively, not only via communication with the language but also via the communication and interaction of the beyond-the-language communication arguments and body language. At the same time intonation of voice, and translingual communication arguments are also important.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to find out the correlation between scientific knowledge and science process skills with scientific creativity in Creative Responsibility Based Learning (CRBL). This study involved 83 students of science, physics, chemistry and biology education at Lambung Mangkurat University, Indonesia. The process of data collection used scientific knowledge tests, science process skills tests, and scientific creativity tests. The results of the study show that: (1) scientific knowledge and scientific creativity have a positive, but not significant, relationship. Even though, the mastery of scientific knowledge was needed as a connector of science process skills with scientific creativity; (2) science process skills were positively and significantly correlated with scientific creativity; and (3) both scientific knowledge and science process skills had a simultaneous correlation to scientific creativity.

AB  - This study investigates the knowledge acquisition of biology and physics freshmen students with special regard to differences between high school (HS) high performing and low performing students. Our study is based on a prior knowledge model, which describes explicit knowledge as a composite of four knowledge types: knowledge of facts, knowledge of meaning, integration of knowledge, and application of knowledge. As a first outcome-oriented approach, we operationalize knowledge acquisition via the changes in these knowledge types between the beginning and the end of the first year. To investigate the knowledge acquisition, a test set was constructed that covers these knowledge types. It was administered to 162 biology and 101 physics students at university. We used an Item Response Theory approach to scale the data. Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to analyze the acquisition of the knowledge types. We separated HS low, medium, and high achievers by high school grade point average (HS GPA). The knowledge acquisition of the HS low achievers did not differ from other groups. However, the HS low achievers did not only start with less prior knowledge but also were not able to reach the prior knowledge of the HS high achievers within the first year. Our findings concerning knowledge acquisition may be used to support and improve students' knowledge acquisition in a targeted way by focusing on selected knowledge types.

AB  - Physics learning in universities utilized the Moodle-based e-learning media as an online learning platform. However, the effectiveness of remediating misconception using online media has not been widely researched. Therefore, this study was set to determine the level of misconception percentage reduction through the use of narrative feedback, the e-learning modules, and realistic video. The study was a quantitative approach with a quasi-experimental method involving 281 students who were taking basic physics courses in the Department of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology Education. The data collection used a three-tier diagnostic test based on e-learning at the beginning of the activity and after the treatment (posttest). The results of the data analysis with descriptive statistics show that the most significant treatment in reducing misconception percentage on the topic of free-fall motion was in the following order: narrative feedback, e-learning modules and realistic video. The misconception percentage reduction in the sub-concept of accelerated free-fall was effective for all types of the treatments.

AB  - This study aimed to recognize upper-secondary school science teachers' perceptions of the meaning, importance, and integrating mechanisms of science, technology, engineering, math (STEM) education, taking in to account the differences between the science teachers' perceptions according to their specialties, years of experience, and degrees. A closed-ended questionnaire was distributed among 700 science teachers (biology, physics, and chemistry) in Riyadh, and 255 teachers responded. The results showed a strong alignment in the upper-secondary school science teachers' perceptions of the meaning and the importance of STEM education, although there was less of a consensus regarding the integrating mechanisms. There were statistically significant differences in the physics teachers' perceptions of STEM meaning, although there were otherwise no significant differences by specialty in the science teachers' perceptions of the importance of STEM education and its integration mechanisms. Furthermore, the teachers showed no statistically significant differences in STEM's meaning, importance, or integrating mechanisms according to their years of experience. Based on the results, recommendations included intensifying professional development programs on utilizing technology, engineering, and mathematics in learning science concepts and application.

AB  - Analogical reasoning is both an innate ability and a basic learning mechanism that can be improved. In classrooms, it is an important tool used by teachers, especially when explaining difficult or abstract issues. In addition to its use in all aspects of our lives, analogical reasoning is commonly used in textbooks. This research examines the extent to which analogies are used in high school science textbooks, the subjects of the examination being high school physics, chemistry, and biology course textbooks used by students between 14 and 17 years of age. A total of 15 textbooks (four biology books, five physics books, and six chemistry books) were reviewed. Ninety-two analogies were identified in these books. These analogies were classified based on a scheme developed by Curtis and Reigeluth. Findings are discussed in the context of previous related studies.

AB  - Integrated teaching is teaching in which the educational contents of subjects are interconnected. Connections can be discussed in a specialized integrated subjects e.g., Integrated science. Integrated science is a subject that connects knowledge from chemistry, biology, physics, geography, and geology. One topic is discussed from a different point of view, and students should transform their theoretical knowledge in practice. Worksheets can serve as a teaching material that can provide help to students as well as teachers and guide students on their path to knowledge. But how should a worksheet look like and how should the tasks be designed? This contribution describes a suggested method for making a worksheet for integrated (science) teaching that we call CCCTER. CCCTER is abbreviation for choose, connect, create, try, evaluate, remade. The method implements the national Framework education program for secondary general education (grammar schools) in the process of making the tasks. The principles choose, connect, and create are demonstrated. It provides a sample task of a worksheet for integrated (science) teaching. [For the full proceedings, see ED620289.]

AB  - Case-Based Learning (CBL) in science education has developed rapidly. This paper reviews the literature on trends in implementing CBL in science education. For this systematic review, we followed the recommendation of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework. Data were obtained from the ERIC, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases by taking scientific articles from reputable international journals with a Scopus Q1-Q4 index and impact factor ranging from 0.040 to 3.092, which is the main indicator of choosing quality of journal articles. Articles were searched using titles and keywords "Case-Based or Case Method or Science Education" from 2012 to 2022. The search yielded 1183 articles, and the selection results were 52 articles for review. The study found that CBL was represented mostly in three learning approaches, namely CBL-IBL, CBL-PBL, CBL-PjBL, and the rest being CBL-Blended, CBL-Online, and CBL-Collaborative. Case-based applications in science education were dominated by health (58%), chemistry (35%), physics (1%) and biology (6%). The reviewed studies encountered some difficulties in implementing CBL. One of them is that solving the problem takes a long time. This review revealed case-based approach to be appropriate to be implemented in an active learning activity based on real-life context.

AB  - The accuracy of learning results relies on the evaluation and assessment. The learning goals, including problem solving ability must be aligned with the valid standardized measurement tools. The study on exploring the nature of problem-solving, framework, and assessment in the Indonesian context will make contributions to problem solving assessment in Indonesian educational learning system. This review involved 32 studies that focus on problem-solving test development conducted in Indonesia and have the Indonesian version of the test. All tests are in the scope of certain subjects (mathematics, science, physics, and chemistry) and administered grade 7 to undergraduate level. Each test revealed a good value of reliability. Most of them have acceptable reliability score (r-value between 0.60 and 0.80) and high-reliability score (r > 0.80). Besides, they also showed content and construct validity (acceptable r value in Pearson product moment analysis and INFIT MNSQ index), but additional analysis is needed to fully develop the tests' empirical evidence. All the tests are categorized as domain specific problem solving which focus on mathematics, science for junior high school, physics, chemistry, and biology. In addition, the topic coverage in the test should be improved and further studies about the measurement of problem-solving and test development are needed in the case of the Indonesian context.

Hence, this study investigated the impact of CL4STEM project mobile communities of practice on science and mathematics teachers' capacity towards piloting curated subject-specific OERs in Nigerian secondary schools and to enhancing subject matter knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and practice for achieving Higher-Order Thinking, Equity and Inclusion (HOTIE) in their classroom. The study adopted a survey research design involving documentary content analysis and a one-group pre-test-post-test design to collect qualitative and quantitative secondary data to achieve the objectives of the research. The population of the study involves all science; biology, chemistry, and physics teachers in senior secondary schools in selected states in Northern Nigeria. Purposive sampling was used to select one newly qualified biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics teacher per subject area from twenty sample schools in the population, thus a sample size of 80 science and mathematics teachers, 20 each per subject but less due to attrition. Content analysis of the science teachers' participation in telegram social network communications was used to obtain qualitative data on their CoP practices. While the Pre-test and Post-test on the teachers' subject matter and pedagogical content knowledge was the instrument for quantitative data collection. The instruments were validated by science and mathematics education experts. Four research objectives and four corresponding research questions guided the study. Descriptive narrative, descriptive content analysis and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data on teachers' participation in the online telegram platform to provide answers to research questions. The study revealed that online CoP has creditably impacted on teachers' subject matter and pedagogical content knowledge. The implications for continuous teacher professional development policy and teacher education curriculum in Nigeria were highlighted. [For the full proceedings, see ED630948.]

AB  - This study aims to develop a measurement tool to measure pre-service science fields teachers' (PSSFT') attitudes towards nanotechnology. For this purpose, a five-point Likert-type scale consisting of 55 items was applied to 373 PSSFT who enrolled in science fields (Science, Chemistry, Biology, Physics) at the grades 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th at a public university in Turkey. The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) determined that the scale had a 3-factor structure consisting of 24 items and the factors explained 55.854% of the attitude variable's total variance. Verification of the model was tested by applying confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The CFA data were obtained from 770 PSSFT enrolled in science fields at the grades 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th at two different public universities in Turkey. The results obtained from CFA were in agreement with the model obtained by EFA. Cronbach's alpha (Cr-[alpha]) reliability of the scale was calculated to be 0.926. Findings from the validity and reliability analyses show that the scale is a valid and reliable measurement tool that can measure PSSFT' attitudes towards nanotechnology.

AB  - Engagement markers (hereafter, EMs) are crucial interpersonal devices to interact with readers through texts. However, little is known about the differences of EMs use in Humanities and Science journal research articles (hereafter, RAs), as well as the changes in markers use over the passage of time. The present study provides a quantitative and contrastive analysis based on two corpora consisting of four disciplines of Humanities RAs (Psychology, Sociology, Economics and Law) and four disciplines of science RAs (Mathematics, Geology, Physics and Biology). Sixteen articles from each discipline were selected randomly from a pool of journal RAs. All sections of the articles were scrutinized for the purpose of the study. The obtained results indicate that Humanities RAs make use of more EMs than Science RAs. Also, the findings of this study suggest that directives are used more than other markers both in Humanities and Science RAs. Regarding the use of EMs in the decades of 1990s and 2000s, a significant increase in the use of EMs was observed with the passage of time, both in Humanities and Science RAs.

AB  - This study examines prevalent misconceptions among students regarding the fundamental concepts of acids and bases, which often arise during the learning process. This study aims to pinpoint misconceptions held by preservice science teachers in the realm of acids and bases; 117 university students from diverse educational backgrounds, enrolled in three distinct courses: Biology, Chemistry, and Physics from the Faculty of Education, participated in the study. Using a structured questionnaire, the research identified 11 misconceptions out of 26 items related to acid and base concepts among pre-service teachers, while 15 items showed a correct understanding. Notably, three misconceptions exhibit the highest prevalence, namely the universal indicator of strong alkali (71.7%), the calculation-related concentration of acids and bases (69.3%), and the procedural steps for preparing a solution with a specified concentration using the dilution method (65.8%). The analysis indicates that although pre-service teachers generally understand acid and base concepts well, some misconceptions persist. Additionally, correlations between gender, university major, and understanding of these concepts were found. Further global research is recommended to identify misconceptions among university students. Comprehensive research in Malaysia could help educators and students address these misconceptions in Chemistry education.

AB  - English language teaching in Indonesia continues to improve the communicative ability of students. To support English language mastery, school subjects such as mathematics, science, and technology are taught in English. However, the main problem faced by prospective science teachers is their limited English proficiency which leads to limited English communication. Therefore, a tool called "Science Instruction in English Audiobook" was seen as one of the media which can help prospective science teachers to practice the teaching skills in English. Hence, this study aims to develop and evaluate a "Science Instruction in English Audiobook" to help prospective science teachers improve their science teaching skills in English. The skills of science teaching in English were then observed to find out the effectiveness of the audiobook. The subjects were 65 prospective science teachers. The research design was Research and Development consisting of problem analysis, literature study, product design, product validation, revision, trial, revision, application, and revision. The "Science Instruction in English Audiobook" product has been successfully developed. The product is a sound recording in .mp3 format with a duration of almost 1 hour 3 minutes 43 seconds. The audiobook contains science vocabulary material (physics, chemistry, and biology) and teaching skills in English. Following the research design steps, the product has been validated by material, media, and language experts. Based on the validation from the experts, it can be stated that the audiobook product is valid with an accumulated percentage of 98% which means it is feasible to be used as a learning resource to develop the English skills of prospective science teachers. Moreover, it has been found that audiobooks can help prospective science teachers to practice effective science teaching skills in English.

AB  - Science curriculums and curricular materials are essential guidelines in materializing effective science teaching. The primary goal of the current study aims to present a thematic analysis of the last three elementary and middle school science curriculums objectives released in 2013, 2017, and 2018 to determine whether they provide a base for science teachers to design intellectually demanding instructional tasks. This study conducted an in-depth document analysis to describe the curricular themes and objectives' intellectual demands beyond a mere description. Moreover, a critical document-based thematic analysis achieved a call for an in-depth interrogation of the intended science curricula. The current study reveals that the explored science curriculums mainly include physics-related and biology-related topics and chemistry-related topics. There is less place for the issues related to astrophysics and earth sciences. Although three curricular changes (2013, 2017, and 2018) were actualized to enrich the science curriculums' scope, intellectual capacity, and thematic variation, the conceptual emphasis seemed to be strictly copied over the years. The curriculums under examination appeared to let the teachers design high intellectually demanding tasks to teach science knowledge and epistemic practices, however, to a certain extent. It is concluded that the sharp decreases in the number of objectives observed in the abstraction zone may hinder teachers from generating teaching environments where students can transfer acquired knowledge and practices to external contexts. Educational recommendations are offered in the sense of curriculum development and teacher education.

AB  - A game-based approach is widely used to increase students' motivation through their active participation, whereby research is interwoven with fun and competition is incorporated with cooperation. Working in teams or groups encourages students to exchange their opinions, to try to find solutions together or to win a game. In this way, they learn and improve skills such as collaboration and responsibility. Several activities involving the 5E model as part of inquiry-based science education and an escape room as part of game-based learning were used in science classes (chemistry, biology and physics). The activities were designed on three different topics - gases, ecology and electrical circuits - within the project "Diversity in Science towards Social Inclusion - Non-formal Education in Science for Students' Diversity". The activities focused on the students' self-concept towards science, interest in the subject, motivation and career aspirations in STEM, as well as the effectiveness of the implemented activities. The study aimed to assess the potential advantages of implementing activities in an ethnically diverse environment, benefiting both students and teachers. Pre- and post-questionnaires were designed and distributed to 190 students from various primary and secondary schools in Macedonia. The present paper provides an overview of game-based activities as well as a brief analysis of the pre- and post-questionnaire responses from students, focusing on the topic of ecology.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the trend of studies in the laboratory and put the current situation in Turkey. For this purpose, document analysis technique, one of the qualitative research methods, was used in the research. The data group of the research consists of thesis studies on laboratories in our country between 1999-2017. Theses in the fields of science, physics, chemistry, and biology have been determined and themes and sub-themes have been created through the keywords of these theses. Then, frequency tables were created according to the themes and sub-themes created. According to the findings obtained, it was seen that the traditional laboratory approach and inquiry-based laboratory approaches are compared in the studies. It was determined that the studies were done on physics subjects and it was determined that complementary measurement and evaluation studies performed for performance evaluation were used in very few numbers. In addition, it was concluded that the keywords did not give enough information about the studies. In this context, it can be suggested to examine the effectiveness of these approaches according to each other and experiment types by examining the approaches in which students can be more active in laboratories.

AB  - This study explored the effect of conventional laboratory practical manuals on pre-service teachers' integrated science process skills (ISPS). A validated multiple-choice questionnaire with the ISPS components was used to collect data. No significant difference between pre-service subject-specific teachers' (biology, physics and chemistry) ISPS scores was found. The ISPS scores significantly increased along with proliferation in lab practical works, except for physics. Pre-service math teachers, who had no lab practical works, showed significantly higher ISPS scores than pre-service science teachers. The results indicated that all pre-service teachers' ISPS scores fell into intermediate level. Further, it was found that they possessed the lowest scores for such ISPS as identifying and controlling variable, stating operational definition and designing experiments. The common format of the conventional laboratory manual adopted from many universities need to be reformatted for engage learners in all ISPS. To improve learners' ISPS, higher-order thinking assignments should be intensively given to them.

AB  - Teaching a foreign language in the process of preparing future teachers is guided by the needs of the modern school system, in which reforms are being actively implemented. The meta-subject approach at school serves as the basis for planning learning outcomes. For example, in biology, foreign language, and physics classes, students are not only expected to know the laws and principles of a particular field of science but also to be able to embed this knowledge into an integral system of worldviews. The implementation of the idea of tri-lingualism in school education increases the role of a foreign language in the cognitive process of students. When using the meta-subject approach, English serves not only the communication needs but also for contributes in the development of meta-cognitive processes. The study of natural disciplines in Kazakh pedagogical universities is carried out not only in the Kazakh and Russian languages, but also in English. Future teachers of biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics ought to master the basics of the natural sciences and methods of teaching them, by using the knowledge of a foreign language as a source of relevant scientific facts. This article analyzes the possibilities of a meta-subject approach in the practice of teaching a foreign language to future teachers of natural sciences. By substantiating the concept of the meta-subject potential of a foreign language, the main categories associated with meta-cognition through diagnosing students' readiness to use these ideas, one can build a foreign language education program for future teachers.

AB  - Students cannot learn in chaotic, badly managed classrooms. In the first years of teaching experiences, teachers revealed that novice teachers came to recognize the importance of discipline skills and classroom management for effective instruction. The purpose of the study was (i) to develop Science teachers' views towards classroom management scale and (ii) to determine science teachers' views towards classroom management. Further, identifying the views of the science teachers on people management, behavior management and instructional management were purposes of the study. In total 130 secondary school science teacher candidates (Physics and Biology pre-service teachers) voluntarily participate in the study. Results of the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) showed that 3-factor structure. After that, another data set was constituted for Confirmatory Factor Analysis. In total 253 elementary school science teachers' responses were included the data analysis process. For the main study, 3 cities (Sanliurfa, Usak and Afyon) were determined from a larger population. Convenience sampling was used. Teachers' teaching experience and gender do not have a statistically significant effect on people management, behavior management and instructional management.

AB  - The study aimed at detecting the level of reflective teaching practices used by science teachers in classrooms. It sought to examine the potential alteration of these practices in terms of some variables, namely gender, qualification, experience, and load. The population consisted of all science teachers of physics, chemistry, and biology in the Bani Kenana educational directorate, Jordan. A representative sample of 256 teachers participated in this research work. The study adopted a twenty-seven-item questionnaire for data collection, used the SPSS program for data analysis, and provided statistical measures. The results indicated that the degree of employment of reflective teaching practices by science teachers was somewhat low but also varied depending on the kind of questions raised. They also demonstrated that there were statistically significant differences at the level of ([alpha] = 0.05) in the degree of employment of reflective teaching practices due to teachers' gender. However, the results also showed that there were no statistically significant differences for the variables of qualification, experience and load. Henceforth, the study recommended the urgent need of providing teachers with professional development programs for instructing them and raising their awareness of the utility of reflective teaching practices. The study also recommended the supplementation of all disciplinary teacher guides with efficient mechanisms for furthering reflective teaching practices.

AB  - This study aimed to identify the trends in the studies conducted on Educational Augmented Reality (AR). 105 articles found in ERIC, EBSCOhost and ScienceDirect databases were reviewed with this purpose in mind. Analyses displayed that the number of educational AR studies has increased over the years. Quantitative methods were mostly preferred in those articles and educational AR was often found to be used in science education (physics, chemistry and biology), engineering education and medical training. The reviewed articles showed that "undergraduate students" were used as samples for most of the time, the most often preferred sample size was between "31-100" and "surveys" were the most utilized data collection tools. While the majority of the articles used marker-based AR as AR type, mobile devices were utilized in many of these articles as the delivery technology. It is believed that the results obtained in this study will light the way for future research.

AB  - This study examines the perceptions of Jordanian science teachers' conceptions of assessment, and how these perceptions are affected by the teacher's gender, length of experience, and subject variables. The teacher conception of the assessment questionnaire was completed by 488 teachers. It consisted of 27 items spread over four dimensions: school accountability, student accountability, assessment improves education, and assessment is irrelevant. Results showed a high mean for assessment being irrelevant, followed by assessment improving education, student accountability, and school accountability. The results also showed significant differences in the teachers' perception of school accountability by gender, as the female teachers' mean score was higher than that of the males. There were significant differences in the perception of assessment that improves education, again by the teacher's gender, with female teachers scoring higher. The results showed no significant differences in the perception of any of the dimensions according to the length of teaching experience. Finally, there were significant differences in perceptions of assessment in student accountability according to the subject, the mean score for physics teachers being higher than that for chemistry and biology teachers. Perceptions of assessment improving education and assessment being irrelevant, also varied according to the subject, the mean score for mathematics teachers being higher than that of the chemistry, biology, and physics teachers.

AB  - Undergraduate students often lack opportunities to comprehend, present, and produce scientific literature as part of their regular curriculum. In courses that have already been already developed, students either analyzed a few journal articles and/or studied disciplinary content typically with the assistance of a textbook. In this study, I have developed a course that primarily relies on scientific literature to introduce interdisciplinary science in the intersection of biology and physics. Here, students not only learned content knowledge through literature, but also how to thoroughly analyze about 20 journal articles published in top-tier journals in the field. Students demonstrate their understanding of the content matter through weekly assignments, oral presentations, and a written review article.

AB  - This study attempted to predict physics, chemistry, and biology and math course achievements of vocational high school students according to the variables of student self-efficacy, academic self-efficacy, state anxiety and trait anxiety. Study data were collected using a questionnaire administered to the students of a vocational high school located in Ankara, the capital city of Turkey. According to the results of the study, academic self-efficacy perceptions of students predicted achievement in physics, chemistry and math courses. Achievement in biology course, on the other hand, was predicted by student self-efficacy. When the results were examined according to the anxiety variable, trait anxiety was detected to predict physics course achievement and state anxiety to predict math course achievement. Study results showed that types and effects of anxiety and self-efficacy variables vary depending on the characteristics and nature of courses.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the beliefs and attitudes of 36 science teachers (biology, physics and chemistry) in six high schools in Ankara towards the use of Interactive White Boards (IWB). Of these, three teachers from each school were chosen for interview and classroom observations according to their questionnaire results with purposeful sampling method. The results were analyzed with descriptive statistics and qualitative data analysis methods. According to the results, teachers agree that using IWBs facilitate reaching different sources and display them to the whole class immediately. Teachers describe the common use of IWBs as showing visual materials, videos and animations in science classes. The majority of teachers enjoy using the IWB technology and express positive feelings about it. Most teachers state that they follow the advances in educational technology regularly. Since the frequencies are approximately equal, no meaningful difference was found between teachers with different majors on staying current with technology. The findings show that biology and chemistry teachers use IWB more frequently than physics teachers. Although the teachers have positive attitudes towards the use of IWBs, it was seen that most of them do not feel comfortable while using them in the classrooms. The interviews indicate the reason for that as insufficient in-service trainings. [Paper presented at the 8th International Computer and Instructional Technologies Symposium.]

AB  - Formative assessment (FA) is considered a powerful tool to enhance learning. However, there have been few studies addressing how the implementation of FA influences the development of inquiry skills so far. This research intends to determine the efficacy of teaching using FA in the development of students' inquiry skills. A test of inquiry skills was used as the main research instrument to identify the level of the selected inquiry skills before and after a period of teaching with or without FA in the experimental and control group respectively. In the experimental group (n=73), FA was implemented across five subjects: biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and informatics, while the control group (n=48) was taught without any external intervention. In both groups, mostly teacher-centred methods of teaching were applied. The research findings confirmed a low initial level of inquiry skills. Teaching using FA showed higher efficacy than teaching without FA, even without a special focus on the inquiry methods. The experimental group achieved significantly better results compared to the control group. In addition, the results confirmed higher efficacy of FA in lower performing students. Gender did not prove as a determining factor in the effective implementation of FA.

AB  - The objective of this study is to understand how the perception of teachers might change after they participate in a training program on the use of non-formal educational places (NFEP). The design of the study is ethnographic and its methodology is qualitative. The study comprehends the analysis of three multiple cases according to the disciplinary area, including teachers of primary education, biology, and physics. The analysis was focused on the discourse of the participants, establishing eight categories which were previously validated through triangulation by time and by instruments. The study concludes that the participants were able to restructure their ideas about the use of NFEP for teaching, showing mainly ontological and epistemological changes, which are discussed in the paper.

AB  - One of the basic science process skills, number and space relation, is used to transform a twodimensional object into a three-dimensional shape or express symmetry axis of the objects. The aim of this research was to determine the number and space relation skills of pre-service science teachers in order to train more qualified science teachers equipped with 21st century skills. The participants were 60 pre-service science teachers, first year students studying in a science education program in a state university located in the Black Sea region of Turkey. The study was conducted in the 2017 fall semester. Integrative Perception Test (IPT) was prepared by researchers to collect data. Within the scope of the IPT, textbooks specific to the field of science were scanned. Then, textbooks' visuals without symmetrical structure in physics, chemistry, and biology subfields were identified and listed. During the application, participants were asked to complete the missing half of the visual images by using their imagination and three-dimensional perceptions from their visual memories. The data obtained from the test with 30 images (i.e., 10 physics images, 10 chemistry images, and 10 biology images) were descriptively analyzed. Participants received two points for completed images, one point for images with missing parts, and zero points for incorrect/empty images. Results showed that the chemistry test average of the participants was the highest. Furthermore, it was observed that pre-service science teachers were especially successful on the topics of diffraction of waves and formation of shadow in physics, states of matter and acid-base indicators in chemistry, and the structure of DNA in biology, but it was also evaluated that their general number and space relation skills were in an average level. Results suggest that new studies with different age groups or using symmetrical images in teaching new concepts can be useful.

AB  - Content and language integrated learning (CLIL) is still a growing area of research. In this study, we investigated the effect of a one-semester CLIL intervention combined with English language instruction on university students' general English skills the associations between institutional and individual factors and views on CLIL. A total of 105 students from two academic programs (biology-chemistry, and physic-informatics) at a private university in Kazakhstan participated in the study. Quantitative data were collected through two different instruments. MANOVA and correlation analyses were carried out to analyze the data. A large effect of CLIL combined with language instruction was observed on language gains. Additionally, the study identified two factors that are significantly associated with student recognition of higher language and disciplinary knowledge learning, more positive attitudes to and higher satisfaction with CLIL: being a non-first-year student and having CLIL experience in pre-university education. In light of the results obtained, our findings reinforce the case for integrating language instruction that includes general, academic, and subject-specific goals in English-medium programs and courses in higher education.

AB  - This research probed the perceptions of secondary school science teachers concerning the objective and utility of assessment, exploring the influences of gender, teaching experience, and specific science subject components. A total of 100 secondary school teachers from Selangor participated in the study, completing the Teacher's Conception of Assessment (TCoA) online questionnaire. This instrument comprised 27 statements categorized into four key aspects: Improvement, Irrelevance, School Accountability, and Student Accountability. Interestingly, the data revealed that the highest mean score was attributed to the irrelevance of assessments (M=4.44; SD=0.86), followed by assessment for improvement (M=4.21; SD=0.95), student accountability (M=4.18; SD=1.32), and lastly, school accountability (M=4.15; SD=1.44). A closer examination of the data pointed towards significant gender-based differences in teachers' perceptions of institutional accountability and educational enhancement through assessments, with female and male teachers scoring higher in these respective areas. However, the length of teaching experience did not appear to significantly affect the teachers' perceptions across any of the assessed parameters. There were noteworthy differences in teachers' perceptions of student accountability in assessments when evaluated based on the subject taught, with Biology teachers reporting higher mean scores as compared to Chemistry and Physics teachers. Additionally, teachers' perceptions regarding the improvement role of assessments and their irrelevance differed significantly across subjects, with general science teachers attaining higher mean scores than Chemistry, Biology, and Physics teachers. The findings of this study shed light on teachers' understanding of assessment, particularly in the field of Science, and serve as a valuable resource for all educational stakeholders. By understanding teachers' perceptions, policymakers and school administrators can make informed decisions that would potentially enhance teaching and learning processes.

AB  - In this study, the attitudes of physics, chemistry and biology teachers towards constructivist approach were investigated in terms of participants' demographic information (e.g. subject area, professional seniority, education, participation to in-service training or not…). In total, 1958 teachers, who are working at high schools of Turkish Ministry of National Education in different cities, from all aforementioned subject areas participated in the study. The constructivist approach questionnaire used in the study was developed by Balim, Kesercioglu, Inel and Evrekli (2002). Aforementioned questionnaire is designed in 5-point Likert type and consists of 20 items, which are divided into three factors. The Cronbach-Alpha reliability of sub-factors of the questionnaire is 0.93, 0.91 and 0.90 respectively. Demographic information used in the study was formed by the participants. The results of the study revealed that there is a positive correlation between the attitudes of the teachers towards constructivist approach and their demographic information, and the findings have been reported.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to comparatively investigate the efficacy levels of pre-service science (Science, Biology, Physics, and Chemistry) teachers enrolled at the Undergraduate Program of Science Teacher Education and Pedagogical Formation Program. A total of 275 pre-service teachers who were studying in different programmes in the Faculty of Education, Ömer Halisdemir University composed the study group of the research in which the general survey model was used. "Teachers' Sense of Efficacy Scale" developed by Tschannen-Moran & Hoy (2001) and adapted to Turkish by Çapa, Çakiroglu & Sarikaya (2005) was used as the data collection tool in the research. As a result of the study, it was concluded that pre-service teachers' level of professional efficacy was high. In addition, it was determined that while pre-service teachers' level of professional efficacy did not significantly differ based on gender, their efficacy showed differences depending on the program they were studying at and their active teaching status.

AB  - The mass-approach in higher education promotes the broadening of students' number and diversity therefore the question about the young people's readiness to adapt to studies becomes more and more topical. Students who enrol in the natural science faculties of the University of Latvia (UL) are motivated and have high assessment in biology and chemistry as school subjects. However, the studies already during the 1st term prove that students encounter problems to get adjusted to the study process. In order to find out the key factors that determine the adaptation of the first-year students to studies, an e-questionnaire was developed and 79 students from the Faculty of Chemistry and Faculty of Biology were surveyed. Institutional and personal factors that are focused on the application of transferable skills are mainly those that affect the students' adaptation in the first term of studies. At the same time such issues of the academic factor as students' prior knowledge in biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics and their skill to learn independently are intrinsic for students' successful studies.

AB  - Primary school teachers need adequate professional knowledge and motivational orientations to qualify scientifically and technologically literate students. Previous studies have focused on the impact of coursework on (pre-service) primary teachers' content knowledge, rather than on the development of academic self-concepts. In addition, the influence of the course format and the major field of study has not been investigated much to this date. Thus, this study examines the effects of an interdisciplinary course on pre-service primary teachers' content knowledge and academic self-concepts in science and technology using a quasi-experimental, quantitative, pre-post-follow-up design (n = 202). Whilst no significant changes in knowledge were revealed for the baseline group not participating in the course, significant short-term and long-term cognitive gains were found for the experimental group. Biology-, chemistry-, physics- and technology-related self-concepts increased significantly when participating in the course. The results also indicate that the course format and major field of study can have an impact on the development of pre-service teachers' professional knowledge. Regarding the development of academic self-concepts in the experimental group, it can be assumed that both the weekly and block course format are beneficial for heterogeneous learner groups consisting of pre-service teachers with different major fields of study.

AB  - Since 2017, Jackson State University's (JSU) Minority Advancement through Recruitment and Retention in Science via Outreach Program (MARRS-OP) developed a series of professional development (PD) programs designed for 6th-12th science teachers in under-resourced Mississippi school districts. Due to COVID-19, MARRS-OP's original program design was modified to implement innovative online PD courses, designed to expand and sustain the reach of STEM teaching and learning opportunities -- particularly for lab experiments. The PD topics included science-subject-based courses centered around equity, science, and technology. Tools for assessing MARRS-OP outcomes included a remote readiness screener for data collection, pre- and post-program survey data collection, and teacher presentation reviews. Despite an array of challenges, teachers reported statistically significant increases in confidence in their ability to teach biology and physics. Teachers also saw value in remote PD, as it provided the ability to experience virtual instruction from their students' perspective, and the opportunity to collaborate with other teachers and expand their network. This article shows that by preparing science teachers to customize approaches for their students, and maintain flexibility, that initiatives such as MARRS-OP can serve as an empowering resource for teachers despite the accessibility and engagement challenges encountered by the sudden shift to online pedagogy.

AB  - Science teacher's self-efficacy has been at the center of many investigations on students' achievement in science, teacher burnout, and teacher performance. While overly studied, this construct has not been examined with scientific literacy in depth. Thus, this study aims to identify the influence of science teacher's scientific literacy on their science teaching efficacy through a canonical correlation analysis. The study utilized an explanatory-correlational research design to unravel the correlation between scientific literacy and science teaching efficacy. It was found out that scientific literacy was correlated with science teaching efficacy. Further the study revealed that Science, Technology, and Society (STS) and content knowledge in earth science, life science, and health science were positively associated with science teachers' self-efficacy in biology, chemistry, and physics. On the other hand, knowledge in physics and Nature of Science (NOS) were not associated as highlighted in the literature. This suggests that a science teacher's content knowledge in specific sciences predicts their efficacy in teaching science. More so, the teacher's knowledge of how science and technology affect society and how society directs science and technology shapes their confidence to teach science. This implies that practical and observable science allows teachers to demonstrate science concepts to their students effectively.

AB  - This study, which was based on qualitative research design, aimed to examine the research trends and results of bibliometric mapping analyses of articles about the Flipped Classroom Model (FCM) in education in the past ten years. For this purpose, 126 articles published with the keywords; flipped classroom, education, social science, science, chemistry, biology, and physics between the years of 2010-2019 were accessed through the Web of Science database. Out of these 126 articles, 63 were selected using criterion sampling model for the bibliometric and the content analysis. As a result of the bibliometric analysis, it was seen that the most frequently mentioned keywords were flipped classroom, active learning, and chemical education with many of them focusing more on "motivation". EducationThe result of the content analysis showed that the variables included not only "motivation" and "perception" but also "academic achievement/performance" as the most common topics in the studies. The results also revealed that the most commonly used data collecting instruments were achievement tests, questionnaires and scales; the most commonly preferred sample groups were university students; and the most commonly utilized research design was the quantitative method.

AB  - A case study entitled 'New Age Atlantis or Mysterious Seventh Continent' was developed as an exemplar model to show how the teaching methods and themes of Global Education (GE) can be used in geography lessons. The main intent of this article is to share an example of good practice about the use of this case study in geography lessons in Czechia. The aim of the study was twofold: to develop an understanding about how plastics contribute to ocean pollution, as a serious and current ecological topic in Global Education; as well as to show how the characteristics and movement of ocean water are related to the topic of ocean pollution. The main research goal was to study how pupils were able to put their skills and knowledge in practice by fulfilling the objective of the teaching activity -- to understand global ocean pollution. The teaching activity is based on methods which develop principles of critical thinking, learning by living, brainstorming, discussion, and group teaching. The teaching activity also allows for cross-curricular links to occur between school geography and other subjects including biology, physics, civic education, ecological education, and personal and social education. The teaching activities for the 'New Age Atlantis' case study is aimed at pupils aged between 12 to 15 years. The case study results confirm that as pupils collaborate and communicate with their peers and teachers, they learn to critically accept the opinions of others and, at the same time, to defend their own opinions. All of the pupils were able to understand and recognize the problem at hand.

AB  - This study on the Estonian lower secondary (7-9th grade) science curricula, is seen as an important framework for educators preparing students as tomorrow's citizens able to reflect on sustainable energy development. As the curriculum is taken to be the major document allowing insights into Estonian educational standards, this study identifies components within the intended lower secondary science curricula for subjects of biology, chemistry, earth science, physics, and interdisciplinary science. Using document analysis, verbs associated with career-related learning outcomes are detected, allowing the relatedness of the energy conceptualizations and determination of their cognitive level utilizing SOLO (Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes) taxonomy. A team of coders identify a total of 782 learning outcomes across three learning domains: psychomotor (176), affective (32), cognitive (574) at unistructural (33), multistructural (225), relational (276), and extended abstract (40) levels. The majority of energy concept learning outcomes (274) are identified in the source (form) and transfer (transform) categories. Very few career-related learning outcomes are detected with the science education relevance dimensions (individual, societal, career). The suitability of the findings is discussed. The current analyzing method can be applied to other educational disciplines for raising awareness of disciplinary crosscutting concepts.

AB  - In this study, the aim is to analyze opinions of engineering students on science literacy. Research participants constitute of a total of 143 students attending construction engineering department in a university located in the Eastern Black Sea region of Turkey. In this study in which survey model was adopted, data obtained through a form containing open-ended questions were analyzed using the content analysis method. Engineering students defined science literacy mostly as "knowing, understanding, interpreting science subjects", "constantly following scientific and technological developments related to science", "making academic studies, writing articles in fields of physics, chemistry and biology" and "receiving or having received education related to science". Students indicated that physical sciences had application especially in the field of engineering, they are cornerstone of the engineering profession, and thus physical sciences are important. Students mostly indicated that laboratory applications were important for science literacy since they ensured practical learning, gaining experience, effective and lasting learning, seeing that theoretical knowledge worked in real life, making learning easy, concretization and allowing transformation of theory into practice. In line with research findings, it was seen that engineering students defined science literacy generally in accordance with literature, and in higher years, students' definitions of science literacy varied.

AB  - The study sought to determine the relationship between problem-solving skills and measure of working memory and attention span of science students of low ability level. The study adopted correlational survey research design. The population for the study comprised all Secondary School I (SSI) that offered physics, chemistry and biology as school subjects in all the public senior secondary schools in the study area for 2017/2018 academic session while the sample was 450 science students from 24 Senior Secondary Schools in the study area. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) backward digit span task and Attention Lapses Clicker (ALC) were used for data collection. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyse data used to answer the research questions and test null hypotheses at 0.05 level of significance. Findings revealed that low percentage variation in students' problem-solving skills in science can be attributed to measure of working memory and attention span. There exist no significant relationship between measure of working memory, attention span and the combination of working memory and attention span of students. It was recommended among others that science teachers should vary concentration spans of science students by inherently mimicking the same kind of cognitive gear shift in the activities that require creative problem-solving skills and thinking, Also interventions and accommodation need be designed by school administrators to help science teachers differentiate instruction with explanations on how techniques or strategies can address students with working memory difficulty and attention deficits in the classroom.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the validity and reliability of the Nanotechnology Awareness Scale (NAI) in Turkish culture. The study group consists of 624 biology, physics and chemistry teachers working in secondary schools in Antalya, Denizli, Burdur and Ankara. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were conducted in order to determine its structural validity. Cronbach-alpha and stratified-alpha coefficient values were calculated for the reliability of the sub-dimensions and the whole of the scale, respectively. In EFA, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) value was found to be 0.92 and the Bartlett Test result (912 91 = 6519.27, p <0.00) was found significant. In addition, in original scale, a two-factor structure was found. This two factors solution explains 59.192% of the total variance. In CFA, factor structure of the scale was tested for two-factor solution as it was designed. According to the findings, it was found that the scale, containing 14 items with two sub-dimensions, had sufficient goodness of fit indices such as X[superscript 2]/sd =1.344, RMSEA = 0.07, GFI = 0.97, CFI = 0.97, NFI = 0.90 and AGFI = 0.83. These goodness of fit indices shows that we have good model-data fit. The Stratified-alpha coefficient was found as 0.942 for the whole scale. Cronbach alpha coefficient was found as 0.935 and 0.805 for the awareness sub-dimension and exposure sub-dimension, respectively. As a result of the research, it was concluded that the Turkish version of the scale can be used as a valid and reliable measurement tool.

AB  - The cell is the fundamental basis for understanding biology much like the atom is the fundamental basis for understanding physics. Understanding biology requires the understanding of the fundamental functions performed by components within each cell. These components, or organelles, responsible for both maintenance and functioning of the cell comprise to form a dynamically stable ecosystem. The secret of achieving this noble and desirable efficiency rely on the structural and functional variations of the organelles within the cell; they each carry out specific jobs within the cell resulting in a smooth, running process that would be the envy of any industrial manager. In this role-playing learning activity, we aim to engage students in deep learning that leads to cognitive and conceptual change by forcing them to be and to actively act as those organelles within the cell. It is centered on the idea that a number of organelles within the eukaryotic cells are strongly "protesting" the "privilege" that mitochondria and chloroplasts have within the living cells (both in single and multi-cellular organisms). They are protesting the structural and functional privileges that other organelles lack, but the mitochondria and chloroplasts have. Students will have to understand and explore the reasons for the differences among all the organelles and how they differ in importance and function, especially in regards to interactions between organelles within each cell and how it contributes to the life of the cell as a whole. After all, as it has been stated by NGS (2007) "a human cell reveals our inner architecture" (p. 40).

AB  - Socioscientific issues (SSIs) have a scientific basis, have a dilemma in their nature and are often discussed under political and social influences. Teachers perceive SSIs as a difficult subject to teach. This project was carried out to guide teachers in overcoming this difficulty and to enable them to include practices that they can adapt more easily to their lessons. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the views of science teachers on the teaching of SSIs and the project carried out within the scope of a funding project for teaching SSIs. The study was designed according to a single-group pre-test post-test experimental design. The study group the study comprises teachers from different branches of science (15 middle school science teachers, four biology teachers, three physics teachers and two chemistry teachers) from various provinces of Türkiye. As the data collection tools of the study, the Project Participation Form, the Scale of Views on Teaching Socioscientific Issues, the Know-Want-Learn Form and the Project Evaluation Form were used. Quantitative and qualitative data analysis methods were used together in the evaluation of the data. Because of the study, the implemented project activities contributed to the development of the participants' views on the teaching of SSIs and caused a positive development in their views on the project. Suggestions were made considering the results of the project so that guidance could be provided for teachers and teacher educators.

AB  - Considering that Mathematics is a multidimensional problem-solving method that can be effective in all areas of cultural life, it is of great importance because of its contribution to other sciences such as physical and social sciences. It is known that the basic concepts of mathematics, which can also be expressed as a way of life, have helped to increase the usefulness of mathematics to practical and even social sciences such as physics, chemistry, biology, economics, engineering and military, as well as their own values. In addition, if abstract subjects and concepts in mathematics are used in other sciences, concrete results can be obtained, which facilitate the labor of humans. In this case, it is useful to illustrate the mathematics of everyday life in order to understand the importance of mathematics. The word "function," which is often used in everyday life as in mathematics, is one of the basic concepts in mathematics. Relating the learned knowledge and the acquired skills related to this concept to everyday life can affect the memory duration of learned knowledge and subsequent learning. Considering the importance of the subject, a case study has been conducted with (62) students. In the study, the definition of the function and two daily life examples related to the definition were presented to the candidates in black and white. The candidates were asked to make the definition of the types of functions presented to make sampling from daily life by making analogies. Content analysis was used in the analysis of the data. In the study, it was determined that the candidates could not go beyond the ordinary in writing samples. In addition, the success rates of candidates' ability to define and write daily life examples have been quite different.

AB  - Self-efficacy plays a key role in determining teaching practices. Still, concerns regarding the low science self-efficacy beliefs held by elementary teachers have raised questions about the effectiveness of teacher preparation programs. Previous research has been restricted to labeling preservice elementary teachers as having high, medium, or low science teaching self-efficacy. Few extended efforts have been made to clearly distinguish preservice elementary teachers' subject-specific lack of confidence in teaching science. The present study aimed to investigate preservice elementary teachers' subject-specific self-efficacy in teaching science using a mixed-method research design. The participants included 55 preservice elementary teachers at a university in the United States. Quantitative data were collected using the Beliefs About Teaching instrument, and interviews were used to collect qualitative data. The results showed that the participants had the highest self-efficacy level in biology, followed by earth science, chemistry, and physics. Four themes emerged from the participants' reasons for feeling more confident in teaching biology concepts than physics: education experience, teacher experience, subject comprehension, and subject relevance. This study highlights the essential role played by teacher preparation programs in providing ample opportunities for preservice elementary teachers to develop a strong understanding of the content and teaching methods of all science subjects.

AB  - In this paper educators provide a valuable feedback in the use of concept maps in secondary education. More specifically their use in teaching dyslexic students Science. Almost 100 educators replied to an online questionnaire after they studied a set of evaluation sheets provided to them based on concept maps. We will begin with a brief presentation of the specific learning difficulty of dyslexia; following that are the main general characteristics and challenges that dyslexic students face. Also, the organization of Science classes for the dyslexic student is briefly discussed. Then information regarding concept maps is given. A presentation and quick discussion of four evaluation sheets with concept maps in the science subjects of Chemistry, Biology and Physics is performed. The main part of this paper presents the questionnaire along with a discussion regarding its results. Finally, conclusion are drawn and future work is mentioned.

AB  - Significant gendered performance differences are signals of systemic inequity in higher education. Understanding of these inequities has been hampered by the local nature of prior studies; consistent measures of performance disparity across many disciplines and institutions have not been available. Here, we report the first wide-ranging, multi-institution measures of gendered performance difference, examining more than a million student enrollments in hundreds of courses at five universities. After controlling for factors that relate to academic performance using optimal matching, we identify patterns of gendered performance difference that are consistent across these universities. Biology, chemistry, physics, accounting, and economics lecture courses regularly exhibit gendered performance differences that are statistically and materially significant, whereas lab courses in the same subjects do not. These results reinforce the importance of broad investigation of performance disparities across higher education. They also help focus equity research on the structure and evaluative schemes of these lecture courses.

AB  - Adolescents are considered as a nutritionally vulnerable subgroup because of their alimentary behaviours. Considering that alimentary habits are strongly influenced by knowledge about digestion, an experiment was conducted with aim to determine whether conceptual understanding and functionalization of this knowledge can be improved by the interdisciplinary teaching approach. The experiment encompassed 258 students attending the fourth year of high school. No statistically significant difference in the level of the previously acquired chemistry, biology and physics knowledge concerning digestion between the two groups was determined on the pre-test. Conversely, the students in the experimental group significantly outperformed those in the control group on the post-test that required a deep understanding and the application of knowledge about digestion in solving real-life problems. Therefore, it was concluded that high-school teachers can be advised to apply the interdisciplinary teaching approach in order to improve their students' knowledge about this process.

AB  - This study explored the teacher knowledge manifestation of Integrated Science (IS) teachers who have specialised in Chemistry, Biology or Physics during their pre-service teacher education. 60 experienced Integrated Science teachers responded to an 'Integrated Science Teacher Knowledge' questionnaire which embraced different dimensions of teacher knowledge. The results of the study indicate that the IS teachers have a common set of knowledge, skills, and dispositions that are, in their professional opinion, needed and in some instances, would enable them to teach IS. The research participants had considerable knowledge as well as clear views about what it meant for them to be IS teachers. It however should be noted that there was a marked variance in the perception of the three cohorts of teachers towards teaching through Practical Work, importance of pre-service teacher education specialisation towards teaching IS and knowledge of students' culture. This study provides contextual inputs to effective IS teacher education re-alignment informed by the IS teacher practitioners, those with the craft knowledge of the contextual environment of the IS classrooms.

AB  - The significance of illusion as a positive force in everyday life has been underestimated in both societal discourse and in empirical science. The objective of this study is to provide a synthesis of many academic disciplines' understanding of illusion and reality by proposing a taxonomy of functional and dysfunctional subjective realities as based on the assumption that the human mind is adaptive in an evolutionary sense and likely to be a quantum entanglement system. Assumptions and discussions needed to construct the taxonomy are generally based on empirical research drawing from evolutionary theory, neurology, biology, anthropology, psychology, psychiatry, physics and other disciplines. The purpose of the proposed taxonomy is heuristic, serving as a base for further studies drawing particular attention to the fact that, by evolutionary processes, Homo sapiens have been made dependent on multiple subjective realities where illusion and reality are not necessarily opposites. The article is concluded by discussing possible reasons for why illusions as a positive force in human behaviour has been neglected in comparison to the dysfunctions of the human mind of which research abound.

AB  - Using their cross-disciplinary review of "Ideas that Work in College Teaching," the authors explore the pedagogical commonalities of fifteen higher education instructors from SUNY Potsdam (State University of New York at Potsdam) in an attempt to reveal the secrets of teaching success across thirteen academic disciplines--math, computer science, geology, modern languages, political science, philosophy, history, biology, psychology, sociology, physics, and art. While the specific instructional disciplines varied considerably in the content that was both studied and presented, the authors found that the principles of effective teaching were quite similar across each of these disciplines. The insights shared by these fifteen accomplished instructors provide pedagogical wisdom that all teachers can learn from regardless of context or developmental age and stage of student capability and competence. Common goals and principles associated with effective teaching in higher education are highlighted using specific examples from individual authors where appropriate. A new model of instruction is then introduced: Attention, Interact, Apply, Invite -- Fact, Think, Feel, Do (AIAI-FTFD), as a potential start-to-finish approach to effective teaching in higher education. Implications for use of the model in both national and international higher education contexts are discussed.

AB  - Since the advent of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) programs, first in K-12 and now in college curricula, many variants of STEM have arisen to include other disciplines in developing cross-disciplinary literacy among students. This paper briefly defines our own variant STE[A]M branch within the context of cross-disciplinary teaching and learning and then describes an interdisciplinary course, The Science in Science Fiction, in which professors of Biology, English, and Physics provided a range of science fiction texts which undergraduate and graduate students studied and discussed in depth. Students then produced and presented collaborative cross-disciplinary research on topics of their choice from the course work. Finally, students provided input on their experiences with collaborative cross-disciplinary teaching and learning. The overall effect was extremely positive. This article provides a framework for other faculty who would like to model this approach.

AB  - This study aimed at performing content analysis and meta-analysis on dissertations related to brain-based learning in science education to find out the general trend and tendency of brain-based learning in science education and find out the effect of such studies on achievement and attitude of learners with the ultimate aim of raising awareness about increasing brain-based learning in science education in Turkey. The study was carried out with document analysis, which is one of the non-interactive qualitative research methods. Study sample consisted of 21 dissertations related to the effect of brain-based learning in science education. Both content analysis and meta-analysis were performed on the dissertations. The content analysis was carried out by using the "Paper Classification Form" by Sözbilir, Kutu & Yasar (2012). In the second stage, a meta-analysis of the relevant dissertations was performed to determine the effect of brain-based learning on achievement and attitude. It was found out that brain-based learning is mostly applied in science and technology education (66,67 %) at secondary level-I; some studies, though few, are conducted in biology (23,81 %) and physics (4,76 %) education; however, no study is available in the field of chemistry education at secondary level-II and primary education. It was also found out that teaching is the most frequently studied subject matter (80,95 %), of these dissertations, 48,57 % aimed at investigating the effect of this learning model on students' achievement and 40 % about the effect of the same on students' attitude, interest and so on. Moreover, it was seen that brain-based learning research in science education is mostly conducted with quantitative research methods (90,58%), most of which (76,20 %) employs the quasi-experimental method. In relation with study sample; 76,19 % of the studies are carried out at secondary level-I (5-8 grades) with 31 to 100 participants (76,19 %). It was revealed that in data analysis, descriptive analysis as a type of quantitative data analysis is used the most (57,65%), which covers percentile, frequency (24,71 %) and the mean, standard deviation, etc. (23,53 %); while inferential statistics (31.76%) includes t-tests at the highest frequency (17,65%). According to the meta-analysis results, the effect of brain-based learning on achievement in science education is calculated to be 1.382, which is high or wide, and the effect on attitude is 0.466, middle, according to the random effect model. These results indicate a positive and significant effect of brain-based learning approach on achievement and attitude of learners. Based on the study results, it is suggested that brain-based learning should be more widespread in the fields of chemistry, physics and biology and primary education and that qualitative and mixed research as well as quantitative research methodology should be done for obtaining reliable, valid and in-depth results in the future.

AB  - As the Philippines moves towards implementing the K-12 curriculum, there has been a mismatch in teacher preparation in science. The present teacher education curriculum prepares science teachers to specialise in a specific field (e.g. integrated science, biology, chemistry, and physics). However, in the K-12 curriculum, they are required to teach all the sciences in a spiral progression approach. Hence, this study analysed the experiences of science teachers in teaching chemistry in the K-12 curriculum in order to identify their challenges and how they are overcoming them. Findings suggest that the teacher's content, pedagogy, and assessment in chemistry are problematic; specifically, challenges such as instruction-related factors, teacher competence, in-service training sufficiency, job satisfaction, support from upper management, laboratory adequacy, school resources, assessment tools, and others influence teacher success in teaching chemistry. These identified challenges greatly affect the ultimate beneficiaries of education, which is the learner.

AB  - The use of transdisciplinary approach to promote learners' interest in the acquisition of natural science at school provides new opportunities for a complex explanation of the phenomenon and improving the quality of the process of learning. The aim of the study is to explore the learners' cognitive interest, personal participation and the approaches chosen by teachers from the perspective of transdisciplinary approach. The study characterises students' subjective evaluations of their personal participation and cognitive interest in the subjects of biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics, and the approaches used by teachers. The participants were 9th grade students from 17 Latvian schools (536 respondents) with the average age of 15.3 (SD=0.63). The results of the study showed that students' evaluations concerning their personal participation in the process of learning were contradictory. They devote little of their free time to the acquisition of science subjects. As to teachers' activity, a variety of teaching approaches are used. According to students' subjective evaluations, the constructivist learning approach corresponds to the trends of sustainable education, whereas the overall context in which the development of learners' cognitive interest in the acquisition of natural science subjects takes place at school highlights issues concerning the sustainable development of the system and the prospects of using the transdisciplinary approach.

AB  - The urgency of the problem of designing a new strategy of teacher training due to the reform of education in universities: decrease of pedagogical disciplines, strengthening fundamental (subject) training, etc. The goal of the article lies in identification of the main components of the new strategy of teacher training. A leading approach to the study of this problem was personological. The result was a new model of teacher training. Undergraduate students are deepening their knowledge of the core subjects (be it Mathematics and Physics or Chemistry and Biology), while graduate students are making a choice: whether to be an engineer, researcher, scientist (which means keep deepening one's knowledge) or be a teacher (which means master psychology, pedagogics, and the methodology of teaching a chosen discipline). The new approach has helped identify the indicators and determinants of pedagogical craftsmanship. The results of the study can be useful in designing new strategies for training teachers.

AB  - The idea of establishing Science High Schools in Turkey was discussed in a multilateral project at the beginning of 1963. The Ministry of National Education (MoNE), Ford Foundation, Middle East Technical University (METU), Ankara University, and International Development Agency (AID) participated in this project to establish these schools. In Ankara, Science High School project was a US funded and technically supported project, carried out jointly by the Florida State University, METU, and Ankara University. Science High Schools' organizational goals were: (1) to improve students' ability and increase their intelligence in science (2) to increase the number of qualified personnel in higher education and industry, and (3) to develop more laboratories by increasing students' scientific knowledge in order to be the center of research and development. MoNE created the "Science High School Project Advisory Board" with six members from Ankara University and four members from METU to contribute to the scientific and curriculum aspects of the project. The Advisory Board selected 30 teachers from Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics and Biology disciplines by written and oral exams from the existing high schools of MoNE from all over the Turkey. Selected science teachers received special training for the development regarding the assessments of subjects and provided with opportunities to study on the curriculum at some universities in the United States (U.S.). To train teachers in Turkey, a modern building was constructed at METU campus and the education at Ankara Science High School started in 1964. After the success of the Ankara Science High School, the MoNE started the Science High School Projects in Istanbul and Izmir. Today, there are 238 Science High Schools serving as public schools and the same amount of schools serving as private schools. In the U. S., the training of 100K STEM teachers started in 2012. In this article, Science High Schools' development and their innovation activities, the STEM projects and the vision for increasing the STEM education in Turkey and other developed countries were discussed.

AB  - The science laboratory learning environment has been a distinctive area in science education since the 19th century. Unfortunately, students are generally not aware of what science instructors expect from laboratory experiences, and far too often, the undergraduate science laboratory curriculum lacks explicit, well-defined goals. Science instructors assume that they have created their laboratory curriculum in such a way as to reflect an ideal science instructional laboratory, but students may not recognize this. What previous studies do not indicate is the extent to which students understand the laboratory goals for instruction as intended by the instructors. This study, therefore, using a quantitative design, examined undergraduate science major (biology, chemistry, and physics) and non-major students', and female and male perceptions of their science instructional laboratory with respect to instructors' goals for the laboratory. Data was collected via the Student Perceptions of the College Instructional Laboratory Survey (SPCILS) at a Midwestern University in the USA. The findings suggest that, on the whole, students perceive their instructional labs much as intended by their instructors. Female and male students were just as likely to view their instructional laboratories as intended by the instructors. Moreover, the study found no differences between science majors and non-majors. This study provides baseline data for future qualitative studies about how major and gender might be impacting students' laboratory experiences in ways beyond what was measured on this survey. Our research was done at a teaching-oriented, midsized university. It would thus be appropriate for similar investigations to be carried out at a research-oriented university.

AB  - This report describes the development and pilot evaluation of SMART Spaces. This programme aims to boost GCSE science outcomes by applying the principle that information is more easily learnt when it is repeated multiple times, with time passing between the repetitions. This approach is known as "spaced learning" and is contrasted with a "massed learning" approach, where content is learnt all at once with no spacing. The development of the programme was led by a team from the Hallam Teaching School Alliance (HTSA). SMART Spaces prepares Year 9 and 10 students for GCSE examinations at the end of Year 10. Teachers were trained to deliver three lessons focused on chemistry, physics, and biology curriculum content, which were repeated over three consecutive days. Pupils did an unrelated physical activity in the spaces between intensive repetitions of science content. Teachers received one day of training and were provided with PowerPoint slides to deliver during the lessons. The Centre for Evidence and Social Innovation (CESI) at Queen's University Belfast (QUB) worked with HTSA to develop SMART Spaces, test its feasibility, and test three different approaches to arranging the spaced learning across the three days (see Table 1). Key conclusions are as follows: (1) The spaced learning principle is based on relatively strong evidence and this pilot suggests that SMART Spaces has evidence of promise; (2) This pilot study demonstrated that SMART Spaces can feasibly be delivered in English schools. Both teachers and pupils appeared to enjoy and engage with the programme; (3) Teachers generally reported that they delivered SMART Spaces lessons as prescribed and did not make major alterations; (4) The small randomised controlled trial (RCT) provided some preliminary evidence that the most promising approach to spaced learning combines the use of both ten-minute and 24-hour spaces between curriculum content. However, this was a small study and a larger trial is needed to better understand the impact of the programme; and (5) SMART Spaces is ready for a larger RCT to evaluate its impact on GCSE attainment. The evaluation team suggest an efficacy trial at the next stage with further exploration of feasibility using both qualitative and quantitative measures (particularly the engagement questionnaire included in this study, which can help monitor this significantly related implementation factor). A key unanswered question at this point is the cumulative effect of SMART Spaces if used throughout the school year.

AB  - One of the main objectives in education is to increase the motivation of the students to achieve meaningful learning. The use of technologies in classrooms which students are familiarized with such as the smartphone or the tablet, is a way to achieve this goal. On the other hand, it has been proven that the inclusion of scenarios supported by games and competition enhance the active participation of students. Therefore, in this work we present the results of a study based on of the application Kahoot with students of secondary education, in the subjects of mathematics, biology & geology and physics & chemistry, during the academic year 2017/2018. This tool allows students to answer to on-line questionnaires created by the teacher, through mobile devices, and check their results in a few seconds as well as those of their classmates. The results obtained on the assessment of the tool by students, in terms of the benefits in the learning process, have been very positive and help us to examine the potential of the use of on-line questionnaires in the classrooms.

AB  - The current research is a descriptive study in which a survey model was used. The research involved chemistry (n = 26), physics (n = 27), and biology (n = 29) teachers working in Science High Schools and Anatolian High Schools in Turkey. An inventory that consisted of seven questions was designed to ascertain what teachers' think about the importance of science process skills in teaching science, to identify the frequency of these skills and the problems teachers encounter during their practice in class, and to specify their identification levels on these skills. The results of the study showed that these skills in general have a positive effect on teaching science and that the in-class activities promote conceptual learning. Most of the teachers participated in the study argued that these skills can only be gained effectively through laboratory activities in which both teachers and students engage; and almost all of them thought that central-examination-based teaching poses a great obstacle. Teachers are more successful in identifying skills of observing, predicting, experimenting, and inferencing than other skills.

AB  - It is shown that in the last decades, geography has expanded so much, that it has lost its object of study. It was not clear, what the geographical science does, and, as a consequence, households have an extremely low level of geographical cultures and geographical education. Each geography is extremely isolated, has its own object of study. Especially the big gap still lies between the physical and socio-economic geography. As a result, each geographical science was so moving away from geography that actually merges with the adjacent sciences--physics, geology, economics, sociology, biology, political science etc. The paper discusses the ideas of the Soviet scientists V.A. Anuchin and N.K. Mukitanov. To prevent the situation, proposed as the object of study of geography to define the human environment. The environment was defined as an area where natural sphere (geographical envelope), anthropogenic (man-made) sphere and the social sphere interact with each other. At the same time narrow scientific branches, not in charge of environment, should move to the appropriate related sciences, is now actually happening. Thus, we propose a new geographical paradigm, where the geography will become less scattered, and will take single or synergetic nature.

AB  - Interdisciplinary science teaching is an issue in various countries. One example in Europe is Germany, especially regarding comprehensive schools. At the same time, German teacher education is primarily subject-specific. An examination of data on self-efficacy beliefs is helpful for understanding the qualifications of teachers for interdisciplinary science. Previous measurement instruments for teaching biology, chemistry, physics, and science lack a literature-based, theory-based, or curricular-valid measurement or a systematic obstacle to overcome. Thus, to meet these requirements, this research developed a draft for a new instrument to measure self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching (SElf-ST). As the theoretical base, the instrument operationalizes a model of pedagogical content knowledge for teaching science and adapts it to self-efficacy beliefs. In a cross-sectional study (N = 114 pre-service and trainee teachers), a ten-factor-solution for self-efficacy beliefs resulted from an exploratory factor analysis (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin-criterion = 0.858, [alpha] = 0.70-0.86). Nine factors are linked to the theoretical model. An additional tenth factor emerged: Teaching Ethically Relevant Issues. Nine factors show low and medium correlations with teaching experience. Eight factors show at least low correlations with self-rated content knowledge in no less than one of the three subjects. In general, science-specific factors show rather low or medium correlations, and generic factors (e.g., Applying Media, and Applying Methods of Evaluation) show low or no correlations. This result is in accordance with the context specificity of self-efficacy beliefs. These results meet most of the research expectations and provide initial indications of the concurrent, curricular, and divergent validity of the SElf-ST instrument. The paper argues for the development of a new, theory-based instrument to measure self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching.

AB  - This study provides an overview of the didactic focus areas in educational research in biology, chemistry and physics, seeking to identify the focus areas that are investigated frequently and those that have been studied rarely or not at all. We applied the didactic focus-based categorization analysis method (DFCM), which is based on an extension of the didactic triangle. As the data set, we used 250 papers published in the "Nordic Studies in Science Education" (NorDiNa) between 2005 and 2013, and the European Science Education Research Association (ESERA) 2013 conference proceedings covering education at upper secondary and tertiary levels. The results show that the teacher's pedagogical actions and the student--content relationship were the most frequently studied aspects. On the other hand, teachers' reflections on the students' perceptions and attitudes about goals and content, and teachers' conceptions of the students' actions towards achieving the goals were studied least. Irrespective of the publication forum, the distributions of foci to different categories were quite similar. Our historical analysis completes the recent studies in the field as it is based on the theory driven categorization system instead of the data driven approaches used by the previous researchers. Moreover, our further observations on more recent publications suggest that no significant changes have taken place, and therefore wider discussion about the scope and the coverage of the research in science education is needed.

AB  - : Current research on self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching indicates shortcomings in facing recent teaching challenges in secondary education and corresponding valid instruments. Thus, we designed the Self-Efficacy Beliefs of Interdisciplinary Science Teaching (SElf-ST) instrument based on a pedagogical content knowledge model for science teaching. We ensured the factorial validity of ten factors. To bring construct validity down to a round figure, we examined convergent and divergent validity in this paper. For answering the overall research question regarding arguments for the convergent and divergent validity of the interpretation of the SElf-ST instrument's test values (and related hypotheses), we analyzed data of pre-service, trainee, and in-service biology, chemistry, and physics teachers (n = 590) in a cross-sectional study. While the strong latent correlations of the ten SElf-ST factors with self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching in primary education (r = 0.40 - 0.63, p < 0.01) indicate convergent validity, the rather weak correlations with self-efficacy beliefs of general teaching (r = 0.17 - 0.54, p < 0.01), self-rated content knowledge in science (r = 0.13 - 0.40, p < 0.01), and perceived stress (r = -0.13 - -0.19, p < 0.01) support different divergent validity intensities. Thus, assumed relations within the nomological net surrounding the self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching construct were confirmed for secondary education. In sum, we shed light on a rarely explored aspect of construct validity in science education research regarding self-efficacy beliefs. Doing so, we gained strong arguments that the SElf-ST instrument's test values can serve as indicators of self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching in secondary education.

AB  - We have investigated the efficacy of on-line, multimedia learning modules (MLMs) as preparation for in-class, lecture-based tutorials in electromagnetism in a physics course for natural science majors (biology and marine science). Specifically, we report the results of a multiple-group pre/post-test research design comparing two groups receiving different treatments with respect to activities preceding participation in "Tutorials in Introductory Physics." The different pre-tutorial activities were as follows: (1) students were assigned reading from a traditional textbook, followed by a traditional lecture; and (2) students completed on-line MLMs developed by the Physics Education Research Group at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC), and commercially known as FlipItPhysics. The MLM treatment group earned significantly higher mid-term examination scores and larger gains in content knowledge as measured by the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM). Student attitudes towards "reformed" instruction in the form of active-engagement tutorials were also improved. Specifically, post-course surveys showed that MLM-group students believed class time was more effective and the instructor was more clear than reported by non-MLM students, even though there was no significant difference between groups with respect to in-class activities and the same instructor taught both groups. MLM activities can be a highly effective tool for some student populations, especially when student preparation and buy-in are important for realizing significant gains.

AB  - Learning physiology requires students to apply physical and chemical principles to the study of biological systems. Unfortunately, many undergraduate anatomy and physiology (A&P) students are unprepared for this due to a lack of prerequisite knowledge in physics and chemistry. This lack of prerequisite knowledge of chemistry and physics makes learning physiology especially difficult and may contribute to the high failure rates among A&P courses nationwide. However, undergraduate physiology courses catering to biology majors often require more stringent chemistry and physics prerequisites that help prepare students to learn physiology. This study compared prerequisite requirements in chemistry and physics between A&P classes for health-related majors and physiology classes for biology majors across numerous four-year institutions and found striking differences in prerequisite preparation between the two groups. 62% of physiology courses for biology majors required a chemistry prerequisite while only 18% of A&P classes for health-related majors had the same requirement. As a result, students entering physiology courses for biology majors may have a better foundation upon which to learn physiology than students entering A&P for health-related majors.

AB  - The changeover of the Kenyan system of education from the 7-4-2-3 to the current 8-4-4 in 1984 made science subjects (Biology, Chemistry and Physics) compulsory to all students up to form two at the secondary school level. This meant increased numbers of students in one class at a time attending the science subjects, which may compromise quality. The quality of secondary teachers and teaching is, however, influenced by many small factors rather than a few large ones. This paper is an investigation into the effectiveness of Strengthening Mathematics and Science in Secondary Education (SMASSE) training of mathematics and chemistry teachers on the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) performance in Kikuyu District. The study used sixteen schools selected by stratified random sampling method. This study gathered both qualitative and quantitative data. Data analysis was done using Statistic Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software, Registered R and Excel. Findings are presented using percentages, trend lines, frequency distribution and means. The study findings indicate that SMASSE In- service and Education Training (INSET) has no impact on the performance of mathematics and chemistry, the Activity, Student-centered, Experiment, Improvisation (ASEI) and Plan, Do See Improve (PDSI) approaches are in use and have improved the teachers' confidence and ability to deliver, and the skills learnt are effective. Thus this study concludes that though SMASSE INSET does not show impact on the performance of mathematics and chemistry, it has influenced the teachers' ability to deliver in their teaching amidst various challenges. The research recommends that future SMASSE programmes should have a bottom up approach to enable full ownership and participation by key stakeholders.

AB  - This study focuses on exploring pre-service science teachers' conceptual integration understandings in explaining the subject of metabolism with the concepts of physics and chemistry. Action research was employed in this study. Nine pre-service science teachers taking the General Biology II course participated. Participants were taught metabolism considering conceptual integration. Data were collected via paper-and-pencil questionnaire administered before and after the intervention. The results showed that the pre-service science teachers could not understand physics and chemistry concepts at a sufficient level while explaining metabolism. Although the activities and practices were executed for conceptual integration in the action plan, only three participants achieved complete conceptual understanding for better conceptual integration at the end of the course in the first question. Thus, future studies could design interventions to be effective in conceptual integration. Further research could also design experimental investigations to examine how conceptual integration is necessary for establishing the relationship between science and other fields.

AB  - The aim of this study is to analyse the science questions in terms of visual content in the higher education entrance exams in Turkey. In this context, 1714 questions in total prepared by the Center for Measurement, Selection and Placement (CMSP) between 1999 and 2019 in the fields of Physics (n=631), Chemistry (n=553) and Biology (n=530) constitute the data source of the study. This study includes case study which is one of the qualitative research patterns. The data of the study are analyzed by descriptive analysis based on the visual content of questions according to the fields of science, their years and their roles in solving questions (partial role and full role). According to the results, the science questions: i) are concentrated on greatly physics in terms of visual content compared to biology and chemistry on the basis of fields; ii) although visual content varies slightly over the years in terms of its type, the formatted drawing image is used quite a lot compared to other types; iii) formatted drawing and measurement diagrams in the field of physics in many years, formatted drawing and graphics in the field of chemistry, and flowchart and graphics in the field of biology have been largely included and iv) the role of visuals in solving the question has been partial in physics in many years, and in chemistry and biology it has been found to have a partial role in some years and in some cases it has a full role. As a result of the study, it is understood that the science questions applied to students at the entrance to university in Turkey do not show a balanced distribution in terms of visual content type on the basis of fields.

AB  - The present study assessed the challenges to implement laboratory teaching in selected Preparatory Schools, North Shewa Zone. The result of this study showed that although laboratories for each subjects were present (100%) in all districts, lack of professional skills (50% in biology, 64.5% in chemistry and 61.5% physics), lack of materials (78.6% in biology, 64.7% in chemistry and 65.4% in physics) and lack of chemicals (75%, in biology, 58.8% in chemistry and 46.2% in physics) were the main challenges to implement effective laboratory teaching. The average numbers of students per laboratory session were 46-55, which was very large size to teach in practical session. Students had interest (strong in all subjects) to learn practically, but 75% of biology and chemistry, and 62.5% of physics laboratory activities were not done. The government look forward that the laboratory activities recommended in the text were not well manipulated and laboratory doing was for the sake of doing. Priority must be given for preparatory school laboratory teaching.

AB  - Instructional design focuses on solving problems in a multitude of contexts. As such, designers are investigators, gathering evidence to optimally design solutions to learning problems within the identified context. The challenge described in this case study was the need to create an educational activity to promote interaction and collaboration among an interdisciplinary participant group comprised of physicians, radiobiologists, and radiation physicists. Based on the premise that interdisciplinary medical research collaboration requires a shared understanding of authentic problems from multiple perspectives, this design research case documents the design and implementation of an online case study incorporating collaborative inquiry in interdisciplinary teams with the intended outcome of building or strengthening interdisciplinary communication skills. Contextual factors--including the design team and design process--influencing the design of the activity are documented. Results indicate that using an interactive online case study as the basis for collaborative inquiry in small, interdisciplinary teams followed by a summative, large group discussion resulted in (1) evidence-based treatment decisions based on the data supplied in the case study and (2) participation of all disciplines in team interactions. Outcomes also indicated the building or strengthening of interdisciplinary communication skills and the understanding of the value and contribution of all three fields to radiation oncology treatment resulted in the participation of the online case study.

AB  - Students' attitudes and approaches to problem solving are claimed to be related to their ways they learn physics and to their success in solving physics problems. In this study, the Attitudes and Approaches to Problem Solving (AAPS) survey was used to reveal Turkish introductory university students' attitudes and approaches to physics problem solving. The data were collected from 175 students, in the spring semester of 2015-2016 academic year, from an introductory physics course at a university in the Black See Region of Turkey. The analysis of the data was conducted by grouping the data by major, achievement level, and gender. They were no statistically significant differences between the averages of civil engineering and molecular biology majors, and between male and female students. However, we obtained a small sample correlation between students' attitudes and exam grades that suggests high achievers' attitudes and approaches to physics problems are more expert-like than the attitudes and approaches of low achievers. Implications for problem solving strategies and directions for further research are discussed.

AB  - The evolution of learning design continues, focusing on blended laboratory approaches incorporating technology. The Sophisticated Thinking Laboratory (STB-LAB) and Gather Town are key tools in implementing collaborative learning in this context. This study assesses the effectiveness of blended laboratory implementation using STB-LAB and Gather Town as a gamification tool, utilizing the Assessment Based on Teaching and Learning Trajectory (AABTLT) with Student Activity Sheets (SAS). The results reveal the successful execution of STB-LAB syntax in blended laboratory activities. Additionally, STB-LAB and Gather Town significantly enhance students' collaborative skills, as indicated by a substantial Cohen's D Effect Size. For physics education majors, the effect size is 1.736 in the experiment group and 0.754 in the control group, while for biology education majors, it is 1.522 in the experiment group and 0.541 in the control group. This study highlights the positive impact of blended laboratories with STB-LAB and Gather Town on collaborative skill development, further emphasizing the role of technology in contemporary learning design.

AB  - To enter practice as an occupational therapist, one must complete an occupational therapy program at an accredited institution and then pass a national certification exam. This exam is called the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT) Exam. Individuals can take the exam more than once to achieve a passing score but must pay a fee each time. Not passing the first time can lead to stress, increased costs, and delayed entrance into the profession. Thus, being a first-time passer is ideal. The purpose of this retrospective quantitative study was to identify variables impacting first time pass rates of occupational therapy master's students. Variables found to be significantly higher in the first time pass group compared to the multiple attempts group include high school grade point average (hsGPA), Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores, whether or not the student earned an A in high school chemistry or biology, whether or not the student took high school physics, undergraduate college GPA, whether or not the student earned an A in certain occupational therapy intervention courses, and percentage correct on the Occupational Therapy Knowledge Exam (OTKE). Results of this study can inform occupational therapy programs' admissions standards and help educators better prepare and support students throughout the entire curriculum to facilitate first time success on the NBCOT exam.

AB  - The Undergraduate Scholarships with Mathematics and Science Training, Exploration, and Research Program (US MASTER) is a STEM scholarship program funded by the United States National Science Foundation. It was implemented at an upper-Midwest institution to target and provide structured support to low-income, academically talented undergraduates in biology, chemistry, geography and geographic information science (GISc), environmental sciences, and physics and astrophysics. In addition to providing financial support, the program features an integrated approach to mentorship and advising consisting of an ongoing seminar course in which students engage in collaborative projects, research experiences with a faculty mentor, and targeted academic advising. As part of our assessment efforts, we interviewed student participants regarding their experiences. A consistent theme emerged regarding mentorship: in addition to providing access to professional socialization experiences and the facilitation of competency and performance, students reported that it was the ability to form close relationships based on personal authenticity and feelings of psychological safety and trust that provided the best scaffolding for success in a challenging STEM environment.

AB  - This study is aimed at creating a general technique for the formation of learners' interest in physics in the context of sustainable development of education. The active means of training and active learning methods are the components of this technique. The sequence of interest formation for physics in the context of sustainable development of education was analyzed. This scheme shows the transition from a situational interest to an individual interest. Short-term objective is the formation of learners' interest in physics as a school subject. Long-term objective is the formation of learners' interest in physics as a science. Results proved that proposed technique increases the level of motivational component of the learners' cognitive activity in physics teaching. This general technique can also be used in teaching other natural sciences (e.g., Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Ecology).

AB  - Creating a metaphor for the concept of energy can contribute to the determination of the mental structuring of the concept of energy. Pre-service teachers' metaphors about the concept of energy were classified according to traditional and scientific fields. The metaphors produced by the mathematics and science teacher candidates for the concept of energy consisted of structural and abstract concepts, approximately 60% of them were the continuity of life and 40% were science categories. While pre-service mathematics teachers mainly produce metaphors for biology, pre-service science teachers produce metaphors mainly for physics. Empathic tendency scores and levels of pre-service teachers were determined. Pre-service teachers have a high level of empathic disposition and predominantly see the other person's problem and emotion as their own. There was no quantitatively significant difference between traditional metaphor types and empathic tendencies. It is understood that the pre-service teachers have high empathic tendencies, and mostly in the you stage, the concepts related to the continuity of life are primarily used in developing metaphors related to the concept of energy, and they tend to produce structural metaphors. Metaphor and empathy will contribute to the determination of mental models and the establishment of a connection between the fields of science.

AB  - Environmental education (EE) in elementary schools (6 - 15 years old) in Slovakia is not systematically defined, it is often dependent on the voluntary efforts and enthusiasm of teachers. Schoolchildren acquire environmental knowledge in a limited form during the teaching of individual subjects, especially Biology, Geography and to some extent, also Chemistry, Physics etc. In elementary schools, the school subject of EE is absent. Therefore, the aim of the presented study is to find out the current situation in formal and informal EE at elementary schools in Slovakia. We gathered data on formal EE in the form of a google questionnaire survey, in which only 18% of all elementary schools in Slovakia were willing to participate. Through some questions in the google questionnaire, these elementary schools also provided informations about the inclusion of formal, informal and non-formal education at elementary schools. Our SWOT analysis indicate a need for systematic EE in elementary schools, as well as improvements of teaching materials and teacher training in this area. At the same time, we present the EE model at the Rakovec nad Ondavou Elementary School with Kindergarten, which is included in the Green School Network and actively involved in Erasmus projects providing the opportunity to implement part of the study and internships abroad.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop two Sudoku puzzles for undergraduate students which can be utilised in the context of introductory physical science courses in order to assist them to practice SI prefixes. For this reason, SI prefixes for decimal multiples and submultiples were addressed in two separate puzzles. To test the puzzles, a case study was conducted with 20 biology teaching students studying their first year in a state university in Turkey. Data were collected with the help of a questionnaire posed to the students before and after the application of the puzzles. According to the results, 18 students (90%) completed the puzzles successfully. In addition, the students agreed that solving the Sudoku puzzles made contributions to them in terms of practicing SI prefixes. It is recommended that the Sudoku puzzles developed in this study might be used efficiently for all undergraduate students taking courses such as general chemistry and physics.

AB  - Transfer of mathematical learning to science is seen as critical to the development of education and industrial societies, yet it is rarely interrogated in applied research. We present here research looking for evidence of transfer from university mathematics learning in semester one to second semester sciences/engineering courses (n = 1125). A transfer index measure was derived from extant university assessments, calculated on content-matched questions requiring mathematical concepts and skills in students' completed mathematics and science/engineering exams. We found that transfer could be measured in this way, and present path models of how transfer is associated with educational attainment and other factors. However, transfer was observed only in physics (n = 258) and engineering (n = 426); biology and molecular bioscience assessments did not provide opportunities for students to demonstrate their mathematical learning. In physics and engineering courses, mathematical attainment had a strong, direct, positive effect, with transfer of learning providing an additional direct and mediating effect upon students' performance in these subjects. In physics and engineering, transfer was also associated with higher levels of educational attainment in general. This new, applied approach to examining transfer trialed here may provide opportunities for analysing, evaluating, and improving cross-disciplinary transfer of learning within universities.

AB  - This study describes a program that the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) carried out in partnership with Birmingham City Schools (BCS) to test an educational intervention, i.e., Hands-On Physics (HOP), among 8th grade students in predominantly minority schools. It also evaluated teachers' demographics and educational backgrounds. The students conducted four physics experiments during a three day period. They performed better on post- tests. The actual and the percent gains in knowledge for each school were essentially equal for the schools that had passing versus failing grades in annual state assessment (20.4±5.6/49.0±5.6%, 20.4±2.7/48.4±8.3%, respectively). Most students (53%) stated that they were comfortable with science, 88% indicated that they were planning to enter higher education, and 86% agreed that higher education was very important for their future. The students' major perceived obstacles to higher education were education cost and low grades. The teachers were primarily between 40-59 years old (60%), female (80%) and African-American (93%), and 87% majored in biology (93%). Forty percent had a bachelor's degree and 60% had a master's degree. They reported that they needed more support teaching physics and reported that a lack of materials and time were the main obstacles to provide the highest quality science educational experiences.

AB  - The global carbon cycle (CC) is a key environmental literacy issue related to climate change, ocean acidification, and energy sustainability. Understanding the CC requires interdisciplinary knowledge informed by multiple science disciplines such as biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. To examine the core principles and interdisciplinary nature of CC, we interviewed 10 experts from various science disciplines and asked them to create their own models of the carbon cycle. We utilized the data to identify emerging core concepts of CC and discover commonalities and differences across the experts' models in the context of interdisciplinary understanding. The concepts and interdisciplinarity were compared with those of CC-related topics in the U.S. Framework and Next Generation Science Standards. Most experts demonstrated a breadth of interdisciplinary knowledge based on their disciplinary backgrounds. The experts hold a wider set of ideas about CC than is present in the standards. Many topics not included in the standards could feasibly be added (e.g., the process of carbon sequestration into the ocean and rocks and CO2 emissions by volcanic activity). This study generates concrete recommendations for science standards to guide the revision of existing curricula or to guide the development of new interdisciplinary approaches to teaching global CC.

AB  - The learning approach is an important component of education. ADI learning model allows learners to argue actively based on the surrounding observable phenomena in the laboratory. This research aims to review national diversities that represent or contribute to studies by applying the ADI learning model and the research type varieties and characteristics and stages of Argument-Driven Inquiry learning model applied by other researchers; research subjects, the applied content materials for investigation, and the impact of Argument-Driven Inquiry learning model. This research is a systematic literature review (SLR) with published article databases from Scopus, ERIC, and Google Scholar. The applied keywords were "Argument-Driven Inquiry" and "Science Education." The findings showed twenty-three articles were in line with the categories. Then, the analysis and classification could be done for each article. The ADI learning model implementation had been frequently found to improve learners' scientific argumentative skills rather than analytical skills or critical thinking skills. The applied content materials were mostly chemical materials, biology, and rarely found in physics. Most applied research types from the articles were quasi-experimental research. The implication of this research is to provide insight for further reviewing the argument-driven inquiry model (ADI) to improve science learning quality.

AB  - This study aimed to compare the objectives of environmental education topics in various countries. The present study is a qualitative study and content analysis was used to analyze the data. The results revealed that the categories of the objectives regarding the environment topic in the primary education were found to be higher in Turkey compared to other countries. The concept of the ozone layer in chemistry curricula and the concept of biodiversity in biology curricula were intensively included. No country had objectives regarding all subcategories in primary education. There are no objectives regarding field trip in physics subject in all countries. Objectives regarding the category of identifying issues and research question were included only in Australia. However, the activities for environmental education were determined to be at a low level in all the countries.

AB  - There are many published examples of strategies for using movies in science education, ranging from individual activities within a class to complete courses like "The Biology of Jurassic Park" at Hood College or "The Physics of Film" at the University of Central Florida (Borgwald and Schreiner 1994; Dubeck et al. 1988; Dubeck et al. 1995; Firooznia 2006). However, all of these strategies employ the use of the film within a formal classroom setting. This paper describes a collaborative program connecting hands-on science activities and new release motion pictures for informal science education in the innovative setting of a movie theater.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate teachers' attitude towards implementation of learner-centered methodology in science education in Kenya. The study used a survey design methodology, adopting the purposive, stratified random and simple random sampling procedures and hypothesised that there was no significant relationship between the head teachers' attitudes, the teachers' attitudes and the level of implementation of Activity-focused methods, Student-centred activities, Experimenting and Improvisation through the Plan, Do, See and Improve (ASEI/PDSI) classroom practices. A sample of 68 head teachers, 147 science teachers and 16 trainers was used for the survey. The study established that majority of the teachers (75%) were partial implementers, and a few (5%) were full implementers. The Chi-square findings for the head teachers were: Biology X[superscript 2] = 72.35>66, Chemistry X[superscript 2] = 69.38>66, and Physics X[superscript 2] = 67.03>66. The teachers were: Biology X[superscript 2] = 55.3429>54, Chemistry X[superscript 2] = 54.4581>48 and Physics X[superscript 2] = 69.4286>58 meaning that they were significant. The conclusion was to reject the null hypothesis, and accept the alternative hypothesis that there is a significant relationship between the teachers' and head teachers' attitude, and the level of implementation of the ASEI/PDSI classroom practices. The study recommended that since the level of implementation was found to be related to the teachers' and head teachers' attitudes towards the innovation, the national Strengthening of Mathematics and Sciences in Secondary Education (SMASSE) inset should then have strategies to bring on board those who still have a negative attitude in order for the implementation to be successful.

AB  - The aim of this research is to reveal the ideas of teachers serving in high schools regarding the factors that affect students' academic achievement. For this purpose, the aim is to investigate and reveal in depth the thoughts of teachers serving in high schools. The research was designed with the case study type of qualitative research method. The study group of this research consists of 11 female, 9 male branch teachers employed in high schools. The participants' professional experience ranged from 1 to 13 years. The participant group consisted of 5 Turkish language and literature teachers, 5 mathematics teachers, 3 English teachers, 2 history teachers, 1 biology teacher, 1 information technology teacher, 1 chemistry teacher, 1 physics teacher and 1 physical education teacher. The study group was determined with the criterion sampling type of purposive sampling method. The criteria determined for this research were that teachers should be working in high schools, be branch teachers and be serving in schools in the province and district. According to the research findings family education level effects students' academic success in terms of academic support, being a role model, concern, intellectual and motivation dimensions; school's physical conditions effects students' academic success in terms of learning, motivation and creativity; School Management effects students' academic success in terms of operation and attitude. School Environment effects students' academic success in terms of motivation, social effects and socio-economic effects. Teacher effects students' academic success in terms professional competence, being a role model, communication, attitude, motivation and guidance.

AB  - In this study, we investigated gender and minority achievement gaps on 8th-grade science items employing a multilevel item response methodology. Both gaps were wider on physics and earth science items than on biology and chemistry items. Larger gender gaps were found on items with specific topics favoring male students than other items, for example, an earth science item requiring visual-spatial ability. Minority students were more likely than White students to score lower on harder constructed-response (CR) items. Some teachers were more likely to reduce minority achievement gaps on easier CR items than other teachers. Implications for instruction in terms of improving visual-spatial awareness, efficacy of female students, and modeling scientific literacy for minority students were discussed.

AB  - Many educators and educational institutions worldwide have agreed that the main goal of science education is to produce a scientifically literate community. Science teachers are key to the achievement of scientific literacy at all levels of education because of the essential role they play in preparing scientifically literate individuals. Studies show that pre-service elementary teachers need to build more confidence in teaching science and scientific literacy during their teacher education programs in order for them to successfully teach science knowledge to their students. Therefore, the purpose of this study is threefold. First, preservice elementary teachers' scientific literacy levels were examined. Second, pre-service teachers' self-efficacy beliefs were measured by distinguishing between their personal and subject-specific self-efficacy beliefs. Third, the extent to which pre-service elementary teachers' scientific literacy levels and self-efficacy levels are related was investigated. Participants were 49 pre-service elementary teachers registered in two science methods courses (introductory and advanced) at a mid-sized university in the United States. Quantitative data were collected using the Test of Basic Scientific Literacy, the Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument-Preservice, and Beliefs about Teaching. Results showed that participants had a satisfactory level of scientific literacy. However, pre-service teachers had borderline scores on the Nature of Science scale. Regarding self-efficacy, findings showed that both groups had the highest self-efficacy in teaching biology and the lowest in teaching physics. Participants in the advanced science methods course exhibited a moderate preexisting positive relationship between scientific literacy and subject-specific self-efficacy in teaching science.

AB  - Tackling the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) skills shortage is an ongoing challenge for governments and policymakers worldwide. While the last decade has seen an increase in student enrolment into STEM degree courses in the UK, the gender gap remains a persistent issue in academia. In order to understand the causes underpinning female under-representation in STEM, it is essential to consider the whole academic pipeline and identify its "leaky points". As the transition between compulsory and voluntary schooling represents a critical attrition point in the STEM educational pipeline, we conducted a survey to investigate the attitude of a cohort of year 11 and year 12 pupils towards STEM disciplines. Our results indicate that a gender bias is already evident at General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) level, where only 25% of girls expressed the intention to pursue a career in STEM. In both age groups, girls expressed a considerably lower preference for chemistry, physics and ICT, and a higher preference for biology compared to boys in the same year group. Participation in extracurricular activities and parents' educational status both showed a strong correlation with pupils' intention to undertake STEM studies in higher education and pursue a career in a related field. A recurring theme emerging from the survey is that pupils are eager to gain more knowledge about "real life" applications of science and are inspired by interactions with visiting scientists. These results corroborate the notion that outreach activities have a crucial role in promoting engagement in STEM subjects amongst young learners, and are essential towards the endeavour of "mending the pipeline" at an early stage.

AB  - Sustainability education (SE) is included in school curricula to integrate the principles, values, and practices of sustainable development (SD) into all education. This study investigates lower secondary school subject teachers as educators for sustainability. A survey was used to study the perceptions of 442 subject teachers from 49 schools in Finland. There were significant differences between the subject teachers' perceptions of their SE competence, and the frequency with which they used different dimensions of SE (ecological, economic, social, well-being, cultural) in their teaching varied. Teachers' age had a small effect, but gender, school, and its residential location were nonsignificant factors. Teachers could be roughly classified into three different subgroups according to their perceptions of the role of SE in their teaching; those who considered three SE dimensions rather often and used holistic sustainability approaches in their teaching (biology, geography, history); those who considered two or three dimensions often but were not active in holistic teaching (mother tongue, religion, visual arts, crafts, music, physical and health education, and home economics) and those who used one SE dimension or consider only one holistic approach in their teaching (mathematics, physics, chemistry and language). Subject teachers' awareness of their SE competence is important to encourage them to plan and implement discipline-based and interdisciplinary SE in their teaching. The specific SE expertise of subject teachers should be taken into account in teacher training and education.

AB  - This study augments existing literature in understanding student perceptions about the geosciences; we examined the choice of major and science courses taken by 645 students at a large southeastern research university. Differences were examined between underrepresented minority (URM) and nonminority students. We compared responses regarding not only different sciences but also different subfields of geoscience, and where possible, we compared those subjects with biology. Our results show significant differences in (1) the selection of a college major, (2) the selection of science electives, (3) characteristics of the ideal career, (4) interest and self-efficacy in science and math, and (5) career perceptions of geoscience and other select sciences among URM and nonminority students. We identified three main factors that contributed to student selection of college major, including "important influencers," "sustained identification with or interest in that major," and "descriptors of the major itself." We also found that a student's advisor may be one of the greatest factors in which science classes an undergraduate student takes at a university. Finally, our research showed that the geosciences scored lower than other science subjects with respect to student perceptions in its ability to "help the environment," "help society," "help them find a job," and "salary." This was true for each of the geoscience fields measured when compared with every other science, technology, engineering, and math fields measured with the exception of physics.

AB  - Students in environmental sciences, ecology, or wildlife management are often reluctant to acquire training in basic laboratory techniques. To advocate the importance of this training, we reviewed literature in the fields of biological and environmental science for one frequently used technique--centrifugation--and evaluated whether centrifugation parameters are properly expressed. Centrifugation is used to extract and purify different types of biomolecules for further characterization or quantification. The repeatability of the procedure depends on the proper identification of parameters defining the gravitational force applied to a solution, for example the duration, distance from central axis, and angular velocity. Correctly expressing rotation velocity--the "speed"--is therefore crucial to ensuring repeatability and the possibility of using the same protocols in different laboratories. When scrutinizing the materials and methods sections of publications in ecology, zoology, botany, or general biology journals, we noticed that velocity is expressed in different ways and essential information is often missing. We sampled 2000 articles in different fields of biological sciences that recorded centrifugation as a technique in the materials and methods section. We found centrifugation velocity to be properly expressed in gravitational force "g" in only 47.8% of the papers. The score dropped to 40.4% in journals specialized in ecology. We use this analysis to advocate for a minimum of training in the techniques of biochemistry that are of common use in environmental sciences. Better training would allow higher reproducibility of results in scientific publications.

AB  - The aim of this study is to conduct a meta-analysis study to examine the effectiveness of the argumentation-based teaching method in terms of sample, subject, years and some variables (academic success, attitude, interest, etc.). Meta-analysis method was used in this study. In order to gather the studies included in meta-analysis, various sources were used in the study. Three type studies were brought together for the meta-analysis: journal articles, doctoral and master thesis. The Social Science Citatio Index (SSCI) journals, Turkish Academic Network and Information Center Social Science Database, national printed journals, Academic Search Complete, Education Research Complete and ERIC databases were searched for journal articles. The Council of Turkish Higher Education Thesis Center was scanned to get the dissertations/theses. While scanning these platforms, the key concepts of "argumentation", "argumentation-based science teaching", "argumentation-based science education", "discussion-oriented teaching method to science" were used. So, 47 studies were used in the meta-analysis. In the study, as a result of the meta-analysis on the argumentation-based teaching process at the national level, it was determined that there was no significant difference in terms of the level of classes in which the studies were conducted and the independent variables examined in the studies, but there was a significant difference between the subject areas in favor of the subject area of chemistry.

AB  - Various similar primary studies report varying impacts of applying blended problem-based learning (Blended PBL) in improving students' 21st-century skills. This study aims to group similar studies on the effect of blended PBL on students' 21st-century skills in science learning through meta-analysis. In addition, studies were analyzed on variations in models, education levels, subjects, and 4C skills. There are 44 articles worth analyzing. The data was analyzed using Excel and JASP applications by presenting results in size effect values, forest plots, and published bias tests. The results of the analysis show that science learning with blended PBL improves 21st-century skills that are better at science learning than other learning (g = 0.617, 95% Cl 0.296-0.937, p < 0.001, I[superscript 2] = 96.861%). Analysis of moderator variables showed that in the variation model, level of education, subjects, and 4C skills, there was a significant effect. These findings confirm that blended PBL is efficiently used to train students' 21st-century skills in science learning.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the intentions of kindergarten teachers to use the content and to apply the teaching methods that they acquired in a one-day teacher training seminar. According to the theory of planned behavior, the answer to this research question is directly related to a series of social-psychological personal criteria assessments, such as an assessment of the personal gains or losses, the opinions of important third persons, the teacher's own assessment of the value of the students' learning, and the perceived behavioral control assessment. A total of 114 participants completed a 5-point Likert-scale questionnaire that consisted of two sets of five questions each. The results show that the kindergarten teachers' intentions to use particular content and teaching methods are based on whether they have the skills to apply them successfully, and on their assessment of the ability of their students to acquire meaningful knowledge. The teacher's choice of teaching method is also associated with the assessment of the personal gains or losses, as well as with the opinions of important third persons. Furthermore, the study findings show that there are two distinct categories of kindergarten teachers: those whose teaching is based on the tradition of science education, and those whose teaching is based on the tradition of early childhood education. The teaching implications of the results are also discussed.

AB  - The aim of this study is to analyse the importance of the number of raters and compare the results obtained by techniques based on Classical Test Theory (CTT) and Generalizability (G) Theory. The Kappa and Krippendorff alpha techniques based on CTT were used to determine the inter-rater reliability. In this descriptive research data consists of twenty individual investigation performance reports prepared by the learners of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) and also five raters who rated these reports. Raters used an analytical rubric developed by the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) as a scoring tool. The results of the CTT study show that Kappa and Krippendorff alpha statistical techniques failed to provide information about the sources of the errors causing incompatibility in the criteria. The studies based on G Theory provided comprehensive data about the sources of the errors and increasing the number of raters would also increase the reliability of the values. However, the raters raised the idea that it is important to develop descriptors in the criteria in the rubric.

AB  - The objective of this article is to identify and discuss the views of teachers of physics-chemistry (Ph-Ch) and Life and Earth Sciences (LES) on the use and effectiveness of interactive simulations PhET (Physics Education Technology) in student teaching and learning. A survey research method was used in this study. 114 Moroccan science teachers (67 Ph-Ch; 47 LES) at middle and high schools were surveyed. The quantitative analysis was performed to provide insight into who uses PhET simulations, why they use them, and how they are used. The data collected was analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. The results indicate that the use of interactive simulations in investigative science teaching and learning is very effective for both teachers and students, despite the presence of a set of obstacles that hinder the use of classroom simulations. The implication of this research is that the use of interactive simulations in science teaching in Morocco can enhance learning activities and help students to understand scientific concepts effectively.

AB  - The main aim of this study is to examine the measurement invariance of the structural equating model constructed on the Awareness and Exposure subscales of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Awareness Scale (NSTAS) test for three teacher branches, three school types, and two genders by using the covariance structural analysis to test configural and metric invariances. The other aim of this study is showing how to use the IBM AMOS-24 software package with examples to address the issue of measurement invariance using the covariance structural analysis approach. Study sample was 1039 complete records gathered from science teachers with convenience sampling. Research data were collected in two stages. In the first stage, data were obtained from 624 teachers who participated to the study in the 2015-16 academic year. In the second stage, data were obtained in 2019 from 415 teachers via a link to access to the scale and all the instructions for the NSTAS in 2019. The covariance structures analysis was used to examine the measurement invariance of the scale. The comparative fit index was used to compare the measurement invariance in the measurement model. The study revealed that configural, measurement weight and structural covariance invariances were ensured for branches, school types and genders. Residual invariance was ensured only for gender. As a result, it was concluded that the NSTAS scale was not biased for teacher branches, school types or gender. NSTAS scale is recommended for the purposes of comparing branch, school type and gender groups.

AB  - It is widely acknowledged that understanding of science is key to becoming global citizens and to embrace technological advancements. Although research suggests that girl's performance in science has improved over the years, there are still concerns about the under-representation of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers in most African countries, including South Africa. Variability in science performance according to gender is still an unresolved issue. In this study we aimed to examine the relationship between gender and science item achievement of Grade 9 South African learners in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2015. We used data collected by TIMSS 2015. The data were further analysed using International Database (IDB) analyser and t-test statistics. The results show that in general gender did not influence learner achievement in most of the test items. However, the findings indicate that girls performed better than boys in most of the questions in all 4 content domains and in the knowing and reasoning cognitive domains. The study highlighted that gender had a limited effect in the manner in which the girls and boys answered the different test items. The observed gender differences in the content domains could be related to socio-cultural environments and learning experiences.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine the distribution of talented students' course achievements in the fields of mathematics and science, according to the learning styles. General screening method was used in this research. The universe of the research consists of Ninth grade students (2016-2017) who study at Bornova Anatolian High School. The sample of the study was composed of 11 talented students. After determining learning styles, the distribution of the students according to the learning styles was determined. At the end of the study, it was detected that mathematics course achievements' average of the students who have assimilator learning style is higher than averages of the other students's who have other learning styles. It was determined that physics course achievements' average of the students who have assimilator learning style is higher than averages of the other students who have other learning styles.

AB  - This research is conducted to identify the scientific conceptual cognition of ecosystem and the corresponding alternative conceptions by lower-secondary school students in Taiwan. Concept mapping, interviewing, and two-tier diagnostic test cannot make explicit reasoning pathways that students may use. Therefore, its purpose is to develop, validate, and utilize a three-tier multiple-choice diagnostic instrument for the ecosystem concept (TDIEC). The instrument can assist teachers in analyzing their students' reasoning. This does not only distinguish alternative conceptions from lack of knowledge but also determines the percentages of false positives and false negatives. One hundred and six students were tested with this instrument in Taiwan. The data analysis reveals common alternative conceptions shared by students, indicating that 35.59% of the samples had inaccurate conceptualizations of ecosystems. Common alternative conceptions of ecosystems include the following: (1) Only biological components constitute an ecosystem; (2) The Venus flytrap and pitcher plants are preys; (3) Competition is synonymous to predation; (4) Ecological balance refers to the sustainable circulation of energy and matter in the environment; and (5) The simpler the species, the more stable the ecosystem. It concludes with the interpretation of the results, suggestions for the application of the TDIEC, and correct alternative conceptions in Ecology classes.

AB  - We reviewed 48 articles related to the engineering design process in science education published from 2010 to 2020. There are several previous literature review studies that analyzed the engineering design process in science education. However, we have not found any that investigates projects, discussed topics, as well as the benefits of the implementation of the engineering design process in science education. The research method used was a systematic literature review. This study analyzed the characteristics of the content based on year of publication, type of publications, countries that implement it, research approach, educational stage, and science content. The findings show that the projects used in the implementation of the engineering design processes in science education varied according to the discussed topics. The benefits of the implementation of the engineering design process in science education include cognitive benefits, procedural (skills) benefits, attitudinal benefits, and a combination of the three benefits.

AB  - Preparing pre-service science teachers (PSSTs) with the scientific research skills (SRSs) is an ultimate aim of PSSTs' programs. This study aimed to explore PSSTs' understanding level of SRHs (SRHUL). To this end, an action research (AR) was adopted using a pre-post-test design. In doing so, a multiple choice test which consists of 15 items was developed and conducted on a random sample comprising 120 subjects. Results of the study revealed that participants showed insufficient performance on the test of understanding scientific research hypotheses (SRHUT) for both pre and post-test. Besides, results of t-test showed a significant difference between mean scores of pre-test and post-test. The difference was in favor of post-test. Also, results of one-way ANOVA revealed a non-significant difference between or within mean scores of compared groups. Based on the results of the study, some recommendations were made.

AB  - Online "Peer Instruction" has become prevalent in many "flipped classroom" settings, yet little work has been done to examine the content students generate in such a learning environment. This study characterizes a dataset generated by an open-source, web-based homework system that prompts students to first answer questions, and then provide explanations of their reasoning. Of particular interest in this dataset, is that students are also prompted to evaluate a subset of peer explanations based on how convincing they are, as part of the Peer Instruction learning script. Since these student "votes" are then used in the selection of what is shown to future learners, we cast this as an instance of "learnersourcing," a paradigm that presents new research opportunities for the Learning Analytics community. This study characterizes a dataset from one "Peer Instruction" tool, that includes not only the student generated answers and explanations, but this novel "vote" attribute, which aims to capture how convincing each explanation is to other learners. The dataset includes longitudinal observations of student responses over the course of a semester, following groups from three STEM disciplines. The data is made available to interested researchers.

AB  - Epistemology plays an important role in detecting learning difficulties in a given field of knowledge and in directing strategies to eliminate them. This quantitative study aimed to get to know the perceptions of 624 students, related to the nature of science and science teaching and learning. The cross-sectional survey, based on the Inventory of Teacher's Pedagogical & Scientific Beliefs (INPECIP) questionnaire, was applied to the students who attended the 10th, 11th and 12th grades of teacher training courses, in a school in Luanda. The results reveal a clear majority agreement with the theoretical and conceptual frameworks presented, in decreasing manner, from the "didactic model" through the "learning theory", the "image of Science" and the "teaching methodologies". The regression model highlights that the course attended clearly influences the epistemological conceptions of the respondents.

AB  - The term "Virtual Reality" currently refers to a profound sensory immersion of the user in a synthetically generated virtual environment. It is foreseen that virtual reality will gain a substantial role in the instruction of science. In this literature review, the purpose was to investigate the research on the utilization of virtual reality in the science education context, according to several criteria. The articles published in peer-reviewed journals and academic conferences/symposiums that are available in the databases of ERIC, WOS, and Google Scholar have been reviewed. Consequently, a total of 30 eligible articles reviewed and findings presented under every respective criterion. Partially, findings revealed the dominance of journal article type publications, the USA and Turkey found to be most prominent origins, experimental studies being preferred mostly, undergraduate students and pre-service teachers were the most studied groups, the contexts of the studies were prominently general, and the learning outcomes investigated mostly.

AB  - Field trip activities are often considered additional activities and are considered recreational activities rather than ones that teach science effectively to students. Field trip activities are one form of effective experience-based learning to train pre-service teachers in the outdoor environment. This study attempted to describe the design of outdoor science learning in the form of the field trip for pre-service science teachers (PSTs) and the condition of psychosocial learning environments in outdoor activities. This research is a case study carried out in a pre-service science teacher training program at Institut Agama Islam Negeri Kudus, Indonesia. The field trip was designed with field visits on six objects for three days in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia. The field trip activity was attended by 70 PSTs. Qualitative data is captured through the documentation of activities at each outdoor learning location. Quantitative data collection instruments included seven psychosocial scales, namely (1) Environmental Interaction; (2) Integration; (3) Students cohesiveness; (4) Teacher supportiveness; (5) Open-endedness; (6) Preparation and organization; (7) Material environment. The field trip design for PSTs recommends activities that lead to observation and exploration of visiting objects relating not only to the content of the science but also to the pedagogical aspects of the science. The psychosocial aspects of PSTs indicate that field trip activities show a positive meaning in all aspects, although there are significant differences in the conditions of expectations and reality experienced by PSTs. The integration aspect is not significantly different. The decline in perception is still at the medium level, and the condition of the perception is still at a positive level. Research and development studies that emphasize the process of integrating classroom learning with outdoor activities can be carried out further to be able to give meaning to science learning, which is not limited by classrooms or laboratories.

AB  - Accumulated evidence indicates that low spatial ability makes a contribution, separate from levels of general or verbal intelligence, to the unlikelihood of students enrolling in, or succeeding in, STEM subjects. Further, there is a tendency for female students not to perform as well as males on some spatial tests, suggesting that this might be part of the reason for their under-representation in some STEM areas. However, the level of spatial ability has been shown to be related to both genetic and environmental factors, thereby suggesting that it can be improved with appropriate training. Here I look at some of this background and prior research, including training studies, in STEM subjects. Interestingly, as subject specific expertise develops, drawing on specific knowledge tends to replace need for spatial thinking, so it is the negotiation of any initial spatial barrier into a subject which is crucial. To effect this, I outline a relatively new spatial categorisation which could be valuable for STEM teachers as a framework to help them guide their students through the early spatial demands of their own teaching subject(s).

AB  - The adoption and use of various eLearning systems to enhance the quality of education in secondary schools in Tanzania is becoming common. However, there is little evidence to suggest that students actually use them. Existing studies tend to focus on investigating students' attitude towards using these systems through surveys. Nonetheless, data from surveys is normally subject to the possibility of distortion, low reliability, and rarely indicate the causal effects. This study adopted WEKA and KEEL as data mining tools to analyze students' usage patterns and trends using 68,827 individual records from the log file of the Halostudy system implemented in secondary schools in Tanzania. The study found that the system usage is moderate and in decline. There is also variability in the usage of multimedia elements with biology having the highest number while mathematics has the lowest. Students from Dar es Salaam, Mwanza, and Arusha, in that order, had the highest system usage with the lowest being from the peripheral regions. The possible challenges limiting system usage are discussed. These findings show that data mining tools can be used to indicate usage patterns of systems implemented in sub-Saharan Africa and to help educators to find ways of maximising systems usage.

AB  - This article argues that cross-disciplinary linkages -- that is, relationships among phenomena studied by those in different disciplines -- often serve to destabilize, at least temporarily, systems of stability that are theorized to operate within the sets of phenomena studied within most disciplines. It surveys across disciplines both systems of stability and mechanisms of instability, and derives several implications for interdisciplinary and disciplinary research practice. In particular it argues that systems of stability deserve to be included within conceptions of disciplinary perspective. It speculates on how a general connection between stability and instability might be explored. The article thus informs our understanding both of what interdisciplinarity is and how it is best performed.

AB  - In order to increase students' awareness for and comfort with mathematical modeling of biological processes, and increase their understanding of diffusion, the following lab was developed for use in 100-level, majors/non-majors biology and neuroscience courses. The activity begins with generation of a data set that uses coin-flips to replicate movement of dye molecules at an interface of a permeable gel. The class results are then collapsed into a single data set that is used to predict the movement of real dye molecules over time, which are then measured by students in a "wet-lab" activity.

AB  - How, when and what kind of learning takes place are key questions in all educational environments. School graduates are expected to have reached a development level whereby they have, among many fundamental skills, the ability to think critically, to plan their studies and their future, and to integrate knowledge across disciplines. However, it is challenging to develop these skills in schools. Following existing curricula, disciplines are often taught separately and by different teachers, making it difficult for students to connect knowledge studied and learned from one discipline to that of another discipline. The Next Generation Science Standards on teaching and learning natural science in the United States point out important crosscutting concepts in science education (NGSS, 2013). In Estonia, similar trends are leading to an emphasis on the need to further develop scientific literacy skills and interdisciplinary learning in students. The changing environment around us must be reflected in changes in our school system. In this paper, we report on research that intends to answer the questions: (a) "How much do Estonian students develop an interdisciplinary understanding of science throughout their high school education?", and (b) "Is their thinking more interdisciplinary after two years of studies in an Estonian high school?" Additionally, we analyzed the results based on the type of school the students attended, and we examined the use concept mapping to assess interdisciplinary learning. This research is part of an overall study that involved students from 44 Estonian high schools taking a science test similar to the three-dimensional Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) test (hereafter called PISA-like multidimensional test) as well as constructing concept maps, while in 10th and 12th grade. In this paper, we report on the analysis of the results for 182 of the students, concentrating on the analysis of the concept maps they constructed. The results suggest that there were changes in the students' interdisciplinary knowledge, but these were small and varied depending on the students' school type. They also suggest that changes may be needed in the Estonian educational system to increase the students' level of interdisciplinary understanding of science.

AB  - The following report addresses the impact of preparatory education on first year science grades at two Ontario-based universities. Specifically, the impact of high school and university level preparatory courses on their respective first year university grades will be addressed. A variety of analytic and visualization-based strategies will be employed to outline a narrative about who is taking such courses, and the impact of these courses on student learning. Overall, conclusions point to the usefulness of preparatory education, and for institutions to continue to provide supplementary courses as scaffolding for undergraduate students.

AB  - Nowadays, the rapid spread of the interdisciplinary approach contributes to the development of disciplines and scientific developments in many ways. Therefore, how the interdisciplinary approach is addressed in the studies carried out is important in terms of guiding other studies. For this purpose, an attempt to determine how 155 doctorate theses which were written in science departments at a university located in Turkey's south between 2010-2016 addressed the study discipline, subject of study and interdisciplinary approach process was made in this study. Furthermore, the opinions of instructors working in these departments on the interdisciplinary approach were also examined. As a result of the study, it was seen that 140 theses were written with the disciplinary approach, 15 theses were written with the interdisciplinary approach, and they were also associated with economics, sociology, psychology and geography among social science disciplines. The facts that the concept of interdisciplinary is not exactly known and that the necessary conditions for studying have not been provided, the lack of time, the presence of gaps in disciplines and failure to ensure the adequate cooperation are important reasons for the limited number of studies carried out with the interdisciplinary approach. Therefore, it is important to promote interdisciplinary studies and to provide suitable conditions for studying.

AB  - According to General Statistics Office of Vietnam on 30th September, 2017, Vietnam has 858,800 teachers, and among those, 615,720 people were female (occupied 71.7%). It can be seen that female teachers made up a big percentage in the education sector. Besides, STEM education is soaring as a new approach in training with prominent advantages, such as: theories embedded in actual practices, ability-oriented development, pressure reduction in studying… This is not only a trend but also a necessary element in new teaching modules at high school -- which will be implemented in academic year 2020-2021 in Vietnam. As a result, it is necessary to consider the gender factor in the process of training and developing teaching with STEM education. This paper will present the results from the research that took place from 2015 to 2018 within Thai Nguyen University of Education.

AB  - Teachers are expected to consider the implications of recommendations made in educational research. In-service teachers are primary actors who play a leading role in education, so their attitudes towards educational research and researchers are more important than those of pre-service or trainee teachers. This study aims to find out inservice science teachers' attitudes towards education research and some the factors that affect them such as gender, teacher's subject area, seniority, and postgraduate research area. The research data was obtained using a Likert-type scale developed by Ilhan, Sekerci, Sözbilir & Yildirim (2013). The study sample included 108 in-service high school science teachers from Turkey. The results show that in-service science teachers find educational research applicable and necessary but of limited value. Teachers who graduated from education faculties have more positive attitudes towards educational research and teachers who are newly appointed to the profession have a better understanding of the utilities and value of educational research. This study emphasizes and underlines that science teachers' attitudes towards the value of educational research are under the targeted level. In order to adequately support science teachers and provide them with the intended competencies of their curricula, this study provides some implications for both teachers and researchers in science education.

AB  - During and after the Financial Crisis of 2008, many institutions of higher learning have had revenue and budgetary reductions, forcing them to make severe university budget cuts and university reductions in force. Often the university cuts are preceded by a process of evaluation of academic programs where institutions determine what they stand for and value. One option, when forced to downsize, is to use a business model, such as Sullivan (2004) explains, where high-value, low-cost programs are kept and low-value, high-cost programs are cut. However, a business model of education does not reflect the true social value of education or the importance of arts, sciences and humanities, where students learn how to struggle with, write about and understand the world. John Henry Cardinal Newman's (1852) treatise, The Idea of a University, suggests an alternative strategy of cost cutting that has to do with deep knowledge, i.e. keep the oldest programs in existence on a given university. Using the deep knowledge concept, a university will cut young (junior programs) first and retain old (senior) programs until the very last, rather than deciding cuts based on a business model. The deep knowledge concept emphasizes a Socratic ideal where professors and students wrestle over concepts, such as the meaning of "beauty."

AB  - The present article analyses the changes in practices, ideas, and attitudes proposed by a group of novice science teachers during a further education teacher training program. The research on which it is based is focused on monitoring the training program and its impact on the participating teachers. The training program has as its starting point the practical problems teachers encounter, and is developed fundamentally through team work, debates, and reflection. The study demonstrates the suitability of these procedures to facilitate change and influence the professional development of these teachers.

AB  - In this study, we provide a review of the status of science and technology education. It addresses the achievements of students in Israel who attend high schools with student bodies that are primarily Arabic speaking. It is generally recognized that the achievements of the Israeli students in international examinations are relatively low. When comparing the achievements of Israeli Arabic speaking students to the achievements of Israeli Hebrew speaking students, there is a low correlation. Some of the questions we try to answer are the following: What are the reasons behind the low scores of Arabic speaking students? Do these low achievement levels affect the future choices of science and technology for those students? Is there a relationship between the science laboratory activities and the bagrut results? (The bagrut-represented by subject-specific certificates is the official Israeli matriculation process that attests to graduation from high school. Receipt by a student of specific bagrut certificates is a prerequisite for higher education in Israel.) Finally, ideas are suggested for improvements (starting at the kindergarten level).

AB  - The objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between preservice teachers' time and study environment management, effort regulation, self-efficacy beliefs, control of learning beliefs and metacognitive self-regulation. This study also investigates the direct and indirect effects of metacognitive self-regulation on time and study environment management. Data from 506 preservice teachers was obtained using the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). The results of the study showed that a positive and significant correlation existed between the variables of control of learning beliefs and metacognitive self-regulation; self-efficacy beliefs and metacognitive self-regulation; metacognitive self-regulation and time and study environment management; time and study environment management and effort regulation; metacognitive self-regulation and effort regulation. In addition to the direct effect of metacognitive self-regulation on time and study environment management, there was also an indirect effect through effort regulation.
