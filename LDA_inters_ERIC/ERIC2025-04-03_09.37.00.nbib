AB  - This case study explores how a problem-based learning (PBL), graduate education course could be organized in ways that utilize the current knowledge of how people learn within diverse, real world community settings. Students were asked to identify an educational enterprise and a social problem within a culturally diverse, high-need community. Throughout the course, they designed a service-learning experience, which was linked to the mission and vision of the enterprise while providing a meaningful, sustainable service to the community. At the end of the course, students viewed themselves as potential agents of social change through project presentations and reflections.

AB  - Research into Australian students' science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) engagement has highlighted that there are comparably fewer women enrolling in STEM programs and working in STEM industries. In Australia, males make up 84% of the total population with STEM qualifications, for example, a report in 2015 found only 13% of all engineers in Australia were women. Science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM), an approach to STEM education that encourages interdisciplinarity, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship, is a strategy that has the potential to increase girls' engagement with STEM. This research investigated the impact of the STEAMpunk Girls Program, funded by the Australian Government, on high school girls' learning and their teachers' teaching experiences. The program uses project-learning and design thinking strategies to enable the girls to gain confidence in themselves as change-makers with the capacity to generate solutions to real-world problems. Using a mixed method approach, the findings indicated that teachers and students were positive about the STEAMpunk Girls' experience, with significant increases in confidence and motivation in the girls at the end of the program.

AB  - The value of interdisciplinary research is increasingly recognised by the research community. Funding bodies are nowadays specifically encouraging that research they fund is interdisciplinary in nature. However, what is often branded as interdisciplinary research is in fact a network of researchers working to deliver a research output. In this research note, we share our experience of what we think can be labelled "truly interdisciplinary". We share some best practice tips for those who are interested to go through a similar metamorphosis as we did as a team, learning from each other's ways of working. Overall, it has been a very positive experience and a revelation that has had a big impact on each author's view on how to conduct research as an integrated multidisciplinary team, as it has shifted our mental models and broadened our thinking, capacity to reflect, and critical analysis. We hope that our research note clearly shows the benefits of truly interdisciplinary research and motivates other researchers to follow our pathway of transformation.

AB  - The authors explore the challenges inherent in traversing the multiple boundaries between sociology and social work, and the academy and the community, by examining a service learning course on hunger and homelessness taught by two sociology professors and two social workers on the staff of a community service organization. The authors draw on instructional team meetings and correspondence, observation of class sessions, and formal and informal course evaluations to analyze three "moments": the planning process, a pivotal class session, and students' final presentations. They found that both their teaching and students' learning were enriched by disciplinary differences in knowledge claims, the design and utility of qualitative research, and the process of drawing conclusions from, and making arguments using, qualitative data. The authors conclude that experiential learning has value beyond providing students hands-on experiences. It can also provide a laboratory in which students and instructors can explore the similarities and differences between sociology, social work, and other disciplines.

AB  - Across a wide variety of disciplines, coaching has become the universal practice for improving the professional performance of individuals and, consequently, the effectiveness of their organizations. Despite these shared outcomes, the coaching of individuals such as executives, athletes, and teachers features a variety of approaches, each with its own set of unique coaching elements. The literature in the respective fields has struggled to keep pace investigating the efficacy of these approaches and the relative impact of their elements. Programmatic research on coaching is further challenged by a paucity of conceptual frameworks. To address this challenge, we examined the coaching literature in the fields of education, sports, and business, highlighting a complimentary array of coaching purposes, elements, and processes. Based on this literature, we propose a new framework to specifically advance instructional coaching in the field of education. The content-neutral framework identifies 3 key dimensions of instructional coaching that can situate task- and subject-specific coaching models. Directions for the development of conceptual models and programmatic research are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of sustainability-focused, cocurricular, interdisciplinary programming for graduate students at creating future leaders in sustainability, i.e. did interdisciplinary sustainability programming further prepared graduate students in sustainability leadership beyond the scope of the individual student academic programs from the perspective of the student participants. Design/methodology/approach: The objective of the study was met by evaluating the University of Michigan Dow Sustainability Fellows Program. With a decade of graduate-student participation, surveys and interviews of Fellows alumni from 2013 to 2020 were used to assess the program impact on creating sustainability leaders. Opportunities for program reflections were included through prompted open-ended questions. Findings: A majority (88%) of the Fellows who responded to the survey agreed with the statement that their career path was positively affected by their participation in the program and that the cocurricular program provided opportunities to explore sustainability-related topics from perspectives they would not have experienced otherwise. The interdisciplinary aspect of the program and the focus on practical community sustainability projects were the most valued attributes of the cocurricular programming. Research limitations/implications: Supporting cocurricular interdisciplinary programs requires significant resources and intentionality to engage diverse disciplines and diverse partner organizations. Practical implications: Programs that provide experiential opportunities to build interdisciplinary team skills successfully enable graduate students to become leaders in sustainability fields in the workplace and in outreach and service. Social implications: Cocurricular graduate student programming focused on community sustainability projects can successfully create valued learning experiences while simultaneously supporting communities with practical solutions to sustainability challenges. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work is the first longitudinal assessment of the effectiveness of the interdisciplinary cocurricular programming on graduate student sustainability leadership outcomes. The results include feedback received from eight years of cocurricular programming.

AB  - Purpose: This study adds to the existing body of knowledge on the benefits to learners of using an interdisciplinary design thinking (DT) pedagogical approach taking the form of a micro credential with an extra curricula workshop. Design/methodology/approach: The interpretivist research examined opinion via nine semi-structured interviews with learners who had participated in a workshop. The interviews focussed on demographic information, learning strategies, workshop interdisciplinary benefits and being taught via DT. The recorded interviews and transcriptions were analysed via NVivo and content analysis. Findings: The results are themed into development opportunities, future learning, making meaning and sense and practical application of knowledge and skills reflection for the students. The DT pedagogy worked well for the students who confirmed university learning should be this way, adding to the debate on embedding engaging interdisciplinary methods to embed entrepreneurship and innovation in the curriculum. Originality/value: The research is original as the use of DT has added value to the students' development and mindset. Developing graduates this way benefits the local and national economy, as the reach of graduates' transferability makes them fit for the future.

AB  - This paper presents findings from a small-scale research study eliciting students' perceptions of benefits and challenges of working in interdisciplinary groups to solve an engineering challenge using problem-based learning. Penultimate and final year undergraduates and postgraduate MSc students in the School of Engineering and Physical Sciences at a Scottish university, studying Robotics, Mechanical, Chemical, Electrical and Software Engineering worked in interdisciplinary groups of five on a project to provide solutions to the United States National Academy of Engineering Grand Challenges (NAEGC). Students were surveyed twice, using closed and open questions before and towards the end of the project. Data were analysed using a thematic approach. Findings showed that most students saw benefits to problem-based working with students from other disciplines, citing increased awareness of approaches, future 'real world' professional preparation and efficiency in problem solving. However, challenges around scheduling meetings and concerns around cross-discipline collaboration indicate that universities should provide training for students before undertaking such problem-based projects, to ensure maximum educational benefits. In addition, greater emphasis needs to be put on students' awareness of the added benefits of development of the 'soft skills' needed for future professional practice.

AB  - The importance of interdisciplinarity in the teaching-learning process has been much debated. This topic has challenged schoolteachers, who do not always manage to integrate interdisciplinarity into the school routine. This paper emerged from the discipline Research Methodology taught at the postgraduate course in education of Universidade Federal do Triângulo Mineiro. During this course, we sought to gain knowledge about the academic production related to interdisciplinarity in the teaching-learning process, mainly in terms of teacher training and teaching practice, published in dissertations and theses. We explored contents published from 2011 to 2016 in Brazil. The covered period was based on a search for recent productions on the proposed theme, conducted by using the database of the Brazilian Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations. Analyses of the documents pointed to the need to work interdisciplinarity during teacher training courses and to adopt an interdisciplinary posture in daily teaching practice in schools. These practices should help to overcome compartmentalization of the teaching-learning process and to provide students with a global view of the world.

AB  - Little research has been done on philosophical implications of the middle voice of early Greek and certain non-Western indigenous languages. In particular, the potential of such a medial ontology has yet to be even explored, much less realized, within the context of interdisciplinary studies. As a linguistic structure indicating an ambiguous middle ground between active and passive voices, the middle voice suggests a medial ontology that I develop with reference to Plato's late dialogues. I argue that conceiving interdisciplinarity in medial terms integrates at least some otherwise disparate interdisciplinary approaches, approaches that themselves stem from different disciplinary spheres of influence. Rather than proposing a global theory of interdisciplinarity, this article defends the medial resolution of a tension within interdisciplinary studies between construction and discovery, thereby suggesting an ontological point of departure for the development of such a theory.

AB  - Active learning spaces emerged at the turn of the twenty-first century. The active learning space design represents not only an overhaul of traditional classrooms' physical appearances but also reflects a paradigm shift from teacher-centered learning to student-centered learning. Current available research mainly focused on student academic performance as well as student and faculty perceptions. Limited research has been conducted to investigate interactions at the student level to find out what interactions are taking place in the active learning spaces and how they affect student learning. This study employed a sequential exploratory mixed-methods design inquiring into student learning in an active learning space first through student focus group discussions and then with an online student survey. The major themes emerged from the focus group discussions were utilized to develop the online survey. The purpose of this survey was to cross-validate qualitative outcomes and further seek answers to unanswered questions triggered by qualitative findings. The qualitative data indicated that the spatial equity in the active learning space put students in positive mindsets and induced active classroom participation. The interconnected screens made it easy for students to view class content and collaborate with peers. The group work conducted in the space fostered mutual learning, promoted learning accountability and improved peer relations. The quantitative survey data on group dynamics validated and reinforced qualitative findings. This paper will help educators better understand student behaviors in the active learning spaces and better design space-appropriate pedagogical strategies.

AB  - This paper explores the processes involved in developing, embedding and sustaining an ECCE practitioner capacity building programme in the community through an interagency approach, which utilises mentoring and coaching strategies for increased knowledge and skills uptake. There is now conclusive international evidence that early childhood care and education (ECCE) is vital in children's learning and development, and that the benefits are long-lasting, and are more cost-effective than educational investments and remedial interventions later in life. This signifies the importance of high quality ECCE for development and learning, and highlights the potential impact of early childhood intervention programmes. This paper explores the implementation of a quality improvement strategy in seven ECCE centres to improve child-outcomes as part of the Young Knocknaheeny Area Based Childhood Programme (YK). Utilising evidence-based programmes, practitioners from a range of disciplines, working in a low-income community with high levels of adversity, are immersed in an environment of continuous learning in line with best practice implementation science. The core elements of the quality improvement strategy focused on language supports for staff (Hanen Learning Language and Loving It™ training), curriculum enhancement ("HighScope" curriculum training), onsite mentoring for staff, and an Environment Enhancement Fund for each centre. The implementation of a Mentoring Programme involved weekly site visits by a specialist onsite mentor in which the implementation of curriculum content and the suggested environmental changes and teaching strategies were overseen and supported. Pre and post Environmental Rating Scale (ERS) assessments; ITERS-R (crèche) and ECERS-3 (pre-school); showed significant improvements in the quality of ECCE services in the YK catchment area following ECCE practitioners participation in the quality improvement initiative. Pre-school rooms across the seven ECCE centres experienced an overall improvement of +2.5 on the ERS scales, and crèche rooms experienced an overall improvement of +2.4. Approximately 700 children aged 1 to 5 years indirectly benefitted from YK-delivered curriculum and language training programmes in their ECCE settings.

AB  - Chronic illness requires frequent medical treatments and lifestyle restrictions that increase academic and socioemotional stressors for families. This paper presents academic intervention recommendations based on a hospital's approach to improving educational outcomes for children with chronic illness. A case study on an intervention for a girl with sickle cell disease (SCD) and a history of stroke. SCD is a relatively common chronic illness that has physical and psychosocial side effects that are central to other chronic illnesses (Platt, Eckman, & Hsu, 2016). A quality improvement approach resulted in five cycles of interventions that were assessed with both qualitative and quantitative measures. The initial strategy of improving academics through collaboration among the school, hospital, and family resulted in psychosocial, but not academic, improvements. Frequent tutoring, which was most achievable using online platforms, resulted in the greatest gains. The girl passed previously failed classes and advanced to the next grade. Recommendations for how to improve academic outcomes for children with chronic illness using the presented intervention strategies are discussed.

AB  - In these Anthropocene times humans are vulnerable through the effects of socio-ecological crises and are responsible for attending to past, present and future socio-ecological injustices and challenges. The purpose of this article is to challenge discursive structures that infuence knowledge acquisition "about/of" the world through binary logics, acknowledging that we are never apart from the world we are seeking to understand, but that we are entangled through a mutual (re)confguring "with" the world. Through storytelling and entangled poetry from outdoor education and environmental science education contexts, this article explores discursive/material forces (socially meaningful statements/affective intensities) enacted through pedagogies 'attuning-with'. As pedagogies 'attuning-with' take up a relational ontology, in which sense-making is generated from the grounded, lived, embodied and embedded politics of location in relationship with broader ecologies of the world, they illuminate a transdisciplinary environmental education. A transdisciplinary environmental education is important for these Anthropocene times, because it not only promotes a multivocal approach to environmental education, but in acknowledging our inherent and intrinsic responsibility and accountability for the kinds of worlds that we are co-constituting, it provides opportunities to change the story of how we choose to live with/in/for these Anthropocene times.

AB  - This article is about the multidisciplinary Community of Practice (CoP) initiative that was implemented in the summer of 2020- summer of the pivot- at a Canadian post-secondary institution to prepare faculty, staff, and students for remote teaching and learning while navigating pandemic conditions created by COVID-19. The CoP as a case study using Critical Theory as a theoretical framework examines the experiences of a collective group of faculty and staff from different disciplines leading a multidisciplinary university-wide initiative and the implications of the approach for promoting effective pedagogies for teaching and learning remotely. Findings based on feedback from workshop attendees, reflections from the CoP facilitators, and comments forwarded to senior administrators about the impact and the effectiveness of the program indicate positive results. It is recommended that although the CoP initiative was originally conceived as a response to the summer of the pivot, it should become an integral approach to promoting dialogue and innovative strategies to advance equitable practices in higher education by cultivating community networks. The findings serve to continue constructive dialogues and discussions about how universities can transition, pivot, and mobilize innovatively and creatively to prioritize equitable teaching and learning conditions that challenge the status quo. This requires a long-term commitment by higher education institutions to break away from historically normalized practices and invest in innovative ways to identify and meet the needs of various stakeholders.

AB  - The aim is to describe the development of a novel interdisciplinary graduate school, using the Swedish National Graduate School for Competitive Science on Ageing and Health (SWEAH) as a case example. We explore doctoral students' perceptions of being part of SWEAH and provide implications for practice. Written self-reports reflecting 78 students' experiences and perceptions were analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings reveal that affiliation with SWEAH is highly valued. The students emphasized the tailored courses and learning activities and reported that it was instrumental in deepening their knowledge and broadening their research perspectives. The findings demonstrate how students navigate between disciplinary and interdisciplinary contexts and become enculturated with intellectual mindset and understanding of the importance of network building. The graduate school adds an interdisciplinary layer of learning, influenced by peers and researchers, and demonstrates the importance of community building within interdisciplinary environments and how it can be achieved.

AB  - This article describes the outcomes of a faculty partnership between a math professor and a composition professor to improve the final paper in a research-focused senior capstone math course. Much attention has been paid in recent years to the importance of undergraduate research experiences and how to best create and support such endeavors. However, little space has been dedicated to helping math faculty design and scaffold writing assignments to support their students' development as scholars. We describe how our partnership took place, the changes we made to existing assignments and the creation of new ones, and an assessment of our efforts completed by an interdisciplinary group of faculty and students, which showed marked improvement in the areas of information literacy, critical thinking, and quality of writing.

AB  - Pre-service teachers often learn to teach in siloed methods courses despite evidence that interdisciplinary pedagogies benefit elementary school students. To address this discrepancy, six teacher educators initiated a two-year self-study to improve their practice. They co-created a shared module to integrate technology, literacy, and science content. The self-study was designed to answer the research question: what are the successes and challenges of implementing an interdisciplinary module within an elementary teacher education program? Findings relate to three main categories: teacher education pedagogies, use of technology tools, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Areas of promise for future integration are discussed.

AB  - Interdisciplinary education has become increasingly prominent as a core instrument to prepare the next generation workforce. Yet, little is known about the impacts of long-term degree-oriented interdisciplinary education on post-graduation outcomes. This paper aims to investigate the influence of long-term degree-oriented interdisciplinary education on graduates' post-graduation plan choices and labour market outcomes using unique administrative micro-data and career-tracking data from a comprehensive research university. Our results indicate that higher levels of engagement in interdisciplinary learning increase the probability of pursuing future study and employment in a field that differs from a graduate's college degree, and are also associated with a higher probability to enter the workforce. Yet, this positive association between interdisciplinary learning and the probability of entering the workforce is specific to graduates from traditional disciplinary programmes. Additionally, our findings suggest that the impact of long-term degree-oriented interdisciplinary education on early labour market outcomes is overall beneficial but varies across degree fields. The findings of our study provided partial evidence in support of the influence of long-term degree-oriented interdisciplinary education on post-graduation plan choices and early labour market outcomes. We suggest that given resource constraints, higher education institutions could consider relaxing module choice restrictions in traditional disciplinary programmes to promote interdisciplinary education. However, it is important to note that higher education institutions should carefully consider the potential trade-off between the breadth of interdisciplinary content and the depth of specialist content, in order to strike a balance.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this project was to pilot and determine the outcomes of a multi-faceted, interdisciplinary human papillomavirus awareness and vaccination campaign within a university community. Participants: Students, faculty, and staff of a large urban Midwest-based public university. Methods: This consisted of five key interventions: promotion and outreach, volunteer training, patient education, access, and documentation. Perceived knowledge and attitudes toward HPV and the HPV vaccine, and HPV vaccine uptake were measured as outcome variables. Results: The project resulted in statistically significant increases in perceived knowledge regarding HPV and the HPV vaccine, willingness to receive HPV vaccination, and likeliness to recommend HPV vaccination (p < 0.001). The project also resulted in a 76.6% increase in the number of HPV vaccines administered at the university's Campus Health Center. Conclusions: A novel HPV awareness and vaccination campaign led to increases in knowledge regarding HPV and HPV vaccines, and substantially increased HPV vaccinations administered at a large, urban public university.

AB  - The Teaching and Learning Network (TLN) at the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada, represents an effective network model for faculty and educational leadership development. Grounded in the principles of communities of practice (Wenger, 1998), the TLN is a collaborative network that fosters interdisciplinary dialogue, relationship building, knowledge exchange, and professional development for its members and the broader campus community. This article explains the TLN's structure, goals, and activities, with special attention to practical examples and suggestions for advancing faculty development through this network model.

AB  - The climate crisis is a growing concern for many people, especially those who are of college age, making it an important and pressing issue to explore in honors courses. Eco-Art: Using Art to Reconcile with the Climate Crisis, a University of New Mexico (UNM) Honors College course, integrates the disciplines of art and environmental justice to examine climate change and address the social and emotional toll of climate grief. The class was co-created and team taught by Associate Professor Megan Jacobs and UNM undergraduate honors and environmental science student Kineo Memmer. This article unpacks the methodologies and lessons learned from this intergenerational team-teaching experience. The class forged community partnerships and created short documentary films highlighting climate activism in New Mexico as well as creative works on climate grief. Using an egalitarian instruction model, the instructors found common ground between their respective disciplines to develop projects and cull readings, which they outline in detail. This type of collaboration is key in the climate movement, as intersectional ways of problem-solving are necessary to combat the climate crisis.

AB  - The qualitative community embraces transparent dialogue through sharing knowledge to improve rigour and develop new initiatives. In this paper, we recognise there are many complexities within qualitative research, leading to important debates. We explore the benefits and challenges, as well as the practicalities and technicalities, of conducting research that 1) employs multiple methods within the qualitative paradigm, 2) is interdisciplinary, and 3) examines a sensitive research topic 4) with a vulnerable group of participants. Specifically, when research is also 5) cross-cultural and 6) utilises participatory techniques. Through our discussion, we draw upon an existing project and examine the complexity of designing and completing intra-paradigmatic mixed methods research with children from different sociocultural contexts, underpinned by interdisciplinary perspectives, in a complex area like mental health.

AB  - LGBTQ+ communities experience significant healthcare and academic success disparities due to barriers in care, negative attitudes towards them, and lack of awareness among healthcare providers and educators. Addressing the unique health and wellbeing concerns of LGBTQ+ individuals in the classroom and clinic requires cultural competency among educators and health professionals, yet knowledge and training in this content is lacking. Thus, we created, piloted, and assessed a six-month interdisciplinary professional development program to enhance knowledge, attitudes, awareness, and cultural humility around LGBTQ+ health for educators, administrators, and clinicians in higher education. Participants were surveyed with standardized assessments pre- and post-program to measure their knowledge, skills, and readiness to teach these topics and incorporate them into their curricula and practice. Participants (n = 33) completed LGBTQ+ inclusivity training including six structured learning sessions, small group mentoring meetings, and a virtual visit to an LGBTQ+ community center. Participants consistently displayed interest and engaged actively in training sessions. In a follow-up survey seven months post-intervention, respondents reported changes in their practice to create inclusive environments. Data analysis demonstrated improved knowledge and comfort with LGBTQ+ care and readiness and willingness to integrate LGBTQ+ care into their curricula and interactions with students. These findings suggest that this interdisciplinary professional development pilot offers a useful program to enable educators and clinicians to support the unique needs of LGBTQ+ communities.

AB  - We present a new highly interdisciplinary project-based course in computer aided drug discovery (CADD). This course was developed in response to a call for alternative pedagogical approaches during the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused the cancellation of a face-to-face summer research program sponsored by the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network (LBRN). The course integrates guided research and educational experiences for chemistry, biology, and computer science students. We implement research-based methods with publicly available tools in bioinformatics and molecular modeling to identify and prioritize promising antiviral drug candidates for COVID-19. The purpose of this course is three-fold: I. Implement an active learning and inclusive pedagogy that fosters student engagement and research mindset; II. Develop student interdisciplinary research skills that are highly beneficial in a broader scientific context; III. Demonstrate that pedagogical shifts (initially incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic) can furnish longer-term instructional benefits. The course, which has now been successfully taught a total of five times, incorporates four modules, including lectures/discussions, live demos, inquiry-based assignments, and science communication.

AB  - Transparency in learning and teaching (TILT) has been a growing topic of interest in higher education. This study aimed to examine how a simple TILT manipulation could impact a well-established, popular, interdisciplinary semester-long research symposium that involves scores of undergraduates. TILTing the instructions for this symposium had a significant effect on all three TILT components (i.e., purpose, task, and criteria). Underclassmen benefited equally to upperclassmen in terms of understanding the importance and ways to be successful. Furthermore, although both majors and nonmajors benefited from the TILTed instructions, students studying a course outside their major benefited significantly more than students taking a course within their own program of study.

AB  - Background: Higher education is expected to prepare students with interdisciplinary learning (IDL), which is important for their educational and working life opportunities. The cocreation of knowledge in interdisciplinary teams offers multiple opportunities for the emergence of collective knowledge objects (KOs) and knowledge practices (KPs). Methods: During iterations of an organization simulation course, interdisciplinary student teams created an offer of human resource services for a client. To analyze the students' IDL (84 students in 12 teams), we conducted an interaction analysis, drawing on sociocultural and knowledge practice perspectives on technology-mediated learning. First, video-recordings of two teams' meetings were analyzed to trace the tensions, negotiations, and cocreation of KOs. Second, students' reflective diaries were analyzed to identify collective KPs. Findings: The negotiation and cocreation of KOs were mediated by multiple material resources and participants' disciplinary knowledge. In their diaries, students described the following collective KPs: 1) attending to interdisciplinary problems, 2) responsibility taking, 3) framing expertise and contribution, 4) crossing interdisciplinary boundaries, 5) exploring and concretizing new knowledge, and 6) reflecting and expanding upon practices and knowledge. Contributions: The study widens our understanding of the intertwined dynamics of KOs and KPs through which students collectively create and engage in interdisciplinary learning.

AB  - This review systematically synthesizes empirical evidence on learning outcomes of interdisciplinary learning. A meta-synthesis approach was used to synthesize data in two rounds, based on strict (n = 38) versus more lenient (n = 60) operationalizations of interdisciplinary learning. The results revealed a variety of interdisciplinary learning outcomes that were categorized into three overarching themes: 1) academic and disciplinary engagement, 2) metacognitive skills, and 3) perspective taking skills. Process results revealed that empirical evidence in the field is still in its infancy. The findings of this review can be considered as a starting point for the further operationalization of interdisciplinary learning outcomes, so that robust evidence for various aspects of interdisciplinary learning can be collected, and compared with other forms of learning such as cross or transdisciplinary learning.

AB  - In higher education, student retention challenges and advancing student diversity are not new. Such institutional student retention challenges and student diversity promotions continue to require more focus and effort. A means to help address student retention and improve student diversity through faculty engagement in classrooms is inclusive pedagogy. In this study, we inform researchers and practitioners about the current state of inclusive pedagogical research, including gaps addressing further needs of inclusive pedagogical research from a multi-disciplinary perspective, including science, technology, engineering, education, math, humanities, management, and economics. We also share a non_STEM-Focused versus STEM-Focused inclusive pedagogy literature perspective. Using the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) framework, we reviewed 304 articles to help shed light on existing inclusive pedagogy, focusing on three core competencies: inclusive communications, inclusive pedagogy practices, and the design of inclusive curriculum. Based on our discussion of findings and related implications for future research, we conclude that inclusive pedagogical research warrants improvement across all core competencies and academic disciplines to strengthen improvement of this research field. This study contributes to researchers and practitioners, especially those focusing inclusive pedagogy in classrooms, as well as the body of inclusive pedagogy knowledge.

AB  - In the ten years since the Modern Language Association published their report, "Foreign Languages and Higher Education: New Structures for a Changed World" (2007) dissatisfaction with the "two-tiered configuration" of US foreign language departments has become increasingly vocal. While the target of the criticism is often the curriculum, it has often been noted that programmatic bifurcations mirror institutional hierarchies, e.g. status differences between specialists in literary and cultural studies and experts in applied linguistics and language pedagogy (e.g. Maxim et al., 2013; Allen & Maxim, 2012). This chapter looks at the two-tiered structure of collegiate modern language departments from the perspectives of the transdisciplinary shape-shifters who maneuver within them--scholars working between applied linguistics and literary studies. These individuals must negotiate the methodologies and the institutional positions available to them--in many instances, the latter is what has prompted them to work between fields in the first place. The particular context of US foreign language and literature departments serves as a case study of the lived experiences of doing transdisciplinary work in contexts that are characterized by disciplinary hierarchies and the chapter ends with a call for applied linguistics to consider not only the epistemic, but also the institutional and affective labor needed to sustain transdisciplinary work.

AB  - The main focus of this article is our project of reimagining higher education for ourselves and our students using the central theme of technology-enhanced learning (TEL), which is inextricably linked to education in the present and in the future in many contexts. We argue that interdisciplinarity and interdisciplinary working are central and essential features of TEL and, yet, they are largely invisible in the TEL literature. TEL itself is still largely invisible in the sociology of education literature and, hence, suffers 'dual invisibility'. We suggest that this may be connected to the crisis that has beset TEL research and pedagogy. We examine the power of theory in TEL work, citing the use of cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) in our own TEL work. A detailed account of an interdisciplinary, theory-informed TEL project is provided, and this is analysed to explore how the weave between disciplines, particularly art and design, and education, and interdisciplinary project working can be mutually beneficial in our project of reimagining higher education for work and study.

AB  - The communicative relationships between scientists and audiences they address beyond their specialized fields have become increasingly strained. These fractures result not simply from an ill-informed lay public, but from deeper trepidation about the ethos of science. This forum offers three distinct, yet intertwined, interdisciplinary perspectives on how communication centers can enhance science communication. Part I engages with science communication from the administrative perspective of the communication center director. This section highlights how the synergies between communication centers and the sciences can entrench a center's role as an indispensable resource for preparing scientists to address audiences of nonspecialists. The author offers fruitful suggestions for communication centers encouraging scientific communicators to engage with their publics rather than dictate recommendations and report findings to them. Part II voices the views of a scientist who distills the ways commonly taught communication skills apply to scientific communication. The author explains--and the section embodies--some of the specific communicative practices that best serve scientists as they attempt to relate to diverse audiences. The section concludes by stressing the importance of storytelling that enables scientists to offer compelling accounts of their research and rationales for its support. Invoking the perspective of science and technology studies, in Part III, the author reflects on how to bridge epistemological divides that often lead to confrontational relationships between scientists and non-scientists. Working with both scientific communicators and lay audiences in joint endeavors, communication centers can develop mutual respect and restore trust in the institution of science.

AB  - This article incorporates a multidisciplinary approach by reviewing the use of 3D printing and 3D printing in art. It contains a brief background about the 3D printing process and a description of how 3D printing is being used in schools. Examples of how artists are currently using this new technology are provided to encourage art education teachers to broaden their perspective and approach in their classes. The article concludes that successful use of 3D printing in the curriculum can be enhanced with collaboration between teachers, art educators, and technicians. Recommendations for practice and research such as teacher training, developing repositories for student work and lesson plans, and examining the challenges as well as investigating the impact of the use of 3D printing in the learning experience are suggested.

AB  - Our population is aging, calling for communities to be more age friendly and younger individuals to be more aware of aging issues that will impact their personal and professional lives. However, colleges provide few opportunities for students to prepare themselves for a more age-diverse world. Drawing on a new general education core curriculum that calls for students to gain and integrate information within four different knowledge perspectives, we describe a multidisciplinary course that uses information from the physical and social sciences to examine age-friendly community problems and solutions. Topics included environmental health, industrial ecology, and sustainable energy in the context of social-psychological well-being across the life span. Research activities and design projects gave students hands-on opportunities to apply multidisciplinary approaches to complex problems and gain age-related knowledge. Evaluations indicated that the course successfully accomplished its learning objectives, and several lessons were learned about delivering an age-friendly, multidisciplinary course.

AB  - Beyond the introductory public speaking course, communication centers can play a significant role in higher education through creating an institutional culture of communication that spans disciplines and through contributing to their institutional mission, strategic plan, and student success initiatives. To do this work, this article argues for the adoption of a multidisciplinary approach to communication centers, achieved through three key strategies: collaborative, multidisciplinary leadership; diverse communication center programming; and strategic partnerships. Implementing a Co-Director leadership model allows representation from multiple disciplines, resulting in a stronger communication center better able to innovate, refine, achieve goals, and respond to institutional needs. Using a three pillar center structure that incorporates multiple external perspectives and leverages outside knowledge can increase center reach, improve tutor training and tutee experience, grow faculty participation and buy-in, and raise the overall center profile. By prioritizing strategic, multidisciplinary partnerships, this article offers recommendations for new and established centers that can lead to expanded services and stronger support from campus stakeholders to meet changing institutional needs and to cement the center's status as vital to that institution.

AB  - The development of communication and other soft skills among computer science students is not usually an easy task. Often, curricula focus on technical skills, with team projects being used for the improvement of communication skills. However, these teams usually comprise solely of computer science students. In this paper, we present a didactical methodology, called MIMI, which can be used in a short, intensive, programme for undergraduate students. This methodology has been implemented in real projects that have run annually since 2014. We advocate the use of team-based projects, with an important requirement that each team is both multidisciplinary and multinational. Additionally, the period of teamwork is short and intensive. A significant role in the project is given to team mentors. A mentor is a person, usually a university lecturer, who helps the team organize their work and tracks if the team's planned didactical results are being achieved. The program has proved to stimulate an increase of soft skills among the students who participated and, in particular, among the computer science students. The detailed description of our process will allow others to implement and build similar events in their university or company environments, the focus of which is a Multinational, Intercultural, Multidisciplinary & Intensive (MIMI) methodology approach.

AB  - The articles included in this special issue of Quest emerged from a research workshop entitled "Thinking About Our Thinking in Adapted Physical Activity," held at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, from June 18-19, 2013. The aim of the workshop was to examine different worldviews that contribute to the adapted physical activity research literature, to identify key disciplinary assumptions, and to outline their consequences for multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research in the field. A lack of understanding of the basic assumptions held by researchers often impedes communication between the disciplines. Hence, a sub-theme of this special issue is communication across disciplines. These conversations are, of course, essential to interdisciplinary inquiry.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the present study was twofold. First, we aimed to adapt the English-speaking Anxiety Scale. Second, we intended to investigate the mediating role of English learning motivation and self-confidence on the relationship between English-speaking anxiety and English self-efficacy through a serial mediation analysis. Design/methodology/approach: The first phase included the adaptation of the English-speaking Anxiety Scale into tertiary level based on data collected from 178 students. The second phase tested the theoretical serial mediation model based on data collected from 526 students. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to serve for the first purpose of the study whereas PROCESS macro (Model 6) was run to test the serial multiple mediation roles of English learning motivation and self-confidence. Findings: The results of CFA showed that the fit indices of the adapted version of the scale were acceptable. Besides, it was found out that English learning motivation and self-confidence played multiple mediating roles in the relationship between English self-efficacy and English-speaking anxiety. Originality/value: This research offers a valid and reliable scale to determine the English-speaking anxiety of tertiary level students. Also, it sheds light how English learning motivation and self-confidence mediates the relationship between English-speaking anxiety and English self-efficacy for the first time. Pedagogical implications of the study for future research were presented at the end of the study.

AB  - Understanding how students self-regulate their learning experiences has been at the forefront of many empirical and theoretical advances in both cognitive and educational psychology. Yet, these two fields have traditionally investigated this multifaceted aspect of learning using different approaches, resulting in scientific knowledge that is siloed in separate literatures. The overall aim of this theoretical synthesis and review is to bridge this divide and shed light on potential integrative perspectives and approaches. We compare the theoretical and methodological approaches that have been commonly adopted in these two fields. Next, we identify several factors that contribute to the divide between the two fields. Finally, we discuss three elements that are essential for integrating perspectives and developing a holistic understanding self-regulation of learning: awareness and understanding, innovation and expansion, and collaboration and interaction. Throughout the review, we highlighted how bridging the two divergent, yet complimentary perspectives could facilitate innovative research, extensive practical implications, and improved theory.

AB  - Researchers agree that attention to bilingualism and biliteracy can and should be a goal in all educational settings where young dual language learners are present. The challenge, however, is how to promote biliteracy development while remaining congruent with principles of developmental direction, specifically the idea that children's understandings and skills proceed from concrete to abstract, and from familiar to unfamiliar. This article proposes that bilingualism and biliteracy are achievable goals at an early age in culturally and linguistically diverse settings when educators purposely follow an interdisciplinary sequence of instruction that capitalizes on young children's inclination to play, use their senses, and actively make sense of the world. The Interdisciplinary Biliteracy Sequence consists of three components that include: (1) a direct experience (Phase 1), followed by an opportunity to write about the experience (Phase 2), and concluding with varied reading activities closely related to the initial experience (Phase 3). In all phases, listening and speaking (oracy) activities are present in the form of conversations, songs, formal and informal talk, and intentional language production as children play and acquire language and content.

AB  - Higher education institutions are increasingly interested in innovative pedagogies that offer hands-on, project-based learning experiences in interdisciplinary settings and enable students to address real-world challenges with emerging technologies. To address this demand, a team of educators, in collaboration with community and industry partners, created an interdisciplinary and project-based service-learning program named Envisioning the Neo-traditional Development by Embracing the Autonomous Vehicles Realm (ENDEAVR). The team piloted the program during the 2019-2020 academic year. Program evaluation was conducted using both pre-post surveys and focus groups centered on the program's impact on students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This article summarizes key lessons, challenges and experiences from the pilot program, and shares insights on curriculum design and program implementation.

AB  - Modern social problems are complex, multifaceted, and challenging to solve. Scholars are increasinglyapplying the concept of social innovation as a path to addressing social issues. Social innovation is aninterdisciplinary framework for producing social change that requires creativity, problem-solvingskills, and collaboration across systems. Higher education is progressively understanding the need toprovide interdisciplinary educational opportunities for students; however, little is known about theeffectiveness and impact of providing interdisciplinary learning experiences grounded in a socialinnovation framework. This article describes and analyzes an interdisciplinary summer fellowshipprogram focused on social innovation for graduate students in social work, business, and thehumanities and social sciences. The program employed multiple pedagogical approaches, includingclassroom-based instruction, field learning, and interdisciplinary teamwork. We used qualitative andquantitative pre- and post-evaluation student feedback to examine students' learning and overallexperiences. We found that the fellowship was a dynamic learning experience, through which studentsstrengthened their communication skills and translated academic concepts into practical ideas. The experience also impacted the students' career trajectories, influencing students to pursue careers thatinvolved working toward social progress in a variety of ways.

AB  - Introduction: Religious textbooks are always at the front of the Greek educational reality, following the broader tendency of a school study grounded on textbook culture. The present paper focuses on the visual structure of the Greek secondary religious textbooks (in the three grades) and answers the following questions: What kinds of visuals are used in the textbooks? What exactly does the substance of these things consist of? Where can they go, exactly? Moreover, how do linguistic and visual structures relate to one another? On the other hand, the "otherness" problem is also analyzed through the results provided by the implication of the mixed method used. The latter is accumulated in the assumption of the dynamics of the visuals and their capacity to stimulate the participation of the students through their content. The otherness definition follows two main paths: one of an interdisciplinary approach during the learning process and another concerning the personal stimulation of all students through an inter-social and interreligious level. The hypothesis is confirmed through the interesting results of the present research. Methods: For research purposes, it has been used Atlas ti. The software was available for the qualitative type of research. However, there are various accounts of interesting quantitative magnitudes for comparisons. Results: The primary outcome focuses on a frequency balance among the grades using traditional and more modern visuals in their textbooks. Discussion: Pictures could offer an outstanding pedagogical service when used creatively and effectively. The latter means that the meanings of the day's lesson could be conveyed through visuals to all the students (international students included). Then the religion teacher could initiate a debate in class or assign a related artful thinking activity (providing motivation and inflaming students' participation. Limitations: The first twenty pages of each religious textbook have been used for research. The above restriction consisted of a research choice to avoid a broader statistical data account, which was not the primary goal to achieve. Conclusions: Disregarding the dominant research frequencies and locations and going further from the correlations issues between textual and visual formations as depicted, it might be interestingly argued that the modern and abstract tendencies and options of Grade A and B's religious textbooks consist of a pole of appealing of the otherness in an individualistic and spiritualistic level of discussion.

AB  - As a concept for preparing and promoting adult student success in an undergraduate, Interdisciplinary Studies degree program with an online senior capstone, this article analyzes how the senior capstone serves as the penultimate component in the students' degree completion. To capitalize on student success, academic advisors and faculty members initiate steps to create student buy-in and discovery of the intersection of academic interests, previous life and work experiences, and future goals. Discussions of the senior capstone begin with initial advisement and ultimately lead to the completion of their undergraduate degrees and beyond. Faculty and academic advisors must impress upon students the benefits of an interdisciplinary senior capstone and its usefulness to student endeavors after graduation. More than just a barrier to getting their diplomas, the senior capstone enables students to visualize and connect the practicalities of the interdisciplinary degree program.

AB  - The social work field is a relative latecomer to the digital revolution. To advance the Social Work Grand Challenge "Harnessing Technology for Social Good," the social work field needs a transformative reorientation--towards seeing itself not only as critical adopters of technology but as necessary contributors in interdisciplinary tech partnerships. The purpose of this article is to describe the collective contributions the social work and tech fields can make through interdisciplinary collaboration. We will discuss the potential of technological innovations in social work settings. Then we will describe how social work's emphasis on structural inequity and social justice can develop equity-focused technologies. Strategies will be discussed to overcome barriers to partnerships in the interest of creating a more just society.

AB  - Transforming the chemistry curriculum to an interdisciplinary perspective is essential for preparing students to meet interdisciplinary career demands and to brace themselves for the challenges of complex environmental and health issues. The study introduces four interdisciplinary electrochemistry STEM-lab activities as an alternative to the single disciplinary electrochemistry laboratory curriculum. The electrochemistry STEM-lab activities are designed considering the learning objectives stated in the curriculum specifications. This enables teachers to seamlessly replace the single disciplinary curriculum, which emphasizes the mastery of chemistry concepts, with the interdisciplinary curriculum that stresses applying the concepts in solving complex multidisciplinary real-world problems. The interdisciplinary curriculum allows students to learn electrochemistry concepts considering the mathematics, engineering, and technology disciplines. During the interdisciplinary electrochemistry STEM-lab activities, secondary school students exhibited collaborative teamwork and communication skills. The activities engage them in science and engineering practices, and engineering design thinking. The activities enforce crossing the boundaries between the STEM disciplines to understand the application of principles to manufacture products in industry. Eventually, the activities engender a meaningful learning context that enhances cognitive and affective outcomes.

AB  - Courses at the postsecondary level continue to rely heavily on visual material that is accessible only to fully or partially sighted students. Tactile graphics work for many pedagogical purposes, but in some cases are insufficient; other information and concepts may be better conveyed through haptic exploration of 3D printed objects. However, there is a dearth of 3D-printable open educational resources for college-level content. To address this need while simultaneously teaching students about accessibility and universal design, we designed and taught an experimental course in which students (a) learned about disability in general and blindness in particular (including history and advocacy); (b) explored technology used by people with visual impairment; (c) heard from many blind voices, including guest experts and community members; (d) studied universal design; and (e) designed 3D-printable educational tactile models in collaboration with blind community members. By the end, students demonstrated significantly less bias and more positive attitudes about blindness and people with visual impairment, and were more confident with accessibility, universal design, and assistive technology. We believe this course can serve as a model for similar courses elsewhere as a strategy to teach students from any major about disability, accessibility, and universal design.

AB  - Interdisciplinary competence is important in academia for both employability and sustainable development. However, to date, there are no specific interdisciplinary education models and, naturally, no empirical studies to assess them. Since problem-based learning (PBL) and project-based learning (PjBL) are learning approaches that emphasize students' collaboration, both pedagogies seem suitable to enhance students' interdisciplinary competence. Based on the principle of constructive alignment and four instructional principles on interdisciplinary learning, this paper proposes that students profit more from interdisciplinary PBL (iPBL) than interdisciplinary PjBL (iPjBL). A pre-post study was conducted with a sample of 95 students participating in iPBL and 183 students participating in iPjBL. As expected, multilevel models on students' development in (a) interdisciplinary skills, (b) reflective behavior, and (c) recognizing disciplinary perspectives show that iPBL enhances students' interdisciplinary competence more than iPjBL.

AB  - The emerging field of mind, brain, and education (MBE) is grappling with core issues associated with its identity, scope, and method. This article examines some of the most pressing issues that structure the development of MBE as a transdisciplinary effort. Rather than representing the ongoing debates in MBE as superficial squabbles to eventually be "overcome," this article argues that the politics of MBE language, discourse, and validity suggest profound epistemological differences that transcend a traditional interdisciplinary approach. Instead, MBE would benefit from a transdisciplinary approach that contextually accords equal and differential weight to a range of knowledge inputs from education studies, neuroscience, and other academic and practitioner spheres beneath the broad umbrella of MBE. Specifically, this article suggests that some of the key tasks for those involved in MBE studies require a transdisciplinary approach to knowledge translation and knowledge development.

AB  - Postsecondary curriculum is designed to prepare students for their careers following graduation, which traditionally revolves around technical aspects of their respected career field. Capstone courses were introduced to help ease students' transition from the university into their careers. However, little research containing empirical evidence exists on the effectiveness of capstone courses in natural resources. This study evaluated 6 yr of course graduates from an interdisciplinary problem-solving capstone course in natural resources, seeking to understand the skills gained and what portions of the course were most useful in transitioning students to their future careers. Results show the course was able to enhance students' writing, communication, job preparation, and teamwork skills. Students valued knowledge gained on soft skills, such as communication and teamwork, over technical skills specific to their major. Overall, the students valued the interdisciplinary problem solving nature of the course, as most natural resource issues are interdisciplinary. Areas that could be improved in this capstone model were focused on improving individual student's verbal communication and presentation skills. Information from this study is useful to colleges and universities considering and using capstone courses to determine skills that can be taught and to determine if using real world problems in an interdisciplinary setting in their courses would be beneficial.

AB  - This paper documents an ongoing collaborative project to develop a situated and culturally sensitive mobile application to assess the educational quality of youth-related initiatives in 38 municipalities of the border regions of Portugal. We focus on sharing the narrative of our cross-disciplinary experiences, drawing on reflexive notes written by team members over 1 year. This accountability process relating to interactions, expectations, and negotiations was analysed using the interdisciplinary theories from education and knowledge work. The outcomes of this interdisciplinary work, which is focussed on product development, are filled with unique challenges shaped by distinct disciplinary fields and scientific "habitus." Relational encounters have followed conflicting understandings (around concepts), which took place in parallel with the progressive redesign of the initial plans and expectations. This brought unexpected results, such as learning opportunities and the development of a common ground, indicating that an exercise of reflexive positionality is fundamental for interdisciplinary collaborative endeavours.

AB  - This case study draws a specific link to the practice of action learning (AL) in China. We organized ourselves into an AL set and used Revans' AL, as interpreted by Marquardt (2004), to create a post-teaching dialog to examine the experience gained from delivering an interdisciplinary course online--a novice situation--in a Chinese transnational university. AL's questioning insight occurred after conducting an evidence-based evaluation of online teaching in an interdisciplinary higher education course that used Debattista's (2018) online teaching effectiveness rubric. The rubric offered rich 'programed knowledge' that triggered our question-based inquiry. We conclude that our AL approach is valuable for teacher professional development and offers our rationale for why this particular AL practice would be suitable for the Confucian culture, teaching of interdisciplinary courses, and in novice situations. By conducting AL, we identified a list of key findings, such as proactive communication among teachers in an interdisciplinary course, was vital when teaching to a large group of students. We offer recommendations to improve interdisciplinary online course design and delivery in the future based on reflections from the AL. Implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research are presented at the end of this paper.

AB  - While educators may be well positioned to support unaccompanied immigrant youth, there is limited interdisciplinary research focused on understanding the complexity of youth's experiences in US schools. The purpose of this qualitative, interview-based study was to better understand how youth's transnational experiences pre-, during, and post-migration affected their school-based experiences, and to explore how schools supported them. Participants included ten unaccompanied immigrant youths from Central America and six key informants who worked with youth in a professional capacity. Findings indicate that youth experienced multiple challenges including stressful and traumatic events, barriers to mental health and legal services, and unfamiliar cultural and linguistic norms that sometimes were not recognized or understood by their teachers and schools. The youth also brought important resources, such as high expectations and aspirations and strong connections to family and community. School-based experiences that built from youth's resources and motivations (e.g., through school-community partnerships and responsive classroom practices) had the potential to enhance belonging, community connections, and wellness. More interdisciplinary research is needed to develop and support school-based practices and partnerships in consultation with youth that build from knowledge of their particular resources and challenges.

AB  - This work describes an alternative approach for introducing the concept of pH in high school. We develop an experimental protocol to demonstrate in classroom as pH affects the life of microorganisms. At the same time, we constructed low-cost equipment and a homemade culture media using ordinary products, which they are easily found by the teachers in any commercial store. It was observed that in pH lower than 3 and higher than 13 the growth of microorganisms is inhibited. We applied this interdisciplinary activity to students from six different schools. The results showed that teaching the concept of pH, contextualized with its effect on the growth of microorganism, was significant for the students. Our goal with this kind of activity is to allow students to understand the concept of pH through the application of knowledge allowing them to intervene in their daily lives.

AB  - Mathematics education researchers (MERs) engage in interdisciplinary collaborations that contribute to the mathematics education discipline. MERs' learned forms of work and discourse, i.e., practices, are particular to their mathematics education discipline and might not align with practices needed to conduct interdisciplinary work. We interviewed four MERs who were leaders of interdisciplinary groups to learn about practices they reported using while collaborating with their groups. Using qualitative content analysis, we describe five practices commonly reported by the four MERs. We argue that these five practices are central ways of knowing and doing for MERs when working in interdisciplinary groups. Our study contributes to the mathematics education discipline by unpacking practices MERs use to engage in interdisciplinary groups that are influenced by interpersonal relationships.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity has become one of the catchwords in current higher education and science policies, with the underlying rationale being that scientific breakthroughs and solutions to today's global challenges require collaboration across scientific fields. However, several empirical studies have shown that interdisciplinary promises are not necessarily realised in research practices, due to manifold cognitive, epistemic, cultural and organisational barriers. Drawing on interviews with women academics working in health technology in Finland, this paper traces subtle obstacles, hidden power relations and invisible hierarchies in interdisciplinary research work. A special emphasis is placed on understanding intersections of gender and interdisciplinarity, pointing to gendered implications of the current policy rhetoric of interdisciplinarity.

AB  - Work-integrated learning (WIL) has become an essential component of many university curricula. Recent global disruptions have challenged traditional models of WIL, particularly industry-based student placements, leading to growing calls for new, sustainable models of WIL. Aligned with this call and the increased emphasis on learning across disciplines, interdisciplinary project-based WIL provides an alternative to student placements that is both student and industry centered. This study reports on the outcomes of pilots of this model of WIL across four Australian universities. A cohort of 38 students, faculty and industry staff who participated in the pilots were interviewed. The key challenges and enablers of interdisciplinary project-based WIL are identified along with recommendations for implementation.

AB  - Study abroad and for-credit internships are both high-impact educational practices. Yet even before the downturn in students studying abroad in the COVID-19 era, the Institute for International Education's "Open Doors" reports indicated that in recent pre-pandemic years only about 7% of study abroad programs included for-credit internships, despite evidence that faculty-led international internship experiences present a transformational learning opportunity that offers insights into understanding complex issues on a more global scale. Expanding study abroad models to include international internship experience may be especially effective for introducing or expanding interdisciplinary learning and integrative thinking. Such programming should have a place in interdisciplinary curricula and program development. This article, based on the authors' years of experience of leading over 350 students through 14 internship-based study abroad programs in five countries, highlights reasons why a faculty-led study abroad program with internships is valuable for students and assists faculty in envisioning the possibilities and overcoming the initial hesitations that might exist when considering mounting such an ambitious endeavor.

AB  - This descriptive research study aimed to assess the management of the existing policies, guidelines, and procedures on the implementation of the interdisciplinary approach in performance-based assessment (IAPA) before and during Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a basis for proposing improvements for its implementation in the "new normal". 30 senior high school science teachers and school leaders from 5 private and 5 public schools in Metro Manila, Philippines, participated in this study. The participants assessed the management of existing policies, guidelines, and procedures on the IAPA's implementation using a survey questionnaire and identified its strengths and weaknesses using an interview guide. The researchers developed the instruments used for data collection but subjected to experts' validation and reliability test. Results reveal that the management of IAPA was effective and that it benefits students and teachers in many ways. However, it has also weaknesses, which are associated with the role of school leaders in the implementation of the policies, guidelines, and/or procedures, especially during the new normal education setting. The study provides suggestions for improving IAPA implementation in the new normal covering both the face-to-face and online learning modalities.

AB  - University faculty are called upon to address complex, contemporary problems using interdisciplinary approaches. But do appointment, reappointment, promotion, and tenure (ARPT) criteria reflect and reward this fundamental change in the nature of scholarly inquiry? We conducted a content analysis of ARPT criteria at one university to determine how interdisciplinary work is valued across disciplines and over time. We found noteworthy differences between colleges and disciplines: generally, creative disciplines placed higher value on individual contributions, while the sciences supported interdisciplinary work. The emphasis on interdisciplinary work over time increased in only a few disciplines, as criteria became more current.

AB  - Much scholarship available on team-teaching focuses on K-12 programming, with limited examples in post-secondary education. Adding to the growing research on college-level team-taught courses, this reflection describes how interdisciplinary team-teaching can offer not only a pedagogically innovative experience for students but also highlight the strengths of the faculty in their teaching and research areas. In addition to reviewing the differences between interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary curricula, we reflect on our experience delivering Globalization as a team-taught course, designing learning outcomes and course material, and negotiating classroom strategies, highlighting successful components and considering future iterations.

AB  - Limited empirical research has investigated the impact of interdisciplinary STEM approaches on students' learning with a particular dearth in the area of assessment. A lack of alignment between interdisciplinary approaches in STEM teaching and its assessment strategies is notable. In this study, we adopt an inquiry approach to the ways in which interdisciplinary learning of science and mathematics impacted on student learning through the use of a STEM challenge that involved a real-world task. Two secondary school teachers, one who teaches science and the other mathematics, participated in the study and jointly planned and taught a sequence of science and mathematics lessons using an interdisciplinary approach to their Year 8 class of 24 students over several weeks. Data of students' project reports, video of their project presentation, and teacher interviews were analysed to identify the intersection of disciplinary specific and generic skills in assessment practice of an interdisciplinary task. Our findings highlight the importance of having an assessment rubric with criteria that addressed both disciplinary specific skills as well as generic STEM skills.

AB  - Despite longstanding calls to integrate school science and mathematics, concerns remain about how to achieve high-quality learning in both subjects. In reporting on a teaching approach that aimed to achieve this outcome, the authors focus particularly on the teacher's role. The Interdisciplinary Mathematics and Science project (IMS), an Australian Research Council study, aimed to integrate learning in both subjects through investigative inquiry processes. Teachers guide students to construct, evaluate, and refine multimodal representations in a four-stage teaching model. This article describes the key design principles of this interdisciplinary approach and the focus of the inquiry process. The authors outline the teaching model's stages as a basis for illustrating how teachers have enacted these stages across different topics.

AB  - In massive open online courses (MOOCs), recommendation relationships present a collection of associations that imply a new form of integration, such as an interdisciplinary synergy among diverse disciplines. This study took a computer science approach, using the susceptible-infected (SI) model to simulate the process of learners accessing courses within networks of MOOC offerings, and emphasized the potential effects of a network structure. The current low rate of access suggests that a ceiling effect influences learners' access to learning online, given that there are thousands of courses freely available. Interdisciplinary networks were created by adding recommended courses into four disciplinary networks. The diversity of interdisciplinarity was measured by three attributes, namely variety, balance, and disparity. The results attest to interesting changes in how the diversity of interdisciplinary knowledge grows. Particularly remarkable is the degree to which the diversity of interdisciplinarity increased when new recommended courses were first added. However, changing diversity implied that neighbouring disciplines were more likely to come to the forefront to attach to the interdisciplinarity of MOOC offerings, and that the pace of synergy among disparate disciplines slowed as time passed. In the absence of domain experts, expert knowledge is not sufficient to support interdisciplinary curriculum design. More evidence-based analytics studies showing how interdisciplinarity evolves in course offerings could help us to better design online courses that prepare learners with 21st-century skills.

AB  - In an institution where assessment was viewed as meaningless box-checking for the purpose of accreditation, a new reflective assessment practice changed 15 faculty members' perception of assessment in a single semester. Piloted with an interdisciplinary graduation requirement for Cultural Competency, the new assessment practice became a powerful tool for closing the loop in which participating faculty analyzed evidence to make improvements for student learning. This article provides a detailed history of the inception and development of that practice and evidence of faculty appreciation for a new four-question protocol.

AB  - Cyberbullying has become increasingly prevalent, particularly on social media. There has also been a steady rise in cyberbullying research across a range of disciplines. Much of the empirical work from computer science has focused on developing machine learning models for cyberbullying detection. Whereas machine learning cyberbullying detection models can be improved by drawing on psychological theories and perspectives, there is also tremendous potential for machine learning models to contribute to a better understanding of psychological aspects of cyberbullying. In this paper, we discuss how machine learning models can yield novel insights about the nature and defining characteristics of cyberbullying and how machine learning approaches can be applied to help clinicians, families, and communities reduce cyberbullying. Specifically, we discuss the potential for machine learning models to shed light on the repetitive nature of cyberbullying, the imbalance of power between cyberbullies and their victims, and causal mechanisms that give rise to cyberbullying. We orient our discussion on emerging and future research directions, as well as the practical implications of machine learning cyberbullying detection models.

AB  - Language teaching and learning is commonly considered as a research discipline that resides within the field of 'applied linguistics', at least in the way the field is conceptualized by English-speaking academia. However, if we consider language teaching and learning as practice, this fit is not as neat as it at first might appear. Teaching, learning and using an additional language is complex and multifaceted; it involves languages, cultures, learning, communication, identities, etc., which in turn are situated academically within a host of disciplines. Research in language teaching and learning is therefore transdisciplinary in the sense that multiple disciplines can provide different lenses through which to understand the same phenomena and to build new understandings of the object of interest. Moreover, as a field in which languages and cultures are inherently brought into contact, language teaching and learning is also at an intersection between disciplines that are conceptualized and developed differently in different languages and academic traditions. For example, 'language teaching' as a disciplinary area does not map well onto its French translation equivalent 'didactique des langues'. These interactions across academic traditions therefore represent an often unacknowledged form of transdisciplinarity. This contribution will examine how language teaching and learning can be informed by a transdisciplinary perspective in both these senses. In particular, it will focus on the idea of language learning from an intercultural perspective to examine how multiple disciplines and different disciplinary traditions contribute to shaping understanding of the field; it will also consider some of the challenges of bringing multiple disciplines to bear on this understanding.

AB  - This research provides an analysis of disciplines and disciplinary differences regarding the pedagogical value and content of post-graduate teaching certificates in higher education. Findings and recommendations are based upon a survey (N = 450) of department heads and doctoral students at Canadian research-focused universities. Participants were surveyed regarding their perceptions of the value of a credentialed teaching certificate for new academics seeking employment, as well as whether they believe the pedagogical knowledge and skills that typically comprise teaching certificates are valuable. Examining whether a strongly held disciplinary identity in more senior academics contributes to these differences, the survey results demonstrate significant differences between disciplines for the overall value and, in some areas, the content of teaching certificates, especially in department head responses. Relatedly, the open-ended survey comments show a deeply ingrained disciplinary identity, particularly for those holding the department head roles, which in turn reflected several participants' perceptions of disciplinary teaching and learning knowledge and skills as holding superior value to generic, transdisciplinary programs. Recommendations include a renewed focus in educational development initiatives on linking transdisciplinary approaches to specific disciplinary contexts, further connecting overarching pedagogical theories to pedagogical content knowledge as it is translated in practice.

AB  - This is the second of two Directions articles, which together offer guidance to help the reader gain the maximum benefit from participating in institutional and national multi-disciplinary undergraduate research conferences. The earlier article introduced undergraduate research conferences, summarized the key benefits of participating in such events, and talked the reader through the steps that should be taken to prepare an effective verbal or poster presentation. The focus of this article is on how to make the most of these excellent opportunities when participating. To do this, it is important to understand the importance of networking and engaging with the full conference programme. The participant also needs to be able to identify and action the principles of effective research communication. This paper provides the information needed to work through this process.

AB  - Background: Many disciplines use outdoor fieldwork (OFW) as an experiential learning method in higher education. Although there has been an increase in research into the pedagogical approaches of OFW, the use of OFW is contested. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to synthesize the OFW literature across a range of disciplines to identify common strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) and outline implications for how OFW is used as an experiential learning pedagogy in higher education. Methodology/Approach: A descriptive literature review was undertaken to examine each aspect of the SWOT at the micro, meso, and macro levels, drawing from disciplines using OFW including biology, outdoor and environmental education, archaeology, and the associated geosciences. Findings/Conclusions: Strengths of OFW include engagement, outreach, and professional competencies; weaknesses exist in the areas of equity, logistics, and standards. Opportunities include improving pedagogical practices, diversity, and collaboration, while threats to OFW were costs, funding, outdated practices, and governance. Implications: Academics from a range of disciplines using OFW have similar experiences; therefore, exploring ways to collaborate or learn from each other will further develop OFW as an experiential learning strategy in higher education.

AB  - Assessment is critical to effectively implementing interdisciplinary pedagogy in higher education. We developed an interdisciplinary project for an Introduction to Psychology and Introduction to Criminal Justice learning community at an urban community college. The semester-long project involved completing a series of lessons and assignments in both courses. The study objective was to evaluate the extent to which the interdisciplinary project supported students' learning, with attention to their academic skill development, progress on course learning outcomes, and academic progress in the psychology course. Data procedures included summative assessment of final paper submissions and collection of final paper grades and final grades in the psychology course across two cohorts of learning community students. Findings suggest the interdisciplinary project positively supported students' academic skill development, progress on course learning outcomes, and overall success in the psychology course. These findings demonstrate the value of interdisciplinary teaching and assessment. We offer the interdisciplinary project and assessment procedures presented here as models for higher education faculty interested in interdisciplinary pedagogical approaches.

AB  - As implementation scientists know well, evaluating fidelity is essential for researchers and practitioners when making sure they implement a plan as intended. However, the concept of fidelity remains unclear, given that various conceptualizations exist within and across disciplines. To help researchers and practitioners understand fidelity, a conceptual framework integrating definitions within and across disciplines is needed. The study we report on here aimed to review the many different terms for and definitions of fidelity to create such an integrated interdisciplinary conceptual framework. We performed a rigorous and structured literature review, known as a scoping review. The 77 documents included in this scoping review: (1) defined fidelity by the degree to which a plan is implemented as planned, and (2) discussed fidelity as a concept, definition, conceptualization, facet, dimension, conceptual framework, model, or theoretical model. We used techniques that will be familiar to interdisciplinarians to find the commonalities amid the differences, allowing us to propose an integrated framework for this sort of endeavor. The conceptual framework we propose includes consideration of levels, dimensions, and relationships between key terms in the reviewed literature. It also clarifies the concept of fidelity and provides details regarding reliable measures to evaluate it. This framework can be used by those in all disciplines seeking to assess fidelity. And we think it will be especially helpful to those working in interdisciplinary teams.

AB  - The rising demand for digital information resources and services in the LAM sector has sparked many innovations by educators in recent years, as we seek to prepare students for careers in an environment that has continued to witness rapid and hard-to-predict changes. Granting agencies such as IMLS have played an important role in driving innovation to meet the needs of new professionals, in part by funding curriculum development projects within LIS schools, but also by facilitating dialogues between educators and practitioners. This work traces a 10-year process whereby one LIS school has designed and tested new courses as well as a new Master's concentration geared to the needs of LAM professionals who will be expected to work intensively with digital technologies, workflows, and collections. Through a succession of projects, some with grant funding, the school has been able to engage practitioners on an ongoing basis, enabling it to build a substantial and regularly updated body of case-study data on LAM practices, which has informed course development efforts and which has enabled the school to meet its key objectives of delivering authentic learning experiences for students and to maintain an up-to-date curriculum in an evolving area of study within the LAM disciplines. It is hoped that both the experience and the results to date will help justify continued support for innovations in LAM education.

AB  - Despite growing advocacy of interdisciplinary approaches to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), there are persistent concerns about the practical and principled epistemic bases on which this can be justified as a mainstream curricular practice. A major issue concerns the nature of interrelations between the STEM disciplines in interdisciplinary work. In the paper, we argue that the spatial metaphor prevalent in discussions of interdisciplinarity, and boundary crossing, while useful, has limitations in capturing the challenges and possibilities for interdisciplinary STEM in schools and in some respects misconstrues the cultural and historical nature of disciplinary epistemic practices. We argue, as a contribution to a theory of interdisciplinary curricular practice, that key issues for such practice can be productively seen through a temporal metaphor and that a temporal model can usefully inform schools and teachers in framing and supporting student learning in interdisciplinary settings. To illustrate this, we use indicative cases from two major Australian STEM initiatives to examine temporal relations between mathematics, science and technology, at the micro-, meso- and macro-levels, and the implications of this for disciplinary integrity. Finally, we argue that contemporary interdisciplinary advocacy amounts to a challenge to renew epistemic traditions in the STEM subjects.

AB  - This study measured competencies and conceptual knowledge developed by undergraduates who participated in a 2-month interdisciplinary research project at a large urban university in Southeast US. Working in groups, students chose a shared topic of significant interest and examined it through the combined lens of multidisciplinary insights toward a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. Significant gains were observed on a cloze test of students' conceptual knowledge of their topic in addition to perceived gains in cognitive abilities and skills associated with interdisciplinarity and most-sought-out 21st century skills. Limitations and recommendations are discussed for designing and implementing similar interdisciplinary engagements.

AB  - Integrated or interdisciplinary teaching is an approach that encourages students to synthesize knowledge from more than one discipline in order to solve problems. It focuses on students' interests, a connection of subjects, use of authentic situations and problem solving techniques. This study aimed to make clear the concept of interdisciplinary teaching, by identifying how different subjects could be integrated in a curriculum and how interdisciplinary work could be developed and organized in mathematics classrooms. By reviewing various literature of the research on the topic of interdisciplinary education, the study synthesized ideas, concepts and models in interdisciplinary teaching. Then the study discussed how to apply the explored theory of interdisciplinary teaching in the Vietnamese mathematics situation. It was found out that projects should be used for interdisciplinary mathematics education. A four-step process to design an interdisciplinary project for Vietnamese mathematics classrooms was proposed. This process proved to be a useful guideline for mathematics teachers to design interdisciplinary projects. Two interdisciplinary projects for Mathematics involving Biology as the second subject were introduced in this study. These are examples of how to construct an interdisciplinary project based on the four-step process. Through these projects, students could know how to integrate skills and knowledge of the two subjects Mathematics and Biology to solve a real life problem.

AB  - Against a backdrop of advocacy for interdisciplinary STEM curricula, this paper explores the design principles underpinning a three-year longitudinal research project that develops and evaluates interdisciplinary mathematics and science learning sequences involving multiple teachers and student cohorts across the primary school years. The research uses design-based methodology and deploys a pedagogical cycle based on representation construction and model-based reasoning, reflecting core disciplinary processes, and aimed at foundational concepts. The interdisciplinary structure of sequences in different topics, teacher pedagogy, and student reasoning and learning are illustrated through analysis of three learning sequence vignettes. In these topics both mathematical learning (measure, data modelling and spatial reasoning) and science learning (concepts and practices), were reinforced and enriched through the interdisciplinary framing. Drawing on notes of teacher planning and review meetings, coupled with classroom data, we identify (a) the conceptual and curricular design features through which mathematics and science can synergistically interweave, (b) the epistemological design challenges involved in working with teachers to achieve this interdisciplinary alignment, and (c) the key pedagogical design features that emerged to support this integration. The research contributes to conceptualising how interdisciplinary processes that enable synergistic interweaving of mathematics and science content and processes can be effectively framed and enacted.

AB  - Students with moderate to severe disabilities benefit most when interdisciplinary teams collaborate to deliver individualized instruction, supports and services. This research study seeks to capture a description of education specialists' collaborative experiences working with interdisciplinary teams composed of speech language pathologists, occupational therapists, adapted physical educators, school psychologists and school nurses. The central question that guided this study asked K-12 education specialists to describe how they collaborate with their interdisciplinary teams in four domains of assessment, curriculum development, instruction, and progress monitoring. A descriptive mixed methods approach, which included surveys and interviews, was used to explore this experience. Overall, education specialists reported that teams collaborate most frequently in the areas of assessment and IEP goal development. Findings indicate that teams respectfully share resources, knowledge of students and behavior support expertise, but lack consistency and a shared systematic approach towards collaboration, especially in the areas of instruction and progress monitoring. Implications for practice and research will be described.

AB  - Approaching elective courses and courses on special topics in Chemistry can seem daunting at times, given the varied backgrounds of the students, together with the broad nature of topics. Often, institutions may give incentives for creating sustainability related course offerings, but knowing where to start and how to organize the information presents a challenge, as can tailoring the content and organization to the diverse experiences, interests, and majors of the students. Herein is described a layout to simplify such an endeavor as well as a sample organization of content and representative activities of an interdisciplinary course entitled "Perspectives on Plastic". The proposed curricular structure comprises two key components: a systems-based approach and unique, spiral-like scaffolding of material. The systems-influence allows for students to make real-world connections to the material being taught in class, while the spiraling structure of how material is taught provides students with meaningful connections between individual concepts by cycling back to the same content areas with more comprehensive knowledge each time. Combined, these curricular aspects foster a deeper, more fulfilling understanding of a scientific topic by creating a network of interconnected themes and ideas.

AB  - Supervised Teaching Practice (PES) should promote the development of skills associated with the profile of the teacher-researcher, namely: observation, recording, analysis, reflection. At the same time, it should provide children with rich and diverse experiences that produce education for (with) citizenship. The research project developed at PES was based on the European project UKIDS (Erasmus +) and was based on learning by project methodology, allowing for interdisciplinary knowledge. The challenges set in the project offer a variety of tasks to work on aspects such as initiative, motivation and innovation, as well as, trust and responsible social participation. Specifically, the Trash Value challenge, proposes to give a new life to waste, respecting a sustainable environment. Based on the implementation of this challenge and using the egg cartons, it was investigated how this material potentiated the development of social skills, reasoning and mathematical communication of children in the 4th year of schooling. The research methodology had characteristics of action-research, selecting different techniques and instruments for data collection. In addition to the pre-test and post-test carried out on the students and the teacher in charge of the class, audio recordings, field notes, photographic records and children's productions were collected and organized in the form of multimodal narration. After conducting the study, it was possible to verify that the Trash Value challenge promoted the development of social skills, with a greater focus on cooperation, self-control and responsibility. Convergingly, problem-solving and mathematical communication skills have improved considerably, in an environment rich in children's environmental awareness.

AB  - Modern developmental science is informed by several shared principles and adopts a lifespan approach that goes from infancy to senescence. Increasingly, disciplines outside psychology are adopting research frameworks (e.g., fetal origins, developmental origins of health and disease, first 1000 days) that prioritize prenatal experience as a driver of children's long-term health and developmental outcomes. Despite originating in medical literatures, these new frameworks share many of the core tenets of modern developmental theories. However, they also raise new questions and provoke a broader consideration of developmental influences, outcomes, and contexts. In this article, we describe these frameworks and consider how they align with, differ from, and inform modern developmental science.

AB  - The world of new media has inevitably changed teachers' and students' attitude towards information. Data of all kinds and from any scientific field are easily available at any time. Nevertheless, isolated data have nothing to do with knowledge. We refer to »knowledge« when an interdependence of information has a particular significance in defined conditions. How to use and connect this information is one of the primary issues teachers have to engage with since they are still the main organisers of the educational process. Taking into account the objectives of his/her explanations, he/she chooses certain relevant contents, and connects them, striving for an interdisciplinary view of the world that makes sense and gives sense to his/her explanations, all in an attempt to motivate students in their approach to knowledge. This article presents research in which the participants, future art teachers, had to answer a questionnaire that required comparing artistic compositions and compositions present in nature. Almost half of them could not find proper examples, even though the participants were students who should have been able to manage contents from both fields. Understanding how art follows nature is an important goal within the education of future art teachers. Difficulty in connecting data, transferring knowledge, giving meaning to images and understanding visual and verbal discourse seem to be a persistent problem in many aspects of their education. Possible strategies to improve the situation using transmedia narratives are presented in the conclusion.

AB  - The aim of present research was to examine the effects of interdisciplinary teaching approach on teaching the topic of proteins. In the research, unequal control group model- one of the quasi-experimental research designs was used. The experimental group included 16 students (8 female and 8 male) whereas the control group included 14 students (6 female and 8 male) in this research- which was conducted with the participation of the 12th grade students. A lesson plan in which the topic of proteins was taught in interdisciplinary approach was prepared as the tool of application. A concept map prepared by the researcher and a 5-point Likert type of question were used in collected the data. The data collection tool was given to both the experimental group and the control group as a pre-test and post-test. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, a non-parametric method- was used in comparing the participants' scores in the pre-test and post-test of concept map and Likert type question. As a result, it was found that the application of interdisciplinary teaching conducted in the experimental group had caused differences in students' associating the concepts in biology and chemistry available in the topic of proteins and in their perceptions of their skills in this respect.

AB  - Can you ask students from three different bachelor programmes to help solve planning and routeing problems for hospitals? In the presented case an interdisciplinary approach was shown to be successful after some redesign. Students from Applied Mathematics, Civil Engineering and Industrial & Engineering Management jointly designed solutions for 'traffic' to and through the hospital using stochastic modelling. Importantly this project was scaffolded through coursework, supervision and problem-design. The particular scaffolding strategy employed by the teaching team offers other teacher teams ideas for making interdisciplinary project-based learning a more effective learning opportunity. At the same time we need to ensure that students feel at home in their own programme and will be empowered to work with other specialists.

AB  - Education for sustainable development (ESD) provides crucial opportunities for young people to be involved in complex sustainability issues. This study contributes to existing knowledge about primary school teachers' approaches to ESD across a range of subjects. Norwegian schools can join the Sustainable Backpack programme (SBP), which supports teachers to develop projects that promote a holistic understanding of sustainable development across school subjects. The presentstudy set out to examines teachers' interdisciplinary approach to ESD and the SBP teachers' perceptions of how their curriculum units promote environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainable development. The study is a multi-case study, with curriculum units designed for students aged 10-13 years from 14 Norwegian schools. Content analysis suggest that the units used several subjects to ESD, but the teachers could have challenged the students' reflection to a greater extent in terms of argumentation and critical thinking. The units succeeded to some extent in pursuing a holistic approach.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop an analytic framework for studying interdisciplinary learning in collaboration between schools and child support services. The analytic framework connects the concept of boundary crossing with the social--psychological processes of trust and identity formation. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is written from a theoretical point of view. Empirical research data from two schools are used to illustrate the use and merit of the proposed framework. Findings: The framework proved to be useful for identifying the level of co-work in the two schools. In addition, the framework helped to shed light on how the support for trust and identity formation by the school management aids interdisciplinary learning. Research limitations/implications: The most essential feature of the suggested framework is its use of complex theoretical concepts. Examining each concept in detail would ignore the interconnected nature of concepts in the framework, as well as the fact that it is not yet known how this interconnectedness works. Therefore, the framework is based on a generalised use of the concepts. Practical implications The contribution of the framework for practice lies in its potential to shed light on how processes in interdisciplinary collaboration can be shaped. The framework can be used to inform contextual interventions that seek to optimize collaborative structures. Originality/value: The paper contributes to understanding the complex processes that constitute interdisciplinary learning in collaboration.

AB  - Some argue that supporting minoritized students' "academic language" (AL) development fosters equity in education. Others contend that AL is hegemonic, and that attempts to teach it perpetuate inequities across racial, ethnic, social class, immigrant, and related sociocultural and linguistic student differences. In this article, we frame the topic of this special issue--interdisciplinary approaches to equity in teaching AL--and show how authors across positions and analytic methods examine the goals of teaching AL and recommend ways for educators to foster meaningful language awareness for students. Although substantive, unresolved disagreements between positions remain; we identify points of agreement as well, which we present to educators as interdisciplinary principles of equity in teaching. Namely, educators should (1) understand how language is more than just vocabulary; (2) recognize academic features in students' everyday talk; (3) develop awareness of language and its contexts of use with students, and (4) foster critical language awareness.

AB  - Teaching interdisciplinary courses requires instilling interdisciplinary habits of mind by using strategies for active learning and reflective thinking. This publication emerged from discussions and surveys used to evaluate interdisciplinary habits of mind and pedagogies drawn from different disciplines. Prior to face-to-face discussions, surveys were sent to 75 expert faculty who had great experience teaching IDS courses. The breakout discussions were observed, transcribed, and analyzed. After analysis, the authors came to three conclusive inferences: (1) course organization and structure have an important albeit indirect effect on pedagogy; (2) traditional pedagogies have an important role to play in teaching interdisciplinary courses; and (3) active learning is especially important in interdisciplinary pedagogy, not just a supplement.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of classroom interdisciplinary diversity, a type of classroom diversity that has been under-examined by previous literature, on the formation of university students' entrepreneurial intentions (EI). Design/methodology/approach: Based on Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour and the interactionist model of creative behaviour by Woodman "et al." (1993), this paper provides empirical evidence demonstrating that classroom interdisciplinary diversity is important in the formation of university students' EI at early educational stages using a cross-sectional study design and survey data on first-year business school students and partial least squares analysis. Findings: Classroom interdisciplinary diversity is important in the formation of university students' EI through its positive impact on entrepreneurial perceived behavioural control (PBC) (self-efficacy), a key antecedent of EI. Practical implications: The results have important implications for educational practice as well as for both public and private organisations willing to promote entrepreneurial activity, in particular, the positive effects of combining people with different profiles and career fields of interest on entrepreneurial PBC (self-efficacy). Originality/value: This study contributes to the scant literature on early university experiences in entrepreneurship education and their influence on EI. It studies the impact of an under-examined dimension of diversity (classroom interdisciplinary diversity) on the formation of students' EI.

AB  - To be effective citizens, students need a great deal of epistemological sophistication. This need has become increasingly visible in curricular, research, and pedagogical efforts in higher education. This reflection considers how "citizen epistemology" across the curriculum might enhance student learning about the politics and ethics of knowledge work in ways that better equip them for civic engagement. Furthermore, the complexity of citizen epistemology suggests a need to more fully invest in interdisciplinary and inclusive general education curricula.

AB  - This study examines the exchange of citations between two disciplines -- Educational Technology (ET) and Library and Information Science (LIS) -- as an indication of their interdisciplinary impact. The study was conducted in three phases. The first phase consists of an analysis of citations from ET journals to 15 top LIS journals; the second phase examined citations from LIS journals to 15 top ET journals; the third phase studied the five LIS journals -- not on the original list of 15 -- to cite ET journals and the relationship of citations from ET journals to them. The findings of this study reveal that about 1/10 LIS articles and 1/30 ET articles in the study sample were cited at least once in an article from the other discipline. This suggests that LIS has slightly stronger impact on ET research than vice versa. Among specific journals, the Journal of Education for Library and Information Science and the Journal of Documentation in LIS and Educational Technology Research and Development and the Journal of Educational Technology and Society in ET were most cited in the other discipline. Overall, the findings indicate a fair amount of exchange of ideas between the disciplines of LIS and ET. These findings are significant for interdisciplinary researchers in both ET and LIS as an indication of the links between and impact of these disciplines.

AB  - Purpose: Our aim was to develop consensus on the definition and operationalization of communicative participation (CP) in 2- to 8-year-old children with language disorders (LDs). A clear definition and operationalization can facilitate the discussion about children's communication problems in daily life between parents and professionals. Method: In an online Delphi study, anonymized thoughts and opinions were collected on the definition and operationalization of CP in young children with LD. The 47 Delphi panel members were Dutch parents, young adults with LDs, teachers and assistants, speech-language pathologists, clinical linguists, and clinical researchers. Thematic content analysis was used to develop a concept definition and items operationalizing CP. The Delphi panel rated the suitability of concept definitions using a 7-point Likert scale. Concept definitions were revised with feedback from the Delphi panel until consensus was achieved. The Delphi panel rated items on how well they operationalize CP, using the same Likert scale. Results: The majority (79%) of the Delphi panel indicated that the essence of CP was captured by the definition: "CP is understanding and being understood in a social context, by applying verbal and non-verbal communication skills." In addition, 33 behavioral items were developed. Conclusion: This study resulted in strong consensus on the definition of CP between Dutch parents and professionals. Items were developed that can inform speech-language pathologists on the type of questions to ask a child's parents or teacher when discussing CP. Further research is needed on how the items can best be used in clinical practice.

AB  - The primary objective of this paper is to offer a new way of understanding the creative processes of multidisciplinary groups, whose work is to generate innovative ideas. The paper reports from a project focused on organizational creativity at the group level, investigating what characterized such creative processes in that context. This project used ethnography as a qualitative method including participant observation, focus group interviews, and individual qualitative interviews. Furthermore, an inductive approach was used to analyze the data. Findings showed that when group members from different disciplines collaborated on innovative idea generation, the creative processes were characterized by a multivoiced stimulation of fantasy. In the paper, we first discuss how imagination involved new ways of combining knowledge and ideas based on one's own and others experiences, including the use of technological tools. Secondly, we discuss how imagination was ignited by diversity and tension. Thirdly, we elaborate on the importance of emotion and support for the drive and stimulation of imagination in groups. Finally, we sum up the discussion by presenting a model based on the concept of Polyphonic Imagination, in order to visualize the characteristics of the creative processes. We propose this concept of Polyphonic Imagination, derived from the empirical data, to designate the ways in which different perspectives in the groups created tensions that fed into the group members´ imagination whenever these perspectives acknowledged each other.

AB  - The article deals with the problem of interdisciplinarity impact on higher petroleum education in Ukraine. Different views on the essence of interdisciplinarity, especially in the context of higher petroleum education, have been presented. It has been indicated that many scholars have studied the essence of interdisciplinarity within higher education systems of different countries and identified that interdisciplinarity encompasses a combination or interrelation of various sciences that are embodied in engineering training process. Interdisciplinarity is considered as one of the effective tools to support enthusiasm of young generation for petroleum engineering; to increase motivation of future petroleum experts; and to enhance the efficiency of collaboration between professionals from different fields. In reality, interdisciplinary approach is very often confused with multidisciplinarity when educators give students knowledge from various disciplines without making the link between them into a coordinated whole. It has been concluded that interdisciplinarity or interdisciplinary approach can be regarded as a natural training context in which boundaries between knowledge systems tend to be erased and a new teaching paradigm is required. It has been revealed that implementation of interdisciplinary approach in engineering programmes necessitates the development of such an educational framework that would provide educators with the relevant methods, tools, and models for design of interdisciplinary engineering curricula regarding specific learning outcomes and ensure support for faculty members to improve their own competence in the interdisciplinary issues. The standards and guidelines of international educational interdisciplinarity of degree programmes in petroleum engineering are analyzed in the article.

AB  - This article reports on a qualitative investigation of Australian, grade 4 primary (elementary) school children's reflections on their learning in a year-long kitchen garden program. Focus group interviews, journal collection, and observations were conducted with three cohorts of students (age 9-11 years) to give insight into whether kitchen garden programs can assist with connecting children to nature and developing ecoliteracy. Findings suggested that frequent visits by the children to the garden assisted with building familiarity and ownership of the garden. This intimacy with the garden created the basis for perceptive observations on changes to the plants and animals in the garden, increased empathy with living creatures, and built interest in the natural environment. Some children also discovered complex interconnections and noted their actions could affect the health of the environment. Facilitated, reflective discussion enabled the primary aged students to explicate their increased engagement with and concern for nature. It is contended that, over time, immersion in transdisciplinary kitchen garden learning experiences can develop students' "ecoliteracy."

AB  - There is a growing interest in multi/inter/transdisciplinary (MIT-D) work, which requires increasing levels of knowledge and co-production interaction. Many studies have addressed this theme with different approaches such as the nature of transversal scientific subjects, the concept of knowledge integration, and the dynamics of research groups to work consistently in collaboration. These are critical factors, particularly to government agencies responsible for assessment and funding researchers, research teams, or graduate courses. In this article, we propose a systemic MIT-D framework to graduate courses and research team's assessment. It takes into account the historical and current research in graduate courses assessment and a national graduate assessment system grounded on peer review and descriptive information conducted by a Brazilian public agency. The framework has three levels of analysis, allowing participation of multiple decision makers, using different approaches to explore four analytical dimensions (individual abilities, collaboration, content, and outputs/outcomes). We have analyzed its applicability in scientometric approaches and research assessment conducted by governmental agencies. The proposed framework is suitable and broadly relevant for both researchers and decision makers for analyzing courses and research teams.

AB  - The general aim of the study was to improve students' awareness of gender equality. An instructional design was developed in which mathematics, science, information technologies and software (ITS) courses were integrated, with the theme of gender equality at the center. The method of the study was determined as a case study. The participants of the study were 21 sixth-grade students at a public school in Turkey. Research data were collected using the "Views Form on Gender Equality" and "Practice Evaluation Form" developed by the researchers. According to the students' views, it was determined that an interdisciplinary education on gender equality had positive effects on improving students' awareness of gender equality. When the students' views about the practice process were examined, it was seen that the positive opinions about the process were high in number, and students presented few negative views.

AB  - The study explored the effects of an interdisciplinary learning approach on developing students' English learning (EL) and computational thinking (CT) through two different game-based learning approaches. A quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in terms of enhancing students' CT knowledge and their EL achievement in an elementary school English as a foreign language learning context. A total of 52 Grade 3 students took part in the experiment, of whom 28 assigned to the experimental group learned with a machine educational robot (machine-ER) board game and 24 assigned to the control group learned with a character educational robot (character-ER) board game. The results indicated that both groups made significant improvements in learning achievement: 1) in EL achievement of learning vocabulary and sentence patterns; 2) in CT concepts, although the machine-ER board game produced a greater increase than the character-ER board game in both language learning achievement and CT knowledge; 3) their learning anxieties were also lower than those of the control group; and 4) the analysis of behavioral patterns also revealed that students playing the machine-ER board game demonstrated better language-learning interaction, while the character-ER board game presented greater CT development in finding solutions.

AB  - The current anthropogenic climate crisis presents unique challenges to the higher education classroom. Pedagogy in the context of climate change must be attuned to complex and varied student experiences that can contend with feelings of anxiety, disconnection, distress and hopelessness. As educators and researchers, we collate our pedagogical approaches in the humanities and social sciences to progress ongoing discussions about climate pedagogy and highlight possibilities for action from Australia. Drawing on the inherent interconnectedness of our disciplines, we offer an interdisciplinary agenda for teaching in the climate crisis that is attuned to framing, positionality and reflexivity; multiple temporal and spatial scales; other ways of living and knowing; and creative action and activism to cultivate an affective classroom.

AB  - E-learning modules were developed to enhance student engagement, reflection and interdisciplinary learning in Pathology courses undertaken by students from the Biomedical Science, Allied Health, and Complementary Medicine disciplines. The modules focused on generating multi-disciplinary and team-based solutions to diagnosis, prognosis and treatment/management of patients. At pre- and post-intervention, we analysed the students' experience of three themes: E-learning, reflection, and interdisciplinary learning. Flexibility and ability to reinforce understanding of course content were identified as main advantages of e-learning but a lack of direct support was a common concern. Visual aids and interactive assessments were suggested to improve online experiences. While all students had a positive pre-conception of all themes prior to intervention, the delivery of the modules significantly improved students' perception on how e-learning deepened their understanding of course materials via reflection and interdisciplinary learning, with both aspects serving to create a holistic learning experience.

AB  - There is value in integrating social-emotional learning with academic development as a way to support children's abilities to effectively communicate ideas, collaboratively solve problems, and strengthen early literacy practices. In this article, we discuss suggestions for using picturebook read-alouds as stepping stones for integrating social-emotional learning (SEL) competencies and core standards (ELA and SS) to address topics related to social justice, equity, and inclusion. We connect each SEL competency with a related topic for discussion and highlight lesson ideas for early grades to examine these themes, including potential prompts a teacher may use to foster curiosity and help students develop questions about each topic.

AB  - This research is a needs analysis study aimed at developing a curriculum based on an interdisciplinary context-based learning approach within the 10th-grade physics course, focusing on the electricity and magnetism unit. The research was designed according to the case study model and data were collected from expert, teacher, and student sample groups through questionnaires and interview forms. Descriptive statistics were utilized for quantitative data analysis, while content analysis technique was employed for qualitative data. The results indicated that the physics curriculum continued to maintain a disciplinary perspective and a classical understanding of physics, with insufficient connection with daily life and adaptation to contemporary conditions. Similar results were identified in the 10th-grade physics textbooks and in-class instructional practices concerning the unit of electricity and magnetism. In this respect, the research identified the needs for developing a curriculum based on an interdisciplinary context-based learning approach to address these negative results. These needs, while enhancing interdisciplinary context-based understanding, can also contribute to the emergence of various opportunities and different perspectives in physics education. It is recommended to identify needs in other subfields of physics as well and develop curricula designed with an interdisciplinary context-based approach for more effective and efficient physics education.

AB  - Background and Context: The Domain-Specific Programming (DSP) platforms EarSketch and TunePad are being used widely in schools for coding novices. Existing studies on both platforms have mainly concentrated on attitudinal changes, leaving a gap in the literature. Objective: The purpose of this research was to advance our understanding of two contrasting DSP platform designs that aim to achieve the same Computational Thinking (CT) learning goals. Method: Two mixed-method case studies were conducted in an authentic school setting to evaluate the design and use of EarSketch and TunePad. Findings: The results suggest both platforms enabled CT that contributed to interdisciplinary learning outcomes, but educators and DSP platform designers should be mindful of their respective strengths, weaknesses, and limitations. Implications: Each platform may suit diverse educational goals, considering individual student backgrounds and interests. Additionally, when designing DSP platforms with interactive graphical features, trade-offs for enabling CT should be considered.

AB  - The galvanic cell is a typical interdisciplinary topic, which is primarily taught in chemistry but its underpinning is closely related to physics. Student learning in galvanic cell has been extensively studied in chemistry education, which has revealed a large number of misconceptions that are difficult to change through traditional instruction. A source of the learning difficulties is that most students lack an explanatory framework to integrate the many complex phenomena and processes into a coherent knowledge system. As a result, students often rely on memorization of terms, laws, and equations in solving problems but without a meaningful understanding of their reasoning. To address the deficit in learning, this study aims to help students develop an explanatory framework for supporting an integrated knowledge structure. Specifically, a conceptual framework model for galvanic cell is developed based on the central idea from physics, which is used as the core concept for mechanistic explanations of the related chemistry concepts. Guided by the conceptual framework, an instrument is developed to assess the knowledge integration in student learning of galvanic cell. A combination of qualitative and quantitative measures was used to assess the levels of knowledge integration in learning galvanic cell with a large number of Chinese high school and college students. The assessment results show that the conceptual framework model can effectively represent the knowledge structures of students at different levels of knowledge integration. The galvanic cell conceptual framework and assessment results can provide useful resources for teachers to develop instruction for promoting knowledge integration.

AB  - It is widely recognized that the great challenges of the 21st Century cannot be understood or addressed through one discipline operating in a silo of research. Solutions to grand scale problems require varied expertise and multiple disciplinary methodologies to generate plausible solution strategies. The individuals involved in transdisciplinary research projects must be capable of employing scientific methods and traditional research skills, as well as engaging additional methods of inquiry such as those used in an art or design studio. In this paper, I first look at literature on transdisciplinarity and note the pattern of importance placed on the transdisciplinary individual. Secondly, I argue that studio pedagogy is integral to fostering the growth of the transdisciplinary individual capable of multi-modal inquiry practices.

AB  - An ongoing challenge in higher education is the support of educators in their development of effective pedagogies. The field of educational research and practice referred to as Learning Design may be able to help educators with no or limited pedagogical training deliver highly interactive and contemporary teaching and learning offerings. The present study reported the findings from a trial of new technologically supported Learning Designs. These pre-designed lessons are referred to as Transdisciplinary Pedagogical Templates (TPTs). These templates contain prepopulated pedagogical instructions to educators and students, but are free of subject specific content allowing them to be used in discipline areas as diverse as teacher education, accounting, engineering or medicine. These TPTs have been designed to assist educators provide constructivist learning experiences, without the need for pedagogical upskilling. This research explored the practical efficacy of the de Bono LAMS template model, documenting educator and student engagement patterns and issues arising from the trial of the five de Bono LAMS sequences. The findings suggest an interest in TPTs by educators and students, but also a reluctance to engage with research, citing mainly a lack of time. The findings also point to a need to better understand students' affective states and the role of emotional intelligence in technology enhanced learning and teaching provision.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to explain the relevance of science-society interfaces and their potential for higher education institutions to engage stakeholders in supporting sustainable change in cities, via the transdisciplinary learning and teaching approach of the Regional Centre of Expertise on Education for Sustainable Development Vienna. Design/Methodology/Approach: This case study stresses new forms of transdisciplinary learning and teaching as essential drivers of a sustainable urban development. The inter- and transdisciplinary teaching course "Sustainability Challenge", which has been offered since 2010 as a collaborative project by the four largest universities of Vienna, highlights the value of experienced-based learning approaches and the method of service learning. Special attention is devoted to the opportunities and challenges of the setting provided by the applied science-society interface and the particular method of service learning with its concrete benefits for the city of Vienna. Findings: In analyzing the conceptual framework of the teaching course as well as conducted service learning projects, the authors prove potential benefits of transdisciplinary learning and teaching for real answers to urban sustainability challenges. Portraits of the most successful service learning projects are presented, with partners such as the City of Vienna, an organization and one enterprise. Lessons learned from the case study and key elements of the institutionalized umbrella function of science-society interfaces that provide prerequisites for applying transdisciplinary learning and teaching are shown. Originality/Value: Finally, main requirements, challenges and necessary institutional settings for transdisciplinary learning and teaching are summarized.

AB  - Background: Knowledge about the brain has been growing rapidly since the 1990s as a result of developments in neuroscientific research linked to improvements in functional neuroimaging and other brain imaging technologies. As the brain is the "principal organ involved in learning" (1), it would seem reasonable to assume that education should be one of the chief beneficiaries of this research, leading to advances in our understanding of how people learn, the development of new curricula and innovative teaching and learning approaches. However, the linkage between neuroscience and education has, historically, always been weak, and, we suggest, continues to be so, notwithstanding important research initiatives since the year 2000. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to critically explore current theoretical understanding of joint neuroscientific and educational research, herein referred to as "neuroeducational" research. There is a particular focus on a critique of the transdisciplinary model as applied in a study of imitation in learners with autism. Main argument and sources of evidence: The review of the literature in the first half of the paper identifies the key barriers to neuroeducational research, including neuromyths, lack of shared understanding, the problem of the translation of neuroscientific findings to schools and clashing research assumptions, methodologies and traditions. However, a model of transdisciplinarity is presented as a possible way forward. This model is tested in the second half of the paper against the experiences of the authors in conducting transdisciplinary research in autism and imitation in the secondary classroom. Here, we develop the concepts of "transfer affordances", "transfer challenges" and "transfer opportunities" to structure our analysis of the various dimensions of the transdisciplinary research process. These new concepts are defined, and their relevance and utility explained. Conclusions: The main conclusion of the paper is that the transdisciplinary research process within neuroeducation is complex, far from fully understood and requires further mapping. It is proposed that the concepts of "transfer affordances", "transfer challenges" and "transfer opportunities" are useful theoretical ideas in pursuit of this aim.

AB  - This research study examined the impact of COVID-19 on university students' perceptions about the effectiveness of a community-based service-learning project designed to prepare graduate students in special education and undergraduate students in psychology and speech-language pathology to work in transdisciplinary teams in early childhood settings. Students were placed into transdisciplinary teams and assigned to one of two community-based early childhood programs to administer a universal screening tool that assessed young children in several domains. The project was in its sixth year when the country stood still because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The project was re-envisioned, mid-course, to provide an equitable and rigorous assignment for students who were unable to complete the original assignment due to the lockdown. Student perceptions were compared, pre and post COVID; subsequent results are discussed in alignment with the original four goals of the project. Additionally, suggestions are posed to position this service-learning assignment for remote delivery should the pandemic persist to disrupt higher education.

AB  - The fourth revolution of industrialization has enormously influenced the education sector and needs to be dynamic and sensible in light of the changeable requirements of employers. Specifically, higher education institutions (HEIs) must focus on the global labor market to offer an innovative curriculum and attract prospective students. One of the current trends in the higher education sector is to design interdisciplinary degree programs. The interdisciplinary master's degree program is relatively new in Mongolian tertiary education. Therefore, we aimed to identify the need for a master's degree program in interdisciplinary studies in education from the perspective of prospective students and also determine the areas of studies that have been preferred in the field of education. In this study, two online surveys and a focused-group interview were conducted. Three hundred ten educators were involved in the online surveys and focused-group interviews. The research questions were created on Google form, data was collected electronically, and focused group interviews were conducted simultaneously. The findings indicated that 52% of the prospective students preferred a master's degree program in interdisciplinary studies in education, and a diverse combination of areas has been demanded, in particular, education and modern teaching methodology (26.4%); teaching and linguistics (25.5%); education and international studies (23%) and, teaching and psychology (19.4%). The other important finding was that interdisciplinary studies would be able to provide the necessary knowledge and skills that make graduates competitive in the labor market.

AB  - The incorporation of interdisciplinary education, a topic of significant global interest, is increasingly being recognized as a key aspect of educational innovation in Vietnam. This recognition extends to several fields, including STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education. This research aims to design and implement a STEM situation associated with the context of water protection in Vietnam for 10th-grade students in which students mobilize the knowledge of Physics (specific gravity, Archimedes' principle) and Mathematics (volume) to design a salinometer. This device measures the salinity of the water. The research methodology is based on the observed increase in saline levels in the coastal regions of Vietnam in recent years, which has had a substantial impact on agriculture and the livelihoods of millions of people. This methodology aims to provide realistic scenarios for students to address and resolve these problems. A total of forty students in the 10th grade were involved in a teaching situation that consisted of five distinct phases. Forty 10th-grade students participated in a teaching situation conducted in five phases. The results showed that the situation helped students strengthen and connect their physics and mathematics knowledge, create a vibrant learning atmosphere, enhance communication, and develop problem-solving competency. Furthermore, the teaching situation also needs to be revised regarding the measurement practices of Vietnamese students. The situation contributes to educating students' awareness of current events, protecting Vietnamese water resources, and the importance of sustainable development.

AB  - In recent years there has been a movement towards offering interdisciplinary curricula within higher education. While there are numerous benefits associated with interdisciplinary learning, the disciplinarily focused structure and culture of higher education can constrain interdisciplinary activities, and the challenges associated with developing this type of learning experience have been less researched. Given that faculty are key figures in organizational change and curriculum development, this study sought to understand faculty members' perspectives on interdisciplinary curriculum development and refinement, including their perceptions of what constitutes an interdisciplinary program, the value associated with interdisciplinarity, and the challenges they have experienced developing and/or refining interdisciplinary programs. Faculty members from the Faculty of Science at a mid-sized university in the province of Ontario, Canada were interviewed, and these data were subjected to a content analysis. Faculty perceived interdisciplinary academic programs as including a collection of courses that offer a combination of knowledge from different disciplines; however, only a few participants identified the integration of knowledge from different areas of study as key to interdisciplinarity. Participants perceived that interdisciplinary learning was important for students to develop diverse, but not necessarily integrated, skillsets. Challenges related to interdisciplinary curriculum development and refinement included navigating institutional structures and collaborating with other academic units. Suggestions for navigating interdisciplinary curriculum development are discussed.

AB  - The Grand Challenges for Social Work were introduced by the American Academy for Social Work & Social Welfare in 2016, which are social problems that are interrelated and "exceedingly complex". We discuss the relevance of complexity theory, operationalized by complex adaptive systems (CAS), to the Grand Challenges. CAS moves beyond current ecological systems approaches and is more appropriate for studying nonlinear, dynamic phenomena such as the Grand Challenges. We explore ideas for incorporating CAS into the social work curriculum at all levels. Adopting CAS into social work practice and research via changes to the curriculum will complement current practices and can facilitate interdisciplinary research teams, and thus has tremendous promise for helping social workers address the Social Work Grand Challenges.

AB  - The human resource skills gap in cybersecurity has created an opportunity for educational institutions interested in cybersecurity education. The current number of schools designated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and National Security Agency (NSA) as Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) to train cybersecurity experts are not sufficient to meet the shortfall in the industry. The DHS has clearly mapped out knowledge areas for cybersecurity education for both technical and non-technical disciplines; it is therefore possible for institutions not yet designated CAEs to generate cybersecurity experts, with the long-term goal of attaining the CAE designation. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the need for a top-driven, multidisciplinary approach to cybersecurity education especially at schools that have not yet been designated as Centers for Academic Excellence. The paper also suggests a multi-faceted approach and the important considerations needed to achieve a successful cybersecurity educational program.

AB  - The creation of a community classroom, grounded in the philosophy of experiential learning, was the challenge for our education students and ourselves as instructors. Goals for our students became twofold: goals as a current post-secondary student and goals as a future educator. To activate this experience, groups of students engaged both collaboratively and individually with exploratory learning at a local community classroom site. Student reflections showed deep value and learning through this experience and of this experience. There were challenges, including navigating collaborative group work and the necessity of becoming vulnerable, alongside the successes of connecting exploratory learning to the real world and witnessing authentic interdisciplinary work. Further questions arising from this research center on authentic assessment practices and the idea of giving back to the community are explored through these real world experiences.

AB  - One promising way to cope with changing requirements from the labor market in the domain of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), but also to keep the field up to date, to start innovations and to advance the STEM domain as such is the use of student labs. In these labs, students work together in small groups imitating professional practice of design and technology workers. More insights are needed in what competences student labs in the STEM domain address and what the implications would be for the design of student labs. A review of empirical studies on student labs and additional literature indicate that five generic competences are addressed in most student labs: Collaboration, communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and creativity. In order to effectively enhanced these competences, student labs should be designed as authentic productive learning environments based on three design principles: (1) Realistic, complex task situations, (2) Multidisciplinarity, and (3) Social interaction. IoT Rapid Proto Labs are examples of such a student labs, in which cross-border multidisciplinary teams of students, teachers (coaches), and practitioners jointly develop solutions to challenging IoT applications (Internet-connected objects), add value for enterprises, and strengthen the employability, creativity and career prospects of students.

AB  - Developing technologies to support individuals with ASD is a growing field of research facing numerous challenges. First, while the individual with ASD is central, the motivations of others, such as parents, are often taken as the motivations of the individual. Second, the desirable cross-disciplinary pollination for improved intervention can often face difficulties due to a lack of a common language among disciplines. Thirdly, the literature often lacks enough information to allow a clear understanding of the targeted contexts and goals not enabling an assessment of outcomes and building on past advances. To tackle these challenges, we propose that families of Personas and scenarios are used throughout the design and development process, and as dissemination resources, and provide illustrative examples.

AB  - Problem-based learning (PBL) has emerged as a suitable approach to shift from teacher-centered to learner-centered education. However, higher education institutions (HEIs) experience obstacles stemming from lecturers' and students' reservations as well as organizational challenges. Following action research, the author reflects on her implementation of interdisciplinary PBL within one exemplar case study to explore opportunities and challenges of interdisciplinarity in the transition toward a PBL curriculum in a traditional HEI. At the organizational level, interdisciplinarity facilitates collective knowledge creation about PBL by providing interdisciplinary learning spaces and in-house training. At the team level, lecturers as well as students can collectively learn about PBL. At the individual level, interdisciplinary student-to-student and lecturer-to-lecturer learning can enhance personal knowledge about PBL. Monodisciplinary structures, discipline-based differences in teaching and knowledge traditions, as well as individual prejudices are sources of challenges associated with interdisciplinarity in organizational learning.

AB  - Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to "forced innovation" in the health education industry. High-quality training of the future rural health workforce is crucial to ensure a pipeline of rural health practitioners to meet the needs of rural communities. This paper describes the implementation of an online multidisciplinary teaching program focusing on integrated care and the needs of rural communities. Design/methodology/approach: A multidisciplinary teaching program was adapted to allow students from various disciplines and universities to learn together during the COVID-19 pandemic. Contemporary issues such as the National Aged Care Advocacy Program for Residential Aged Care COVID-19 Project were explored during the program. Findings: This case study describes how the program was adopted, how learning needs were met, practical examples (e.g. the Hand Hygiene Advocacy within a Rural School Setting Project), the challenges faced and solutions developed to address these challenges. Guidelines are proposed for remote multidisciplinary learning among health professional students, including those in medical, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, and allied health disciplines. Originality/value: The originality of this program centers around students from multiple universities and disciplines and various year levels learning together in a rural area over an extended period of time. Collaboration among universities assists educators in rural areas to achieve critical mass to teach students. In addition it provides experiences and guidance for the work integrated learning sector, rural health workforce practitioners, rural clinical schools, universities, policy makers, and educators who wish to expand rural online multidisciplinary learning.

AB  - This paper details the research design of a multidisciplinary, multi-method, collaborative research project investigating health communication from the experiences of the early childhood education (ECE) sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the rapidly evolving pandemic, the ECE sector was instantly tasked with expanding their required health practices to prevent the spread of infection. It was evident that the sector needed a system to communicate health advice in a timely, consistent and effective manner. Founded on a partnership model based on 'knowledge brokering' theory, this project demonstrates the value of a multidisciplinary research team collaborating with stakeholder organisations to investigate how COVID-19 health information traversed through complexities of organisational layers and diverse communities of families and staff. Detailing our data collection and analysis protocols, we conclude by outlining how our innovative research design is generating actionable and impactful recommendations for both the ECE and health sectors.

AB  - Agricultural and natural resource managers face complex problems that involve thinking across multiple disciplines, particularly in North America where professionals often work in multi-use landscapes containing both private and public lands. Here we describe a multidisciplinary, conflictbased experiential learning course we developed to prepare students to address complex issues facing future managers working at the public-private land interface. Using both pre- and post-course surveys and qualitative analysis of reflective essays, we observed that following our course students (1) were more aware of conservation needs and more sensitive to perspectives of various stakeholder groups concerning those needs, (2) embraced complexity and multidisciplinary thinking needed to address management challenges at the public-private land interface, and (3) showed appreciation of and became more comfortable discussing controversial issues with stakeholders and the general public. Students also became more willing to travel, work independently, and take a leading role in peer groups. By embedding students in a charged learning environment with multiple competing perspectives, our course has been able to build a more knowledgeable, empathetic and confident cohort of future employees who are better prepared to address complex issues facing agricultural and natural resource managers working at the public-private land interface.

AB  - Statistics is taught in mathematics courses in all school levels. We suggest that using rich tasks in statistics can develop statistical reasoning and create both intra and interdisciplinary links in students. In this paper, we present three case studies where middle school mathematics teachers used different tasks in lessons on pie charts. We analyzed the actions implemented/performed/attempted by teachers to support the development of statistical reasoning and the creation of intra and interdisciplinary links in their lessons. Results show that their procedural vision of statistics led them to focus more on graphical representation, neglecting aspects of statistical reasoning. Results also reveal an interdisciplinary intersection between mathematics and statistics, which may prevent the development of statistical reasoning.

AB  - Collaborative teamwork is fundamental to successful research and is a desirable skill set for employers. Yet students receive little training in how to effectively work in teams. This article presents the preliminary design and implementation of course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) in biology, geology, and environmental engineering in which student teams address questions related to their discipline while contributing to a shared research project. Team science training in communication, research planning, and conflict resolution was embedded into CURE classes at a regional R2 university. Although barriers to this approach were present, evidence in the form of writing prompt scores and team science products suggested student understanding of effective teams and the benefits of working with individuals within and across disciplines to solve complex problems increased.

AB  - Purpose: In line with business goals of customer satisfaction, higher education institutions of learning consider excellent student experience a priority. Teaching and learning are important aspects of satisfaction that are monitored annually by universities using tools such as the National Student Survey (NSS). The NSS results are useful for educational planning and informing consumer choices. This research measured undergraduate student experiences on an interdisciplinary project using the NSS framework. Hinged on diversity, the purpose was to investigate whether full-time (FT), part-time (PT) and degree apprenticeship students with varied work experience enhance their learning studying together on an interdisciplinary project. Design/methodology/approach: This research has measured, using the NSS criteria, student experiences on an interdisciplinary project on a civil engineering programme. It benchmarks the quality of learning and student understanding and perceptions of learning. The method is based upon a literature review and questionnaire survey of students. Findings: Results indicate good amounts of peer influence on learning in a simulated interdisciplinary team setting supported by a mix of diverse work experience in students' background. Originality/value: Sections of the NSS are extended with additional questions to capture the impact that FT, PT and degree apprenticeship study modes, closely associated with students' background of job experience, have on teaching and learning.

AB  - This article examines the genesis, development and implementation of an interdisciplinary university cross-school research group (three individual schools) at Federation University in Australia. This CSRG is a consequence of both local and national calls for interdisciplinarity in university research and a direct response to the revised Strategic Goals and Policy document at Federation University. Using a conceptual framework based on a treatise by Jürgen Habermas (The theory of communicative action, Beacon Press, 1987) incorporating three socio-political levels (Lifeworld, Steering Media and Systems), we examined the ideals, processes and challenges in setting up an interdisciplinary research group within a traditional disciplinary-based university environment. Drawing on multiple data sets composed of member survey responses and interviews, email communication, online meetings, policy documents and co-leader feedback, we identified key resonant themes focussing on academic aspiration and motivation, the role of policy and practice, influence of grants and grant development across schools, mentoring and publishing. Using Habermas' conceptual framework and his overarching notion of Lifeworld with qualitative methods of data analysis, this article explores establishment of the CSRG, deeper academic aspirations and engagement for interdisciplinarity informing the group's formation and effectiveness of the processes used in this specific case. The impact on systems and policy is addressed together with the processes adopted to bring about interdisciplinary university collaboration. Evaluating the formation of the CSRG, the authors found that researchers placed a high value on opportunities to creatively collaborate in a cross-school and interdisciplinary environment, whereas obtaining grants and publishing research were seen by staff as indirect and less immediate benefits of collaboration. This article contributes to the growing body of research on interdisciplinary collaboration by applying a distinct theoretical and analytical framework to emphasise the potential of grassroots collaboration and the role of power and influence on research within universities.

AB  - Providing challenging curriculum in a literacy classroom of students whose reading abilities range widely can be a challenge. Integrating interdisciplinary book selections into a self-selected reading program, however, provides students with challenge by engaging them with big ideas. This article describes methods of integrating advanced interdisciplinary pedagogy into a reading approach, called the Schoolwide Enrichment Model in Reading (SEM-R) for talented readers. In this approach, introductions to thematically connected texts during book hooks encourage readers to engage with new topics, authors, and genres. Students build fluency and comprehension through independent reading with the support of teachers who point out connections among texts and ideas. Individual conferences allow teachers to determine each student's need for support and challenge. Independent explorations allow students to delve into areas of interest and explore connections among topics through further reading, internet research, and writing projects. Investigating interdisciplinary ideas and complex themes can incorporate challenge for all readers but can be especially engaging and enriching for academically talented students who are also advanced readers.

AB  - Environmental education aims to change the perception of people about the environment. Primary education (four to eleven years old) is a fundamental stage in the development of children's conduct, so enhancing learning of the environment in which they live is essential for them to start recognizing nature as part of their life. We tested students' perception before (pre-test) and after (post-test) a specific environmental education activity elaborated in a ludic and interdisciplinary way (psychological, biological, performing arts and educational perspectives), with more moments of practice than only theoretical or rhetorical. Our study showed that schools located in cities with low Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI) can present satisfactory results in relation to students' environmental perception (hypothesis 1), that this perception does not differ according to nationwide educational indexes such as the Brazilian Basic Education Development Index (IDEB) (2), and that regardless of MHDI, there is an increase in this perception after environmental education activities, even a single activity (3). The developed methodology was effective in changing students' environmental perception, and can be used in an interdisciplinary way, even when resources are scarce.

AB  - Growing interest in interdisciplinary (ID) understanding has led to the recent development of four ID assessments, none of which have previously been comprehensively validated. Sources of evidence for the validity of tests include construct validity, such as the internal structure of the test. ID tests may (and should) test both disciplinary (D) and ID understanding, and the internal structure can be examined to determine whether the theoretical relationship among D and ID knowledge is supported by empirical evidence. In this paper, we present an analysis of internal structure of ISACC, an ID assessment of carbon cycling, selected because the developers included both disciplinary and ID items and posited a relationship among these two types of knowledge. Responses from 454 high school and college students were analyzed using confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) with the Mplus software for internal structure focusing on dimensionality, as well as functioning by gender and race/ethnicity, and reliability. CFA confirmed that the underlying structure of the ISACC best matches a two-factor path model, supporting the developers' theoretical hypothesis of the impact of disciplinary understanding on interdisciplinary understanding. No gender effect was found in the factor structure of the ISACC, indicating that females and males have similar performance. Race/ethnicity performance was similar to other science assessments, revealing possible ethnicity bias on the part of the instrument. The reliability coefficients for the two-factor path model were found to be sufficient. This study highlights the importance of the internal structure of test instruments as a source of validity evidence and models a procedure to assess internal structure.

AB  - The importance of developing students' argumentation skills is well established across the curriculum: students should grasp how claims are made and supported in different disciplines. One challenge is to follow and thereby agree with or critique the arguments of others, which requires perspective-taking, in tracing these other reasons and reasoning. This challenge is increased when disciplines construct argumentation and perspective-taking differently. Here, we consider the role of perspective-taking in argumentation within and between science education and pluralistic religious education, where the former aims at the justification of scientific claims and the latter at both an empathetic understanding of different religions and worldviews, and personal reasoning. We interpretively analyze student data to identify salient features of students' strategies to perspective-taking within argumentation. Data from 324 pupils across nine schools are explored in relation to students' challenges in perspective-taking, strategies for perspective-taking within argumentation, and the use of perspective-taking to construct personal argumentation. The analysis shows some barriers to perspective-taking within argumentation, the range of students' perspective-taking strategies within argumentation, and how personal argumentation could hermeneutically build upon perspective-taking strategies. The importance and implications of perspective-taking within argumentation across the curriculum are considered highlighting challenges in the etic/emic shift, both within the individual subject as well as across them, and some reflections on how this provides a fresh pedagogical perspective on the science/religions debate are made. To end, we conclude with the wider challenges for disciplines and perspective-taking across schooling and university.

AB  - The 360 Degree Global Education Model (360 Global Ed Model) provides a comprehensive framework for creating meaningful interdisciplinary student team learning through international service learning. Providing successful multi-disciplined undergraduate education necessitates creating a foundation for productive team-science based learning between disciplines. The pedagogical foundation employed by Breitkreuz and Songer within the 360 Global Ed model creates a shared values student dialogue for enhancing undergraduate team learning and performance. This paper provides a summary of the 360 Global Ed Model, a discussion of methods used to create a student shared dialogue ("Team Learning Foundation"), lessons learned, and student outcomes. Methods for shared dialogues include creating a team-defined mission, team-defined behavioral standards, building shared cultural understandings and expectations for developing cultural intelligence, and developing realistic expectations for interpersonal understandings through use of self-assessments. Student team-led projects provide an authentic context impetus for implementing the team learning foundation. [For the full proceedings, see ED631133.]

AB  - The research is devoted to the problem of mastering pre-service EFL teachers' specific proficiency in using questions as an effective tool in the EL classroom discourse and university discourse. The purpose of the paper is to submit the teaching scheme of training pre-service EFL teachers' questioning skills, encouraging them to work out their own teaching strategies in the future professional activity. The authors substantiate the possibility of improving MA students and pre-service EFL teachers', questioning skills via suggested teaching scheme actualising interdisciplinary connections between the practical course ("English Communication in Academic Discourse") and theoretical-practical course ("Theory and Practice of Speech Communication") and students' teaching practice that are majors of the Master's degree curriculum. The emphasis is laid on the content level -- EL classroom discourse acquisition. The experiment was conducted involving 90 MA students, pre-service EFL teachers, of South-Ukrainian National Pedagogical University named after K. D. Ushynsky to clarify the efficiency of the suggested teaching scheme. Data were obtained and analysed via pre-experimental assessment stage, experimental teaching (implementation of the suggested teaching scheme), post-experimental assessment stage employing quantitative and qualitative research methods. Data collection procedures included pedagogical observation, analysis of the students' results, self-assessment questionnaire, student's opinion questionnaire, statistical and mathematical processing of obtained data. The findings of the research indicate that the suggested teaching scheme using interdisciplinary approach helps students become more proactive in constructing their knowledge of questions linguodidactic potential, to transform the acquired knowledge to new ways of verbal behaviour, to model successful communication in the EL classroom through appropriate questions, and to modify their teaching styles. The authors come to the conclusion that it is mandatory to include special consecutive training covering initially purely practical courses with a gradual shift to theoretical-practical ones, and finally -- teaching practices as a closing step to improve students' proficiency in using questions effectively in the EL classroom school and university discourse.

AB  - Children can see the Moon with the naked eye and often are curious about the Moon and other objects in the sky, like the Sun and the stars. However, there is sometimes disagreement in early childhood about whether studying space is appropriate for young children. This activities described in this article engaged children who had different learning preferences. Some children adored a creative make-your-own constellation, while others were drawn to a crater science investigation. In this article, the authors introduce a space science study--starting with how children's interests were at the core--outlining interdisciplinary links and including a detailed description of the making Moon craters activity. This study of space took place in a prekindergarten classroom with children ranging from 3 to 5 years of age, but could easily be adapted for older children. The lessons were part of a thematic unit on outer space that developed after the class had learned about weather.

AB  - This paper aims to provide insight and guidance for developing and leading interdisciplinary collaborative writing groups when working with researchers in Centre-Periphery contexts. The participants in this study were exiled Syrian academics domiciled in Turkey working in interdisciplinary project groups with their UK-Turkey-based academic mentors and UK-based workshop leaders. The groups were at the writing for publication stage of the project. In exploring the processes involved in writing in such groups, the study identified a key dimension to successful collaborative writing -- that of relational expertise. The study found that authorial identity played a significant role in the process of writing and that relational expertise was evidenced through confidence in knowledge, positive attitudes to others' knowledge and willingness to negotiate. We argue that explicit articulation of authorial identity and power differences are necessary first steps in establishing interdisciplinary collaborative writing groups in Centre-Periphery contexts.

AB  - While biomedical and life science research have embraced interdisciplinarity as the means to solving pressing 21st century complex challenges, interdisciplinarity in undergraduate education has been more difficult to implement. As a consequence, disciplinary rather than interdisciplinary capstones have become ubiquitous. Disciplinary capstones are valuable for students because they enable them to integrate knowledge and skills within the discipline, but they are also limiting because the integration is within rather than across disciplines. In contrast to a capstone, which involves a single discipline, interdisciplinary capstones require two or more disciplines to combine and integrate across disciplinary boundaries. Interdisciplinarity, where two of more disciplines come together, is difficult to implement in the biomedical and life science curricula because student majors and finances are administered in ways, which reinforce institutional organization of schools and faculties and prevent collaboration. Here in this "idea to explore" we provide an interdisciplinary capstone model where students enroll in disciplinary courses, but then these disciplinary courses and students collaborate on interdisciplinary real-world problems. This interdisciplinary capstone model was implemented across two diverse and large biomedical and life science schools within two faculties in a research intensive, metropolitan university. This approach allows for integration of the biomedical, social and ethical perspectives required when solving problems in the real world, such as COVID-19. Interdisciplinary learning also better prepares students for higher degree research and future careers. Overcoming disciplinary curriculum silos and faculty barriers is critical if we are to meet expectations of acquiring interdisciplinarity as a key competency.

The project Stoa Malakopi allowed design and social science students from two universities in the US and Greece to collaborate in a necessity-driven field of inquiry through engagement with local knowledge. Evaluation showed that students embraced polyphony, reflexivity and situational problem solving as conditions for meaningful university-community partnerships.

AB  - Universities admit increasingly diverse student cohorts with varying academic entry standards. To address students' varying academic prerequisites, academic support services -- such as literacy and numeracy support -- are offered to ensure student success. However, students often do not engage. Aimed at mapping variables related to a student's decision to seek academic help in order to identify gaps, this systematic scoping review informs future research and supports the provision of academic support services for diverse student cohorts. As recent research does not provide sufficient evidence, the areas of psychological, physiological and help-seeking in career counselling were included. Informed by the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), database and reference list searches were conducted for age, gender, nationality and cultural background, acculturation, stigma, socioeconomic status, educational background, help-seeking experience, perceived behavioural control, attitudes, locus of control, personality and subjective norms, and 168 primary research studies were included in the review. Studies were selected based on their publication year, and the context and the variables examined. Information from the studies was systematically entered into a database and organised. Findings show that gender, stigma, help-seeking experience, attitudes and subjective norms are crucial for help-seeking in general. More specifically, gender, age, cultural background and personality seem to be related to academic help-seeking and should therefore be considered when evaluating or designing academic support services. Although other variables were examined in some studies, no trends could be identified for these due to ambivalent results, indicating that the variables related to academic help-seeking may depend on the context. This review also revealed that there are gaps that should be addressed in future research concerning academic help-seeking behaviour, while at the same time, if possible, including all variables identified in this review.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate how patterns of collaboration and scholarly independence are related to early stage researchers' development in two multidisciplinary learning environments at a Swedish university. Based on interviews with leaders, supervisors, doctoral students, and post docs, results show how early stage researchers' development is conditioned by their relative positions in time (career stage) and space (geographical and epistemic position). Through the theoretical notions of 'epistemic living space' and 'developmental networks', four ways of experiencing the multidisciplinary learning environment were distinguished. Overall, the environments provided a "world of opportunities," where the epistemic living space entailed many possibilities for cross-disciplinary collaboration and development of scholarly independence among peers. However, depending on the members' relative positions in time and space, this world became "an alien world" for the post docs who had been forced to become "over-independent" and find collaborators elsewhere. Moreover, it became "an avoided world" for absent mono-disciplinary supervisors and students who embodied "non-collective independence", away from the environments' community. By contrast, "a joint world" emerged for doctoral students located in the environment, which promoted their "independent positioning" and collaborative ambitions. Thus, early stage researchers' collaboration and development of scholarly independence were optimised in a "converged learning space," where the temporal and spatial conditions were integrated and equally conducive for learning. Based on these results, the authors provide suggestions for how to improve the integration of scholars who tend to develop away from the community because of their temporal and spatial positions.

AB  - Entrenched compartmentalisation of subjects in secondary school means that students lack opportunities for learning how disciplines relate to each other and how knowledge can be applied in real-world contexts. This article examines what it means to 'think like a scientist in a multidisciplinary arena' and why this is (and should be) an integral part of secondary school science education. To this end, the article outlines a workshop, 'Renoir's painting', for key stages 3 and 4 (ages 11-16), which aims to develop students' understanding of the power and limitations of science and how science relates to other disciplines.

AB  - This paper presents a robot prototype for an undergraduate laboratory program designed to fulfill the criteria laid out by ABET. The main objective of the program is for students to learn some basic concepts of embedded systems and robotics, and apply them in practice. For that purpose, various practical laboratory exercises were prepared to teach different aspects of communications, control, mechatronics, and microcontrollers. The practicals are organized such that the students can systematically solve real-world problems. The most important feature of the presented program is that, it incorporates interdisciplinary knowledge, and inculcates technical and professional skills required in pursuing a successful career. Furthermore, students and instructors can modify the software and hardware units of the robot prototype as necessary, to explore more ideas and to apply the robot in other mechatronics-related courses. A digital electronics course taught at the Automation Department at Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro, Querétaro, Mexico, is presented as a case study in which the evaluation process was based on ABET criteria and the corresponding student outcomes. A student survey elicited students' observations of, and interest in, the learning process. The positive student feedback and student academic outcomes indicate that the inclusion of prototype had a significant impact on student academic outcomes.

AB  - This article analyses the use of peer evaluation as a tool for evaluating teamwork and students' perceptions of this type of evaluation. A study was conducted of six subjects included on five degree courses at the University of Girona. In all of these subjects, students carried out a team activity, evaluated the performance of the team and the involvement of its different members, and responded to a survey on their perceptions of this evaluation system. We found the main factors influencing the evaluation and perception of teamwork to be teachers' and students' prior experience in this type of evaluation activity, the field where it is applied, the academic year students are enrolled on and the weight of the activity in the final mark. The results show that, in general, students' views regarding such evaluation procedures are positive.

AB  - This article reviews the potential of kite-mapping as part of an interdisciplinary and multinational field course. It situates kite-mapping as a low cost, high quality, participatory approach, in relation to field use of maps, arguing that research might usefully attend to more than simply the skills acquired during the field exercise and the technicalities of the innovation. Evidenced from two day-long workshops on the Maltese island of Gozo we describe practical issues involved in making the mapping work. We draw on descriptions of field practice and deploy a multi-method evaluation of staff and student reactions and experiences to explore pedagogic aspects of kite-mapping. We conclude that the practices of kite-mapping significantly impact upon the value of the mapping technique, and highlight how creative and playful mapping processes implicit in the technique might usefully be deployed in other field contexts.

AB  - How do we navigate fear of catastrophic change while also fostering a sense of well-being in our everyday? This question provides the lived context for the story this article tells about teaching a course on imagining well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Taking an integrative interdisciplinary approach that employs methods of literary analysis in conversation with phenomenological philosophy gives students insights into the necessary relationship between well-being and catastrophe that modernist discourses bypass. This approach thus underscores the limitations in disciplinary attempts to find objective measures to quantify well-being and, implicitly, to prescribe (physiological, psychological, political, or economic) methods for attaining it. Further, attending to the lived experiences of students as they encounter this integrative approach can give us insights into valuable resources that are not just material but existential. In the face of direct and immediate threats to our physical, psychological, and emotional well-being, diving into a shared exploration of loss, fear, and displacement invites students and faculty to show up increasingly in our full humanness, replete with contradiction, confusion, and ambiguity. This stance of not-knowing, as opposed to claiming to know and hence prescribing, may lend itself to new cognitive, emotional, and imaginative avenues for self-realization and connection, which are means to the experience of well-being.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to explore an interdisciplinary pedagogical approach for advancing knowledge and understanding of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) at higher education institutions (HEIs). Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study conducted an explorative experiment to elaborate on forms to advance a pedagogical approach that embeds sustainability. The design of the pedagogical project was explorative and interdisciplinary, using a predefined framework on key competencies for sustainability. Findings: The findings showed that an interdisciplinary approach can create a learning setting that stimulates students' problem-solving competencies for sustainability-related issues. Students were trained in the five key sustainable competencies addressed by Wiek et al. (2011). Moreover, although it is not always possible to arrange an interdisciplinary pedagogical setting, this might be a key condition for the development of students' key competencies regarding their understanding of the SDGs. Addressing the SDGs from an interdisciplinary perspective paved the way for the development of students' strategic competencies, including systems thinking and anticipatory competencies. Practical implications: The pedagogical project, as an interdisciplinary explorative experiment, was shown to be a potentially suitable method to counteract "cherry-picking" approaches to teaching the SDGs at HEI. Originality/value: The pedagogical approach advanced in this paper, extends active learning and interdisciplinarity in higher education. The authors argue that this approach encourages students to take ownership of and responsibility for their learning process and indicates a changed mindset and behavior.

AB  - In our interconnected world, what does it mean to teach global environmental issues to young children? Using theoretical foundations from the social justice learning community and child-directed, inquiry-based learning best practices, this practitioner reflection details a seven-week, student-centered, interdisciplinary learning experience conducted in the author's classroom. This exploration of the Amazon rainforest and deforestation promoted content knowledge development across fine arts, math, earth science, English language arts, and social studies disciplines; standards-based skills acquisition; collaboration; self-determination; and critical engagement among students in a diverse kindergarten class at a public school in Los Angeles County, California, in the United States. To guide the development of the project, an appropriate social studies framework was utilized along with the popular culture resource "3 Questions That Can Change The World" from the Kid President enterprise. Students conducted research and took concrete action through a variety of projects, including raising and donating funds for injured wildlife and reporting on their experiences verbally, in writing, and graphically. I analyzed my field notes, reflective teacher journal, and student work samples to improve my practice and pedagogical progress in teaching young students about global environmental issues. In this process of critical reflection and action inspired by Freire's (1993) concept of praxis, I found that inquiry-based learning that encourages students to ask meaningful questions, investigate answers through interdisciplinary learning, and find meaningful solutions to the problems they encounter increases their self-determination.

AB  - Science educators have highlighted the need to develop students to integrate knowledge across science disciplines to address real-world issues. However, there has been little research about the development of interdisciplinary assessment instruments. In this research, the instrument that measures the level of upper-secondary school students' interdisciplinary understanding of environmental issues was developed and validated based upon Wilson's Construct Modeling framework. After a pilot testing, the revised assessment instrument of interdisciplinary understanding covering five typical environmental problems comprised 14 multiple-choice questions and four constructed-response questions. Five hundred twenty-three eleventh graders, including 279 boys and 244 girls from mainland China, made up the research sample. The partial credit Rasch analysis has verified the reliability and validity of the interdisciplinary understanding instrument. In addition, the results of cluster analysis revealed that over half of the students could use some partially accurate scientific concepts and principles from two or more disciplinary perspectives to deal with a specific environmental issue. The validated instrument can provide insights for assessing and developing upper-secondary school students' interdisciplinary understanding in science education.

AB  - Students often struggle to make interdisciplinary connections and cite a lack of opportunity to make such connections. To address this issue, we are developing activities aligned with the framework of three-dimensional learning that provide students with opportunities to make connections between chemistry concepts and biological phenomena. Here, we focus on an activity that asks students to incorporate the concept of entropy in explaining the biological phenomenon of osmosis across a cell membrane. This activity was administered in both introductory cell and molecular biology and second-semester general chemistry courses. We found that after completing carefully scaffolded questions within the activity, students were better able to correctly use the concept of entropy in explaining osmosis than they were before the scaffolding questions. Additionally, we found that students' course history appeared to impact their explanations of this phenomenon in that students who had taken second-semester general chemistry (i.e., the semester in which entropy is discussed for these students) provided more sophisticated responses and were less likely to include scientifically inaccurate ideas than their peers who had not taken second-semester general chemistry.

AB  - In this article, we present the first results of the project OPEN-MATH. The research project aims at acknowledging the need for learning environments with differentiation strategies for all. We developed a model for inclusive mathematics learning, based on the Theory of Objectification and a broad idea of differentiation realized through Open Learning. It poses an interdisciplinary research issue that requires the collaboration of two sub-disciplines pertaining to the area of educational studies: Inclusive Education and Mathematics Education. The results we present here are related to the dialogue between theory and practice, whose outcome is a teaching and learning model for inclusion in mathematics. The construction of the teaching and learning model moves along two complementary paths: (1) concerning the theoretical point of view, we implemented connecting theory strategies to network Open Education and the Theory of Objectification; and (2) concerning the methodological point of view, we implemented Educational Design Research. The new teaching-learning model is the result of theoretical and methodological validation in real contexts according to an interdisciplinary approach. This study shows the strengths of interdisciplinary research for the pursuit of inclusive mathematics and high standards of learning.

AB  - Educative curricula support teacher learning as well as the learning of students. High quality educative curricula contain features that help teachers customize learning opportunities and environments in ways that meet the needs of their learners. Designing these features requires expertise related to subject matter content, pedagogy, teacher and student learning, and instructional design. In other words, it requires interdisciplinary team work -- which is notoriously challenging. To understand and support collaborative interdisciplinary design processes, a retrospective case study was conducted on interdisciplinary design team work that yielded a high quality educative curriculum for inquiry-based science learning. Design documents and transcripts of interviews with six designers (a cognitive psychologist, a practising physicist, and four science educators) were analyzed to identify their contributions during the phases of analysis, development, and evaluation to create educative features for developing pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). Findings articulate specific educative features that can contribute to supporting PCK and thereby supporting instructional performance. Findings also reveal the proactive and reactive nature of designer contributions, describing different ways in which designers provide specialized inputs from a disciplinary perspective. Further, this study shows how designer contributions intermeshed, with contributions from one discipline shaping the work of colleagues, and thereby coordinating varied inputs to yield coherent educative materials. In addition, theoretical insights and recommendations for research on the nature of collaborative interdisciplinary design processes and implications for practice are given for supporting designers working in interdisciplinary teams to create educative curriculum materials for teacher (and student) learning.

AB  - The global carbon cycle (CC) is a key environmental literacy issue related to climate change, ocean acidification, and energy sustainability. Understanding the CC requires interdisciplinary knowledge informed by multiple science disciplines such as biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. To examine the core principles and interdisciplinary nature of CC, we interviewed 10 experts from various science disciplines and asked them to create their own models of the carbon cycle. We utilized the data to identify emerging core concepts of CC and discover commonalities and differences across the experts' models in the context of interdisciplinary understanding. The concepts and interdisciplinarity were compared with those of CC-related topics in the U.S. Framework and Next Generation Science Standards. Most experts demonstrated a breadth of interdisciplinary knowledge based on their disciplinary backgrounds. The experts hold a wider set of ideas about CC than is present in the standards. Many topics not included in the standards could feasibly be added (e.g., the process of carbon sequestration into the ocean and rocks and CO2 emissions by volcanic activity). This study generates concrete recommendations for science standards to guide the revision of existing curricula or to guide the development of new interdisciplinary approaches to teaching global CC.

AB  - In this empirical study, the one-day project Robot Love Design-a-thon was designed for an interdisciplinary group of preservice teachers (in arts, sciences, and primary education), and evaluated through observations and learner reports. An analysis of the observations and the learner reports showed that having to go through a complete design process in a single day worked well: it facilitated the exchange of ideas and critical discussions between students concerning the project's socially engaged theme 'Tenderness and Technology'. In addition, interdisciplinary collaboration emerged as an important learning outcome. All students found working in mixed teams a relevant and educational experience as they could profit from each other's expertise.

AB  - Universities invest in teaching academies to reward outstanding teachers. Few studies have been published about the impact of teaching academies on teaching communities. The aim of this study was to see who excellent academic teachers spoke to when they discussed teaching and learning, and what kind of community a Teachers' Academy established in 2013 offered to its Fellows. We analysed the answers to two open-ended questions from two surveys. The first survey (2013) was addressed to first-round applicants to the Academy in 2013 (N = 46, 32%) and the second (2018) to its Fellows (N = 56, 65%). In both surveys, most teachers had meaningful discussions with their close colleagues. In the second survey, the conversations with pedagogical experts merged with the discussions at the Academy. The 2018 survey also examined how well the Academy's key objectives of providing teachers with an interdisciplinary community and peer support had been achieved in five years. The Academy had become an important community for teachers, in which teachers shared mutual appreciation for teaching and collaborated across disciplinary boundaries and campuses. A challenge for a teaching academy is to support its fellows in implementing the principles of scholarship of teaching and learning, that is, carrying out scholarly educational projects and sharing the results locally, nationally and internationally.

AB  - Science educators are placing increasing emphasis on the development of students' interdisciplinary competence. This study examined the degree to which disciplinary, cognitive and affective factors could explain students' (N = 385) individual differences in interdisciplinary competence. Multiple linear regression indicated that students' disciplinary knowledge (DK), attitudes toward interdisciplinary approach and interdisciplinary learning opportunities were significant when added to the prediction model. Notably, the results of a semistructured interview and think-aloud session suggested that students' engineering design knowledge was not robust in their responses. Students' feelings toward interdisciplinary learning affected how they mobilized DK to create comprehensive insight into all aspects relevant to the possible solution. Additionally, students' feelings about the interdisciplinary approach influenced their exposure to interdisciplinary issues outside school and engagement in interdisciplinary learning tasks at school, which affected their integration of scientific ideas across disciplines. The results of this study can inform both the movement toward incorporating an interdisciplinary approach into pedagogy and educators and instructors about the factors and possible mechanisms that may shape students' interdisciplinary competence.

AB  - An analysis of the state of pedagogical practice and scientific and methodological literature speaks of shortcomings in solving the problem of the formation of elementary schoolchildren's speech skills. This article is devoted to the formation of elementary schoolchildren's speech skills in interdisciplinary communication. The purpose of our experimental work is to verify the effectiveness of our methodology for the sustainable of speech skills in interdisciplinary communication. In preparation for the experimental work, the following objectives were set; to identify the level of formation of speech skills (motivational, informative, reflective), development of a complex of diagnostic methods: observation, questionnaires, diagnostic methods, assessment, self-esteem, etc., on the basis of the data obtained to determine the level of formation of speech skills in interdisciplinary ICT communication. Therefore, the aim of our study is to analyze the state of formation of elementary schoolchildren's speech skills in interdisciplinary communication. The theoretical significance of the study allows clarifying knowledge on the issue of the formation of speech skills; practical significance lies in the presentation and testing of a set of productive exercises aimed at developing learners' speech skills in interdisciplinary communication. According to the developed diagnostic technique, the formation of speech skills in interdisciplinary communication consists of three components: motivational, substantive and reflective. Based on these components, indicators and levels characterizing the formation of elementary schoolchildren's speech skills in interdisciplinary communication are distinguished. During the study, the results of a verifying, forming and control experiment were presented. According to the study, we can say that it is necessary to pay attention to the development of meaningful speech, because it is for this indicator that most children are at a low level of formation. On the whole, our study proved that systematic work is needed to form elementary schoolchildren's speech skills.

AB  - Pedagogical knowledge has been identified as an essential factor for impacting the learning, behavioral, and social emotional outcomes for children with disabilities, particularly students with emotional disturbances (ED). There are many professionals in and out of the school environment who work with children with ED. Oftentimes, these professionals are required to have specialized knowledge and skills. Unfortunately, they acquire these skills and knowledge separate from each other. Therefore, this 5-year interdisciplinary project funded by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs (USDOE, OSEP) was designed to enhance the skills and knowledge of special education teachers and social workers regarding students with ED. The purpose of this study was to explore participants' perceptions of interdisciplinary teacher preparation. The study adopted a basic qualitative (i.e., content analysis) design. Each question was analyzed to capture the emerging categories. The results for each question are discussed in detail. Some recommendations for teacher educators and practitioners are provided.

AB  - We reflect on the use of photovoice methods in a hybrid classroom environment for an interdisciplinary course titled Climate and Society at the University of Miami. The activities, based on our team's hyperlocal method of community-based climate adaptation engagement, create opportunities to engage with the complexities of climate science and policy solutions in unique and powerful ways. Our principal contribution is a series of exercises that can be done by educators anywhere in the world, providing a foundation for reflection and rich conversations. We conclude with recommendations and tools to aid educators in recreating the exercise in many settings.

AB  - Engaging with interdisciplinary learning during higher education (HE) study can provide students with skills and modes of thinking informed by multiple worldviews. Opportunities for interdisciplinary learning in the English HE system are limited; associated primarily with postgraduate study or later undergraduate stages. This paper reports on an enhancement project that sought to engage first-year students with interdisciplinary learning. Drawing on data gathered from staff interviews, student focus groups and module enrolments, we examine drivers and barriers impacting on the planned curriculum transformation. Whilst drivers emerged from many directions (e.g. professional bodies, staff advocates), these were overwhelmed by the barriers - both administrative and ideological. Student responses were mixed. Some would have liked a wider choice of truly interdisciplinary modules, but it was clear many students did not understand the rationale for the modules and felt that they needed more support to participate.

AB  - This article reports on the design of interdisciplinary units in five International Baccalaureate schools in Norway and Denmark, each with fewer than 100 students in their Middle Years Programme. The mixed methods study describes subject combinations and time frames of 37 enacted units and 111 hypothetical interdisciplinary units, and the qualitative perspectives of nine teachers, representative of the curriculum frameworks' eight subject groups, on the contribution of these school-based units to student learning. In the special context of schools with logistically simple staffing structures, interdisciplinary units were consistently conceived and enacted as substantial units, typically implemented over 8 weeks. Subjects were usually paired using a common Key Concept and differentiated by Related Concepts. Although framing and classification were considerations in interdisciplinary planning, the quantitative data found nearly every pairing of the subject groups was feasible. Interdisciplinary units were consistently valued by teachers for helping students connect disciplinary knowledge and developing metacognitive skills that supported their future learning, and for enriching teachers' own pedagogical practice. As a pragmatic, sustainable approach that resolves the tensions posed by assessment of disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives, the strategies reported in this study suggest a 'middle way' for countering the disciplinary fragmentation associated with junior secondary education.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing focus on innovation research, particularly in the manufacturing and information technology sectors in the US and Europe. However, the disruptions caused by the recent pandemic called for more innovations, especially in the education industry. Innovation is viewed as an outcome of a set of various drivers. This study explored faculty perspectives on the drivers of innovation that can transform the curriculum into an interdisciplinary model to promote sustainability in education. Additionally, it examined the relationship between these drivers and the outcome of innovation, particularly at the process level. An explanatory sequential mixed-method approach was employed to collect quantitative and qualitative data from a purposeful sample of 60 faculty members at one federal higher education institution in the United Arab Emirates. Findings indicated that while there is a correlation between the drivers and process of innovation and sustainability in education, other factors played a more significant role in facilitating this transformation. Empowering faculty members and involving them in the process of transformation, connecting them with the institutional vision and mission for innovation, fostering a clear understanding of the value of the transformation, providing faculty with continuous professional learning and development opportunities to promote the use of innovative pedagogical methods, are among the key factors.

AB  - To assist preservice elementary teachers in attaining scientific competence, knowledge, and understanding of interdisciplinary concepts, a teacher education model--the combined individual microteaching, modeled teaching, and inquiry-based team-teaching (CIMIT) model--was established, and its effectiveness was evaluated. A quasiexperimental design was adopted, and 57 preservice elementary teachers from 2 classes of a science education preparatory course were included in the analysis (30 in the experimental group and 27 in the control group). The 18-week course comprised 36 h of classes. Before and after the course, all participants completed pretests and posttests, respectively, that measured basic scientific competency and subject matter knowledge. Quantitative and qualitative data were also collected and analyzed. The instruction of the CIMIT group comprised 3 stages: individual microteaching, modeled demonstration inquiry--based teaching by an expert teacher, and inquiry-based team teaching. For the control group, the inquiry-based team-teaching stage was omitted. The results validated the effectiveness of the CIMIT model. First, the experimental group exhibited a significantly greater improvement in scientific competency and knowledge than did the control group. Second, after training, the experimental group's knowledge of interdisciplinary concepts increased for all seven interdisciplinary concepts.

AB  - Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is a growing interdisciplinary field addressing exposures to microbial pathogens and infectious disease processes. Risk science is inherently interdisciplinary, but few of the contributing disciplinary programs offer courses and training specifically in QMRA. To develop multidisciplinary training in QMRA, an annual 10-day long intensive workshop was conducted from 2015 to 2019--the Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment Interdisciplinary Instructional Institute (QMRA III). National leaders in the fields of public health, engineering, microbiology, epidemiology, communications, public policy, and QMRA served as instructors and mentors over the course of the program. To provide cross-training, multidisciplinary teams of 5-6 trainees were created from the approximately 30 trainees each year. A formal assessment of the program was performed based on observations and surveys containing Likert-type scales and open-ended prompts. In addition, a longitudinal alumni survey was also disseminated to facilitate the future redevelopment of QMRA institutes and determine the impact of the program. Across all years, trainees experienced statistically significant increases (P < 0.05) in their perceptions of their QMRA abilities (e.g., use of specific computer programs) and knowledge of QMRA constructs (e.g., risk management). In addition, 12 publications, three conference presentations, and two research grants were derived from the QMRA III institute projects or tangential research. The success of QMRA III indicates that a short course format can effectively address many multidisciplinary training needs. Key features of QMRA III, including the inter-disciplinary training approach, hands-on exercises, real-world institute projects, and interaction through a mentoring process, were vital for training multidisciplinary teams housing multiple forms of expertise. Future QMRA institutes are being redeveloped to leverage hybrid learning formats that can further the multidisciplinary training and mentoring objectives.

AB  - Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) provide opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in authentic research and generally increase the participation rate of students in research. Students' participation in research has a positive impact on their science identity and self-efficacy, both of which can predict integration of students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), especially for underrepresented students. The main goal of this study was to investigate instructor-initiated CUREs implemented as upper-level elective courses in the Biomedical Sciences major. We hypothesized that these CUREs would (i) have a positive impact on students' scientific identity and self-efficacy and (ii) result in gains in students' self-assessed skills in laboratory science, research, and science communication. We used Likert-type surveys developed by Estrada et al. (14) under the Tripartite Integration Model of Social Influence to measure scientific identity, self-efficacy, and scientific value orientation. When data from all CUREs were combined, our results indicate that students' self-efficacy and science identity significantly increased after completion. Students' self-assessment of research and lab-related skills was significantly higher after completion of the CUREs. We also observed that prior to participation in the CUREs, students' self-assessment of molecular and bioinformatic skills was low, when compared with microbiological skills. This may indicate strengths and gaps in our curriculum that could be explored further.

AB  - The article focuses the use and reflection of explanatory videos in pedagogical contexts from an interdisciplinary perspective and with regard to teacher reflection and production processes in a joint primary school pedagogical study (with a focus on mathematical learning processes) and Catholic religion education study (with a focus on secondary school teacher education). With an explorative research question and an interpretative qualitative research design, teachers' reflections of explanatory videos produced by learners as well as teachers are analyzed abductively to gain in-depth insights into potentials and obstacles of the usage of explanatory videos in the context of learning processes. In the primary school pedagogical study, students produce multilingual explanatory videos (n = 18) of the 'Auxiliary task', a mental calculation strategy, which the multilingual teachers reflect (n = 6), and in the Catholic religion education study, teachers produce explanatory videos for making 'encountering' processes possible (n = 17) and both studies are linked with a joint research question. The main insights into potentials and obstacles are that explanatory videos can be used didactically for a) identifying student's subject-and-language-related needs, b) 'decelerated' valuation processes and c) iterative revisions of non-viable video productions as well as biases and beliefs of teachers.

AB  - We have come to conceptualize our transdisciplinary, transnational, and transcultural interaction and reciprocal learning through self-study research as "polyvocal professional learning." Our conceptualization of polyvocality has made visible how dialogic encounters with diverse ways of seeing, knowing, and doing can deepen and extend professional learning in self-study research. For this collaborative self-study, we created a poetic bricolage composed of frequently used words in three of our published research poems as we asked, "'Why?' Why does our work together exist? And why should anyone care?" What emerged became an organic abstract of the impetus for our collaborative learning over time. Through inventing a poetic bricolage, we were able to make visible and available how our multiple interests, practices, and methods have come together to support fluid, dialogic co-learning, and re-learning. Discovering the "why" of our work included unearthing our gravitation toward transdisciplinary scholarship, which offers university faculty a wide range of possibilities for co-learning and co-creativity. Our demonstration of methodological inventiveness in action through poetic bricolage will be useful to others interested in exploring the promise and tensions of plurality, interaction and interdependence, and creative activity in self-study methodology.

AB  - The paper emphasizes the crucial importance of transdisciplinary approach to qualitative research methodology in teaching and learning contexts involving highly stigmatized minority languages. Autoethnography and participatory action research are herein employed as constructive, critical, qualitative methodological procedures relevant to transdisciplinary research on minority languages in applied linguistics. An international project on teaching and learning Romani, QUALIROM, is used as a case study in order to emphasize the fact that mere theoretical knowledge and professional expertise are important but not sufficient for successful implementation and sustainability of outcomes in this field of linguistic research. The analysis suggests that socially engaged minority language learning and teaching projects should be understood as transdisciplinary, collaborative activities that transcend academic boundaries, and in which research participants create a number of interactive contexts within project-oriented communities of practice aimed at reshaping dominant social relations and practices.

AB  - Neoliberal ideology has transformed higher education timescapes in profound ways. However, research has given limited consideration to how pedagogical practices can create a space for students to reshape these timescapes. By drawing upon empirical material, I will first explore how students reflect upon timescapes in an interdisciplinary course. From the student accounts, it appears that it is possible to create spaces that enable students and teachers to express, explore, and negotiate their perspectives and co-create the timescape of courses. In addition, I will explore how an emphasis on dialog, relations, and reflections is perceived by the students and discuss how these pedagogical approaches provide opportunities for the co-creation of timescapes. Finally, I will highlight emerging possibilities to frame a counter narrative to neoliberalism in higher education that accentuates principles and values of authenticity, reciprocity, being more, hope, and collective responsibility.

AB  - This research intends to provide understanding of the impact that a module consisting entirely of collaborative interdisciplinary science tasks had on students' group work behaviour, attitude and motivation. It was hypothesised that implementing a module based entirely of group tasks would develop positive attitudes and increase student accountability. Previous research indicates that large introductory modules in higher education fail to nurture student motivation to engage with course work. In this study 303 students completed surveys and focus groups that examined the level and nature of group work, student feelings towards group work, and student motivation to complete tasks and attend timetabled class sessions. The findings suggest that in order to complete the science tasks, students typically completed sections individually and consolidated their individual parts to form a complete solution. Collaboration occurred when students completed numerical aspects of the task as students felt these sections demanded group members to share ideas. Collaborative work can promote positive student attitudes, increase students efforts to work on tasks and attend timetabled class sessions. These findings imply that collaborative work may act as a means of promoting attendance and facilitating student engagement in module activities throughout the semester. This study highlights the need for educators to assess learning outcomes achieved in higher education and to distinguish between tasks that promote working collaboratively and collaborative learning.

AB  - To understand and deal with real urban development problems, urban planners, designers, and managers need to combine and synthesize a variety of academic and professional knowledge. As our urban challenges grow more complex, learning how to do this effectively becomes ever more important. For educators, this means teaching students how to work in interdisciplinary settings, i.e. how to jointly discover the different disciplinary dimensions of an urban problem, and how to reflectively design courses of action. In this paper, we explore and evaluate the components of such interdisciplinary experiential learning, develop a framework to design and analyse this type of courses, and use it to position and evaluate a specific urban development management course. Results show that, by performing and reflecting upon specific professional roles, the course stimulates students to both integrate different disciplines and reflect on an array of academic and practical insights. Based on our evaluation, we discuss several didactical aspects that may help lecturers to improve their interdisciplinary teaching in urban planning, design, and management courses--particularly when creating learning experiences in an increasingly diverse professional, societal and educational setting.

AB  - In the last decade, the term STEM has been increasingly picked up internationally and come to represent a solution to a range of issues. Within education, STEM is being translated as a curriculum organiser that has the possibility of engaging and retaining students and is interdisciplinary and skills focussed. This paper takes the STEM curriculum as its focus and investigates the influences that have resulted in the current interpretation of STEM as well as the epistemological questions, tensions and issues that this curriculum raises. The paper does this through a consideration of previous and current curriculum movements and debates and in doing so raises questions about the underlying assumptions, form and focus that STEM curriculum take before considering some possible future directions.

AB  - For decades, science policy has been promoting interdisciplinary research (IDR), but universities have not responded uniformly. To explain this variation, we integrate insights from the organizational literature, especially research on microfoundations, and highlight the role of both administrators and faculty. We collect and, with the help of machine learning, code vast amounts of textual data from 156 universities nationwide to measure universities' structural commitment to IDR as well as key explanatory variables, including top-down administrative support for, and bottom-up faculty engagement with, IDR. We integrate these measures with extant data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates, Higher Education R&D Expenditures Survey, NIH, NSF, and IPEDS to analyze how internal university dynamics influence the degree to which a university commits to IDR. Our results reveal that the level of structural commitment to IDR differs at universities with and without medical schools, as do the precursors to this commitment. At universities with medical schools, we find that bottom-up engagement is positively associated with structural commitment to IDR, and that status moderates the relationship between top-down administrative support and structural commitment to IDR. For universities with low levels of supportive administrative discourse status significantly impacted their structural commitment to IDR. At universities without medical schools, top-down support and bottom-up engagement are interrelated and mutually reinforcing such that universities with high levels of both administrative support and interdisciplinary research grants have higher levels of structural commitment to IDR. We discuss the implications of these findings for university administrators, policy makers, and researchers.

AB  - STEM education has received increasing attention in recent years. However, developing valid and reliable assessment of interdisciplinary learning in STEM has been a challenge. This study is a comprehensive review of assessment of interdisciplinary STEM education during the last two decades. A total of 49 empirical research articles were collected from an initial library of 635 articles focusing on interdisciplinary STEM education. A two-dimensional framework was developed to examine the literature. The first dimension concerns the nature of disciplines being assessed and includes three categories: monodisciplinary, interdiscipline, and transdiscipline. The second dimension concerns the learning objectives and includes four aspects: knowledge, skill, practice, and affective domain. The results show that most assessments focused on assessments of monodisciplinary knowledge, monodisciplinary affective domains, and transdisciplinary affective domains. Although many programs aimed to improve students' interdisciplinary understanding or skills, their assessments did not align with their aims. Based on the review, future directions are proposed for developing assessments for interdisciplinary STEM educational programs.

AB  - In this paper, we will discuss a type of activity that lets the mathematics classroom become a place where students can learn more than mathematical content. Specifically, students can learn interdisciplinary skills in the area of communication (both verbal and non-verbal) and debate skills that are often taught in communication or English classes. This paper discusses activities, which we call TACTivities, that can be added into any mathematics course to make the course more interdisciplinary, merging the arts and the sciences. They are best fit in mathematics courses where skills are to be learned and practiced, but modifications can be made for a variety of mathematics courses.

AB  - Background: Despite evidence that Communication Partner Training (CPT) can enable health professionals to communicate more effectively with people with aphasia (PWA), an evidence-practice gap exists. To address this, a tailored implementation intervention was developed and trialled to improve health professionals' implementation of communication strategies in a subacute setting. Aims: To explore the outcomes and perceived feasibility, acceptability and potential effectiveness of an iterative CPT implementation intervention on multidisciplinary healthcare professionals' communication with PWA. Methods & Procedures: The CPT implementation intervention was delivered to two groups of healthcare professionals (n = 6 and 7) approximately 6 months apart. The intervention underwent two iterations targeting emerging barriers to implementation success, with Group 2 receiving a modified version of the Group 1 intervention. A concurrent qualitative process evaluation was conducted to understand key factors determining implementation outcomes. Quantitative outcomes were recorded at baseline and 3-month follow-up, including the Measure of Skill in Supported Communication (MSC), a customized behavioural determinants survey mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Organizational Readiness for Change survey. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews were conducted with health professional participants and the speech-language therapist trainer to explore perceptions of feasibility, acceptability and potential effectiveness. Content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data, with categories and themes generated. Outcomes & Results: The Group 2 implementation intervention was adapted based on feedback and reflections from Group 1 participants to incorporate more time for practice interactions and discussion during training, individual follow-up sessions and provision of accessible resources to aid communication attempts. There were greater improvements seen in the Group 2 outcomes on both the MSC and the TDF survey, suggesting that the iterative tailoring of the intervention was successful in addressing the barriers to change and led to improved implementation. The difference between the group's outcomes may also partly be explained by the impact of organizational readiness, which decreased during Group 1's implementation period. Despite similar themes emerging from the stakeholder perspectives in both groups (training factors, implementation facilitators, implementation barriers, and changes in knowledge and practice), these diverted in ways which served to explain the different implementation outcomes. Conclusions & Implications: An iteratively adapted CPT implementation intervention targeting healthcare professionals' use of supported communication strategies was feasible and acceptable for most participants. The implementation intervention was potentially effective in changing participants' communication with PWA, particularly for Group 2. Future CPT implementation efforts should continue to incorporate stakeholder input and tailor strategies to the organizational context, and measure whether outcomes are sustained in the long term.

AB  - An important issue in the discussion on the quality of legal education is the interdisciplinary character of legal studies. The main problem is how much the interdisciplinarity is demanded and needed by the consumers of the legal education market. It is believed that bringing interdisciplinary elements into law studies curricula, contributes to enhancing knowledge, skills, competence, and qualities that are necessary in modern times, sometimes much more than just dry legal knowledge. Lawyers who have sound knowledge of economy, finance, sociology, or psychology may provide better services tailored to their clients' needs. The major question remains--what makes a good lawyer--technical legal skills and fluent knowledge of legal provisions, statutes, case-law, or ability to listen, to understand the social processes or economic mechanisms better, having a better methodological apparatus, familiarised with a richer range of points of reference useful in creating solutions in their respective fields--having learned them from other disciplines of knowledge. The goal is to analyse the content of the Polish legal studies and reflect on how higher education institutions may address the issue of interdisciplinarity, in the context of the growing pressure to have highly skilled lawyers who can adapt to the fast-progressing socio-economic environment.

AB  - This article introduces an international and interdisciplinary summer school, 'Living in the Landscape' (LiLa) in 2018. LiLa's practices focused on creating dialogue among art education, anthropology and nature science and developing culturally sustainable methods for investigating cultural heritage in the Komi Republic of Russia. The article's research interest is how dialogue and cultural heritage appear in the artistic processes, artworks and final exhibition of the summer school. These are examined through art-based action research in order to develop international, multidisciplinary and culturally sustainable art education. The four-field model utilised in the research highlights the multidimensional role of dialogue in both individual and collaborative artistic endeavours.

AB  - We explore the potential drivers for and barriers to interdisciplinary education in design from the student learning perspective. To achieve this, a series of in-depth student interview studies were conducted at two interdisciplinary design schools in the Republic of Korea and the UK. Results indicated both awareness and synthesis of interdisciplinary perspectives across the two schools. However, these abilities appeared more heavily dependent upon individual student attitudes and interests, compared to the programmes of study themselves. Instructor bias and potential integration issues at school and institutional levels were further cited as challenges to interdisciplinarity. However, results also indicated application as a key driver for the acquisition and synthesis of disciplinary perspectives. Students, within the applied discipline of design, responded well to interdisciplinarity when accompanied by opportunities to integrate disciplinary knowledge through application within their own project works. Implications for interdisciplinary approaches to design education are finally discussed together with suggested avenues for future investigation.

AB  - This case is designed to help school leaders develop skills needed to work with interdisciplinary groups while demonstrating the complex issues faced while considering the special education needs of students. The case further examines a child study team meeting from the lens of different participants, including the principal, teacher, school psychologist, parents, and consulting psychologist. Although initially designed as an interdisciplinary lesson, with students from various programs taking on the roles, the case can also be used exclusively with educational leaders, with leaders role-playing the parts. Roles can also be adjusted and/or eliminated as needed to accommodate other disciplines.

AB  - An integrative tool that we have piloted in two LCs, the interdisciplinary index, is an integrative template that students use to make connections between disciplines. In the learning community, "Cli-Fi: Stories and Science of the Coming Climate Apocalypse," faculty developed the Climate-Change Stress Index (CCSI) that students used to identify evidence of climate-change impacts in the fictional setting of each novel they read. In another learning community, "All things Connect: Living with Nature in Mind," students again used an index consisting Ecopsychology principles to describe, explain, and/or evaluate how these principles informed excerpts from environmental literature. We present a variety of student samples using Barber's (2012) model of integrative learning and conclude with a review of the functions of interdisciplinary indexing.

AB  - Competency Based Education (CBE) is becoming increasingly popular with Department of Defense (DoD) training and education. Air University, located at Maxwell Air Force Base (AFB) Alabama, recently identified CBE as a key factor for consideration in future training. This article discusses Air Force Competencies, analyzes the evaluation of competencies, and transfer of learning. The Civilian Associate's Degree, currently under beta testing, is discussed as an example of the need to consider transfer of learning with respect to institutional competencies. Beta testing of the Associate of Applied Science Degree in Air Force Leadership and Management Studies is meant to pave the way for the development and implementation of Civilian Airman training. Based on Civilian Associate's Degree (CAD) Beta Testing student data, our research examines how CAD faculty can best capture professional interdisciplinary knowledge and experiences present in incoming students. In turn, leadership and management theories will add to the student knowledge and experience. This paper is an effort to capture the utilization of previous professional student experiences while developing and updating course curriculum based upon research and Beta Test student data.

AB  - Color has been considered as a special problem in several disciplines, notably art and music, but also philosophy and literature. Given that color is also a central feature of some scientific thought (think of Newton and the color spectrum, for example), the question "What color is the interdisciplinary?" seems to be a golden opportunity to investigate the interdisciplinarity of color. My question, which follows from Michael Taussig's similar anthropological question, "What color is the sacred?" points to important issues about the nature of interdisciplinary thinking. Rather than merely posit an answer such as, for example, "interdisciplinarity is red," we would do well to think through those issues. The question is novel not only because it invents the nominal adjectival form of "interdisciplinarity" as "the interdisciplinary" (as in "the sacred"), but also because it approaches interdisciplinarity with a hint of both reverence and irreverence. Giorgio Agamben's take on "the sacred" and Walter Benjamin's understanding of color figure into my response to the question. Agamben explains the importance of the "profanation" of the apparatuses of "the sacred." And Benjamin's ideas about the color of experience establish the basis of an answer to our question: the rainbow.

AB  - Undergraduate Research (UR) provides deeper experiential learning opportunities for students while increasing their self-efficacy, academic success and motivation to pursue graduate studies. Many real-world problems require an integrated solution and collaboration across different disciplines; therefore, it is important that students develop skills to work across disciplines on challenging research problems. As types and complexity of UR increase, Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Research (IDUR) has become more prevalent, but little is known about it. We define IDUR as "student-faculty collaboration to examine, increase, and share new knowledge or works relevant to research questions the investigation of which necessitates an interdisciplinary approach". From the faculty perspective, and based on the results of a national sample of higher learning institutions in the U.S., we outline the enablers of and barriers to IDUR and provide quantitative and qualitative insights. Survey results show that, irrespective of the size of the institution at which they work, faculty members value mentoring students conducting IDUR although it brings with it some challenges. Our findings may help institutions better facilitate IDUR projects and inform faculty development opportunities that deepen student learning and retention via enhanced curricula in which IDUR is embedded.

AB  - Today, interdisciplinary education is a hot topic. Gaining an insight into the nature of interdisciplinary education may help when making design decisions for interdisciplinary education. In this study, we argue that, derived from interdisciplinary research, the choice of problem, the level of interaction between different disciplines and constructive alignment are variables to consider when designing interdisciplinary education. Several models of analysis have been used in two descriptive case studies to gain insight into the design parameters for interdisciplinary education. In this study, we AIM to describe (a) the level and nature of integration, (b) the problem definitions as a guiding principle for constructive alignment for (c) the design and execution of interdisciplinary/transdisciplinary education.

AB  - The study explores the effects of an interdisciplinary learning approach on developing students' English learning (EL) and computational thinking (CT) through two different game-based learning approaches. A quasi-experiment is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in terms of enhancing students' CT knowledge and their EL achievement in an elementary school English as a foreign language (EFL) learning context. A total of 52 Grade 3 students take part in the experiment, of whom 28 are assigned to the experimental group learned with a machine educational robot (machine-ER) board game and 24 are assigned to the control group learned with a character educational robot (character-ER) board game. Results indicate that both groups made significant improvements in learning achievement: 1) in English-language achievement of learning vocabulary and sentence patterns; and 2) in CT concepts, although the machine-ER board game produces a greater increase than the character-ER board game in both language learning achievement and CT knowledge, their learning anxieties are also lower than those of the control group. The analysis of behavioral patterns also reveals that students playing the machine-ER board game demonstrate better language-learning interaction, whereas the students playing character-ER board game present greater CT development in finding solutions.

AB  - Background: Argumentation, that is the coordination of evidence and reasons to support claims, is an important skill for democratic society, developing subject-specific literacies, and can be embedded in multiple school subjects. While argumentation has been extensively researched in science education, interdisciplinary argumentation is less explored, particularly between subjects where collaboration is not the norm, such as science and religious education (RE). Yet everyday issues often involve considering information from multiple sources, such as scientific information or ethical, moral, or religious perspectives. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to better understand students' abilities in argumentation within and across the school subjects of science and RE to inform research and practice of interdisciplinary argumentation. Sample: The participants of this study were 457 students, aged between 11 and 14 years, from 10 secondary schools in England. Following data cleaning, 394 student responses were analysed. Design and Methods: Students completed simultaneous written assessments for argumentation in three tasks which are situated within three different subject contexts: (1) science (2) RE, and (3) an interdisciplinary context which involved argumentation from science and RE. Results: In each of the three contexts, high proportions of students achieve all available marks for identifying claims and evidence. These proportions drop when constructing the link between claim and evidence (warrant) and constructing an evaluative argument. Higher performances were generally noted in the context of science and that students experience particular challenges in argumentation in the RE scenario. Conclusions: This study contributes to our understanding of the challenges and successes of students' argumentation within and across the subjects of science and RE. Implications for both research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Contribution: This study identifies the skills required by the faculty to mentor first-year interdisciplinary design projects. The findings are compiled as a set of themes that can act as a guide for engineering educators in mentoring interdisciplinary design projects. Background: The National Academy of Engineering's (NAE) Engineer of 2020 report states that developing solutions to real-world problems requires engineers to possess skills to access, understand, evaluate, synthesize, and apply information and knowledge from multiple disciplines. However, most engineering students possess strong monodisciplinary expertise and skills, which are insufficient when students graduate and work in the industry. In order to equip engineers to solve real-world problems, engineering education should focus on building competencies and bringing the flavor of interdisciplinary education into the undergraduate engineering curriculum. While there is a growing call to introduce interdisciplinary courses to undergraduate engineering students, the ability of the faculty to teach and mentor students from multiple disciplines is a concern. Research Question: This study qualitatively investigates the question, "What skills do engineering faculty consider important to mentor first-year interdisciplinary engineering projects?" Methodology: The study is situated in a project-based learning course offered at first-year engineering at a university in India. It identifies the skills a faculty needs to possess to mentor students working on interdisciplinary (mechatronic) design projects through thematic analysis of faculty and student interviews. Findings: Performing qualitative analysis on the data collected from the two sources, including semistructured interviews with the faculty and students focus group discussion, reveals three dimensions on which the engineering faculty needs to be trained on. It included project management and interpersonal and interdisciplinary skills.

AB  - This study aimed to systematically review the literature focusing on music integration approaches adopted in preschool to secondary education in Turkey. The relevant studies were identified through a systematic search on five databases (The National Thesis Center, TÜBITAK ULAKBIM TR Index, ERIC, Scopus, and Web of Science). The paper analyzed the publications that were written in Turkish and English between 2010 and 2022 and that are available on the databases of empirical theses and peer-reviewed scientific journals, addressing music integration approaches adopted in preschool to secondary schools by using qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods. By operationalizing these criteria, 35 studies were included in the review. The studies included were found to tend to use quantitative methods. Music has mainly been integrated into math, science, and language arts curricula. This study revealed that most of the analyzed studies used a subservient integration style, an arts integration style, and offered limited insight into the depth and scope of subject areas covered and the sequencing of skills. Furthermore, this study proposed to consider educational, cognitive, artistic, and affective outcomes together by maintaining the integrity of each of the disciplines in music integration studies in the general schooling context.

AB  - Behavior analysts frequently collaborate with interdisciplinary colleagues to share information and make decisions about client services. This study evaluated the effects of behavioral skills training on preparation for and presentation during interdisciplinary review team meetings by clinicians (n = 4) and nurses (n = 4) at a residential school for students with intellectual and neurodevelopmental disabilities. The primary dependent measure was the percentage of preparation and presentation steps from task-analyzed behavior checklists that the participants implemented correctly. As evaluated by multiple-baseline designs, the participants improved their preparation and presentation skills to nearly 100% following behavioral skills training, maintained performance 1 month after the study, and rated training positively. We discuss elements of the training program, practice implications, and research directions.

AB  - The authors' aim was to present a practical decision-making framework for decision makers (DMs) to use in evaluating interdisciplinary strategic approaches to degree program development. A framework based on ordinal game theory was applied using a recent decision to create an interdisciplinary business analytics program at a small, public university. The optimal Nash, in which each decision maker receives the most desirable outcome, was determined. The proposed methodological framework can be used for the design, evaluation, and postcommitment support of any interdisciplinary degree program.

AB  - Preservice teachers need opportunities in teacher education courses to explore arts-based interdisciplinary learning that can inspire connections between communities of practice and allow learners to integrate concepts and imagine creative possibilities. This study reports on preservice teachers engaged in a workshop on arts-based interdisciplinary music and mathematics tasks. Data included surveys, task-related artifacts, and participant observations to examine how preservice teachers conceptualize and engage in such tasks. Three resonating themes were identified, revealing that preservice teachers generally thought: (1) music and mathematics are more engaging and relatable in interdisciplinary contexts than when taught alone; (2) interdisciplinary music and mathematics tasks can and should be adapted to the needs of all learners; and (3) some uncertainties and concerns about implementing such tasks still exist. Based on these findings, suggestions are made for purposeful ways teacher education can engage preservice teachers in arts-based interdisciplinary music and mathematics tasks that can prepare them to create equitable and creative interdisciplinary learning opportunities for their students.

AB  - Learning analytics dashboard (LAD) development has been criticized for being too data-driven and for developers lacking an understanding of the nontechnical aspects of learning analytics (LA). The ability of developers to address their understanding of learners as well as systematic efforts to involve students in the development process are central to creating pedagogically grounded student-facing dashboards. However, limited research is available about developer perceptions on supporting students with LA. We examined an interdisciplinary LA development team's (IDT) perceptions of and intentions to support student agency, and the student-facing LAD development process. Qualitative content analysis supported by a social cognitive theory framework was conducted on interviews (N = 12) to analyze the IDT's perceptions of student agency. IDT members had differing conceptions of student agency but agreed that it manifests in strategic study progression and planning, as well as in active interpretation and use of LA-based feedback. IDT members had differing views on student involvement in the LAD development process. Communication challenges within an IDT and limited resources were mentioned, impeding development work. The results of this study highlight the importance of fostering communication among IDT members about guiding pedagogical design principles and the systematic use of educational concepts in LA development processes.

AB  - Teachers in France working with (emergent) bilingual pupils often not only feel ill-equipped to provide the specific support these learners require, but also find it difficult to accept that languages other than French have a right and role as learning resources in the classroom. Challenging such monolingual mindsets whilst helping teachers to understand, experience and experiment with the linguistic and cultural diversity of their classrooms requires innovative and creative approaches (Mary, Krüger & Young, 2021). In this paper, we present and analyse data collected from 14 students during 2019-2020 (pre & post-course questionnaires, student portfolios, written reflections and working group minutes) during an elective course offered to future (pre)primary teachers in France (N = 40). The course was project-based and interdisciplinary, incorporating techniques, concepts and insights from the visual arts, new technologies, language acquisition and development, psychology and sociolinguistics. A key objective of the course was to empower student teachers to become agents of change or "language activists" (Shohamy, 2006) through the implementation of creative projects for and with their (emergent) bilingual pupils. Students developed projects ranging from the creation of bilingual books and story bags to multilingual music collections, in collaboration with the children and families who frequented their schools.

AB  - Gender-based violence (GBV) is global issue, requiring specialized knowledge, attitudes, and skills. The most effective responses are interdisciplinary, involving social work, healthcare, and the justice system. While GBV was exacerbated during the pandemic, many students faced a reduced availability of practice opportunities to learn how to respond to GBV. The authors describe a teaching and learning project which expanded access to experiential, interdisciplinary learning across three faculties (social work, nursing, law) by using virtual gaming simulation-based learning (VGSBL). Processes of development and implementation are discussed, along with recommendations for further integration of VGSBL in addressing grand challenges of social work education such as interdisciplinary collaboration in responding to GBV.

AB  - To understand current maternal health outcomes and growing health disparities, this interdisciplinary project investigates the development of a community advisory board (CAB), guided by the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR), which explores the perspectives of providers, community stakeholders, and students. This step-by-step process analysis allows for greater clarity and recognition of areas to consider in future CAB initiatives and use of interprofessional education. Both quantitative and qualitative principles were used to assess and evaluate the process, including survey, observation, and content analysis. While this project remains in the early stages, promising results have emerged supporting strong group dynamics and commitment toward change in the local community while identifying improvements to the overall delivery of the CAB and CBPR process.
