AB  - Primary literature searching and the utility of research articles in chemistry teaching and instructions provide connections between conceptual understanding and the application of chemical knowledge. Article citation tracking, an often-neglected dimension in literature exploration, expands information seeking and provides opportunities to track how the reported breakthroughs of a research article are utilized and how the science behind the work progresses. Tracking published works that cite an article can be an effective methodology to gauge the impact of the work not just on the chemical sciences but also on other fields, thus highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of chemistry. The activity reported herein explores the utility of article citation tracking as an exercise for students to realize the potential impact of a published work and how the findings, whether infinitesimal or grand, contribute to creating knowledge and their applications in dealing with contemporary issues. The activity uses citation databases and indexing platforms for the learners to generate information such as the type of documents that cite a paper, the field or subject area of the citing articles, and the evaluation of the reasons for citing the work. Implemented among students taking introductory chemistry classes, encompassing psychology, medical technology, and nursing students, the exercise captures the enhancement of information-gathering skills, effectively incorporating research into classroom instructions and promoting critical thinking among students. Anchoring on an active cognition framework that weaves information and extracts related scientific concepts, this exercise addresses the adoption of strategies serving the global drive for sustainability in science education.

AB  - Our society is affected by the climate crisis, which is largely a consequence of human activity. For this reason, the education and awareness of society plays a fundamental role. Spain and Andalusia are committed to the 17 sustainable development goals established by the United Nations and their fulfilment by 2030, representing an important part of the Challenges of Andalusian Society (CAS). One of the goals to be achieved is to "improve education, awareness and human and institutional capacity for climate change mitigation, adaptation and early warning". Education and environmental awareness in relation to CAS remain one of the main challenges, especially in foreign language teaching and learning. By means of an innovative educational strategy, this project aims to address four CAS in university language learning/teaching of French as a foreign language (FFL): 1. Climate action, environment, resource and raw material efficiency, 2. Smart, green and integrated transport, 3. Safe, clean and efficient energy, and 4. Health, demographic change and social well-being. The aim is to train and raise awareness of key concepts among undergraduate students through the integration of the CAS as didactic units in FFL subjects of the Bachelor's Degree in French Studies at the University of Granada (Spain). This project may well have a positive impact on the environmental attitude, interest and motivation of students towards the CAS and the acquisition of linguistic competences in the French language.

AB  - Purpose: Inter- and transdisciplinarity are core concepts in almost all education for sustainable development (ESD) competence frameworks and curricula. To equip students with inter- and transdisciplinary competencies is highly demanding for educators. Educators must not only know how to teach students such competencies, but need to be experienced in inter- and transdisciplinary research and must have some technical knowledge about inter- and transdisciplinarity. This paper aims to show how university educators can be supported in their teaching. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is a case study based on research and on experiences in interdisciplinary teaching and in supporting educators in their interdisciplinary teaching. Findings: The paper presents a competence framework of interdisciplinary competencies to guide university teachers that has been developed, implemented and refined in interdisciplinary study programmes belonging to the field of ESD. It shows how the professional development of educators could be addressed referring to the experiences in these programmes. The measures presented consist for one thing of interdisciplinary processes among the educators and of measures directly supporting educators in their teaching for another thing. Originality/value: The case study the paper refers to is of special value, first, because the experiences are based on long-standing research and on two decades of experiences. Second, because considerable efforts were made to deliver coherent and consistent interdisciplinary teaching in which interdisciplinarity was not only a teaching subject for the students but showed by the educators as well so that the educators involved did not only talk about competencies for inter- and transdisciplinary collaborations but also set an example in their own doings.

AB  - ChatGPT, a sophisticated online chatbot, sent shockwaves through many sectors once reports filtered through that it could pass exams. In higher education, it has raised many questions about the authenticity of assessment and challenges in detecting plagiarism. Amongst the resulting frenetic hubbub, hints of potential opportunities in how ChatGPT could support learning and the development of critical thinking have also emerged. In this paper, we examine how ChatGPT may affect assessment in engineering education by exploring ChatGPT responses to existing assessment prompts from ten subjects across seven Australian universities. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of current assessment practice and discuss opportunities on how ChatGPT can be used to facilitate learning. As artificial intelligence is rapidly improving, this analysis sets a benchmark for ChatGPT's performance as of early 2023 in responding to engineering education assessment prompts. ChatGPT did pass some subjects and excelled with some assessment types. Findings suggest that changes in current practice are needed, as typically with little modification to the input prompts, ChatGPT could generate passable responses to many of the assessments, and it is only going to get better as future versions are trained on larger data sets.

AB  - Well-being is generally acknowledged as a complex concept, and leading discourses are rooted in disciplines such as philosophy, psychology and economics. Despite a wealth of theoretical explanations, child well-being is largely under-theorised. Some argue it is unlikely that philosophical discourses of well-being will straightforwardly be extended to children because they were not originally written with them in mind. Therefore, this article first examines dimensions, domains and discourses of well-being and summarises the discussion with a conceptual framework in order to provide clarity about a complex concept. Second, the article discusses current research about the meaning of child well-being and finds that while there are different terms in use, many discourses are similar in nature. Third, the article shows how knowledge and understanding of early childhood relates to various well-being discourses and suggests that a theory of child well-being may not be needed. The article highlights the new development emerging between psychology, economics and sociology and concludes by discussing the value of adopting multi-disciplinary perspectives of well-being. The article is useful for policy-makers, practitioners and researchers in understanding the complex nature of well-being, particularly in the context of early childhood education.

AB  - Integration is a concept that is referred to very widely in relation internationalization, yet its meaning is rarely explored and its benefits are often assumed. In this article, we start by reviewing the conceptualization of "integration" across different fields, notably education and the internationalization of education, intercultural communication, health psychology, and organizational studies. We propose that the varying interpretations within and across these fields can be synthesized by considering the different levels at which integration can be analyzed--individual level, community level, and institutional level. We then review the multiple benefits that integration can bring at these different levels, while acknowledging their interconnections, and noting the potential risks from ignoring integration. We end by proposing a framework to help universities and all of their members (staff and students) develop their own strategies and priorities for enhancing integration.

AB  - The world's cultural heritage (customs, practices, places, objects, artistic expressions, and values that signify a legacy of the history of humanity) provides identity to communities. In Mexico, the case of the World Heritage City of Xochimilco involves a sustainable agroecological system designed by its ancient inhabitants more than 500 years ago. Currently, the biodiversity and the chinampas (floating agricultural gardens) are at risk due to inconsistent government oversight and the lack of incentives for communities to carry on with the culture of agricultural production on Lake Xochimilco. Through a Challenge-Based Learning, a culturally relevant academic experience for university students was designed to involve them in preserving biodiversity while developing research and problem-solving skills. Satisfaction surveys and course evaluations indicated that this didactic methodology encouraged students to consider their connection to social justice issues and prompted them to expand their knowledge in their different disciplines. Socially-oriented experiential learning is an effective pedagogy that fosters a sense of social responsibility in students.

AB  - The independence of research is a key strategic issue of modern societies. Dealing with it appropriately poses legal, economic, political, social and cultural problems for society, which have been studied by the corresponding disciplines and are increasingly the subject of reflexive discourses of scientific communities. Unfortunately, problems of independence are usually framed in disciplinary contexts without due consideration of other perspectives' relevance or possible contributions. To overcome these limitations, we review disciplinary perspectives and findings on the independence of research and identify interdisciplinary prospects that could inform a research programme.

AB  - To build a sustainable future, science and engineering education programmes should emphasise scientific investigation, collaboration across traditional science topics and disciplines, and engineering design, including design and evaluation of solutions. While some research studies articulate the shifts that are needed to realise classroom learning emphasizing investigation and design, fewer research studies help us to understand how we co-design these instructional programmes, including how experts from different essential disciplines collaborate towards an interdisciplinary instructional programme. We adopted a qualitative case study design to address the research question, "What is the process of team co-construction of instructional materials that emphasize learning through both science investigation and engineering design?" The paper outlines the first year of our team co-construction activities involving the design, implementation, and evaluation of instructional materials for secondary science. Qualitative data included semi-structured interviews with nine team members and documentation in form of researcher field notes and learning artefacts. Two cycles of coding resulted in five major themes that served as the basis for the five-phase model of team co-construction of instructional materials. This study provides information on the kinds of partnerships and collaboration needed to realise instructional programmes for students' study of the interdisciplinary STEM-based challenges of tomorrow.

AB  - While interdisciplinarity has been widely addressed in higher education policies and university strategies across countries, universities and colleges are struggling with the implementation at the programme level. For instance, extant literature implies many barriers to establishing interdisciplinary degree programmes (IDPs). However, there is a lack of both conceptual understandings and empirical investigations on how these barriers can be resolved through appropriate management. Our paper addresses this research gap by constructing an analytical framework for understanding the cause of barriers in the context of establishing IDPs and managerial approaches to overcome them through the lens of managing organisational innovation, and applying it in an empirical study of two cases of establishing IDPs at a Finnish research university. Our study yielded four conceptualised and tested propositions on key factors that middle-level university managers should consider for both preventing and resolving barriers to establishing IDPs. It suggests that while managers should plan IDPs that largely fit the institutional environment and bring foreseeable benefits to participants in the programmes, the art of their management lies in leveraging all relevant resources to enhance institutional compatibility, to change peoples' perceptions about profitability and to empower other participants' agency.

AB  - K-12 teachers and students are vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks and mostly ill-prepared to deal with them. The COVID-19 pandemic has only increased these risks because of the reliance on digital technology in education and increased free time young children and adolescents spend online. Simultaneously, the U.S. is facing an extreme shortage of cybersecurity professionals. Given the rise of cyberattacks and the need for cybersecurity professionals, a concerted effort to prepare preservice teachers to integrate cybersecurity education across the K-12 curriculum is needed. In our vision for 2025, all preservice teachers across the country are prepared to integrate age-appropriate cybersecurity concepts, skills and career awareness in the curriculum regardless of their content area or grade level specialization. We propose a repository of stand-alone activities and full curricula developed through collaboration among K-12 educators, teacher educators, and cybersecurity experts that could be adopted across teacher education programs. We use the elementary grades as a context for providing examples of some activities that might be included in the repository. We also provide recommendations for developing such a repository and for individual teacher educators who want integrate cybersecurity education in preservice teacher education right now.

AB  - Interdisciplinary experiments within chemistry are very important for the improvements in the overall quality of the education received by students. In this work, we describe an interdisciplinary experiment that was successfully completed by undergraduate students. This training integrates multiple disciplines including natural product medicinal chemistry, organic synthesis, and instrumental analysis. The experiment involved the extraction of crude berberine hydrochloride (BBH) from "Coptidis rhizoma," recrystallization for purification, and qualitative and quantitative analysis of purified BBH using the "Brick-L" miniature mass spectrometer (mini-MS). The use of mini-MS analysis is the highlight of this work. Mini-MS offers an unprecedented opportunity to incorporate MS analysis into regular undergraduate teaching due to its small size, low power consumption, and portability. The modular design of the mini-MS instrument used in this work allows instructors to disassemble the instrument on-site in the laboratory to show and introduce the actual structure and components inside the instrument to students. Students not only gain hands-on experience with technology but also have the opportunity to see some of the "inner workings" rather than simply treating the mass spectrometer as "a black box". This greatly helped students understand the construction and analysis principles of MS and motivated students to learn about scientific instruments. This comprehensive experiment can help undergraduate students to improve their overall ability and get in touch with the frontiers of analytical chemistry. This teaching practice can also provide a viable case for comprehensive chemistry experiments in other related disciplines.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss the individuals' "roles", "responsibilities", and "routine activities", along with their "goals" and "intentions" in two different contexts--a school science context and a university research context--using sociological lenses. We highlight the distinct characteristics of both contexts to suggest new design strategies for STEM learning environments in school science context. We collected our research data through participant observations, field notes, group conversations, and interviews. Our findings indicate that school science practices were limited to memorizing and replicating science content knowledge through lectures and laboratory activities. Simple-structured science activities were a means to engage school science students in practical work and relate the theoretical concepts to such work. Their routine activities were to succeed in schooling objectives. In university research settings, the routine activities had interdisciplinary dimensions representing cognitive, social, and material dimensions of scientific practice. Such routine activities were missing in the practices of school science. We found that the differences between school and university research settings were primarily associated with individuals' "goals" and "intentions", which resulted in different social structures. In school settings, more authentic social structure can evolve if teachers trust their students and allow them to share the social and epistemic authorities through establishing mentorship. We do not expect school science students to perform the tasks of scientists in the same manner, yet the desired school science activities should include mentorship roles and interdisciplinary perspectives and encourage school science students to pursue unanswered questions without looking for the right answer.

AB  - Cultivating innovative talents in the humanities and social sciences is a pivotal element in the development of high-level innovative talents with a direct impact on a nation's superstructure and economy. Nevertheless, this area has often been a weak link in the talent market. In response to this challenge, Chinese universities have initiated the "New Humanities and Social Sciences" reform, emphasizing interdisciplinary education to nurture high-quality talents. However, the impact of interdisciplinary education within this context on the creativity of humanities and social science students, along with the intricate underlying mechanisms, remains a question yet to be fully answered. To address these issues, using survey data from 184 students majoring in humanities and social sciences in Sichuan Province of China, we employed structural equation modeling to explore the impact of interdisciplinary education on the creativity of humanities and social science students, the moderating effect of metacognitive awareness and the mediating role of knowledge integration ability. The research findings unequivocally affirm the significantly positive influence of interdisciplinary education on the creativity of humanities and social science students. Knowledge integration ability mediates the relationship between interdisciplinary education and creativity. Furthermore, metacognitive awareness plays a moderating role in the relationship between knowledge integration ability and creativity.

AB  - Despite psychology's position within the National Council for the Social Studies' definition of social studies, the American Psychological Association is advocating the rebranding of psychology as a science course. This study interviews six high school psychology teachers and employs a Foucauldian framework to understand different perspectives on this rebranding, what makes teachers position their psychology course as science or social studies, and how that rebranding has impacted teachers' perceived ability to make psychology content relevant to students' lived experiences. We find significant disagreement among psychology teachers about the degree to which they should embrace the "psychology-as-science" paradigm. We also find that most professional development for high school psychology teachers is rooted in the science paradigm and that many teachers feel limited by their ability to connect psychology content to students' lived experiences under the science paradigm. We conclude with recommendations for teachers, curriculum leaders, researchers, and teacher preparation programs for upholding psychology as an interdisciplinary social studies course.

AB  - Teachers' and practitioners' pedagogical practices also have legal professional responsibilities and regulations to adhere to under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. We understand the former as the policy master narrative that can reify inaccessibility in the classroom. We take a paradigmatic shift focusing on "storying" pedagogical practices in special education by centering 2 Black and Brown girls in attendance in K-12 classrooms, "storying" together/two-gather transformative teaching-learning wisdom. We propose that "storying" involves explicit engagement with and highlighting of the student's voice, and we would center spirit and emotionality. The girls' storying illustrates praxical research through the lens of Black Womanist/Feminist and Disability Justice. The girls will show ways to support their learning. We introduce 5 "storying" pedagogical practices related to access-intimacy as interdependence, voicing intersectional knowledge for anti-racist and anti-ableist praxis in special education. Finally, we share how these practices lead to justice in education by reframing the master narratives for our readers to access and determine a reflexive accessibility praxis (everyday life) for their pedagogy.

AB  - Faculty development is essential to promote pedagogical innovation and the transformation of teaching practices. The faculty development model presented in this study was guided by three research questions about how scholars engage in institutionally held training opportunities for professional development; how scholars engage with and collaborate within learning communities/communities of practice; and the implications and perceived impacts of such dynamics for the conceptualization of faculty development approaches aimed at community development. The results highlight community development as an interdisciplinary opportunity to reflect, learn, diversify, rethink, envision, and be intentional about pedagogy.

AB  - Experiencing failure is an important part of the learning process, but undergraduate students often hold a negative perception of failure that may contribute to fear of failure and risk avoidance. We investigated the influence of instructor feedback, discussions of failure in the classroom, and course-level and institutional structures on students' view of failure across disciplines. Undergraduate students at the University of Toronto Mississauga participated in an online survey (n = 304) consisting of Likert-scaled and open-ended questions on perceptions of failure, experience with instructor feedback, likelihood to engage in help-seeking, and course- and institutional-level suggestions to support learning from failure. When instructors discussed with their students how to best respond to feedback, students were more likely to view small failures as a helpful part of the learning process. Further, when instructors discussed strategies to best respond to failure, students were more likely to view failure as helpful for learning and less likely to view weak performance early in a course as an indication of future weak performance. Student-identified strategies to better support resilience included improved communication between students and instructors, in peer-to-peer conversations, and by the institution more broadly. Across all three areas, students expressed a desire for systems of higher education to destigmatize failure through changes in both rhetoric and policy. This suggests the incorporation of meaningful conversations and failure narratives in the classroom and beyond are effective strategies to encourage the development of resilience-based skills. Such discussions may help students engage positively with failure and maintain willingness to engage in future challenges.

AB  - Conversations and networks are essential for transforming academics' teaching practices as learning experiences (Palmer 1993). Yet, there has been little research reporting academics' informal conversations about teaching (Thomson and Trigwell 2018). Teachers will generally access small significant networks (Becher and Trowler 2001) for nuanced and personal issues relating to teaching and learning. Collaborative transnational projects provide fertile ground for unique conversations about Higher Education (HE) teaching (Thomson 2015), with the added value of cross-national perspectives. This study examines the conditions that help to create significant networks and conversations, based on collective autoethnographic reflections of the member of an Erasmus+ project, including five partner universities from four different countries. The results provide insights into how the project have afforded the generation and continuation of cross-national and interdisciplinary significant networks and how unique conversations have allowed for trust, relationships and common goals to develop, which add value beyond the individual level.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to enhance integration of game-based learning (GBL) as a tool for conveying intricate circular economy (CE) concepts effectively into international and interdisciplinary higher education collaborations for the development of sustainable communities. Design/methodology/approach: A series of game-based workshops by the Circular EELISA Community of the EELISA European University program were examined in terms of their compliance with literature-based GBL characteristics and their international, interdisciplinary and online conduct. An online survey conducted with 17 workshop and/or challenge organizers from four participating universities in different countries revealed expert experiences and perceptions on these points. Findings: It was found that sensory elements, rewards and game choice enhanced engagement and motivation in all gamification, serious game and storytelling experiences, and that a combination of multiple GBL approaches was more effective than a single-method challenge design. Diversity-friendly collaboration, cooperation and immersion were particularly important when involving culturally and disciplinarily diverse participants. Practical implications: This study offers practical recommendations to improve both the performance of GBL-based learning environments in current and future education alliances and collaborations and the potential of GBL approaches to motivate youth to contribute to more sustainable communities across and beyond Europe. Originality/value: The findings underscore the value of innovative pedagogical methods in shaping environmentally conscious mindsets and practices across institutions of higher education. To that end, this is the first study that investigates GBL in CE education with implications for international university cooperation.

AB  - Taking three typical interdisciplinary programs integrated with modern technologies in a vocational college as examples, this research was designed to identify the indicators of student career maturity and to explore the indirect effect of career learning planning on the relationship between career maturity and confidence in self-directed career learning. A survey was conducted to collect data on interdisciplinary programs in the humanities of a vocational college. Factor analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to conduct the analysis. Results showed that career value and students' perceptions of career competencies and external assistance were predictors of the career maturity of students in the early stages of college learning. The modelling test supported the significant effect of career maturity on confidence in learning through the mediating effect of planning for learning. Early career interventions was proposed to guide interdisciplinary students to make plans for future careers.

AB  - The Arts and Science Honours Academy (ASHA) is a unique interdisciplinary undergraduate honours programme at a large research-intensive university in Canada. Data were collected in early 2020 from 108 past and present students, representing the first eleven cohorts of the programme. Triangulating results from quantitative and qualitative analyses, we describe the ASHA students' educational and social experience during their time at university and, for those who have graduated, their post-graduate activities. Situating our investigation within previous literature examining interdisciplinary undergraduate learning communities and high impact practices, we assess whether students from arts and science disciplines experienced the programme differently, and which aspects of the programme were most impactful. We find that academically, students reported benefiting from the exposure to interdisciplinary thought, the opportunity to do research, and the study abroad requirement. Socially, students reported benefiting from the connections they formed with a small cohort of high achieving peers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. While science students reported benefitting the most from ASHA socially, arts students were more likely to indicate that the programme influenced their careers following graduation. These findings provide evidence to support the creation and design of future interdisciplinary undergraduate programmes.

AB  - Finland has recently reformed the national school curriculum, basing it on so-called twenty-first century skills. The curriculum prescribes that schools must organise at least one multidisciplinary learning module per year. In this case study, we investigate the implementation of such a module in secondary school (grade 9) from the perspective of the school headmaster and science and mathematics teachers. The data comprise interviews with the headmaster, teachers, and protocols from collegiate meetings. Despite some gains experienced by teachers concerning cooperation with colleagues, the results reveal challenges connected to diffusely defined learning goals, as well as to the vagueness of goals concerning the role of different subjects in the module. The study shows the importance of offering research-based support and time for shared sensemaking for stakeholders to avoid the problems identified when implementing multidisciplinary teaching.

AB  - In this article the authors set out and critically reflect upon an innovative pedagogical approach to delivering studio-based learning -- drawing on the 'Collaborative Futures' project. Collaborative Futures is a live project premised on a futures-focused design brief written with an external partner. In previous iterations of the project, partners have included Hitachi and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Each year this project brings together a team of students in their final year on the Masters European Design programme to collaborate with a group of early career design graduates. Between 2019 and 2020, the Collaborative Futures project worked with Glasgow City Council's Centre for Civic Innovation to explore and prototype citizen-centred scenarios surrounding data experiences set in the context of Glasgow 2030. Throughout the project the student-graduate team engaged in multidisciplinary collaboration within and beyond the boundaries of the higher education studio context, working with civic, academic and design professionals, public and third sector organisations, and members of the public. The authors reflect on the design process; theoretically unpack the cross-cultural, studio-based collaboration that took place; and discuss the complex challenges that emerged and the meditating role design artefacts played. The insights presented in the article have value for design educators seeking new approaches to designing and delivering studio-based design learning that fosters creative, multidisciplinary communities of practice and collaborative capacity-building for design students in a professional setting.

AB  - It is vital for the art education field to continue defining and redefining its multimodal versatility and malleability in the education of children in this ever-changing organic culture. Marshall (2014) called for art integration to be framed as a transdisciplinary paradigm to meet the current needs of education. This article provides a framework of employing contemporary puppetry as a powerful narrative and transdisciplinary tool in K-12 and adult educational settings. The hybrid nature of puppetry provides many opportunities for the merging of various disciplines, learning styles, and technologies to create contemporary comprehensive learning experiences. In addition, puppetry is a natural bridge to play, imagination, experimentation, storytelling, and collaboration. Puppetry provides multifaceted pedagogical/learning opportunities for (1) narrative pedagogy (Romanski, 2015; Rolling, 2010, 2012; Zander, 2007), (2) transdisciplinary and substantive arts integration (Marshall, 2006, 2014), and (3) a conceptual approach with contemporary art and curriculum built on enduring ideas (Stewart & Walker, 2005). In this article, the author describes a course in which shadow puppetry is investigated and its potential for transformative curriculum approaches is considered, specifically in elementary settings.

AB  - In 2014, the Finnish National Board of Education launched a new core curriculum with the aim of meeting the skills and competence requirements of the 21st century. The purpose of this case study was to find out what transversal competencies Finnish eighth graders developed and how they experienced studying in a problem-based transdisciplinary course, which was arranged for the transitional stage between the former and the new curriculum. The qualitative data consisted of questionnaires and interviews. The analysis followed the methods of qualitative content analysis. When asked about their learning, the students commented on not having learnt much, referring to the discipline-based knowledge. Instead, they had learnt skills through teamwork, problem solving, and expression of their views and opinions, an aspect that they did not clearly connect with the things to be learnt at school. Many students felt that they acquired the competencies that they would need later in their lives. The students' teamwork had a crucial impact on their learning experience. The timeframe for the integrative approach needs careful consideration; the learning process in this course was perceived as being successful because it was long enough. Our study highlights that focusing on students' views is critical when reforming curriculum.

AB  - Contextualized in the critical pedagogies of universal design for learning (UDL) and social justice education, our study aimed to equip teacher candidates (TCs) to provide students with equitable access to learning social studies content knowledge, skills, and processes as a way to equally empower all students to be civically engaged, and thus to disrupt the social reproduction of empowering privileged students and disempowering marginalized ones in the public schools. An earlier study indicated that our TCs did not transfer or generalize the UDL framework from foundation courses to subsequent classes or in practice. This case study describes how and in what ways elementary education faculty used a transdisciplinary approach, integrating the UDL framework taught in the foundation's course into a social studies methods course to facilitate TCs' continued learning and application of theory into practice. The results of this case study suggest that TCs that TCs had not yet internalized the UDL framework or critical consciousness and that these must be intentionally transferred and generalized to new coursework by the faculty on a consistent, ongoing basis.

AB  - Complex global challenges and declining scientific literacy demand novel approaches to engaging students with science and the natural world. While evidence supports integrating creative and scientific modes of inquiry, these approaches are often separated in undergraduate education. We designed Ecology Through the Writer's Lens (ETWL) to allow students to explore an ecosystem of critical importance, the tall grass prairie, through an interdisciplinary field experience. Co-taught by Biology and English professors and open to students of all majors, ETWL leverages classroom activities to prepare for and process the immersive field experience over the course of one semester. Field-based exercises include natural history observations, hypothesis building, experimental design, analysis of the literature, and creative/reflective writing. Learning was assessed through multiple assignments, including a final creative project that spanned diverse writing genres. Students met and exceeded expectations with respect to course objectives. Non-science majors learned how scientific knowledge is generated; science majors learned how creative approaches can open new pathways for exploration. Many students overcame fear of natural spaces. Several students independently engaged with tall grass prairie in post-course activities. We conclude that interdisciplinary approaches to field-based inquiry can generate transformative experiences, even when the immersive component is short-term and close to home. ETWL provides one model by which different modes of inquiry can be blended to enhance student appreciation of science, literature, and the environment.

AB  - The availability of corpora has greatly strengthened the possibilities of identifying high-frequency lexical items in a more systematic and objective manner than has typically been used for vocabulary instruction. This article adopts a corpus-based approach to accommodate the vocabulary instructional needs of students enrolled in university reading support courses. The adopted model identifies high-frequency interdisciplinary academic vocabulary and their functions in authentic academic language with the support of the Word and Phrase Tool (WPT). Considering academic vocabulary to be an interrelated feature of academic language, as opposed to a series of isolated items, the instructional model shows how the use of this tool, in connection with a well-designed selection process, can advance the capabilities of instructors while doing justice to the dual necessities of depth and brevity.

AB  - This paper describes an interdisciplinary effort involving faculty from five different disciplines who came together to develop an interdisciplinary, open, general education cybersecurity course. The course, Cybersecurity, Technology, and Society, brings together ideas from interdisciplinary studies, information technology, engineering, business, computer science, criminal justice, and philosophy to provide students an interdisciplinary introduction to cybersecurity. We provide an overview of the rationale for the course, the process the authors went through developing the course, a summary of the course modules, details about the open education resources used as readings, and the types of assignments included in the class. We conclude by offering recommendations for others developing similar courses.

AB  - Purpose: Despite the potential for research institutes to advance interdisciplinary research on university campuses, There have been few studies on how interdisciplinary research centres integrate multiple disciplines in practice, how they influence the collaborative behaviours of scientists and how they establish collaborative communities. This study aims to provide a deeper understanding of how interdisciplinary research is being enabled at research institutes and offers signposts for how research institutes can further embed interdisciplinarity within their units. Design/methodology/approach: Within this study, 30 interviews were conducted with leadership and faculty within 4 sustainability research institutes in the USA exploring how research institutes support interdisciplinary research within their units. A thematic analysis on the interview data revealed themes on how research institutes are enabling interdisciplinary research within their organisations and universities. Findings: The study highlights eight themes on how research institutes are, and can further, enable interdisciplinary research within their organisations and universities. Some of the themes are fully implemented within the research institutes, whilst others are more aspirational and highlight where institutes can create additional capability and capacity for interdisciplinary research within their units and universities. Research limitations/implications: Whilst the study is limited to four major sustainability research institutes the findings will be applicable to all research centres and institutes attempting to create interdisciplinary research environments. Practical implications: The study will be of particular interest to research institutes and university leadership who wish to cultivate a deeper culture of interdisciplinary research within their organisations. Social implications: The advancement of inter- and transdisciplinary research within universities are seen by many academic institutions, expert groups and funding bodies as essential for solving wicked problems and grand challenges facing society. The findings of this paper will help universities increase their capacity for interdisciplinary research. Originality/value: There are few comparable publications in terms of methodology, approach and focus on research institutes.

AB  - Whether the current post-16 qualifications system in the UK is fit for purpose has long been under discussion, with many calling for a broader, more interdisciplinary approach to preparation for university. This paper examines the relationship between post-16 (A-level) qualifications and degree success for students on the University of Exeter's innovative Natural Sciences programme, with particular emphasis on whether it is possible to be successful at degree level in subjects not studied at A-level. Maths was found to be the best predictor of success in interdisciplinary science and no one science was found to be more important than the others for preparing students for the bespoke interdisciplinary first year of the degree programme. The data also demonstrates that these students can be successful in later years in subjects not studied at A-level which they would otherwise have been prohibited from studying at university through their lack of core entry requirements. We acknowledge the unique nature of the cohort under analysis and the fact they self-select for this type of programme, but discuss how the study provokes questions and debate about pre-university qualification requirements and the way we structure our school and university curricula to maximise the opportunities for the next generation of STEM graduates.

AB  - With increasing rates of globalization, understanding the cultural factors that promote positive adaptation in migrant children and adolescents is vital. In prior research, acculturation and enculturation frameworks often rely on unidimensional or bidimensional conceptions of culture to study the effects of migration on child and adolescent development. However, the contemporary strategies that migrant children and adolescents utilize to navigate multicultural contexts remain undertheorized. Therefore, we advance an interdisciplinary framework that describes the factors and processes that affect migrant child and adolescent development across four contexts: global, macrosystem, microsystem, and the individual level. Additionally, conceptualizations of cultural adaptation are broadened in our framework by examining the intersections of community cultural wealth, cultural preservation, and cultural restoration. We highlight the importance of prioritizing the culture and experiential knowledge of migrant children and adolescents in the development of policy, research, and practice, to support their positive adaptation in a globalized society.

AB  - In the contemporary workplace, data scientists who are capable of interdisciplinary collaboration are in high demand. Universities need to provide data science students with a plethora of learning opportunities that involve collaboration in interdisciplinary contexts and engagement with industry partners. Curtin University and Lab Tests Online Australasia (LTO[superscript AU]) collaborated to provide an interdisciplinary, industry-focused learning experience for data science students. Upon completing the project, students reported improved understanding of the range of applications for data science skills. The experience delivered opportunities for greater self-awareness and highlighted the importance of teamwork, decision-making and leadership skills. This chapter presents Interdisciplinary Project-based Work-Integrated Learning (IPjWIL), an educational approach that equips data science students with the necessary skills to navigate the future world of work. The results of the pilot project described demonstrate how interdisciplinary, industry-focused learning experiences enhance the capabilities of data science students, thereby augmenting employability.

AB  - Students need feedback from instructors to learn from their mistakes and improve their academic skills. Responding to student writing is a central and necessary component of the instructor-student feedback loop. There are many forms of feedback on written assignments, and not all of them have the same role in supporting student learning. For example, as for written feedback, one primary distinction is between comments made in the margins and comments at the end of the written work. Work has focused on practices of instructor feedback among instructors, and other studies have focused on practices of feedback within a single discipline. Although there have been many studies on the topic of instructor feedback, no studies were found that explored possible differences of feedback across disciplines. The purpose of the study described here was to explore what instructors consider to be the purpose(s)/value of writing feedback (whether it is in the margins or at the end) on written assignments, as well as how instructors from different disciplines conceive of using comments in the margins and end of essays/written work, that is, whether or not they would conceive of them differently, and therefore provide different feedback, according to discipline. Nearly half of the instructors valued the use of written feedback on written assignments as fostering future improvements. In contrast, when analyzing responses across disciplines, identifying specific errors seemed to be more important in making comments in the margins. Further analysis and recommendations are provided.

AB  - Is the reductionist approach to teaching chemical principles in the laboratory adequate for students to make effective evaluations? In this work, using the example of sunscreens, students first assessed the analytical chemistry parameters of the active ingredients, later comparing and contrasting them with organic chemistry information for effective practical chemical evaluation in the laboratory. Students evaluated three commercially available brands of sunscreens by a simple, two component experiment analyzing five SPF values with UV spectroscopy using the Beer-Lambert Law to rate the most efficient sunscreen by analytical determination. To explain the differences in degree of photoprotection for sunscreens with the same SPF values in the three brands, students connected the values of molar absorption constant from Beer-Lambert Law for the UV absorbing active ingredients to their organic chemical structures and composition correlating the concentration and application amount with health and regulatory policy, protection performance, and product price. Responses from survey questions asked after students had completed the laboratory experiment and reviewed the molecular structures and regulatory information indicated that the complementary organic and the interdisciplinary regulatory information accompanying the experimental analysis and characterization positively informed and influenced their chemical evaluation.

AB  - This report presents a review of study abroad research conducted from an ecological perspective (Kramsch, 2003; Leather & van Dam, 2003; van Lier, 2004) and identifies areas of inquiry that are lacking compared to second language acquisition and other fields (i.e., linguistics, psychology). It identifies value-based views as a high-priority area of interest and draws on frameworks in other fields to outline how language learning research could effectively describe the moral ecology of study abroad for language learning.

AB  - Interdisciplinary approach is viewed as the best way to learn about and perceive complex scientific phenomena in the real world; therefore, students need to develop interdisciplinary habits of mind in K-12 science education. This article provided a framework for understanding middle school students' interdisciplinary competence that included four dimensions, each with three performance levels. Science educators have claimed that the current assessment system is still oriented towards single discipline-based science learning. Therefore, this study presented a validated instrument based on our multidimensional construct to explore students' interdisciplinary competence. The participants in this study were 385 9th graders in Henan Province in China. Multidimensional Rasch analysis suggested that this measure had satisfactory reliability and validity. All the students demonstrated the basic level of ability for each dimension. More competent science learners were found to achieve higher ability levels. In addition, students with different scientific proficiencies underperformed in different dimensions. Implications and suggestions for interdisciplinary science teaching and assessment were also discussed.

AB  - An authentic, interdisciplinary, research and problem-based integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) project may be ideal for encouraging scientific inquiry and developing teamwork among undergraduate students, but it also presents challenges. The authors describe how two interdisciplinary teams (n=6) of undergraduate college students built integrated STEM projects in a research based internship setting, and then collaboratively brought the project to fruition to include designing lessons and activities shared with K-12 students in a classroom setting. Each three person undergraduate team consisted of two STEM majors and one Education major. The Education majors are a special focus for this study. Interviews, field observations, and lesson plan artifacts collected from the undergraduate college students were analyzed according to authenticity factors, the authentic scientific inquiry instrument, and an integrated STEM instrument. The authors highlight areas of strength and weakness for both teams and explore how preservice teachers contributed to integrated STEM products and lessons. Teacher educators might apply recommendations for teacher preparation and professional development when facilitating authentic scientific inquiry and integrated STEM topics with both STEM and non-STEM educators. Undergraduate college students were challenged to fully integrate the STEM disciplines, transitions between them, and the spaces between them where multiple disciplines existed. By describing the challenges of integrating the spaces between STEM, the authors offer a description of the undergraduate college students' experiences in an effort to expand the common message beyond a flat approach of try this activity because it works, to a more robust message of try this type of engagement and purposefully organize for maximum results.

AB  - The University Without Walls experiment on the University of Massachusetts, Amherst campus, began in 1971. The central animating concepts of the original experiment include the value of knowledge that is learned both within and without 'the walls' of the university. These various knowledge sources are integrated into the student's individualized plan of study within an interdisciplinary analytic framework. This approach is described here as integrative interdisciplinary studies and its on-going strength as an approach to adult learning is in the synergy of these approaches. An integrative interdisciplinary approach supports transformative learning within a context-specific understanding of knowledge.

AB  - Remote teaching can be both challenging and motivating. Professors and lecturers have developed innovative strategies to improve students' education and engage students in synchronous and asynchronous classes. In this Illuminations paper, we describe BodyWorks, online tools to support courses in physiology, motor control, and biomechanics. The tools are interactive and easy to use, have low computer and internet demands, and can be used in many conditions and topics of study. All resources are freely available online in three different languages. We hope our initiative can help professors and students worldwide promote more interactive and engaging motor control and related topics classes for both synchronous and asynchronous formats.

AB  - Music cannot be separated from its historical, geographical, and cultural context; therefore, it is important that students be taught music from a variety of genres, cultures, and historical periods relevant to the music to which they are introduced. In this article, I introduce an interdisciplinary approach through contextualization of the content of music, using it to lead to the study of related works in various disciplines. Using a song inspired by Indonesia's Solo River, a lesson sample demonstrates teaching strategies that motivate students to engage in integrative thinking. By exploring music's connection with relevant subjects to teach about the natural environment, this contextualized lesson presents a global learning experience to broaden students' knowledge of the world. Contextualizing the content of Bengawan Solo illustrates how history and culture shaped the song and demonstrates how this work can be used as a springboard for students' exploration of its history, geography, and ecology.

AB  - This article explores how a university-wide, short-term mobility, work-integrated learning (WIL) program at an Australian university developed students' interdisciplinary, adaptability and interdependence skills. We chose a case study methodology with a mixed methods approach to answer a key research question to better design online, short-term mobility programs. Data was collected from students who participated in a short-term mobility program through pre- and post-experience online surveys, and recorded focus group interviews. We utilise the findings from this study to provide specific recommendations to support online, short-term mobility practice, curriculum design and delivery. This study contributes to mobility, internationalisation of the curriculum and interdisciplinary education research fields for higher education.

AB  - Ranking of scholarly journals is important to many parties. Studying the relationships among various ranking metrics is key to understanding the significance of one metric based on another. This research investigates the relationship among four major journal-ranking indicators: the impact factor (IF), the Eigenfactor score (ES), the "h." -index (hI), and SCImago Journal Rank (SJR). The authors used 519 journals from a diverse range of subjects and executed a correlation analysis. The results show that a higher correlation exists between impact factor and SCImago Journal Rank (0.796). However, a very strong positive correlation between two metrics does not necessarily imply that journals are ranked according to the same pattern.

AB  - To what extent, and why, do social science undergraduates experience anxiety about taking statistics courses? Despite holding assumptions of rampant statistics anxiety among students, sociologists have conducted few empirical studies of this issue. We extend the literature by analyzing data from a survey of sociology, social work, and criminal justice students enrolled in seven sections of our department's Social Statistics with Computer Applications course in the winter 2018 semester. Two thirds of respondents are anxious or very anxious about taking the course. They experience statistics anxiety primarily due to their lack of confidence in their ability to succeed in the course and their more general test-taking anxiety. This article offers a framework for instructors of social statistics courses to measure student anxiety and to address it in class in a way that aims to alleviate anxiety among the anxious while not alienating those who are comfortable in the course.

AB  - Today, multidisciplinary cooperation is an important objective of higher vocational education in Europe as well as other countries. The aim of this study was to explore how, and to what extent, fourth year bachelor students from different domains cooperate in multidisciplinary teams at two research centers. Data for 71 students were collected with a semi-structured questionnaire, followed by focus group discussions in 14 groups. Results indicated that students accomplished multidisciplinary cooperation to varying degrees, depending on differences in disciplinary program backgrounds, student characteristics, the research center, the thematic group they belonged to, and the quality of the 'graduation research assignment.' For example, students experienced pressure from their training college to conduct their research autonomously, and this affected the degree to which the goal of multidisciplinary cooperation was reached during the final assignment before graduation. The results of this study were useful for improvement of the professional learning environment in which training colleges and research centers cooperate.

AB  - This design case covers a graduate course in educational software design that focuses on semester-long projects in response to client requests. The course was intended to address the need for professionals across disciplines, such as instructional design, computer science, and human-computer interaction design, to usefully collaborate on educational software projects. The ability to work on a multi-disciplinary team was fostered in several ways: through recruiting students across multiple majors; providing readings and student presentation topics related to language, processes, and techniques used by each discipline; and by scaffolding the work of multi-disciplinary student groups in a major semester-long project.

AB  - The Garden Team at Washington State University is a transdisciplinary, geographically dispersed group of faculty and staff. As with many such teams, member retention requires effort, as busy individuals may not see the overall benefits of active team membership. Ripple effect mapping is a strategy that can illustrate the tangible and often unexpected results of virtual team efforts. Not only are the data-rich results useful to individuals during their annual reporting activities, they also serve to strengthen collegial ties and enhance esprit de corps.

AB  - This article explores the use and usefulness of carefully designed transdisciplinary pedagogical templates (TPTs) aligned to different learning theories. The TPTs are based on the Learning Design Framework outlined in the Larnaca Declaration (Dalziel et al. in this collection). The generation of pedagogical plans or templates is not new. However, the creation and sharing of web-based pedagogical templates is underpinned by a re-use philosophy and the notion that such material can be adopted or adapted for various purposes by learning designers and developers. This article will exemplify the importance of pedagogical clarity by showcasing how different teacher and learner roles are instantiated in different TPTs that subscribe to behaviourist, cognitivist, or social learning theories. A key goal is to demonstrate that the TPTs constructed based on the Learning Design Framework (LD-F) introduced in the Larnaca Declaration, are easy to be re-used or modified to suit specific learning situations and contexts.

AB  - The extent to which predatory journals can harm scientific practice increases as the numbers of such journals expand, in so far as they undermine scientific integrity, quality, and credibility, especially if those journals leak into prestigious databases. Journal Citation Reports (JCRs), a reference for the assessment of researchers and for grant-making decisions, is used as a standard whitelist, in so far as the selectivity of a JCR-indexed journal adds a legitimacy of sorts to the articles that the journal publishes. The Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI) once included on Beall's list of potential, possible or probable predatory scholarly open-access publishers, had 53 journals ranked in the 2018 JCRs annual report. These journals are analysed, not only to contrast the formal criteria for the identification of predatory journals, but taking a step further, their background is also analysed with regard to self-citations and the source of those self-citations in 2018 and 2019. The results showed that the self-citation rates increased and was very much higher than those of the leading journals in the JCR category. Besides, an increasingly high rate of citations from other MDPI-journals was observed. The formal criteria together with the analysis of the citation patterns of the 53 journals under analysis all singled them out as predatory journals. Hence, specific recommendations are given to researchers, educational institutions and prestigious databases advising them to review their working relations with those sorts of journals.

AB  - Many universities offer some version of centrally offered professional development opportunities for graduate students seeking academic careers. Less is known about what impact these programs have on student career preparation and success and which design elements are most beneficial to each learner (Diggs et al., 2017; Schram et al., 2017). This article reports on a mixed methods decadal review (2011-2021) of one large, research-intensive institution's multidisciplinary cohort-based year-long program, Preparing for Academic Careers, for graduate students near the end of their doctoral or master's of fine arts (MFA) degree. Results from a systematic employment status search using publicly available records (Google and LinkedIn) indicate that a higher percentage of participants are employed in academic positions than national trends. Results from the analyses of closed and open-ended questions from an alumni survey suggest a range of perceived benefits: an increased sense of belonging in the academy, comfort talking to others about their work, confidence as an instructor, and interest in cross-disciplinary work. These findings will inform others seeking to design and implement academic career preparation programs that aim to provide student-level support in an inclusive and multidisciplinary environment.

AB  - The history of education is, and can be, many things. In this article, I argue that the history of education in the Nordic countries is marked by three phases, based on its institutional setting. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the history of education was written by schoolmen for schoolmen. In the post-war era, the discipline of education took increasing responsibility for the field. Since the 1980s, it has been a multidisciplinary research field based on the disciplines of education and history where history of education was combined with research in history education, sociology of education, child studies and educational policy. While the development of the history of education varied across the Nordics, this setting proved to be fertile. In terms of active researchers, output and coordination, the Nordic history of education clearly stands stronger now than it did 20 years ago.

AB  - Interdisciplinary collaborations between different academic disciplines can create knowledge and solutions to challenges that are beyond the scope of what a single discipline can achieve. However, little is known about how interdisciplinary teams of faculty and graduate students function as a whole and the processes that guide them as they work on collaborative tasks. Using Activity Theory, this qualitative study analyzed team meeting transcripts to examine interdisciplinary team interactions involving Science/Engineering and Science Education graduate students and faculty members as they co-developed laboratory activities for a grant-funded project. Several factors contributed to the team's success: shared goals (Object), environment (Community), and clear Division of Labor. Differences (contradictions) were found in the Tools, Rules, and Division of Labor; the PI and Science/Engineering graduate students tended to focus on the needed lab materials, and the Science Education members focused more on educational standards and teachers' ideas in the lab development (Tools). The PI and Science Education members set and enforced the team meeting agendas and deadlines (Rules). The Science/Engineering grad students focused on practical considerations to ensure the labs could successfully be implemented in a class setting (Rules) and were assigned the most tasks to complete (Division of Labor). The findings provide insight into the nature of interdisciplinary team dynamics between a Science/Engineering and Education grant team. The findings also suggest the importance of shared goals (Object), community development (Rules: Team Building), and the potential of capitalizing on different strengths and knowledge (contradictions) in an interdisciplinary team.

AB  - Past research has often shown a lack of student output in English medium instruction (EMI) classes (e.g., An et al., 2021; Lo & Macaro, 2012) and this study seeks to identify possible reasons. Guided by literature on wait time (Rowe, 1986) and teacher higher-order thinking questions (Chin, 2007), this study explores whether these two pedagogical moves have the same impact on classroom interaction in EMI science classes. 30 EMI science lessons were recorded from seven EMI high school programs in China, taught by 15 native speakers of English to homogenous groups of Chinese students. Correlation tests showed that when there was more wait time after a teacher question, the students produced lengthier responses with more linguistic complexity, took up more talk time, and asked more questions. However, greater use of teacher higher-order thinking questions, coded by Chin's (2007) framework of constructivist questions, did not correlate with any student output measures. This suggests that wait time may be a more effective factor leading to more student output in EMI classes than asking higher-order thinking questions. Qualitative analysis showed teachers' follow-up moves may have also played a role in the limited success of higher-order thinking questions.

AB  - Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) represent an economical and practical way for institutions to equitably offer research experiences to large numbers of students. Although the benefits of CUREs are well documented, most CURE models are not guided by theory and are discipline specific, which limits their application. We used a community of practice framework to develop an interdisciplinary, authentic CURE course (Science Bootcamp) for first-year STEM majors. We describe the details of Science Bootcamp, then present assessment data verifying that the course includes key CURE design features (opportunities for collaboration, discovery/relevance, iteration) and successfully establishes a community of practice. Students who participated in Science Bootcamp reported psychosocial gains (e.g., increased belonging and science self-efficacy) from pre-CURE to post-CURE, a pattern distinct from a comparison group. Psychosocial gains, in turn, were positively associated with students' intention to remain in STEM. We also found that each CURE course design feature was related to at least one psychosocial outcome. Our authentic, interdisciplinary CURE model is flexible, scalable, and economical, making it feasible for institutions to integrate this approach into their own undergraduate-based research initiatives.

AB  - Interdisciplinary teaching and learning is an approach that synthesizes the curricular objectives and methods of two or more disciplines or subjects focusing on a specific topic or issue. While it is being increasingly implemented in universities, at lower levels of education there are still countries where science subjects are taught and learned fragmentarily. To assess the significance of the interdisciplinary approach in primary school biology teaching, the paper aims at an experimental verification of the effectiveness of this method in relation to the quality and retention of student knowledge, compared to the monodisciplinary approach to teaching and learning biology. The paper also describes a scenario for teaching a topic in which biological and geographical contents correlate. The study applied a pedagogical experiment with parallel groups. In total, 180 students attending two primary schools in the city of Novi Sad participated in the experiment and were divided into an experimental and a control group. The findings suggest that the interdisciplinary approach improved the quality and retention of student knowledge. The experimental group was more successful in completing tasks that required comprehension and practical application of knowledge. The study thus emphasizes the need for a professional curriculum development that would enhance the interdisciplinary correlation of various disciplines.

AB  - This article presents the psychometric properties of the evidence-based practice (EBP) instrument (School Version), a new interdisciplinary measure for understanding and measuring EBP use that can be understood and used across the three professions who provide the most mental health services in schools. The instrument was developed based on theory, review of the literature, expert review (N = 12), pilot study (N = 20), and national study (N = 303). While the measure may have applicability for other groups of mental health providers in other settings, this study focused on the perspectives of mental health providers in schools, specifically school psychologists, school counselors, and social workers. Initial psychometric examination resulted in a 13-item, one factor model and indicated preliminary evidence for strong validity and internal reliability. No significant difference in total score among groups of mental health professionals was found, suggesting similarities of comprehension and application of EBP regardless of professional discipline. This instrument is the only one of its kind and provides a helpful first step towards common language and common goals when conceptualizing what it means for mental health providers to use best practice. Implications for school professionals and future research are offered.

AB  - The interdisciplinary nature of food makes it an effective teaching vehicle in many fields. This article shows specifically how flavor and food fermentation, two topics not usually featured in the undergraduate STEM curriculum, can inspire a powerful interdisciplinary learning experience. Importantly, because of their accessible nature and relatively unexplored status in current research, these two topics are also uniquely attractive as authentic research experiences for students from diverse backgrounds. Focusing on these topics, the author designed and executed a student-centered science course. The course is unusual from other Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) in being highly inquiry-driven and discovery-based, with students independently defining their research topics. By emphasizing curiosity, creativity, and practicing how to generate "good" research questions, the course fills a gap in the traditional undergraduate research experience and curriculum. The findings of the article are based on hundreds of enrolled students from five course offerings. It shows that the course promotes student engagement and curiosity, as well as gains in conceptual learning and in self-reported learning of concepts and science skills. Further, students report valuing the hands-on and inquiry-based format for improving their learning, engagement, and sense of curiosity about the material.

AB  - Although faculties are more diverse, decentralized, and increasingly isolated in technology-supported modern universities, effective technology use can also foster faculty professional academic development and collegiality. This scoping literature review applied Cooper's systemic review model and a categorical content analysis technique targeting decentralized collaborative research teams in higher education. Findings indicate technology supports formal and informal university and nonuniversity networks, as well as various collaborative research structures; all contributing to professional academic development. Shared attributes of successful collaborative online teams include a sense of social presence, accountability, institutional and team leadership. Collaborative teams are integral to research and allow more faculty members to contribute and benefit from professional academic development through scholarship. Collaborative team research should be investigated further to understand and promote cross-discipline and cultural collaboration potential for research and professional academic development possibilities with special attention given to opportunities for women, online, and adjunct faculty.

AB  - The term "interdisciplinary" is an increasingly popular buzzword within higher education, yet varying interpretations of what constitutes interdisciplinary learning can dilute its meaning and potency. The Integrative Studies program at Kennesaw State University has participated in this dilution by offering an Integrative Studies degree that closely resembles a general studies, degree-completion curriculum. This article focuses on the first step of curricular overhaul, as I document the process of transitioning an introductory course from a general studies to an interdisciplinary studies approach to learning, including a discussion of qualitative data from students on how the course (post-intervention) now helps develop their interdisciplinary thinking skills.

AB  - Background: Societal challenges that call for a new type of engineer suggest the need for the implementation of interdisciplinary engineering education (IEE). The aim of IEE is to train engineering students to bring together expertise from different disciplines in a single context. This review synthesizes IEE research with a focus on characterizing vision, teaching practices, and support. Purpose: We aim to show how IEE is conceptualized, implemented, and facilitated in higher engineering education at the levels of curricula and courses. This aim leads to two research questions:What aspects of vision, teaching, and support have emerged as topics of interest in empirical studies of IEE?What points of attention regarding vision, teaching, and support can be identified in empirical studies of IEE as supporting or challenging IEE? Scope/Method: Ninety-nine studies published between 2005 and 2016 were included in a qualitative analysis across studies. The procedure included formulation of research questions, searching and screening of studies according to inclusion/exclusion criteria, description of study characteristics, appraisal, and synthesis of results. Conclusions: Challenges exist for identifying clear learning goals and assessments for interdisciplinary education in engineering (vision). Most pedagogy for interdisciplinary learning is designed to promote collaborative teamwork requiring organization and team management. Our review suggests that developing interdisciplinary skills, knowledge, and values needs sound pedagogy and teaming experiences that provide students with authentic ways of engaging in interdisciplinary practice (teaching). Furthermore, there is a limited understanding of what resources hinder the development of engineering programs designed to support interdisciplinarity (support).

AB  - This article presents the conceptual underpinnings of a homelessness intervention program, accompanied by a social work course, that provide direct services and cause advocacy with and on behalf of people experiencing homelessness. A program goal is to educate students in social work, medicine, law, pharmacy, public health, and nursing?about systemic causes and human consequences of homelessness, while teaching students skills for providing trauma informed care while simultaneously pursuing mezzo and macro-level systems change. The program's and course's evolution and efforts to collect evaluation data are described. In detailing the iterative process that spawned the still evolving program and course, the article illuminates person-centered ways to teach about homelessness, social work practice, interprofessional teamwork, humility, flexibility, and persistence.

AB  - This study examines whether human-centered design may be a useful approach for training interdisciplinary teams to innovatively address homelessness. This case study examines the implementation of a 10-week graduate seminar in which students worked with youths experiencing homelessness to develop solutions to building social connections. The study explored benefits to students and to the community partner using pre- and postcourse surveys, focus groups, journals, and field observations. Findings reveal changes in student knowledge and attitudes related to homelessness, interdisciplinary work, and personal citizenship. Community members indicated the course created opportunities for their voices to be heard in developing human-centered solutions. The article concludes with a description of the challenges experienced during the course and approaches for overcoming these challenges.

AB  - Although the existence of and access to clean water are essential for sustaining life on Earth, multiple studies have demonstrated students' nascent understanding of basic water principles. Students have misconceptions related to the water cycle (Ben-zvi-Assarf and Orion 2005), groundwater (Dickerson and Dawkins 2004; Covitt et al. 2009), and the effects of pollution (Bingol 2017). Regardless of the number of science classes taken, students' knowledge of water remains stagnant, with misconceptions becoming more prevalent over time (Brody 1993). The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) address the need for students to develop a depth and breadth of understanding of water, specifically within the high school Earth Science domain on the intersections of Earth and human activity (National Research Council 2012). The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer a blueprint for addressing enduring global challenges by 2030. The SDGs are grounded in global consensus and set targets to be reached by all countries. In this interdisciplinary Project-Based Inquiry (PBI) Global (Spires et al. 2019), students engage in collaborative inquiry across multiple academic disciplines around SDG 6 ("ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all") (United Nations General Assembly 2015). Through their inquiry, students create multimodal learning products to share their research findings with a broader audience and take social action to address global water and sanitation challenges.

AB  - Building content knowledge alongside the task of increasing literacy skills has become a goal for many elementary classrooms. Selecting and implementing texts for the literacy block that both increase content knowledge and develop students' literacy skills alongside increasing motivation for reading is a daunting task. The authors share a strategic approach for selecting texts called the quad text set framework. This framework involves first selecting a target text, which is a challenging content-related text, and then selecting easier texts, including visuals, to build background knowledge and a hook text to garner interest in the topic. The teacher then decides how to implement the texts to best support students' content learning. The authors describe considerations for selecting and ordering texts for interdisciplinary units to maximize content learning and literacy and provide examples of how to implement quad text sets related to math, science, and social studies.

AB  - Reviews of literature are conducted within academia to summarize and highlight gaps in findings and research approaches associated with a particular line of inquiry. Identifying sources to be included in reviews in rigorous ways can be challenging for interdisciplinary research topics, as relevant articles may be found in a wide variety of sources. Guidelines on conducting reviews rarely include step-by-step methods of identifying articles. Thus, this research note extends an existing scoping review framework by adding a more systematic method of manual searching to the common database search. As demonstrated through the application, one single rigours method of source identification is not sufficient for identifying articles in an interdisciplinary line of inquiry. The described systematic manual search presents a "complementary" method to the database search, rather than as a supplementary method to assists researchers in their searches of interdisciplinary topics.

AB  - A desired outcome of education reform efforts is for undergraduates to effectively integrate knowledge across disciplines in order to evaluate and address real-world issues. Yet there are few assessments designed to measure if and how students think interdisciplinarily. Here, a sample of science faculty were surveyed to understand how they currently assess students' interdisciplinary science understanding. Results indicate that individual writing-intensive activities are the most frequently used assessment type (69%). To understand how writing assignments can accurately assess students' ability to think interdisciplinarily, we used a preexisting rubric, designed to measure social science students' interdisciplinary understanding, to assess writing assignments from 71 undergraduate science students. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 25 of those students to explore similarities and differences between assignment scores and verbal understanding of interdisciplinary science. Results suggest that certain constructs of the instrument did not fully capture this competency for our population, but instead, an interdisciplinary framework may be a better model to guide assessment development of interdisciplinary science. These data suggest that a new instrument designed through the lens of this model could more accurately characterize interdisciplinary science understanding for undergraduate students.

AB  - In this field report from a STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) study abroad programme, the author describes how students came to see collaboration -- a key component of arts practice -- as a buzzword, rather than a set of specific, tested, vital practices productive to a wide range of situations. The author argues that the arts have much to offer as a 'mobile critical paradigm' (Gallagher, Kathleen, and Barry Freedman, eds. 2016. "In Defence of Theatre: Aesthetic Practices and Social Interventions." Toronto: University of Toronto Press), particularly in interdisciplinary situations, but only if educators are exacting and purposeful as they define and employ collaboration as one of the arts' most enduring lessons.

AB  - In times of rapid technological innovation and global challenges, the development of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) competencies becomes important. They improve the personal scientific literacy of citizens, enhance international economic competitiveness and are an essential foundation for responsible citizenship, including the ethical custodianship of our planet. The latest programme for international student assessment results, however, indicate that even in economically mature countries such as those in Europe, and the USA and Australia, approximately 20% of students lack sufficient skills in mathematics or science. This trend serves to highlight the urgent need for action in relation to STEM education. While it is widely acknowledged that mathematics underpins all other STEM disciplines, there is clear evidence it plays an understated role in integrated STEM education. In this article, we address an element of this concern by examining the role of mathematics within STEM education and how it might be advanced through three interdisciplinary approaches: (1) twenty-first century skills; (2) mathematical modelling; and (3) education for responsible citizenship. At the end of the paper we discuss the potential for research in relation to these three aspects and point to what work needs to be done in the future.

AB  - We presented one new coach's development during a K-12 STEM integration initiative in order to explore how coaches develop professional identities for coaching. Madison, a former mathematics educator, partnered with science teachers for 1 year in order to co-develop and implement STEM curriculum. Transcripts of coaching conversations, written reflection data, assignments from a graduate-level coaching course, and interviews were analyzed using three-phased qualitative methods. Findings suggest that a new coach approximated practice similar to new teachers; relied on existing professional identities when constructing new coaching identities; and the local, global, and institutional affinity groups for STEM coaching both informed and disrupted coaching identity development. The process by which new coaches develop contextually dependent and discipline-specific identities for coaching has implications for the success of STEM coaching efforts.

AB  - With increased focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and STEAM, educators are looking for ways to integrate disciplines. Planning content around a common theme is an avenue for an interdisciplinary approach to teaching and learning in the middle grades. Middle grade educators must find ways to relate content to their students in meaningful ways. Cross-curricular integration of content areas is one way to do that. Providing opportunities for students to explore topics connected across content areas strengthens students' understanding and investigation of real-life applications. Middle-level students require ongoing, concrete, experiential learning in order to develop intellectually (AMLE, 2010) and an integrated curriculum that is more compatible with the way their brains work (Vars, 2001). Over 60 years of studies provide evidence that middle-level students perform better with an interdisciplinary or integrated curriculum than with departmentalized programs (Irvin, 1997). Historically, educators such as John Dewey, Howard Gardener, and Benjamin Bloom have emphasized the value of contextual learning. An integrated curriculum can provide students meaningful opportunities to connect learning in and out of school (Beane, 1997; Vars, 2001). Integration promotes the relevance of classroom learning by making the curriculum more meaningful to students' lives (Hargreaves & Moore, 2000). Implementing interdisciplinary unit planning will encourage teachers to move beyond their content areas and provide opportunities to create curriculum more relevant to adolescents (Stolle & Frambaugh-Kritzer, 2014). When teachers work together on teams to coordinate and integrate instruction, teaching and learning outcomes improve (Mertens & Flowers, 2003). The article examines the Center of Excellence in Middle-level Interdisciplinary Strategies for Teaching (CEMIST) which was established to develop and model state-of-the-art teacher training programs with an emphasis on interdisciplinary curriculum development and implementation at the middle school level. A partnership between CE-MIST, three middle schools, and the Aiken Writing Project resulted in the development of twenty-six Traveling Interdisciplinary Literacy Trunks (TILTs). The trunks' introduction was used as the catalyst to connect planning by teachers with activities for students. Ongoing, year-long professional development sessions built on the theme of interdisciplinary strategies for teaching and allowed grade level teachers focused time to collaborate in horizontal planning teams. The CE-MIST literacy trunks align standards from two or more content areas, are framed by essential questions, and are anchored by writing activities that are connected to learning goals. The trunks' unit plans include activities that allow for active student engagement and are easily adapted for students with different backgrounds and abilities.

AB  - Interdisciplinary learning experiences (i.e., experiences which illuminate learning of, and connections among, multiple disciplines) are essential to building a more robust understanding of the interconnections of multiple systems. Having an interdisciplinary understanding positively influences the ability of learners to contribute to solving wicked problems (e.g., soil degradation, climate change), most of which fall within the realm of agriculture, food, and natural resources (AFNR). Therefore, within AFNR Education, preparing learners via interdisciplinary experiences could empower the next generation of problem solvers. The Curriculum for Agricultural Science Education (CASE) has emerged as a potential method for teaching AFNR and science in an interdisciplinary way. However, research has yet to evaluate the impact of CASE on teachers' intentions to teach science within curricula. In this study, intentions to teach science were compared between CASE-certified and non-CASE-certified educators via a national survey of 212 randomly sampled teachers, 81 of whom were CASE-certified. Within four of the eight courses evaluated, CASE-certified teachers intended to teach more science than non-CASE-certified teachers, while non-CASE-certified teachers intended to teach more science in the remaining four courses. The findings suggest opportunities to enhance the interdisciplinary structure of CASE curriculum and/or explore alternative models for facilitating interdisciplinary learning within AFNR Education.

AB  - After a lulled period there is renewed debate in first-world institutions for increasing interdisciplinary studies and research. The literature has occasionally attempted to capture what "true interdisciplinary work" was and to lure the unbelievers with the use of metaphors, fables, and stories that has led to confusion. As a result, interdisciplinarity is not well understood and the lack of message clarity impacts it's standing within the industry and society in general. This paper purports to overcome marketing communications barriers by: a) defining and positioning the interdisciplinary movement vis-a-vis more traditional approaches; b) explaining what it is and what it is not; c) examining whether interdisciplinarity is on its way of becoming an established discipline; and d) parting with some concluding remarks.

AB  - The application of game-based learning adds play into educational and instructional contexts. Even though there is a lack of standard methodologies or formulaic frameworks to better inform game-based intervention development, there exist scientific and empirical studies that can serve as benchmarks for establishing scientific validity in terms of the efficacy of using games to achieve serious outcomes. The development of these games does not normally follow a specific set of guidelines, which limits replication. There is a need to reflect on such a multidisciplinary process and infuse knowledge from relevant disciplines towards developing a unity of considerations and approaches beyond the disciplinary perspectives. An infused and trans-disciplinary methodological framework could serve as a guideline to inform the development process of a game-based approach. With these perspectives, this paper aims to provide an example of how relevant theories and frameworks can be adopted collectively in order to inform a development process. Based on a digital game intervention aiming to support the delivery of Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) in the UK, this paper reflects on trans-disciplinary considerations, informed by frameworks such as the Four-Dimensional Framework (4DF), the Intervention Mapping (IM) approach, Mechanics Dynamics Aesthetics model (MDA) and Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LM-GM) mapping. IM, when infused with the game design considerations of 4DF, provides a more procedural perspective to game-based intervention development, collectively reflecting a participatory development approach. This subsequently provides the basis upon which other theoretical and methodological frameworks such as the MDA and the LM-GM models can be embedded in order to marry the pedagogical aspects with the entertainment attributes of gameplay. These components, when integrated, may formulate a trans-disciplinary model that can be adopted and adapted by other researchers, designers and developers.

AB  - In this keynote presentation given at the 2016 Association for Interdisciplinary Studies conference, I considered the field of gerontology from a transdisciplinary perspective. Juxtaposing personal narratives with dominant and alternative discourses on issues of aging, later life, and old age, I explored such questions as: Given the multifaceted, diverse and context-dependent nature of aging phenomena, what might be said to be the defining characteristics of the field of gerontology? Is the common claim that gerontology is "fundamentally interdisciplinary" borne out? How are phenomena of aging--and the aging subject--constructed within (and without) the field? What might a transgressive approach to gerontology that embraces the wild and ultimately untamable lived experience of traveling through the life-course look like?

AB  - Multidisciplinary field investigations courses offer exciting alternatives to traditional learning. They offer a more holistic view of Earth and an opportunity for students to experience the relationships between all of the different elements instead of just one individual segment. We designed a multidisciplinary field investigations course for upper division students of the earth sciences. The course provides an opportunity for geology, environmental science, environmental studies, and geography students to collaborate on projects while learning about the interconnections between geology and geography as they shape unique landscapes. We use the field investigations courses that we have taught in the Greater Yellowstone region, Pacific Northwest, and Southwest United States as case studies to demonstrate the advantages of combining disciplines into a single course. We collected voluntary course evaluations from the student participants of these courses to evaluate the course and learn the benefits of field experiences in the geosciences. These data along with faculty experience and observation suggest that a holistic approach in undergraduate field courses broadens student experiences, enhances peer-based and collaborative learning, builds team-working skills, and fosters a curiosity about the natural environment.

AB  - This article discusses a pedagogical and creative approach to designing a mixed-media, live dance performance. By involving undergraduate students in the process, the authors were able to examine the contemporary phenomenon of selfies and the effect of the "online self" and "mediated self" on dance performance. The performance combined the work of dance and digital media design faculty members, self-reflective contributions from students, a music composer, and a costume designer. Even the audience participated, as the students' selfies and images of audience members taken by the dancers early in the performance were then also projected onto a media screen. Some of the choreographed movements were developed by student dancers following journaling and small group explorations of self and identity as seen in the selfies. Postperformance interviews revealed the value of complicating more traditional dance-making practices through role interdependence and of teaching the creative integration of multimedia in performance design.

AB  - A partnership was created between psychologists and computer programmers to develop a computer-based assessment program. Psychometric concerns of accessibility, reliability, and validity were juxtaposed with core development concepts of usability and user-centric design. Phases of development were iterative, with evaluation phases alternating with development phases. The system was evaluated by the team using an accessibility measure, standard usability heuristics, and student questionnaires (n = 131). In its final form, the assessment was satisfactory to students, although many students did not use the provided testing accommodations, and reliability analyses were in the acceptable range. Recommendations include updating and creating common language, standards, heuristics, and measures to develop and evaluate computer-based assessments.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the 2030 SDGs Game as a pedagogical tool for the promotion of interdisciplinary education. Based on the simulation of possible world outcomes for the year 2030, the game induces participants to reflect on the socioeconomic and environmental consequences of actions and facilitate the exploration of the interconnected nature of the Sustainable Development Goals. Design/methodology/approach: Starting with a review of the main benefits and constraints of interdisciplinary learning approaches, this paper discusses how pedagogical attitudes have change over time and suggests the use of the 2030 SDGs Game as a powerful tool for sustainability education. Composed by a set of cards with different projects and goals, the game connects participants to the principles of the Agenda 2030 and is suitable for a wide range of educational settings. In the case study presented in this paper, the game was played by 20 students from five different faculties of the University of Liverpool (UK). Findings: The participatory nature of the game, where players learn through the experience of play, is functional to support the co-creation of knowledge of the "active-learner-centred" approach, and facilitate the development of problem-solving attitudes, soft skills and team-working abilities. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper presents, for the first time, the 2030 SDGs Game as a pedagogical tool for interdisciplinary sustainability education. The game is relatively easy to play and is suitable to be used in a wide range of educational settings.

AB  - Educational research often refers to the subjective values assigned to aspects of education. Theoretical frameworks from the related disciplines of psychology and sociology applied to the context of education aim to better describe why some students are more motivated in school than others to understand differences in academic outcomes. In the current study, we followed an interdisciplinary approach that aimed to integrate psychological views regarding domain-specific value beliefs (i.e., intrinsic, attainment, utility, cost) and sociological views regarding domain-general values of education (i.e., stimulation, comfort, status, behavioral confirmation) and to investigate how they relate to academic success in upper secondary education. In a sample of 3,775 upper secondary school students in Germany, we found evidence that combining the two perspectives had incremental effects when predicting domain-specific achievement and GPA. We discuss how integrating interdisciplinary theoretical perspectives could foster communication between scientific disciplines and benefit future research in the field of motivation.

AB  - The complexity of modern biology poses challenges in fostering interdisciplinary understanding, particularly between practicing scientists and the public. Furthermore, scientists often lack formal training in science communication, despite various motivations to engage the public. The science literacy of the public in the biological sciences can also vary across socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. Leveraging popular culture and informal learning practices to promote active learning offers promising avenues to enhance public understanding of biological systems. Organized sports hold collective recognition across various communities and cultures, serving as a means to bring people together. Notably, the NCAA March Madness event holds widespread national and international popularity, presenting an opportunity to laterally apply this concept to promote science communication within STEM and biology education. An educational social media and web-based contest tool was developed integrating NCAA-inspired brackets with animal biological systems concepts. The tool featured tournament-style matchups based on animal biological systems, interesting animal facts, and a voting system, all housed within a user-friendly interface. To encourage regular user access to the tool, graphic designs were developed for all social media posts to aid in visual recruitment to the voting website. Based on online metrics, the use of social media garnered repeat users across both the public and educators. The latter noted the tool's simplicity and informative content. Application of this social media and web-based bracket contest tool, which leverages informal settings for active learning for use in biology education, can foster science communication to engage audiences, improve comprehension, and promote interdisciplinary biology education.

AB  - This paper outlines the design, development, and implementation of a new Master of Science in Interdisciplinary Medical Sciences (MSc IMS) program at Western University in Canada. The course-based program focuses on interdisciplinary education and experiential learning with a goal to foster students' academic, professional, and personal skill development. The authors discuss the rationale for developing the MSc IMS program, describe the curriculum design process, outline the innovative features in the program, and share the findings from the inaugural cohort on their motivation to enroll in the program. The alignment between the data from the inaugural cohort and the rationale for the program is also highlighted. The paper adopts a narrative approach to detail the process used throughout the design of the program and presents findings from a pre- questionnaire--focusing on the overall needs of students and rationale for their enrollment--administered to the inaugural cohort of the program. This scholarly work informs educators, curriculum designers, and administrators about the importance of interdisciplinary programs in higher education. It is also of significant relevance to departments planning to develop new programs or update existing ones to reflect 21st century teaching and learning approaches.

AB  - Many of today's engineering students are seeking international, intercultural, and interdisciplinary educational opportunities that involve acquiring real-world project experiences while working toward making a difference in communities. Even as university teaching and learning is tied to terms and learning modules and therefore has certain constraints, educational programming should be balanced with lasting contributions to long-term goals of the partners and communities with which they interact. To achieve these goals, Oregon State University's humanitarian engineering program offered a two-part faculty-led study abroad course focusing on technologies and policies to meet household energy needs in rural Guatemala. During a 1-credit background course, a triad of stakeholders worked together to identify and formulate research questions for student-led team projects. These projects supported current and long-term objectives of the partnering researchers, U.S.- and Guatemala-based NGOs, local entrepreneurs, and communities in Guatemala. The research questions were then investigated during a 3-credit summer field course that followed. For the NGO and OSU researchers, these goals included gathering systematic data regarding user perceptions and adoption of the technologies for donor reporting requirements, measuring performance, facilitating co-development of user-driven designs, evaluating new usability protocols, and developing new sensor-based monitoring tools to quantify impact of cooking technologies. For the local manufacturing partner EcoComal, the primary goals involved improving workflow processes, optimizing stove performance, and contributing to manufacturing cookstoves. Communities were also supported through income-generating opportunities and subsidized cookstove distribution. Results showed that through this model both praxis and knowledge were advanced, partner projects and missions were supported, new technologies were commercialized, and data collected contributed to support donor financing and publications. Lessons learned point to the value of long-term partnerships outside of the course itself, the need for attention to fair trade learning and communication, and preparing for flexibility in the field when executing the projects.

AB  - The number of health psychology courses offered in higher education institutions has dramatically increased over the past 30 years. Health psychology courses provide students a unique opportunity to learn about important public health issues and health disparities affecting our society from a biopsychosocial perspective. Prior research indicates that students taking these courses, many of whom are non-biology majors, often report feeling anxious about learning the underlying biological mechanisms that affect health outcomes, particularly as they relate to stress and disease. Therefore, innovative teaching strategies, such as the use of active learning approaches, are needed to promote student confidence and engagement in learning these interdisciplinary models of health. Despite rapid advancements and innovations in health technologies, few health psychology courses have integrated these technologies as a modality of active learning. This article describes the implementation of health technologies (e.g., biosensors, biofeedback equipment, wearable technologies) as an active learning modality and innovative teaching approach to promote student engagement and learning outcomes in an undergraduate health psychology course taught in the U.S. Eighty students from a minority-serving university participated in this pilot course redesign. Student responses to the use of health technologies in their course were very positive. A description of the course curriculum is provided and results from student responses and feedback are presented. Implications and recommendations for implementing these technologies and pedagogies in future health courses are also discussed, including university support for sustaining these high impact teaching practices.

AB  - This study aims to determine the usability of the book 'Five Weeks in a Balloon' authored by Jules Verne, as a context for interdisciplinary teaching of fourth-grade science and social studies courses. As a document review, the book was analyzed based on the Science and Social Studies Curricula/Turkey-2018. The book was associated with all learning areas of the Science Curriculum and five of the seven learning areas of the Social Studies Curriculum. It was determined first the association between the two curricula and the book, then starting points for planning appropriate activities for multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary teaching. As a result, the book can use as a context for fourth-grade science and social studies courses. Also be used in multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary teaching to integrate science and social studies courses. Teachers and researchers can carry out various studies by designing interdisciplinary environments by benefiting from the study results.

AB  - In this article we present research on Slovenian primary school teachers' opinion about the interdisciplinary approach between fine art and science education. With the help of questionnaires, interviews, and analysis of lesson plans, we determined how primary school teachers use this type of interdisciplinary approach, how often and what their views are. We included 138 primary school teachers from every region in Slovenia. It turned out that primary school teachers in Slovenia use an interdisciplinary approach between fine art and science teaching quite often and consider it useful to achieve different aspects of pupils' development. The study revealed that most teachers find it difficult to consider the educational goals of both fields (fine art, science). They often use the connection between the subjects only on an associative level - they only mention the teaching content of one subject quickly and carelessly, without making meaningful connections and without achieving the goals of both subjects. Content taught in this way cannot be considered a cross-curricular approach in the subject sense.

AB  - Because interdisciplinary thinking is critical to address complex issues, we created and evaluated an interdisciplinary team-taught undergraduate course on mental illness using the kaleidoscope approach. After grounding students in biology, psychology and sociology, we aimed to develop students' abilities to think interdisciplinarily and cultivate their appreciation of the importance of integration. We found that guided integration practice enhanced students' interdisciplinary abilities, whereas repeated application of these skills emphasized their importance. Future interdisciplinary courses should intertwine both types of experiences to increase the likelihood students develop integration abilities and choose to apply them to solve complex problems facing our world.

AB  - STEM and computer science (CS) education are some of the most important research topics of the last decade. The idea that CS should be a part of STEM is becoming more and more common. The most important goals of integrating CS into STEM are to develop students' computational thinking (CT) and problem-solving skills. STEM education creates a natural context for integrating CT into learning and teaching processes. However, applied studies are needed since the subject is new and open to development. In this study, we designed an interdisciplinary unplugged programming activity to integrate CT into STEM activities which we then implemented in a professional development course (PD) with the participation of STEM teachers. To evaluate the effectiveness, an open-ended questionnaire was given to the teachers and the results were analyzed. Accordingly, the teachers stated that the activity was exemplary in applying the interdisciplinary approach and enabling the perspectives of different disciplines to be seen by other subject-area teachers. Also, using unplugged programming activities in teacher education provides an important example. Teachers who want to conduct unplugged programming activities in their classrooms, learn how to integrate CT into STEM, are interested in the practice to support their students' research skills, and aim to support students' 21st-century skills can also use this activity. The interdisciplinary structure of the activity and its example of integrating CT into STEM will guide practitioners and researchers in the field.

AB  - The present research examined the effectiveness of digital storytelling (DST) on foreign language learners' English speaking and creative thinking. In this study, DST was realized in the form of an interdisciplinary project integrated in a partnership between an English course and a computer course, with the class time of the former devoted to the content design and that of the latter to the multimedia design of learner-generated digital stories. The participants were required to work in small groups to create their digital stories in the target language, English, under an eight-week interdisciplinary curriculum. A two-group quasi-experiment with a pretest and posttest design was then conducted to compare the participants' learning outcomes. The findings reveal the authentic and meaningful learning opportunities that DST has to offer for effectively fostering the students' development of becoming proficient English speakers and creative thinkers. Future implementations on interdisciplinary DST projects are thus recommended for educators.

AB  - This study examines the impact of interdisciplinary teacher collaboration on English-medium instruction (EMI) teachers' professional development in higher education. Five content teachers from a variety of academic backgrounds jointly designed, developed and implemented an interdisciplinary EMI course at a private university in Taiwan. Based on classroom observations, in-depth interviews and document analysis, the findings show that content teachers' attitudes towards EMI teaching became more positive as a consequence of participating in teacher collaboration. The findings also stress the value of teacher collaboration in supporting content teachers' language teaching strategies and instructional language use in EMI. Implications and directions for future research are also provided.

AB  - This article explains how research "on" practitioners can be turned into research "for and with" practitioners (Cameron, Frazer, Rampton, & Richardson, 1992, p. 22) by including these practitioners in the research teams. Methodologically, it draws on two decades of multimethod research and knowledge transformation at the interface of applied linguistics and transdisciplinary action research on professional communication (Perrin, 2013). Empirically, it is based on large corpora of data collected in multilingual and multicultural workplaces. First, the article outlines transdisciplinary action research as a theoretical framework that enables researchers and practitioners to collaboratively develop sustainable solutions to real-world problems in which language use in general and text production in particular play a substantial role (Section 1). Then, Progression Analysis is explained as a multimethod approach to investigate text production practices in natural environments such as workplaces (Section 2). Examples from four domains (education, finance, translation, and journalism) illustrate what value transdisciplinary collaboration between academic researchers and practitioners can add to knowledge generation in applied linguistics (Section 3). For the case of journalism in increasingly global contexts, in-depth analyses offer step-by-step understanding of the trajectory from a real-world problem to a sustainable solution (Section 4). The article concludes by suggesting empirically-based measures for research that contribute to the development of both theory and practice in applied linguistics (Section 5).

AB  - Background: As the number of computer science (CS) jobs become increasingly available in this country and computing skills become essential tools for managing all aspects of our personal lives, CS is quickly becoming an essential element of K-12 education and recently, there has been increased attention to bringing computer science to the elementary grades. However, with a schedule that emphasizes literacy and mathematics, and other subjects competing for instructional time, creating opportunities for CS in the elementary school day is challenging. This study aimed to address this problem by investigating the use of problem-based transdisciplinary modules (i.e., "Time4CS" modules) that combined English language arts (ELA), science, and social studies lessons with the Code.org "Fundamentals" CS education program. Results: indicated that teachers who taught Time4CS modules completed more CS lessons than teachers who did not teach the modules. Further, across all classrooms, completing a higher percentage of non-grade level assigned Code.org Fundamentals lessons (i.e., Code.org lessons above or below grade level that were available to teachers, but not required for their particular grade level) was positively associated with students' achievement outcomes on state ELA and mathematics tests. Additionally, higher amounts of interdisciplinary teaching practices were associated with higher student achievement, specifically students' state assessment ELA scores. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that transdisciplinary problem-based modules that integrate the teaching of CS with other subject areas are a feasible way to bring more CS opportunities to younger learners. Moreover, it showed that implementing such modules is linked to more positive student academic achievement outcomes. With attentive revision, the modules featured in this study may be useful tools for elementary schools. These findings have implications for researchers, school district administrators, and those individuals who are in-charge of public policy initiatives seeking ways to bring CS to all elementary school students. Specifically, they highlight that it is possible to make time in the elementary school day for CS, and that there are no negative consequences for core subjects (e.g., ELA and mathematics).

AB  - Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often delayed in achieving bowel continence, resulting in negative outcomes. In this pilot trial, 20 children with ASD and encopresis were randomly assigned to multidisciplinary intervention for encopresis (MIE; n = 10) or a waitlist control group (n = 10). The MIE group was treated for constipation and received a 10-day behavioral intervention that utilized suppositories to produce predictable bowel movements that were reinforced. Caregivers were trained to implement the intervention. Results support the feasibility of clinical trials of MIE, with high enrolment, competition, attendance, and caregiver acceptability. Preliminary outcomes were positive, with six of 10 in the MIE group achieving continence by the end of treatment compared to 0 in the control group (p = 0.005).

AB  - Interest in the field of entrepreneurship is at an all-time high; coincidentally, migration is increasingly changing the landscape of employment. Many migrants find themselves facing challenges that entrepreneurial skills can help overcome. However, little remains explored within adult migrant education, especially within enterprises. "Multidisciplinary Approach to Entrepreneurship Education for Migrants" is a pivotal reference source that examines the most effective methods for teaching migrants vital venture capital skills and ensuring they have the tools necessary for leading business ventures. The book contributes to the development of literature and practices in areas related to both migrant entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial education by presenting conceptual approaches, methods, and educational perspectives that go beyond pedagogy to involve andragogy and heutagogy. Highlighting such topics as local development, self-employment, and teaching-learning methodologies, it is ideally designed for entrepreneurs, educators, trainers, human resources professionals, policymakers, government officials, researchers, academicians, and students.

AB  - Introduction: Telepractice is recognised as an effective and efficient medium of service delivery; however, despite this evidence, implementation has been inconsistent. Clinician confidence and perceptions are integral factors to the successful implementation of telepractice in routine care. This study aimed to develop, implement and evaluate a telepractice training package for clinicians in a single hospital service. Methods: Forty-one clinicians from Speech Pathology, Physiotherapy and Chronic Disease departments participated in a training package with a specific focus on staff skills training, access to resources and embedding telepractice models of care into organisational culture. Questionnaires were used to evaluate clinician self-reported skills and confidence at baseline, post-training and 6-months post-training. Thematic analysis of open-ended questions was used to glean a deeper understanding of perceived barriers and facilitators to using telepractice. Results: Participants' perceived knowledge and confidence significantly increased from baseline to immediately post-training (p < 0.001) and increased further to 6-months post-training (p < 0.001). Thematic analysis revealed three main enabling themes: (a) perceived benefits to patient care; (b) training and practice; and (c) resources and support; and four main barriers: (a) staff knowledge and training; (b) staff confidence; (c) client factors; and (d) infrastructure and resources. Conclusion: The telepractice training package improved staff skills and confidence which was sustained over time. Facilitating the uptake of telepractice is multidimensional and it is integral to address all relevant factors to ensure its success.

AB  - Few studies have addressed gender differences in autism in relation to functioning and across cultures. We aimed to explore functional gender differences in autism from a multidisciplinary, global perspective using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. Perceptions among professionals in high-income countries and middle-income countries were examined based on qualitative survey data from N = 225 professionals. Of these, n = 131 professionals provided information on functional gender differences in autism. Thirty-two professionals reported perceiving no gender differences. Remaining respondents (n = 99)--representing 31 countries, all World Health Organization regions, and 10 different professions--were included in a content analysis on functional gender differences, which generated three main categories and 13 subcategories. The subcategories were subsequently linked to International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health categories. Autistic males were described as displaying more externalizing behaviors, and females as having more internalizing problems and being more socially motivated. Thirty-two International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health categories were identified, of which 31 were covered by the comprehensive Core Set for autism. Gender differences in core symptoms and co-existing problems were acknowledged by professionals from both high-income countries and middle-income countries, while differences in social behaviors, including camouflaging, were more frequently described by experts from high-income countries.

AB  - Canada has become one of the most popular destinations for international students at the higher education level. A number of complex factors and trends, both in Canada and globally, have contributed to the emergence of Canada as a destination for international higher education. However, more research is still needed to better understand the experiences of international students in Canada considering the rapid growth in numbers as well as the social, political, and linguistic singularity of Canada as a destination. "Multidisciplinary Perspectives on International Student Experience in Canadian Higher Education" is an essential scholarly publication that explores international students' experiences in Canadian colleges and universities. It seeks to explore the various factors, aspects, challenges, and successes that characterize the international student experience in Canadian higher education from the perspective of international students and the academic communities to which they belong. Featuring a wide range of topics such as information literacy, professional development, and experiential learning, this book is ideal for academicians, instructors, researchers, policymakers, curriculum designers, and students.

AB  - In this study, two multidisciplinary Social Sciences and Humanities research schools in Sweden have been investigated regarding disciplinary identity-making. This study investigates the meetings between different disciplines around a common thematic area of study for Ph.D. students. The Ph.D. students navigate through a complex social and organisational landscape with obligations and loyalties towards the discipline and the research school, which may be in conflict with each other. The main finding is that a multidisciplinary environment in fact creates strong disciplinary identities, partly in contrast to the purpose with the multidisciplinary research school. Encounters with Ph.D. students from other disciplines give the Ph.D. student something to relate to and to discuss e.g. with the supervisor. Another finding is that multidisciplinary research schools extend the perspectives of students. For some, new methods and theories from neighbouring disciplines were integrated and used, while for others the empirical scope of research was affected.

AB  - Interdisciplinary pedagogy can enhance Introduction to Psychology curricula. We developed an interdisciplinary project to make meaning in a learning community (LC) clustering Introduction to Psychology with Introduction to Criminal Justice. Our purpose is to describe the project as a model and report on students' evaluations of the project and their academic progress. We collected questionnaire data about students' experiences completing the project. Results were positive with most students valuing make meaning, feeling more connected to psychology and expressing satisfaction. We measured student learning using project grades and final grades in the psychology course. Participants performed satisfactory on the project and outperformed a comparison group in the Introduction to Psychology course. Findings demonstrate the value of interdisciplinary pedagogy in psychology curricula.

AB  - COVID-19 has had an extreme effect on older people. Now more than ever we need collaborative approaches to address complex issues within research on aging. However, the pandemic has dramatically changed the way we conduct, interact, and organize research within interdisciplinary groups. This paper describes a case study of how an interdisciplinary institute for research on aging has managed the process of change during COVID-19 restrictions. A design lead, researcher centered approach was used to understand the needs of researchers as they adapted across 6 months. Firstly, an online survey (n=51) was conducted to understand the scope of change and needs. The survey found broad themes ranging from assistance with finding additional funding to adjusting current research proposals. Following the survey, two Co-Design Sessions were conducted. The first session (n=53) diverged thinking to scope ideas from the survey and actionable themes were created. The second session (n=36) was conducted to converge thinking and focus on solutions based on one of these themes. The results revealed a diversity of ideas addressing the needs of interdisciplinary researchers in aging. These ideas spanned from exploring the capacity to do research remotely and creating virtual collaboration spaces to rethinking stakeholder engagement.

AB  - Understanding data analysis and interpreting data are key components of teaching interdisciplinary undergraduate students. We detail a semester-long research project that introduces students to long-term data sets, incorporates the use of widely available statistical analysis, and underscores an inquiry-based method of teaching climate change. Our learning objectives included analysis of large-scale climate data and interpretation of empirical trends in the context of two climate change phenomena: warming and the urban heat island effect. We demonstrate how small groups of students (n = 2 or 3) were empowered to independently download and analyze long-term temperature data to be aggregated into a class data set. Students used the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) to find the long-term data sets of hourly maximum (TMAX) and minimum (TMIN) temperatures. Students used the open-source statistical software R to manage and summarize data. Students also examined changes in land use cover using Google Earth satellite data to quantify whether stations were urban or rural. Students were assessed in their groups based on a research paper and a class presentation. Approaching climate change education from the inquiry-based learning perspective allows students to understand how scientific research is conducted, apply the scientific method, and experience firsthand the importance of open-source data.

AB  - In this paper we combine a philosophical theoretical analysis with human movement science empirical studies, in order to provide a better understanding of the possible links between free play and creativity. We deal in particular with some dialectical dynamics inherent to free play: the relation between rules and freedom, spontaneity which often leads to imitation, the presence of a purpose as a necessary element to makes novelty creative, innovation as an essential part of adaptive processes. We remark the topic into a developmental perspective including the role of play tutoring. We advocate an interdisciplinary criticism for approaching the paradigm of free play and creativity. Our aim is to show that free play in itself does not always and necessarily imply creativity, but can easily foster it in the presence of certain specific conditions.

AB  - Interdisciplinary education is gaining prominence in higher education, but little is known about the experiences and professional development needs of interdisciplinary educators. Through the lenses of self-reflection, peer review, and the educational literature, this paper uses a narrative enquiry approach to explore the lived experiences of two academics as they transition from a focus on their disciplines into roles as interdisciplinary educators. By exploring sequential events, we identify five key phases: making the move, starting out, the teaching experience, learning more, and looking forward. We faced many challenges, including working with an interdisciplinary teaching team, feeling 'undisciplined', and the need for an adaptive curriculum. Based on our experiences, there is a real opportunity for academic developers to design and implement initiatives to support academics embarking on interdisciplinary teaching.

AB  - Interprofessional education (IPE)--students of different professions learning together, from and about each other--is increasingly common in health professional degrees. Despite its explicit aims of transforming identities, practices and relationships within/across health professions, IPE remains under-theorised sociologically, with most IPE scholarship focussed on evaluating specific interventions. In particular, the significance of a shared knowledge base for shaping professional power and subjectivity in IPE has been overlooked. In this paper we begin to develop a framework for theorising IPE in allied health, by drawing parallels with a cognate area in which there has already been fruitful conceptual development: interdisciplinarity. Specifically, we offer a worked example of how the two areas may be brought into dialogue, by deploying Barry, Born and Weszkalnys' (2008) conceptualisation of interdisciplinarity as a lens for understanding IPE. Following Barry et al. (2008) we delineate a number of "modes" and "logics" of knowledge-production that emerge both in IPE literature and in our own empirical study of IPE. Our empirical data are drawn from 32 semi-structured interviews with 19 allied health students participating in an IPE curriculum at one Australian university. Findings point to the emergence of interprofessional practitioner identities among students that have the potential to undermine traditional epistemological boundaries and transcend role-based distinctions in future health profession(al)s. We argue that Barry et al.'s "logic of ontology" sheds light on previously unidentified processes of transformation within IPE, and offers a theoretical framework that can explain the importance of a shared pan-professional knowledge base for the reflexive individual construction of new interprofessional ontological subjects.

AB  - With a focus on resources for learning through writing, this paper compares the interdisciplinary framings of two teacher education programmes. What are the implications of these framings and resources for students' possibilities when they write independent projects/bachelor theses? The paper presents a case study with data (interviews, texts, observations) from two different teacher education programmes. The conceptual framework stems from the Academic Literacies approach. The analysis shows that one of the programmes shapes interdisciplinarity by a "block approach" that allows students to work independently, while the other is shaped as a "bridging approach" with tight collaboration between students and tutors. The two educational programmes apply the same national regulating documents in different ways, thus creating different possibilities for students to learn and write as "independent" or "collaborative" students, respectively. The results contribute to a discussion of higher education structure and the role of writing within it.

AB  - This paper describes the design of an industrial informatics course, following the project-based learning methodology, and reports the experience of four academic years (from 2012-13 to 2015-16). Industrial Informatics is a compulsory course taught in the third year of the B.Sc. degree in industrial electronics and automation engineering at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Spain. The course had students develop an embedded controller for a 2DoF SCARA robot that drew a specific trajectory. The robot was built with the LEGO Mindstorms kit and the controller was implemented with NXC, a C-like programming language for the NXT brick. In this activity, students became aware of their learning needs and had to work proactively, both autonomously and in teams. The course design achieved several objectives: 1) students learned the course material; 2) soft skills demanded by employers were reinforced; and 3) the material was structured into project tasks for students to perform. The article analyses two indicators: 1) qualification marks and 2) student satisfaction.

AB  - This article focuses on how HRD research can better address some of the barriers to inclusive career development and secure employment. Beginning with the concept of decent work, we suggest expanding the scope of studies on workplace inequities, encouraging HRD to push further into disparities facing under-represented identity groups and including those often overlooked in the literature. We reinforce the importance of furthering research on building individual skills related to career proactivity, and we encourage HRD to delve further into the research of related fields and to explore more interdisciplinary studies on career development.

AB  - Modern academic libraries tend to provide services beyond traditional lending, reference, and enquiry services. Many are converged with other professional or student-focussed services such as IT, student services, academic support, or such learning resources as multimedia or print services -- often co-located in space and management structure. At its optimum, this convergence can foster cross-institution working and enable Library services visibility in institution strategy alongside other business continuity services (e.g., student records, Finance, HR). Conversely, the structure could bury Library services, relegating them to the 'always there, not a problem' box. The visibility of Library services within the converged structure, of course, is dependent on whether the Library leader has influence at the executive table. Through the prism of the McKinsey 7S framework, this article reflects on the convergence of Library, IT, Multimedia Services including classroom management, and Print Services at SOAS University of London and examines the process of bringing together staff with varying professional identities and grades to work as a cohesive team delivering front-line, customer-focussed services. The article also reflects on how taking a multidisciplinary approach to providing institution support enabled the Customer Services and Operations (CSOps) team to influence institution strategy on space development for learning, teaching, and research support.

AB  - Secular scholars have criticized Christian education and counseling on sex as restrictive, ineffective, and outdated. The authors of the current study explored both common non-Christian and Christian approaches to human sexuality with reference to overarching domains of religion, philosophy, psychology, sociology, and anthropology. Secular approaches were classified as the "inward approach," the "spatial approach," and the "temporal approach", whereas Christian approaches were categorized as the "traditional" and the "modern" perspectives. Although Christian faith can be signified as a protective factor against casual and risky sexual behaviors, traditional Christian values should be reevaluated in favor of comprehensive Christian approaches to sexuality, which embrace sexual desires as divine gifts for completeness of humanity.

AB  - In this paper we highlight the issues and opportunities of a participatory action research (PAR) and co-design project, currently being undertaken as engaged research between academics at Durham University and practitioners at the UK's International Centre for Life in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne (CfL; see creativescienceatlife.com for more information and developments). The focus is on the use of PAR to enable university researchers and Science Centre professionals to co-design Informal Science Learning exhibits that enhance creativity and innovation in young people. We define the principles of PAR and explore reasons for adopting the approach. An account is provided of the iterative co-design and piloting of a novel exhibit within a new exhibition space at the CfL. Reflections collated independently by the practitioners and the academics involved highlighting the development of ideas and insights over the course of the PAR process. We discuss how PAR enabled effective engagement with and creation of enriched knowledge, and innovation, in both the academy and science-learning professionals. The added value of PAR and co-production to our project aligns with current calls for a redefining of how societal impact of academic research is considered.

AB  - This article aims to expand our knowledge on interdisciplinary design education by focusing on team development, which has remained a less explored aspect of interdisciplinary collaboration so far. An interdisciplinary design studio course, Collaborative Design, for food engineering and industrial design students in higher education provides the research context. The empirical basis of the paper comes from interviews with students on their experiences of interdisciplinary collaboration in the course, and the educator's observation notes. Drawing on these data, this article critically reflects on how and to what extent the teaching materials, methods and strategies incorporated into the course design guided and supported students' transition through the four stages of becoming a performing interdisciplinary team. The article concludes with four suggestions for design educators. First, encountering new ways of thinking, talking and doing that make sense for both disciplines engages students in interdisciplinary collaboration. Second, humour and positive social relations play an important role in team success in all stages of team development. Third, using the first weeks of the course to reveal the disciplinary differences and potential issues that would lead to conflicts through class discussions and warm-up activities facilitates a smooth transition from forming to norming. Fourth, adequate representation of each discipline should be ensured both in the design problem and solution, and among the tutors.

AB  - Among the relevant aspects of the family resemblance approach (FRA), our study focuses on the potential of the approach to elaborate on disciplinary identities in an interdisciplinary context, specifically regarding the interplay between physics and mathematics. We present and discuss how the FRA wheel can be used and intertwined with the framework of boundary objects and boundary crossing mechanisms (Akkerman & Bakker, "Review of Educational Research," 81, 132-169, 2011), which is well-known in STEM education for dealing with interdisciplinarity. The role of the FRA discussed in the article is dual: both practical and theoretical. It is practical in that we show how its use, in combination with the Akkerman and Bakker framework, appears effective in fostering productive discussions among prospective teachers on disciplinary identities and interdisciplinarity in historical cases. It is theoretical in that the combination of the two frameworks provides the vocabulary to characterise the 'ambiguous nature' of interdisciplinarity: like boundaries, interdisciplinarity both separates disciplines, making their identities emerge, and connects them, fostering mechanisms of crossing and transgressing the boundaries. This empirical study reveals how the theoretical elaboration took advantage of the prospective teachers' contributions. We initially presented the FRA to characterise disciplinary identities, but the prospective teachers highlighted its potential to characterise also the boundary zone and the dialogue between physics and mathematics. The data analysis showed that the combinination of the two frameworks shaped a complex learning space where there was room for very different epistemic demands of the prospective teachers: from those who feel better within the identity cores of the disciplines, to those who like to inhabit the boundary zone and others who like to re-shape boundary spaces and move dynamically across them.

AB  - Background: Although sound is an everyday phenomenon that we hear about constantly, numerous studies have reported that students often exhibit learning difficulties in understanding this subject. Only a few studies have proposed programs involving practical learning experiments to provide students with solid conceptual knowledge. Moreover, little research to date has dealt with the topic of sound from the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) perspective. Purpose: The need for this research is rooted in the general lack of learning materials developed according to integrative STEM and in the shortage of interdisciplinary contents that specifically address the subject of sound. The Sound, Waves and Communication Systems (SWCS) program was developed in Sakhnin in Israel to integrate the learning of science and technology through the extensive use of Information and Computer Technologies (ICT). The study aimed at exploring middle school students' achievements and motivation in learning the program and discovering the factors that might affect these elements. Sample: The participants in the study are 120 middle school students (7th-graders), divided into six separate groups: two groups (40 students) participated in the pilot study, whereas four groups (80 students) took part in the main study. Methods: The study adopted a mixed method research design, and combined quantitative and qualitative methods that included observations in class, administering a students' motivation questionnaire before and after studying the course, giving achievement exams, and analyzing the students' projects. Results: The findings showed that despite difficulties in learning the subject, the students eventually managed to gain a conceptual understanding and their self-efficacy significantly increased. Conclusions: The flexible integration of the teachers' instruction, the hands-on lab work, the use of ICT, and project-based learning all contributed to the participants' success and motivation in learning the current course.

AB  - While higher education plays a critical role in society, little is known about the motivation of faculty members within such institutions. In this paper, we explore the faculty motivation to voluntarily cocreate an interdisciplinary course as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of our qualitative, phenomenological study highlight sensemaking for both students and faculty, being peer-driven, ability to collaboratively innovate, desire for student engagement, being able to leverage existing expertise, and concern for institutional welfare as motivational drivers for faculty. The shared experience of creating and teaching the course subsequently impacts faculty in a number of different ways. A crisis-based faculty motivation model for interdisciplinary course cocreation is presented.

AB  - The present study aimed to find out the attitudes of Arabic as a foreign language (AFL) and English as a foreign language (EFL) students toward learning foreign languages in the Turkish higher education context within an interdisciplinary perspective. It was designed as a survey study and conducted with 26 Turkish AFL students and 26 Turkish EFL students who were chosen through convenience sampling. The data were collected through the attitude toward learning foreign languages scale for students studying at schools of Foreign Languages and were analyzed with descriptive statistics. According to the findings of the present study, the opinions of the participants related to foreign language lessons and their emotions related to learning foreign languages were positive, while their opinions about learning foreign languages were not very negative. Also, the findings indicated that the participants gave a lot of importance to learning foreign languages and used foreign languages on social media a lot. As a result of these, the findings revealed that both participant AFL and EFL students had a positive attitude toward learning foreign languages. The findings were discussed. The implications and limitations of the present study were explained, and suggestions for future studies were made.

AB  - The relevance of the researched problem is caused by the increasing interest in using potential of transdisciplinary approaches, and mathematical methods, which include the game theory in analysis of public and economic processes. The aim of the article is studying a possibility of implementation of the transdisciplinary approaches in economic researches. The leading approach is institutional and evolutionary, which allows to reveal such tendencies of relationship development and interrelations of individuals that remain hidden and implicit. It also allows to receive new and quite unexpected important results, significant for practice. In the article the hypothesis is proved. According to it, innovations, its generation and autopoiesis itself are structural units. In the innovative environment it assumes various forms. The materials of the article can be useful for development of the theory of the system analysis, and also when developing macroeconomic forecasts of social and economic development.

AB  - Saudi Arabian citizens, including university students, are in an interesting and precarious situation -- they care for sustainability, but their economy thrives because of oil production. This study used an author-developed instrument to briefly explore 135 Saudi university students' (nine disciplines) knowledge, awareness, evaluation and convictions of how to facilitate the nation to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) per "Vision 2030" despite living in an oil-based economy. Within this context, the paper then reports 31 female Saudi pre-service teachers' (also university students) experience with and reaction to using inquiry-based learning (IBL) to teach sustainability. Their feedback as emergent educators is invaluable for Saudi initiatives concerned with Education for Sustainability (EfS). Study participants were from Saudi's Eastern Province (convenience and snowball sampling) with data collected in fall 2019. Recommendations include integrating IBL into teacher education, supporting IBL with Saudi cultural and religious practices, and communicating anthropogenic impact to Saudi citizens.

AB  - Design methods and processes are now commonly used across disciplines as an approach to gain deeper and more connected understanding within complex or wicked problems. However, little research exists on the use of Design to facilitate and grow interdisciplinary research culture within higher education institutes. This paper discusses how and why Design methods were used to create an interdisciplinary research culture in a newly emergent and rapidly evolving higher education environment. It uses a case study of a teaching orientated higher education institute, now moving towards Technological University status, and seeking to create an Interdisciplinary research culture. It discusses the process of using Design to create a unifying research identity, Design methods in mapping and framing of research landscapes, designing dissemination platforms, and Co-designing future research policy for the institute.

AB  - This article critically examines three assumptions underlying recent efforts to advance interdisciplinary research-defined in this article as communication and collaboration between researchers across academic disciplines (e.g. Sociology, Psychology, Biology)--and examines these assumptions' implications for health professions education research (HPER). These assumptions are: (1) disciplines are silos that inhibit the free flowing of knowledge across fields and stifle innovative thinking; (2) interdisciplinary research generates a better understanding of the world as it brings together researchers from various fields of expertise capable of tackling complex problems; and (3) interdisciplinary research reduces fragmentation across groups of researchers by eliminating boundaries. These assumptions are among the new beliefs shaping the contemporary academic arena; they orient academics' and university administrators' decisions toward expanding interdisciplinary research and training, but without solid empirical evidence. This article argues that the field of HPER has largely adopted the premises of interdisciplinary research but has not yet debated the potential effects of organizing around these premises. The authors hope to inspire members of the HPER community to critically examine the ubiquitous discourse promoting interdisciplinarity, and engage in reflection about the future of the field informed by evidence rather than by unsubstantiated assumptions. For example: Should research centres and graduate programs in HPER encourage the development of interdisciplinary or disciplinary-trained researchers? Should training predominantly focus on methods and methodologies or draw more on disciplinary-based knowledge? What is the best route toward increasing the field's profile within academia and attracting the best students and researchers to engage in HPER? These are questions that merit attention at the current juncture as the future of the HPER field relies on decisions made in the present time.

AB  - This article describes the implementation of an interdisciplinary design studio as a means to teach creative problem-solving through project-based learning. "Learning and Innovation Skills" has been designated as a core skill that students need to be successful in today's world, and project-based learning is one approach to helping students develop these skills. After describing the early genesis and development of the interdisciplinary design studio, the article describes results of initial research into the students' experiences in studio courses. Students described courses as flexible and reported high levels of motivation stemming from the authenticity of the problems. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the studio, some students described deepening disciplinary skills while at the same time being exposed to cross-disciplinary skills. They believed the courses helped develop interdisciplinary collaboration, creativity, and communication skills.

AB  - This paper describes the 20-year evolution of an information studies program from one primarily focused on librarianship, to one that now encompasses a range of interdisciplinary topics including knowledge management, user-experience design, data science, and bioinformatics, among others. The program revisions, course development, and faculty renewal were guided by the School's strategic plan to centre its teaching and research on the focus of the interaction between people and information, supported by technology. Over twenty years, the proportion of interdisciplinary courses increased from less than 10% to almost half. There were a number of challenges throughout the process, including finding the right balance within the program, maintaining accreditation, and working with limited resources. Yet, the outcomes have been well worth the effort, and we suggest best practices based on our lessons learned.

AB  - This paper develops the structure for an integrative model information systems curriculum on Accounting Analytics, which affords students the opportunities to develop domain knowledge along with application of data analytics. As industry experiences rapid technological change, university curricula must remain current in order to be effective. Curriculum content is further advanced and established with input from industry organizations that employ graduates of the programs. The paper output includes a curriculum review of top accounting programs, course curriculum map, accounting data skills matrix, and professional opportunities. The curriculum review utilizes an empirical text analytics methodological approach to extract patterns and develop additional insights for the advancement of accounting information systems research. To minimize curricular disruption, existing courses can be utilized as core curriculum, enhancing key courses to complete undergraduate, graduate, or certificate programs. The Accounting Analytics customized curriculum provides students an opportunity to take advantage of the growing interdisciplinary field and student interest among accounting and analytical career paths. The integrative curriculum is developed to better prepare graduates with the critical knowledge, skills, and abilities to excel in this new-age workforce.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research networks are increasing, with professionals encouraged to undertake research across disciplines to increase innovation, creativity and knowledge. More recently, this interdisciplinary focus is being mirrored by the establishment of interdisciplinary doctoral research networks. But do these networks work? And if so, how and why? We employ social capital theory to (a) understand the lived experiences of students in interdisciplinary doctoral programmes and (b) build programme design theory to support the development of social capital within such programmes. We present the results of 28 semi-structured interviews conducted with doctoral students from three European Union funded interdisciplinary research training networks to understand how they perceive the enhancers, inhibitors and manifestations of social capital within their networks. Key themes revolve around 'extracting value from the interdisciplinary process', 'motivating students throughout the interdisciplinary programme journey', and 'relating to others both within and external to the programme'. We propose a framework for interdisciplinary programme design.

AB  - Enhancing students' interdisciplinary design ability in a highway engineering context is important for the development of building information modeling (BIM). This paper proposes a new paradigm for highway engineering and its service areas based on the BIM platform, integrating road, bridge, tunnel, engineering costing; architecture; structure; water supply and drainage; heating and ventilation; and electrical engineering for a senior year capstone course. An overall and breakdown work system is constructed of the joint design process guided by the highway engineering discipline. BIM technology is utilized to integrate the design work content of nine majors, linking the originally separated design stages, and articulating the flow of interoperability information in highway engineering. A case study tests the course, evaluates the students' performance, and identifies improvements in software training, time schedule, technology connection, interoperability issues, as well as how BIM affects teamwork. In applying BIM in an interdisciplinary situation, a visualization tool is used to enrich the body of knowledge of BIM education as it relates to highway engineering.

AB  - In interdisciplinary studies, multiple definitions and practices proliferate. Interdisciplinarians such as William H. Newell claim that complex systems theory provides the rationale that we need to guide reform. However, complex systems theory alone cannot rationalize interdisciplinarity and inform what Ernest Boyer calls the scholarship of integration. Language and texts also play a key role. This claim is just as significant today as it was when Immanuel Kant noted the importance of texts in his controversial blueprint for higher education. Not only is Kant one of the fathers of modern philosophy and constructivism, but he is also a key architect of the disciplinary silos that instrumentalists such as Newell claim to oppose but indirectly reinforce through reductionist practices. A dialogic conceptual framework recalibrates these practices and their correlates, thus improving interdisciplinary education in the digital age. This article reveals that a study of Kantian architectonics and its dialogic reinterpretation by Mikhail Bakhtin has much to teach educators about interdisciplinarity as an agent for integrative learning and higher education reform.

AB  - Interdisciplinary collaborations to help students compose for discipline-specific contexts draw on multiple expertise. Science, technology, education, and mathematics (STEM) programs particularly rely on their writing colleagues because (1) their academic expertise is often not writing and (2) teaching writing often necessitates a redesigning of existing instructional materials. While many writing studies scholars have the expertise to assist their STEM colleagues with such tasks, how to do so--and, more fundamentally, how to begin such efforts--is not commonly focused on in the literature stemming from these collaborations. Our article addresses this gap by detailing an interdisciplinary Writing in the Disciplines (WID) collaboration at a large, public R1 university between STEM and writing experts to redesign the university's introductory biology writing curriculum. The collaborative curriculum design process detailed here is presented through the lens of wayfinding, which concerns orientation, trailblazing, and moving through uncertain landscapes according to cues. Within this account, a critical focus on language--what we talk about when we talk about writing--emerges, driving both the collaboration itself and resultant curricular revisions. Our work reveals how collaborators can wayfind through interdisciplinary partnerships and writing curriculum development by transforming differences in discipline-specific expertise into a new path forward.

AB  - This design case discusses the complex collaborative design reasoning processes involved in developing an online interactive learning tool for learners of all ages to explore and understand the role of flagellate plants in our society. The learning tool consists of a main website (the "Voyager") and an interactive, dynamic map of the evolutionary relationships between thousands of flagellate plant species (the customized "OneZoom" web application). The design and development of this innovative learning tool required expertise in collaborative design, design reasoning, project management, theories of learning and instructional strategies, software development, and web usability. Collaboration platforms used by the project team involved "GitHub" and "Slack." Domain knowledge needed to complete the project included botany (flagellate plants), web programming ("Python" and "JavaScript"), and database management ("MySQL"). The project included a team of international experts who negotiated design strategies and solutions over the course of a year and produced and improved prototypes until converging on the final product. This article explains the challenges faced during these processes and presents solutions and lessons learned from this experience.

AB  - Evidence-based pedagogies to improve student success in STEM disciplines are now recognized, but their successful incorporation can be hampered by faculty wariness of novel pedagogical research. To support these pedagogies' effective implementation, a research team at a southeastern Historically Black College and University (HBCU) provided its faculty with long-term (2013-2020), incentivized professional development (PD) in STEM subjects, focused on faculty teaching development (TD). Over 6 years, PD/TD experts provided faculty participants with theoretical underpinnings and student outcome data, demonstrated hands-on strategies for under-prepared and differential learners, and addressed concerns that novel pedagogies could erode STEM-subject standards. Participants reflected on their teaching and learning foundations, examined their approaches and assumptions, and implemented new strategies. Interview and survey findings showed long-term, multidisciplinary STEM PD can help change faculty teaching views, even among those initially resistant. Although beyond our study window, ICFAIM collaborations yielded two DOE-funded faculty-developed interventions and team cohesiveness during the pandemic's shift to online instruction. ICFAIM evidence supports PD/TD that is: 1) designed to build on shared standards and knowledge; 2) provided incrementally over time; 3) focused on topics of concern to faculty alongside new ones; and 4) fairly incentivized.

AB  - Contract cheating occurs when students outsource assessed work. In this study, we asked experienced markers from four disciplines to detect contract cheating in a set of 20 discipline-specific assignments. We then conducted a training workshop to improve their detection accuracy, and afterwards asked them to detect contract cheating in 20 new assignments. We analysed the data in terms of sensitivity (the rate at which markers spotted contract cheating) and specificity (the rate at which markers spotted real student work). Pre-workshop marker sensitivity was 58% and specificity was 83%. Post-workshop marker sensitivity was 82% and specificity was 87%. The increase in sensitivity was statistically significant, but the increase in specificity was not. These results indicate that markers can often detect contract cheating when asked to do so, and that training may be helpful in improving their accuracy. We suggest that markers' suspicions may be crucial in addressing contract cheating.

AB  - This pretest/posttest study investigated the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary program in which occupational therapists and speech-language pathologists used a combination of video modeling, scenario-based learning, guided discussion, and reflection on the development of interpersonal skills and work readiness among students with disabilities. This study examined 20 high school and postgraduate transitional students enrolled full-time in Life Skills Support classrooms in two rural high schools. Participants completed 21 dynamic and interactive group sessions which included video modeling, scenario-based learning, guided discussion, and reflection. Sessions were completed once a week, for one hour, and focused on enhancing interpersonal skills, cognitive skills, work habits, and performance skills. Sessions were delivered via an interdisciplinary model with participants' primary occupational therapist and speech-language pathologist. Results of the paired-samples t-test found a statistically significant increase in the Becker Work Adjustment Profile-2 scores in three categories: Cognitive Skills, Work Performance, and Broad Work Adjustment. All students showed growth on Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) T-scores; 18 of the 20 students achieved GAS T-scores greater than threshold performance.

AB  - Recent studies have posited that K-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education should go beyond traditional subject silos and take an interdisciplinary approach that integrates these core subjects into a cohesive curriculum to foster authentic problem-solving skills. The purpose of this study was to field test one of five proposed packages of interdisciplinary STEM lessons to examine its feasibility for further revisions of lesson development. The study employed a piecewise linear growth model to examine growth patterns of students' science vocabulary acquisition and contextualized problem-solving skills during a 40-week observation period. Results showed that all students with learning disabilities (N = 9) made significant knowledge gains in these two areas and maintained them for a long term--two and four weeks post intervention. Our findings are encouraging and provide initial evidence for effective lesson design to support STEM education for students with learning disabilities.

AB  - The multidisciplinary fields of public administration (PA), public policy sciences (PP), and nonprofit studies (Nonprofit) contribute in different ways to interdisciplinary knowledge integration in public affairs. At the field and topic level, we examine the variety and coherence of the disciplinary knowledge that each field draws upon when conducting research. Our analyses focus on citations from articles published between 2009--2020 in PA, PP, and Nonprofit journals indexed in Web of Science (n = 991,627). The contributions of each field are shaped by their distinct disciplinary origins. PA is more insular than PP and Nonprofit, in part due to its need to adopt new paradigms because of rapid, substantial shifts in public administration practice. Although Nonprofit achieves relatively more interdisciplinary knowledge integration, public affairs is heavily influenced by knowledge integration in PP. We identify variation in interdisciplinary knowledge integration across research topics and discuss possible explanations for the observed patterns.

AB  - Anatomical education is pivotal for medical students, and innovative technologies like augmented reality (AR) are transforming the field. This study aimed to enhance the interactive features of the "AEducAR" prototype, an AR tool developed by the University of Bologna, and explore its impact on human anatomy learning process in 130 second-year medical students at the International School of Medicine and Surgery of the University of Bologna. An interdisciplinary team of anatomists, maxillofacial surgeons, biomedical engineers, and educational scientists collaborated to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the study's objectives. Students used the updated version of "AEducAR," named "AEducAR 2.0," to study three anatomical topics, specifically the orbit zone, facial bones, and mimic muscles. "AEducAR 2.0" offered two learning activities: one explorative and one interactive. Following each activity, students took a test to assess learning outcomes. Students also completed an anonymous questionnaire to provide background information and offer their perceptions of the activity. Additionally, 10 students participated in interviews for further insights. The results demonstrated that "AEducAR 2.0" effectively facilitated learning and students' engagement. Students totalized high scores in both quizzes and declared to have appreciated the interactive features that were implemented. Moreover, interviews shed light on the interesting topic of blended learning. In particular, the present study suggests that incorporating AR into medical education alongside traditional methods might prove advantageous for students' academic and future professional endeavors. In this light, this study contributes to the growing research emphasizing the potential role of AR in shaping the future of medical education.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine sustainability-related challenges in the two Western Balkan countries--Albania and Kosovo. It discusses the opportunities of local higher education institutions (HEIs) taking responsibility to tackle these challenges by providing professional development through science-society collaboration in innovative training sessions for university educators. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review on actual challenges and transformations of higher education for sustainable development (ESD) in Albania and Kosovo will be the starting point of this paper. Subsequently, experiences from the on-going European Union (EU) project "ConSus" will be used to draw both a competence framework for ESD within science-society collaboration based on the training sessions, as well as possible scaling opportunities. Findings: The paper draws possible approaches of training sessions for university educators promoting sustainable development and science-society collaboration in higher education. They will be concluded by addressing possible scaling opportunities of the project's activities. Practical implications: The experiences of the ConSus training sessions will outline competences of university educators in ESD gained in relation to transdisciplinary collaboration in research and teaching. Originality/value: The paper will contribute to ESD approaches in higher education in Albania and Kosovo. Furthermore, scaling possibilities will be discussed to systematically implement ESD approaches also in higher hierarchical levels and other HEIs.

AB  - This article explores inter- and transdisciplinarity, given the need for more complex, relevant, and transformative knowledge to shift society towards more sustainable futures. It connects practical questions about economic, societal, and ecological limits to questions about the limitations of academic knowledge. Transdisciplinarity involves co-constructing socially relevant, transformative knowledge with actors outside academia. In practice, transdisciplinary work requires clarity about intentions, along with inclusive and well-facilitated collaborative processes that accommodate dissenting and transgressive perspectives. Higher education has begun to experiment with inter- and transdisciplinarity via sustainability-focused projects. However, it insufficiently addresses broader demands for transformation and cannot address these adequately without integral leadership.

AB  - The use of big data in higher education has evolved rapidly with a focus on the practical application of new tools and methods for supporting learning. In this paper, we depart from the core emphasis on application and delve into a mostly neglected aspect of the big data conversation in higher education. Drawing on developments in cognate disciplines, we analyse the inherent difficulties in inferring the complex phenomenon that is learning from big datasets. This forms the basis of a discussion about the possibilities for systematic collaboration across different paradigms and disciplinary backgrounds in interpreting big data for enhancing learning. The aim of this paper is to provide the foundation for a research agenda, where differing conceptualisations of learning become a strength in interpreting patterns in big datasets, rather than a point of contention.

AB  - This article explores the concept of transdisciplinarity as a cultural endeavor. It centers on the concept of transdisciplinary hermeneutics, as a form of contextualizing science in the framework of cultural ideas, subjective experiences of the researchers involved in the research process, and of imagination and the artful creation of possible new realities. The concept is rooted in the work of Basarab Nicolescu and the Paris based CIRET, the "Centre International de Recherches et Études Transdisciplinaires." In this approach, reality is seen as complex and multilayered, and cannot be known only through the lens of modern science. Philosophy, art and subjective experience are essential and complementary ways of knowledge production that provide context to scientific knowledge, giving it meaning and perspective. To be able to engage in transdisciplinary hermeneutics, researchers need to complement cognitive knowing with embodied and enacted knowing. They as well need to combine the formal and science-based language of what is seen and measured, with the poetic, polyphonic and metaphorical language of what is unseen but sensed, felt and envisioned. The article finally sketches the importance of two competencies that transdisciplinary researchers need to acquire, the competencies of mindfulness and of transdisciplinary dialogue of knowledges.

AB  - Challenges exist in respect of people with intellectual disabilities who, with the increasing life expectancy, have a growing risk of age-related degenerative conditions. Changes in bone health are associated with increasing age and the bone health of people who have intellectual disabilities is well documented in the literature as being poor in comparison to the general population. A heel scan clinic was set up in an intellectual disability service as a service improvement initiative. There were 12 females and 17 males scanned using a heel scanner. Only 3 (10.3%) people with intellectual disabilities were in the normal bone mineral density (BMD) range. Peripheral BMD screening for people has been shown to provide important information about the bone health of people with intellectual disabilities which has prompted further treatment by general practitioners and has the potential to provide an accessible way to obtain information on the bone health of people with intellectual disabilities.

AB  - This article examines the development, impact and integration of interdisciplinary approaches in British Higher Education Institutions. It evaluates how the concept of interdisciplinarity has become popularised over time and embraced by disciplines such as archaeology. It then explores the extent to which interdisciplinary approaches have impacted research agendas, first, by evaluating the interdisciplinary research calls from 2019 for seven UK-based research councils and then, at a discipline level, using archaeology as an exemplar. Overall, interdisciplinary research calls only accounted for, at best, 11.9% of a council's budget. Interrogation of the funding requirements of four of the largest archaeological-research funders demonstrated that successful archaeology-themed grant applications are reliant on interdisciplinarity. The influence of interdisciplinarity on British University's research and education agendas was examined through analysing the strategic plans of eight universities, followed by an analysis of the availability and potential benefits of interdisciplinary undergraduate and research programmes. This indicated that interdisciplinary approaches are interwoven into university's research aspirations but displayed variation in relation to their educational goals, with only 20% of institutions offering specific interdisciplinary degree programmes. Despite this, the skillset and research outputs produced as a result of interdisciplinary collaboration were found to be highly valued, thereby suggesting that interdisciplinarity will increasingly feature in the research and education strategies of British universities.

AB  - In order to fully appreciate the interdisciplinary nature of energy resources, there is a need to understand pertinent issues from other viewpoints besides a purely chemistry perspective. In this paper, the teaching of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and business databases as part of CM4282: Energy Resources at the Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore (NUS), is described. For teaching of CBA, in two 1h sessions, topics such as net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), discount rate, payback period, and sensitivity analysis were introduced in the context of capital budgeting. With collaboration from NUS libraries, in another 1h session, students were instructed on searching business databases for conducting strength, weakness, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis as part of their end-of-semester group presentation. Exposure to CBA and business databases enables chemistry majors in CM4282 to understand energy resources in an interdisciplinary light and enables the application of classroom knowledge to real-life scenarios in energy resources.

AB  - International reports analyzing current and future educational trends with an emphasis on technologies applied to education declare the importance of the design and application of digital educational resources. Guaranteeing its usability allows obtaining an adequate resource with a high pedagogical and technological quality. The objective of this paper is to analyze the empirical researches to determine if exists convergence between educational and computational researches on the assessment of the usability of digital educational resources. To fulfill the objective, the PRISMA protocol was used to carry out two systematic reviews and answer the two scientific questions. The results show that in few cases an adequate integration is achieved between: (1) the criteria for assessing usability as established by Software Engineering; (2) the methods and computational models to assess usability; and (3) the criteria established in pedagogical usability. Due to these shortcomings, a model for evaluating the usability of digital educational resources is proposed as future work. It concludes with the importance of interdisciplinary integration to assess the usability of digital educational resources.

AB  - Today, conserving the natural environment is paramount. Educators have been striving to develop pedagogical approaches that facilitate greater engagement in conservation behaviors. However, many of these reforms have been targeted at an institutional level, without necessarily testing whether changes in proenvironmental perceptions, attitudes, or behaviors occur for students. This step seems important when developing conservation biology courses that provide well-rounded education that may better prepare students for future challenges in biodiverse conservation contexts. Our objective was to assess the proenvironmental attitudes and conservation values of undergraduate students enrolled in an undergraduate conservation biology course before and after instruction to determine whether a multidisciplinary curriculum, in conjunction with traditional conservation biology content, would alter their perceptions. Students in both the control and intervention groups felt relatively neutral about a range of environmental and conservation topics. No statistical significance between curricula and impact on student perception was revealed. However, in the experimental course, shifts were found concerning students' understanding of the complexity of conservation. Results also highlight longstanding issues related to conservation education, such as a bias toward mammal conservation, and suggest that guest lectures are insufficient to bring about attitude change related to sustainability. Further research on incorporating cross-disciplinary pedagogy into STEM courses is recommended.

AB  - Research suggests that students need authenticity by welcoming their stories, even causing tension and discomfort with complex topics, encouraging discussion, and questioning. Our study explores undergraduates' open-ended reflections on using young adult literature to challenge dominant, deficit perspectives about themselves and others, which is not yet the norm but more common in high school settings. We explored how students questioned their implicit biases and assumptions toward a more critically aware identity through a holistic qualitative case study. Our analysis of students' open-ended reflections produced three major themes: (a) Importance of Diverse Books and Analysis; (b) Books as an Impetus for a Change in Thinking and Awareness of Self; and (c) Lingering Tensions and Ongoing Resistance. Although many students expressed a change in thinking, there were still instances that reflected resistance.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of ecological art (eco-art) projects on preservice classroom teachers' attitudes towards and views on environmental issues. Ecological art is an art-oriented teaching model. The study adopted a mixed embedded research design and integrated ecological art into the "Environmental Education" course. The sample consisted of 78 first-year students from the department of classroom education of Ondokuz Mayis University in the spring semester of the 2020-2021 academic year. Data were collected using student logs and a semi-structured interview questionnaire developed by the researchers, and the Environmental Problems Attitude Scale developed by Güven (2013). We developed a 14-week project and integrated visual arts education into the "Environmental Education" course. The project aimed to raise awareness through artistic expression. Each participant chose an ecological problem. The quantitative data were analysed using the Wilcoxon test. There was a significant difference between pre-test and post-test scores (p = 0.001). The qualitative data were analysed using content analysis. The results showed that the eco-art projects had cognitive, affective, and behavioural effects on participants. In other words, the eco-art projects raised their awareness of environmental issues. Participants stated that eco-art projects should be integrated into environmental education classes because they believed that art conveyed universal messages. We can conclude that eco-art projects bring an innovative and interdisciplinary perspective to environmental education and help preservice classroom teachers develop positive attitudes and views on environmental issues.

AB  - Creative confidence can be reflected in our identities and behaviours. The study explored perception changes in creative challenges and creative personal identity among first-year-in-college students before and after taking an interdisciplinary creativity course. A total of 764 students reported significantly higher levels of creative personal identity and heightened awareness of creative challenges at the end of the semester. "Self-doubt" was the most frequently reported internal barrier, and "time" and "money" were the most common external blocks. The results also demonstrated a strong relationship between creative personal identity and internal obstacles. The study concluded that students exposed to creative learning experiences become more motivated to exert time and effort in cultivating creative capacity with elevated levels of confidence.

AB  - Interdisciplinary introduction to quantum information science (QIS) courses are proliferating at universities across the US, but the experiences of instructors in these courses have remained largely unexplored in the discipline-based education research (DBER) communities. Here, we address this gap by reporting on the findings of a survey of instructors teaching introduction to QIS courses at institutions across the U.S., primarily at the undergraduate or hybrid undergraduate and graduate level, as well as follow-up focus interviews with six individual instructors. Key themes from this analysis include challenges and opportunities associated with the diversity of instructor and student backgrounds, student difficulties with the mathematical formalism (especially though not exclusively with linear algebra), and the need for better textbooks and curricular materials. We also find that while course topics are ostensibly similar, each course is crafted by its instructor to tell a different story about QIS and to uniquely balance goals such as accessibility and academic rigor, such that no canonical introduction to QIS course emerges from our dataset. We discuss the implications of this finding with regard to the benefits and risks associated with standardization of curricula as QIS coursework matures.

AB  - Research on racial and linguistic disparities in disability identification must be grounded on the dual nature of disability as an object of protection and a tool of stratification. This dual nature requires a situated research approach to understand the stratifying power of disability--Who is targeted? Where? How? By whom and to what consequences? I contrast this perspective with the traditional research approach that privileges a deficit and colorblind framing of racial disparities. The application of a colorblind ideology enables researchers to envision students of color as innately damaged and in need of remediation; thus, forming ideology-ontology circuits. I offer three strategies to disrupt these circuits in future learning disabilities research, namely the elimination of colorblind research strategies, the adoption of a historical imagination, and the discontinuation of Black and Brown abstractions.

AB  - The study aimed to examine the effects of design-based STEM activities developed for renewable energy sources on science teacher candidates' perceptions, attitudes, and behavioral orientations. The one-group pretest-posttest design was used. The participants comprised 40 second-grade teacher candidates studying at a public university, and the study lasted for 14 weeks. The data were collected using a renewable energy perception scale, renewable energy sources attitude scale, sustainable consumption behavior scale, and STEM product-performance observation form. The results demonstrated that design-based STEM activities towards renewable energy sources enhanced teacher candidates' perception, attitude, and behavior toward renewable energy sources. However, there was no statistically significant increase in the unneeded consumption sub-dimension of the sustainable consumption behavior scale and the renewable energy-environment relationship sub-dimension of the renewable energy perception scale.

AB  - We propose an innovative approach to teaching friction. Our approach aims to educate students on its microscopic nature by highlighting its origin in intermolecular interactions. We have designed a teaching sequence (TS) based on a set of experimental investigations of the properties of a gecko-inspired tape at different length scales. The TS has been conceived to unravel the peculiar behavior of this man-made, commercially available biomimetic material and to train students to identify the connection between the micrometer-scale patterning and the peculiar tribological properties. Specifically, our approach compares friction (and adhesion) to wetting, occurring at solid/solid and solid/liquid interfaces, respectively. The aim is to scaffold a correct mental model of real interfaces and disclose the common origin of both phenomena in intermolecular interactions. The TS has been devised according to the design-based research scheme and it was inspired by the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE) and the 5E paradigms. It has been tested and tuned with students at level 3 in the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), during several on-campus stages. We report here the details and results of pre- and post-tests, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, we measure success in terms of the students' comprehension of the link between contact area and friction and of the role of intermolecular forces. We are confident that the learning experience with our TS will lead students to recognize the enormous potential impact of surface patterning in technological applications, in a curiosity-driven manner that will likely result in students' interest in quantitative studies of science and technology.

AB  - The essence of Islamic education, in addition to the transfer of value and knowledge is the optimization of all human potential. Most of human potential rests on his brain. The science of studying the brain is neuroscience. Therefore, Islamic education and neuroscience can be hybridized in an interdisciplinary manner. The purpose of this study was to find new scientific varieties resulted from hybridization of Islamic education and neuroscience. This research is an interdisciplinary study with a qualitative approach in the form of library research. The source of the research data is the literature in the field of Islamic education and neuroscience that is explored and collected documentary and analyzed with content analysis. The results of the study showed that the concepts of "nasiyah" (crown) and "'aql" (mind) in the Quran have a correlation with the brain and mind in neuroscience. Both can be hybridized so as to find new varieties of science called the Islamic Education Neuroscience. This new branch of science has the potential to be equivalent to the scientific branches that have been developing so far, such as the philosophy of Islamic education, the psychology of Islamic education, the anthropology of Islamic education and so is the neuroscience of Islamic education. Educators, both teachers and lecturers who study this science can do stimulation and intervention to optimize students' brain potential in an integrated manner in learning Islamic diversity.

AB  - A key insight of a transdisciplinary perspective on second language acquisition (SLA) as articulated by the Douglas Fir Group (2016) is its usage-based understanding of language. Evidence on the fundamental role that usage plays in shaping individual language knowledge is no doubt compelling. However, while the force of social interaction in shaping language knowledge is acknowledged, missing are specifications of the jointly constructed actions and courses of action comprising social contexts of use. Also missing is a reconsideration of key SLA concepts engendered by a usage-based understanding of language. The intent of this paper is to redress these limitations. First, I summarize the research programs of conversation analysis and interactional linguistics, which take as their central task the specifications of the jointly constructed actions and courses of action comprising social contexts and thus significantly enhance a usage-based understanding of language. Then, arguing that more suitable conceptual tools are needed to better capture current understandings of language knowledge and objects of L2 learning, I offer repertoire, semiotic resources, and register as alternative terms to competence and grammar. I conclude with a proposal for a Conversation Analysis/Interactional Linguistics-based research program for further advancing understandings of SLA and transforming understandings of L2 pedagogy.

AB  - Writing successful academic conference abstracts is essential for PhD students to enable them to access world-class conferences for the presentation of their research. However, these students often face both discourse-structure and linguistic difficulties in writing their conference abstracts. This study evaluates the impact of genre, process, elicitation and guided learning instruction on students' performance in academic conference abstract writing. Participants are multidisciplinary L2 PhD students at a Sino-British university. The first dataset used for the impact evaluation comprises post-intervention written abstracts collected from 10 focal students. To evaluate the instruction, a scoring descriptor instrument adapted from the university's academic writing assessment rubric is used to grade the abstracts' move-structure, and linguistic features of cohesion, hedging, passive, and present simple. Trends in the scores are analysed statistically. The second dataset consists of students' questionnaire-elicited experiences of the instruction. Findings show improvements in post-intervention abstracts' move-structures and linguistic features, which suggests pedagogical effectiveness. Questionnaire responses also display positive perceptions of the pedagogy. Due to the impact of disciplinary genre materials, disciplinary discrepancy is more evident in linguistic structures than in move structures. Writer characteristics also appear to gravitate towards a discipline-centric writing ethos due to the impact of disciplinary-genre materials and the desire to enhance the abstract's selection chances. Thus, there is potential for language-feature functions, process writing, exact-genre materials and interactive learning process pedagogies to mediate learning and improvement in disciplinary L2 writing.

AB  - In this article, we suggest that competencies in working in intercultural and multidisciplinary environments are part of expected key skills in contemporary organisations. Higher educational institutions across the globe are pressured to contribute to the development of such key skills. Using social identity theory, through social network analysis of 113 postgraduate management students in one UK business school and follow-up focus group interviews (N = 16), we have identified three types of learners: Co-National Learners, Bridge-Building Learners, and Cross-National Learners. We argue that developing learning relationships in intercultural and multidisciplinary environments needs to go beyond a cultural-only approach, and the understanding of identity has an important place.

AB  - Teaching and learning in universities have shifted towards online education, and there is not enough scientific knowledge about suitable pedagogical design principles to guide the construction of hybrid learning spaces for today's university students. In this design-based research, we studied the benefits and challenges in reaching the expected learning outcomes of an e-course, "Collaboration and Professional Interaction Skills." The practical purpose was developing the pedagogical design of this e-course. The scientific objective was to build on the research about design principles that guide teachers in constructing e-courses, enabling in-depth learning in hybrid learning spaces. The pedagogical design was guided by six design principles. Empirical data (21 students' assignments and reflections, teacher's observations, data from the digital learning management system) were collected in two research cycles. Students were from different degree programmes of educational sciences. Thematic analysis of students' individually and collaboratively authored assignments was carried out in both research cycles. The most emphasised benefits and challenges concerned the combination of working and creating knowledge together, virtually, in a multidisciplinary group. Based on the results, practical recommendations were made for university-level pedagogical designs that facilitate effective and active collaboration and interaction, and learning of such competence.

AB  - This paper presents a way of utilizing interdisciplinary relations between two educational branches, Mathematics and its applications and Information technologies (ICT) in integrated learning by the use of the Scratch programming language. The authors also present how they understand the concept of integrated learning and why they have chosen to integrate mathematics and programming in Scratch. The situation regarding state testing in the Czech Republic and its outputs, which had been the main impulse for why to create presented activities, will be outlined. The main part of this paper is dedicated to created activities. They focus on topics of geometry and tessellations from the educational branch of mathematics and its application and topics of programming and vector graphics from educational ICT branch. At the end of the article, the authors describe the conducted pilot survey and its outcomes.

AB  - This article presents the Pilgrimage Model as a template for educators wishing to lead students on site-specific studies of engaged learning. During the 2015-2016 academic year, a group of Georgetown University students, faculty, and staff pursued the Pilgrimage Project, a year-long pedagogical experiment in interdisciplinary education and speculative design. Students researched Georgetown's historic Old North building from a variety of disciplinary angles and presented the results of their collective research in an on-site multimedia exhibit. The article analyzes the Pilgrimage Project from a practical perspective, as an effective means of delivering robust educational experiences, and from a theoretical perspective, as an example of speculative method in education research. As a model of interdisciplinary education, the Pilgrimage Model effectively merges disciplinary-specific course goals, in-depth student-led research, and student skill development in digital design and multimedia production.

AB  - With the introduction of "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS"), teachers have been called to find meaningful and engaging ways to teach science content while incorporating engineering practices and, to a lesser extent, computing and computational thinking. The task becomes even more complex when they also have to integrate mathematics under the umbrella of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education. To be of high quality, this integration needs to be intentional and specific, with consideration given to both content and context (Bryan, Moore, Johnson, & Roehrig, 2015). This article describes an integrated STEM unit where students worked on a project requiring an interdisciplinary solution authentic to complex problems in the real world (English, King, & Smeed, 2016). It also highlights core features that supported disciplinary engagement, improved interdisciplinary learning, and increased awareness and interest in engineering specifically and STEM more broadly, with the goal of providing a framework to support engineering education as situated within the broader context of STEM learning.

AB  - Fractals are geometric objects used to describe irregular shapes that have a fractional dimension and commonly appear in nature. Although several proposals for the study of perfect fractals at the basic level are present in the literature, only few proposals for the study of real fractals exist, which does not seem reasonable considering the wealth of the theme and its potentiality as an interdisciplinary topic. In this text, we present a simple and easily assimilable procedure to calculate the fractal dimension of any two-dimensional object. It only demands a computer with the free software ImageJ installed. This procedure is easily understandable, considering the basic school curriculum, and easily usable in a variety of school settings.

AB  - During the 2016 election season, the authors--a collection of staff, faculty, and students at a rural, four-year comprehensive college--piloted a new format for a student-driven, campus-wide, nonpartisan voter mobilization campaign anchored in a political science course and supported by a credit-bearing internship and advanced graphic design course. We argue that this project offers a model for how collaboration between student affairs and academic affairs can transform the nonpartisan voter mobilization campaign into a site for interdisciplinary, cross-campus service-learning projects that benefit the student participants and the campus community. This article outlines the advantages and challenges of the project and concludes with recommendations for those interested in implementing a similar program.

AB  - Creative dance is an engaging and empowering educational medium. Creative dance provides children with a comfortable, noncompetitive arena where they can explore, discover, and share what they think and feel in the purest of bodily expression. This manuscript highlights a standards based creative dance lesson designed to educate elementary students in grades 3 through 5 about the environmentally responsible activity of repurposing. Students are prompted to explore a sequence of movement tasks based on a poem about a repurposed quilt made from old jeans! In addition the implementation of the four learning modalities or "sensory channels": visual, auditory, kinesthetic and tactile, Moving Green, Going Green permit students to learn about their environment through their bodies, and capitalize on preferred senses while enhancing weaker ones. Key to this manuscript is the implementation of the movement framework--the foundation of creative dance. The movement framework outlines the components of dance: body, space, time, effort, and relationships. With the framework as a base to work from, teachers can effectively guide students through a process of thinking divergently, developing ideas, refining ideas, and ultimately expressing those ideas through movement that is unique to them. In addition the use of Universal Learning for Design (UDL) and how it can be used to support the inclusion of all learners is explained.

AB  - The arts have not received much attention from business and professional communication (BPC) scholars who are interested in workplace communication. This article begins to fill that gap by explaining a course focused on the BPC that artists produce in their careers. Students learned BPC genres by addressing arts situations: They crafted email pitches to promoters, took promotional photography, created crowdfunding proposals, and more. I argue that teaching artist communication can give a new context to existing BPC assignments, encourage interdisciplinary initiatives, and allow for the incorporation of natively digital communication genres into existing courses.

AB  - An expanded investment in interdisciplinary research has prompted greater demands to integrate knowledge across disciplinary boundaries. "Vision and Change" similarly made interdisciplinary expectations a key competency for undergraduate biology majors; however, we are not yet synchronized on the meaning of interdisciplinarity, making this benchmark difficult to meet and assess. Here, we discuss aspects of interdisciplinarity through a historical lens and address various institutional barriers to interdisciplinary work. In an effort to forge a unified path forward, we provide a working definition of interdisciplinary science derived from both the perspectives of science faculty members and scientific organizations. We leveraged the existing literature and our proposed definition to build a conceptual model for an Interdisciplinary Science Framework to be used as a guide for developing and assessing interdisciplinary efforts in undergraduate science education. We believe this will provide a foundation from which the community can develop learning outcomes, activities, and measurements to help students meet the "Vision and Change" core competency of "tapping into the interdisciplinary nature of science."

AB  - The majority of this essay describes the content, pedagogy, and assessments associated with an undergraduate, interdisciplinary honors seminar on science and religion. The seminar is structured around five major themes: (a) philosophy of science, religion, and their interactions, (b) historical and contemporary case studies, (c) the controversy over biological evolution in the United States as a necessary case study, (d) comparative religion and science, and (e) contemporary issues at the intersection of science and religion. I also describe the consistency between the seminar and the mission of the honors college at my institution. Given the prominence of both science and religion in contemporary culture, I assert that such a course is engaging for students and faculty alike and provides opportunities for multidisciplinary involvement.

AB  - This manuscript explores an interdisciplinary ecological framework to more effectively address LGBTQ interpersonal violence in schools. Specifically, authors utilize ecological systems theory, as well as social goals, to better understand points of intervention across contexts such as community, school, and Internet settings. An illustrative example is used to demonstrate how professional counselors, as well as related mental health and youth services professionals, can utilize social goals and ecological systems theory to intervene at different systemic levels and within their respective contexts. Implications for the interdisciplinary ecological framework are discussed, including cautions and areas for future research.

AB  - School counselors and special education teachers are most often the professionals called upon to support students with intensive, challenging behavioral and emotional needs. However, research suggests that many preparation programs fail to provide training specific for intensive evidence-based interventions. We review the context and need for interdisciplinary school counselor and special education teacher training and provide a perspective on potential directions for addressing this need in professional preparation.

AB  - In general engineering studies focus on the technical skills in their own discipline. However, in their subsequent industrial careers, a significant portion of their time needs to be devoted to non-technical skills. In addition, in an increasingly globalised world collaboration in teams across cultures and disciplines is paramount to the creation of new and innovative products. In order to enhance the non-technical skills for groups of engineering students a series of innovation courses has been arranged and delivered in close collaboration with an industrial company (Bang & Olufsen). These courses have been organised as summer schools called "Conceptual Design and Development of Innovative Products" (CD-DIP) and delivered outside the usual educational environment. In order to explore the impact of this single course, we have conducted a study among the students participating from 2007 to 2013. This has been carried out both qualitatively using interviews with selected students as well as quantitatively using a survey. The results are outstanding in demonstrating that the non-technical skills obtained in this single course have been of high value for a large portion of the students' subsequent professional life.

AB  - The survey data suggest a high technical and sufficient psychological readiness of Yaroslavl State University students to use mobile devices in learning. The results of the research prove that students have an above the average level of interest and motivation in learning with the help of mobile devices. Nevertheless, it is obvious that there is a need for popularizing mobile learning among students through organization of explanatory talks and encouragement on the part of the teaching staff. Two multidisciplinary cases with using modern IT-technologies in university educational process are presented. [For the complete proceedings, see ED579190.]

AB  - In response to the leaky STEM pipeline, particularly for girls, many schools have introduced integrated STEM (iSTEM) programs to enable students to solve problems using skills from each STEM area and hopefully enhance their interest in continuing with STEM subjects in senior-high school and university. We investigated whether gender differences in students' perceptions of classroom emotional climate and attitudes to STEM depend on whether students are undertaking iSTEM projects as part of a multidisciplinary curriculum (S, T, E "and" M) or unidisciplinary curriculum (S, T, E "or" M) and also whether they attend a government or nongovernment coeducational school. The sample consisted of 256 students in 24 coeducational grade 7-9 classes in 8 government schools and 157 students in 12 coeducational grade 7-10 classes in 6 nongovernment schools. Whereas boys were significantly more positive than girls in perceptions of clarity, motivation, consolidation and attitudes to iSTEM in coeducational government schools, there were no significant gender differences in coeducational nongovernment schools. Students of both genders in government schools were significantly more positive about all aspects of classroom emotional climate and attitudes than students of both genders in nongovernment schools, even after controlling for socioeconomic status. Also, females were slightly more positive about classroom emotional climate and in their attitudes in multidisciplinary STEM classes in government schools. This study suggests that multidisciplinary STEM classes could motivate girls to pursue STEM subjects in senior-high school and at university.

AB  - Objective: Pilot study to assess the efficacy of a multidisciplinary educational training program (OverdosED) designed to increase college students' knowledge of and confidence in their ability to appropriately recognize and respond to suspected overdose on depressant substances. Participants: Undergraduate students (n = 92) with Greek life affiliations at a moderately-sized private liberal arts college in the southeastern USA. Methods: Electronic surveys were administered before and after delivery of the training program. Questions assessing knowledge of depressant substance overdose were compared to determine the impact of the educational intervention. Questions assessing participants' confidence in their ability to recognize and respond to overdose and their perceptions of campus culture were also compared. Results: Mean composite scores on knowledge-based questions were significantly higher for the post-intervention survey compared to the pre-intervention survey. Confidence in knowledge also significantly increased after the intervention. Mean scores for survey responses related to campus culture were high at baseline but significantly increased after the intervention. Conclusions: OverdosED successfully increased college students' knowledge of and confidence in their ability to appropriately recognize and respond to suspected overdose on depressant substances, and positively influenced perceptions on campus culture.

AB  - In the past years Centers of Excellence (CoE) has risen to prominence as a funding instrument in science. The idea is that by focusing resources, people and attention within a center environment, and over a substantial time span, excellence in science can be promoted. Similarly, interdisciplinarity is often seen as an enabling condition or even necessary for frontier research. This article builds on a qualitative interview study with Swedish Centers of Excellence (CoE) directors, and asks the question: - how is interdisciplinarity governed and developed within a CoE environment, and what is its effects in terms of research processes and organization. The study presents a detailed account of a number of aspects of interdisciplinary governance, conditions and outcomes, and describes how these relate via specific mechanisms. Together the results illuminate how CoE governance creates pathways to interdisciplinarity, that allow collaboration to go beyond mere interaction, and towards integration of specialisms.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity has become part of contemporary university discourses on knowledge in both research and curriculum. The move to break down traditional disciplinary boundaries reflects emerging forms of enquiry into knowledge that are less hegemonic and more distributed, and more tuned to its production, practices and the needs of its practitioners. A focus on complex problems that draws on multiple knowledge domains and an emphasis on professional knowledge have engendered a loosening of discipline boundaries in the development of curriculum and degree programmes. In this case study, we investigated teaching practices across discipline boundaries: how interdisciplinary curriculum and teaching are understood, practiced and supported within an Australian university that typifies a discipline-based organisational structure. Through interviews with relevant academics, managers and professionals, we explored the challenges and strategies in sustaining interdisciplinary curricula that were managed between several disciplinary Schools. Our findings were two-fold: engagement with interdisciplinary knowledge had profound effects on academic culture and identities among participating students and teaching staff; and significant challenges arose in the coordination and administration of interdisciplinary education, with institutional structures highlighted as a contributing factor. While the literature on interdisciplinary education emphasises academic collaborations and leadership, there has been less attention to the role of institutional processes -- mediated by procedures, artefacts and routines -- in supporting and sustaining interdisciplinary education. Aspects of the case study are used to analyse the conflicting practices arising with interdisciplinary education, and to develop the potential for boundary crossing modes of interdisciplinary governance to counter the legacy of discipline-based structures.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity is heralded as a relatively new educational and research paradigm that can effectively address complex problems at disciplinary boundaries. Yet little is known about the extent to which interdisciplinarity has penetrated higher education, nor about how students and program administrators view its usefulness. Through a case study of one field, urban planning, we assessed the extent to which graduate students and program administrators understand and support interdisciplinarity in the departments. We also assessed the extent to which specific factors might affect levels of support. Our survey results suggest differing attitudes between students and administrators and diverse opinions as to whether interdisciplinarity provides a practicable approach to addressing societal challenges. We offer a model for fostering interdisciplinarity and developing empirical evaluations of programs.

AB  - Purpose: The sustainability of the global food system hinges on its environmental resiliency and safety, including the health and well-being of its labor force. Single disciplinary courses in liberal arts or science often fail to highlight the overlap between environmental and social vulnerabilities that lead to food insecurity and diminish the sustainability of food systems. This paper aims to present the design and delivery of a successfully co-taught, interdisciplinary module on agricultural labor and sustainable food systems as a case study. Design/methodology/approach: The authors designed a co-taught module in which they joined each other's respective history and science class sessions at the undergraduate business college where they teach. Innovating the cross-disciplinary content of food security, immigration status, labor exploitation and pesticide exposure, they approached sustainability from the disciplinary perspectives of labor history and environmental science to show how these elements had both unique and overlapping impacts across food systems levels. Comparisons between pre- and post-module survey responses, alongside assessments of a co-authored exam question, measured the effectiveness of this module is changing students' perspectives as food consumers and as citizens. Findings This module altered students' understanding and perspectives around issues of food systems sustainability. Assessments indicated that students increased their awareness of agricultural workers at the front end of the food system, during production; students also gained awareness beyond consumption as they came to see the connections between workforce invisibility and ecosystem degradation. Originality/value: These insights are valuable to educators at all institutional levels who seek to collaborate on sustainability initiatives and teaching, both in the singular, robust modules and in building modules that will lead to the development of entire courses focused on sustainability. The module described here builds on previous demonstrations of the value, significance and effectiveness of cross-disciplinary collaborations; it pioneers the use of the food system as the link between social and environmental sustainability education.

AB  - The purpose of this instrumental, multisite case study is to examine fidelity, adaptation, and differentiation challenges found at Wood Badge, a nationwide Boy Scouts of America training for adult volunteer leaders. Our iterative analysis of more than 900 pages of fieldnotes and 400 pages of documents revealed facilitators often explicitly taught syllabus content during the trainings. Observers noted 119 minor differentiations across trainings, notably involving facilitator delivery methods and the duration and scheduling of training segments. Facilitators observed 16 adaptations, which appeared to be based on external conditions at trainings or facilitator preferences, and just three instances of differentiation. Our analysis of the trainings surfaced key fidelity/adaptation issues like overadherence, conflicting notions of deviation, and the impact of preparation on fidelity. In addition, we identified factors influencing facilitators' use of adaptation and differentiation. Recommendations for large-scale trainings are made based on the study's findings.

AB  - There is a notable lack of opportunity for students in pre-service professional training programs and faculty in higher education to collaborate and work together, across disciplines within a common area of professional expertise. In this case, a faculty learning community (FLC) was formed to create a set of video-based simulations based on relevant topics for Committee on Special Education (CSE) meetings, used to inform the development of an Individualized Education Program. These materials were made available across departments and universities, establishing a common language and set of CSE practices. Additionally, a structured three-level text reading and discussion provided faculty with an opportunity for professional development, networking, and scholarship. The project was completed following Cox's 16 Recommendations for a Faculty Learning Community as a guideline for the successful implementation of the project, the creation of course materials, and analysis of faculty learning outcomes. It is important to note that the FLC process applies to a wide range of disciplines as a means of engaging faculty in responsive and reflective teaching practices as well as professional development.

AB  - A four-week global interdisciplinary service-learning project to Botswana, was developed to increase cultural humility and cross-cultural communication skills in 12 current and future educators of children with autism and developmental disabilities. Participants worked alongside peer educators in eight different special education units across different regions of Botswana to create curricular activities that can be used in classrooms in both countries. Instruction in Botswana education, culture, language, history, and traditions was provided along with immersion in daily Botswana life. The present study examines the impact of these experiences on participant growth of cultural humility and cross-cultural communication skills. Results indicated increases in cultural humility for all participants, with the greatest increases for the stages of integration and intercultural communication. Individual growth varied based on factors such as previous experiences, chronological age, and flexibility. In this paper, we discuss details of the project, results, limitations, and implications for practice.

AB  - The forces of globalization are magnifying the importance of interdisciplinary creative work. While the field of creativity studies always has been more open to interdisciplinary idea borrowing than many other fields, it can and should do more interdisciplinary synthesizing. This article begins with a discussion of the rationale for encouraging interdisciplinary work in the field and then explores several examples of constructs imported from various disciplines that can enrich theory and research in creativity studies. These constructs include market fundamentalism from economics, and networked science from various STEM fields. Some other candidates for importation also are discussed briefly.

AB  - In this article teachers will find a rationale and examples for connections between literature and other disciplines, such as history, science, art, political science, philosophy, and psychology. The article addresses the goal of the Connections standard, as defined by the "World-Readiness Standards for Learning Languages" (W-RSFLL) (NSFLEP, 2015), namely, to help students expand their knowledge, engage in critical thinking, and attempt to solve problems creatively. With this goal in mind, it examines two literary avenues for making connections: first, literature in the original language, and second, literature in translation. It demonstrates connections with history, political science, and art within a language or literature course. Some examples include the question of immigration through Marie-Thérèse Coliman-Hall's short story "Bonjour Maman, Bonne fête, Maman, [Greetings, Mama; Happy Mother's Day, Mama"]; the role of colonialism in French history through the poetry of Léopold Sédar Senghor; and the question of national identity through Daudet's La Dernière Classe ["The Last Class"]. The article also addresses literature in translation through examples taken from the author's personal experience in teaching an interdisciplinary course. Among the topics are the role of memory through Bergson and Proust, and Einstein's "space-time" through Proust and Bakhtin. This topic includes folk-tales, accessible in the original and translation. Finally, the article illustrates a multi-disciplinary approach to atomic warfare through the film "Hiroshima mon amour." It emphasizes the role of the language teacher in guiding students to make connections between language and content disciplines, notably through the three modes of communication, and illustrates the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to problem solving and critical thinking.

AB  - A collaboration between social work and nursing faculty created a curriculum to improve cultural awareness and knowledge of LGBT older population's health and quality of life. Social work and nursing students completed a pre/post survey following the educational intervention; results from this mixed methods study indicated positive change in attitudes as well as increased knowledge. Quantitative findings included statistically significant (using paired t-test) changes in four perceptual dimensions (need to acquire knowledge, attitudes regarding interaction comfort, experience with encounters, attitudes regarding treatment) and factual knowledge. Qualitative findings revealed four primary themes about how gender identity and sexual orientation influences health: (a) bias of health care providers, (b) access to quality care, (c) specific health care needs, and (d) health risks of LGBT older adults. This project impacted student learning, awareness, and sensitivity in working with LGBT older adults. Older adults continue to be the largest population needing healthcare; thus, professionals must be competent in providing culturally sensitive health care and demonstrate competency in practice as well as interpersonal interactions.

AB  - Interdisciplinary working plays an important role in achieving impact outside academia. One barrier to interdisciplinary working is the lack of mechanisms to assess contributions from outside the primary discipline. Positioning our research in debates about knowledge translation, we analyse the ability of narrative cases to assess the interdisciplinary contribution of one academic discipline, Human Resource Development (HRD), to impact. We take the example of the cases used to assess impact in the UK's 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation (REF 2014). While the narrative cases revealed the complexity of knowledge translation and the role of HRD practice in it, their authorship by a single discipline imposed a linear structure and prevented interdisciplinary contributions from HRD academics from being recognised in the formal assessment. To facilitate the assessment of interdisciplinary contributions to academic impact, we propose remodelling the knowledge translation process as a net of cases rather than a single chain.

AB  - Contribution: A systematic interdisciplinary engineering and technology instructional model using cutting-edge technologies is proposed in this research. This model consists of four key components: 1) interdisciplinary collaboration; 2) hands-on projects; 3) real-world simulations; and 4) cutting-edge technologies. The model was designed to engage students in the real-world engineering projects and experience through the following activities: 1) performing the design, fabrication, and lab testing; 2) modeling and analyzing testing samples; 3) conducting on-site experiments; and 4) performing data processing and analysis. Background: Engineering programs are challenged by the rapid development of innovative technologies. To address this challenge, it is required to provide engineering graduates with "soft skills" for the capability of project management, especially the communication and collaboration among disciplines through university education. Therefore, it is desired to develop a systematic interdisciplinary engineering and technology educational strategy. Research questions: 1) is the proposed systematic interdisciplinary instructional model appropriate and feasible to be integrated into the engineering curriculum? 2) what were the students' perceptions and experiences about the interdisciplinary model? 3) does the interdisciplinary model facilitate engineering students' soft skills, such as interdisciplinary communication and collaboration? and 4) does the interdisciplinary model help to enhance engineering students' real-world professional experience, develop design thinking and problem-solving skills, which will help them to transfer their learning experience from the classroom setting to the real-world setting? Methodology: A systematic interdisciplinary engineering and technology model was developed, implemented, and evaluated. Findings: The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed systematic instructional model were validated by various data sources. The tested model is recommended for broader adaptation in various STEM disciplines.

AB  - Collaboration between teachers and child support workers is seen as a promising way to effectuate inclusive practice in mainstream education. This paper aims to explore how co-location of services promotes transformation of practice, and to expand an analytic framework for interdisciplinary collaboration. By combining these two perspectives, we intend to contribute to both theory and practice. The data consist of semi-structured interviews that explore the experiences of teachers and child support workers who co-work in three schools for secondary education. A template analysis was used to examine collaboration in co-location, and to further develop the framework with which we began our empirical research. The initial template consisted of dimensions of knowledge sharing in relation to dimensions of trust and dimensions of identity. The results showed that proximity can be divided into three different types, being spatial proximity, organisational proximity and personal proximity. These types of proximity, in turn, can be related to knowledge sharing, trust and identity. The contribution of the expanded framework for practice lies in its potential to shed light on how processes in interdisciplinary collaboration can be shaped.

AB  - This study addressed the intractable issue of ensuring that all students, including those who are linguistically and culturally diverse, have access to high quality science education. We explored the efforts of two organizations in the United States (one that supports science teachers and one that focuses on language development) to design resources that can inform science instruction for multilingual learners. We used Bronstein's (2003) framework for interdisciplinary collaboration to shed light on the institutional, program, and interpersonal factors that defined and helped sustain the collaboration between the two organizations. The findings showcase what it takes to integrate equity, science, and language development considerations in resources designed to inform content-area instruction for multilingual learners. The paper adds to the nascent literature on the role of interdisciplinary collaboration in supporting the science education of multilingual students and is unique in its exploration of both the process and the product of this collaboration.

AB  - In this article, "presentism"--bringing current events into the classroom to discuss historically rooted structural inequalities (Spratt and Draxler 2019)--is examined as a pedagogical tool in the context of a service-learning class in which students participate with different Latinx partnerships. During COVID-19, this service-learning class has been restructured as a distance learning experience where students meet synchronously with different schools organizing projects that range from bilingual readings to university and career orientations. A presentist pedagogy is employed to explore how COVID-19 has exacerbated the inequalities in Latinx communities and how these inequalities relate to current and historical issues of access, language, and race. It is argued that embracing a presentist perspective in Hispanic Studies is necessary to make our courses relevant to the present crisis.

AB  - This manuscript discusses the creation of online strategies to support belonging while de-stressing for learning community student participants during the compounded stress of the world epidemic of COVID-19 and final exams. De-stress techniques were implemented via Instagram Live and were presented and facilitated as an easily accessible activity to enhance the importance of well-being for students and provide a sense of community during quarantine social distancing/restrictions. These strategies were intended to incorporate a holistic approach to working with students to help build a supportive learning community and overall well-being (SAMHSA, 2014). Discussion includes implications for a holistic/inclusive approach to establishing a online learning community event including an interdisciplinary collaborative approach. The authors examined strategies, which engaged students in effective holistic de-stress life skills.

AB  - Ecological learning is enriched when students can apply course content to their own communities and gain an understanding and experience for deploying sustainable practices. Such merging of content, application, and place requires an interdisciplinary approach to grapple with the ecological and cultural issues more holistically that sustainability education explores. Guided by the ecological pedagogy of David Orr, founder of the Oberlin Project, we devised a pilot study that combines course content in environmental science, cultural studies, and writing with place-based, experiential, and hands-on learning to empower students to critically analyze their lifestyles and engage in activism for change.

AB  - Family involvement is a cornerstone of early intervention (EI). Therefore, positive caregiver outcomes are vital, particularly in caregiver-implemented interventions. As such, caregiver instructional approaches should optimize adult learning. This study investigated the comparative efficacy of coaching and traditional caregiver instruction on caregiver outcomes across EI disciplines. A systematic search for articles was conducted using PRISMA guidelines. Meta-analysis methodology was used to analyze caregiver outcomes, and a robust variance estimate model was used to control for within-study effect size correlations. Seven relevant studies were ultimately included in the analysis. A significant, large effect of coaching on caregiver outcomes was observed compared to other models of instruction (g = 0.745, SE = 0.125, p = 0.0013). These results support the adoption of a coaching framework to optimize caregiver outcomes in EI. Future research should examine how coaching and traditional instruction can be used in tiered intervention models with a variety of populations.

AB  - In recent years, many institutions have transformed traditional classrooms (TCs) into technology-rich active learning classrooms (ALCs) to accommodate the pedagogical concept of "active learning". In order to investigate the impact of ALCs on teaching and learning, we observed an instructor teaching in an ALC for an entire academic year, audio/video-recorded every class and took field notes. A focus group discussion was conducted with faculty from six allied health disciplines who taught weekly classes in the ALC and an online survey was distributed to students who took those classes. Data was then analysed using a qualitative constant comparative method (CCM). Findings indicated that the ALC generated greater teaching and learning enjoyment, deepened engagement, amplified interaction, enhanced group activity efficiency and fostered the development of creative ideas. All these features were interrelated and created a synergistic effect on student learning.
