AB  - Jamestown is at the heart of any teaching and learning of colonial American history. Stories of John Smith and Pocahontas are learned by elementary and secondary students across the United States. In Virginia, Jamestown is first taught in third grade and revisited five more times from historical, political, economic, and geographic perspectives. However, the history of Jamestown is taught principally as a place, a series of events, and people from long ago with little consideration of its place in the world today. The reality is that Jamestown Island, the location of the first permanent English settlement in the Americas, is today part of a thriving metropolitan area of approximately 1.7 million people. By examining a local policy issue such as plans to build power transmission lines across the James River in Virginia, students can investigate significant questions related to urban sprawl and the environment.

AB  - This article analyzes the process of institutionalizing interdisciplinary graduate programs in Brazil, which has over more than four decades of experience implementing masters and doctoral problem-oriented programs designed to operate outside the disciplinary structure of universities. Brazil has a high degree of centrality and government regulation, requiring systematic performance reports. The main focus of this case study is the bottlenecks and lessons emerging from programs focused on sustainability, environmental management, and environment and society, all of which are strictly supervised by a national system of accreditation and evaluation. The article includes detailed presentation of one particular graduate program that has existed for twenty years, the Sustainable Development Center at the Universidade de Brasília. Several overall topics are also considered, including the idea that interdisciplinarity is an opportunity to integrate knowledge needed for confronting complex problems and does not compete with disciplinary efforts towards progress in science.

AB  - Purpose: Online learning is developing rapidly in higher education. As a result, in the Initial Teacher Education Division at The University of Northampton, UK, academics have experimented with methods to embed blogs and online communities into courses to enhance learning for staff and students. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: This paper critically analyses the approach used to examine media-rich multimodal content that was shared through these tools. Findings: The paper models how blogs and communities have enhanced interdisciplinary subject teaching, staff development and student engagement. This is achieved by sharing case studies from the courses which model the strengths and limitations of practices adopted. Originality/value: Focused discussion demonstrates how reflexivity, communities of practice and experimentation with technological teaching strategies fuel the learning that occurred.

AB  - Biocompatible and biodegradable block copolymers composed of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and aliphatic polyester are a class of promising biomaterials. Herein, a teaching experiment was designed to furnish undergraduates with a reliable method to synthesize an amphiphilic poly([epsilon]-caprolactone)-PEG-poly([epsilon]-caprolactone) (PCL-PEG-PCL) triblock copolymer via ring-opening polymerization of [epsilon]-caprolactone using PEG as the macroinitiator and diphenyl phosphate as the green organocatalyst; the concentrated solution of synthetic polymer in water was then demonstrated as an injectable thermogel with a sol-gel transition upon heating. Ten students serving as volunteers successfully synthesized PCL-PEG-PCL copolymer, and then analyzed their specimens using various techniques including proton-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction and learned the principles of instruments. Finally, students prepared an aqueous polymer solution, and observed its interesting spontaneous physical gelation upon heating via the tube-inverting approach and dynamic rheological analysis. The experimental features captured the students' attention and made them more enthusiastic participants. This newly designed teaching experiment afforded senior undergraduates an excellent opportunity to consolidate basic concepts and principles in books with practical experimental sessions in the field of polymer chemistry, analytical chemistry, and materials science.

AB  - Traditionally, university students' education is siloed into disconnected courses and programs. Increasingly, however, there is a trend toward providing interdisciplinary learning experiences to help students develop meaningful skills for becoming more successful in their chosen careers. In this paper, we describe an instructional design project in which we engaged to develop an interdisciplinary minor in design thinking at a university in the western United States. This effort involved uniting faculty from the colleges of education, business, fine arts and communications, and engineering and technology. After reviewing our needs analysis process, we describe the structure of the minor itself, and how it was designed to respond to our analysis. We also discuss the following lessons learned throughout our project: (1) common vision is the beginning, not the end, of interdisciplinary design thinking; (2) personal relationships are crucially important in interdisciplinary design thinking; and (3) iterative prototyping improves interdisciplinary design thinking. Using principles such as those discussed in this paper, we believe the field of instructional design can help lead the way in the development of additional interdisciplinary learning experiences in higher education.

AB  - This article reports on a modified faculty learning community (FLC) composed of university faculty from science education and a variety of engineering disciplines. This research investigated the efficacy of an intentional, long-term, ongoing, interdisciplinary collaboration to benefit the development of science teacher education, including engineering, across the kindergarten to college spectrum (K-16). The successful implementation of the modified FLC, and systematic structure provided by project leadership, led to beneficial results for both education and engineering faculty members. A multiple case study approach was used to evaluate faculty motivation to participate in an interdisciplinary FLC; whether FLC participation contributed to the professional growth and was able to overcome any challenges for faculty participants; which characteristics of FLCs contributed to project success and mitigated any challenges; and if effective collaboration and overcoming challenges was supported by the overall structure of the modified FLC. Findings indicated that faculty experienced valuable professional growth; with only a minor exception, challenges within groups were able to largely be addressed and did not hinder group progress; and that FLC project leadership structure helped guide groups to successful outcomes. Findings conclude with benefits and advice for others on how to establish successful structured interdisciplinary collaborations and mitigate challenges encountered. Ultimately, FLC projects from this study contributed to the support of K--12 teachers in successfully using the Next Generation Science Standards, including the engineering design component, within their classrooms.

AB  - The "Next Generation Science Standards" identifies argumentation as a central practice, and, subsequently, energizes teachers to develop students' capacity to write well-reasoned arguments and support their claims with relevant evidence. These skills now expected in the science classroom have long been central to instruction in English-language arts. This article overviews the design and delivery of a first-time interdisciplinary collaboration between three teachers, representing English language arts, science, and a teacher-librarian. Their integrated unit was based on principles of scientific argumentation. Recounting the experience from the perspectives of the teachers, and informed by observations and interviews conducted, discussion centers on the practical aspects of unit delivery and meeting intended goals. This article thematically explores qualitative data collected from the teachers, including individual reflections and a focus group interview, as well as classroom observation and student post-unit survey data. Drawing on the experience from the inaugural implementation, we discuss considerations for future efforts and implications for the broader audience.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to explore how elementary preservice teachers' mathematics-science integrated teaching strategies changed as a result of participating in exemplary interdisciplinary activities with multiple themes across school curricula. The participating elementary preservice teachers (n = 28) were recruited for this study from the College of Education students enrolled at a medium-sized southwestern research university in the United States. A qualitative methodology with pre-and-post data collection from open-ended surveys was used in the current study to explore the development of preservice teachers' mathematics teaching strategies with connections to science themed activities before and after an 8-week intervention. In general, the results from the pre-and-post surveys revealed that the preservice teachers' interdisciplinary knowledge of using science-themed activities as instructional approaches for teaching mathematics had remarkable changes across all four science content areas including physics, chemistry, biology, and environmental and space science. This study provided additional empirical evidence on how contextualized mathematics educational activities, in the current case using the association between science and mathematics, can be used as effective teacher education resources for developing teachers' capacity for designing mathematics lessons.

AB  - Numerous higher education researchers have studied the ways in which students' or academics' beliefs and conceptions affect their educational experiences and outcomes. However, studying the learning-teaching relationship has proved challenging, requiring researchers to simultaneously address both the invisible internal world(s) of the student and teacher, and the observable communicative world they inhabit. This paper describes the development of a methodological approach for exploring the learning-teaching relationship based on an interdisciplinary conceptual model -- The Learning-Teaching Nexus (LTN). We describe the ways in which disciplinary perspectives within the model were translated into methodological processes, enabling us to study teaching and learning as both individual experiences and a shared communicative relationship. The paper aims to provide researchers with a staged approach for studying learning and teaching together, and to illustrate how interdisciplinary perspectives can be translated into staged but integrated methodological processes in order to address complex educational questions.

AB  - Current debates around the concept of boundary crossing stress the importance of boundary objects in bringing people together to share understandings. We argue that the boundary object is of secondary importance, and that what is important for the transformational potential of interdisciplinary understanding is opportunities for "boundary experiences". We present three examples of interdisciplinary boundary experiences: the first describes a collaboration between an education academic and speech and language therapists; the second presents a research opportunity experienced by a group of education, architecture, and sociology academics, alongside practising architects and educators; and the third reflects on the process of co-production involving academics from education, medical education, cultural and heritage studies, sociology, music, and social computing. We argue that engaging in shared landscapes of practice, when accompanied by opportunities for dialogue and for developing relationships, creates meaningful moments of service, and thus has transformational potential. However, we believe that this necessitates a new way of thinking about research methodology. We advocate a co-production approach that is grounded in developing and maintaining relationships, and routinely provides opportunities for boundary experiences. This requires a more open and flexible approach to research design than is currently usually promoted within academic research infrastructures.

AB  - During the second industrial revolution (1870-1914), scientists moved away from trial-anderror methods to more systematically apply the principles of chemistry, physics, and biology (Mokyr 1998). The authors chose this period as the foundation of a project-based learning (PBL) unit integrated with the ninth-grade U.S. history curriculum (Thomas 2000). The unit encouraged students to associate the second industrial revolution's many inventions (in such areas as manufacturing, transportation, and communication) with methodical investigation and professional collaboration rather than random eureka moments. The goal was to develop student understandings about the evolution of different inventions within their scientific and societal contexts. The unit culminated with students producing and presenting timelines of significant inventions from the period. This article presents a four-phase approach to implementing the PBL unit that links scientific innovation to social context (Larmer and Mergendoller 2015). The authors launched this project at a STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and math) academy in Jersey City, New Jersey. The small public high school offers all students a college preparatory program grounded in hands-on, project-based activity. The PBL unit took place in six two-hour weekly sessions.

AB  - In this study, students' views on the process of authentic assessment and implementation of a unit which was designed by using conceptbased interdisciplinary approach were examined. To achieve this, the influence of implementation on teaching-learning process and also students' perceptions about authentic assessment were investigated. The study was conducted as a case study which is one of the qualitative research designs. The sampling group was composed of 14 students. Data collected through interviews, observations and journals were analyzed with the help of content analysis method. Results indicate that students thought that the implemented activities were different from the previous ones. These activities made students' interest into lessons to increase and contributed to developing positive attitude and working collaboratively. Students also thought that authentic assessment activities were different from previous ones in terms of being oriented to learning process, being student-centered, requiring metacognitive strategies and usage of information about various disciplines. Interdisciplinary activities and the process of authentic assessment prepared by teachers consciously provided beneficial contributions for students to take responsibility of their learning and for teachers to make more realistic assessment. For this reason, it is useful for teachers to develop their skills in designing interdisciplinary programs and authentic assessment.

AB  - We argue for an interdisciplinary pedagogical approach that we call the Integration of Research and Education in the Classroom, which highlights and crosses disciplinary boundaries to challenge each field's assumptions, limitations, conceptual and interpretive purview. We use a set of examples that center on problematizing various aspects of the concept of indigeneity in the Spanish Colonial Period of Latin America. These examples draw explicitly on material from literary and culture studies, archaeology and anthropology, and foster students' critical thinking about the works of early indigenous authors such as the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega and Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala. We show how an Integration of Research and Education in the Classroom approach provides rich fodder for classroom discussions as well as scholarship.

AB  - The identification of conflict and development of common ground, important steps in the interdisciplinary research process, become challenging when applied to solving complex real-world problems that involve opposing interest groups, especially those whose members do not possess academic or interdisciplinary training. This article examines psycho-social mechanisms that can complicate the interdisciplinary process in solving such problems, using attempts to solve the problem of anthropogenic climate change to exemplify the situation. Understanding the mechanisms of conflict as well as strategies of conflict resolution can improve the interdisciplinary research process in its application to complex real-world problems.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate an interdisciplinary international service learning program and its impact on student sense of cultural awareness and competence using the Campinha-Bacote's (2002) framework of cultural competency model. Seven undergraduate and one graduate student from Human Development and Nutrition Science disciplines participated in the program. Reflections from a synthesis paper post-travel were analyzed using an inductive approach. Six themes emerged from the reflective journals and were applied to Campinha-Bacote's cultural competency constructs. Participating and learning together while reflecting helped deepen and progress this process for ISL students. Overall, the experience proved to be an effective educational tool for sensitizing students towards cultural competency within interdisciplinary programs.

AB  - Students in colleges and universities need to be able to learn how to communicate effectively both within the specialized arenas of their chosen disciplines and, increasingly, with a wide variety of public and professional audiences. One way to accomplish this goal is to integrate the development of effective writing and speaking skills into both our disciplinary and interdisciplinary classrooms. In this essay, we suggest that faculty to adopt a "rhetorical perspective" in their teaching, regardless of discipline, in order to capitalize on already existing faculty expertise and empower students. Specifically, a rhetorical perspective integrating speaking and writing can help students to become more active agents in their intellectual development, can help faculty design assignments and activities that relate directly to course goals and learning outcomes, and can provide a framework for feedback that can facilitate student learning.

AB  - This article aims to convince readers of the value of intersecting the scholarship of interdisciplinarity with the field of argumentation studies. The interdisciplinarity literature has not much engaged with the vehicle that carries interdisciplinary learning, languages, and locutions: the argument. On the argumentation studies side, despite the diverse interests of these scholars, not many have studied how reasoning proceeds in interdisciplinary inquiries. To aid bridge-building from both sides, I use the example of interdisciplinary abductive reasoning to show how the two fields can benefit from each other. The article proceeds as thin, comparative case studies thickened by theory. By analyzing two extended cases of inquiry cast in Douglas Walton's argumentation terms, I argue Walton's model is necessary but not sufficient for understanding and dealing with the unique challenges of interdisciplinary abduction. I propose, instead, we add the PEPR model (Pattern Recognition, Explanation Imagination, Pattern Matching, and Reporting) to help us focus on the data to be explained while we lean on Walton's model to understand the people doing the explaining. I conclude argumentation studies and interdisciplinary theory can be mutually enlightening.

AB  - For 12 years, Denise Gillman has taught the course Science on the Stage at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia. The plays studied awaken intellectual curiosity and understanding of human nature and complex scientific ideas within the framework of a good story and can do so for students of every major. This article presents how science-themed plays build interdisciplinary bridges in the classroom, create collaborative inquiry-based learning models, and launch creative research pathways for undergraduates. It explores the use of these plays as an interdisciplinary springboard by sharing exercises and writing assignments that engage various learners. It also exemplifies, through student work and two case studies, how students' research and creative investigation of these plays have originated questions that explore urgent problems and led them into capstone experiences, research projects, and conference presentations.

AB  - An interdisciplinary undergraduate research program with international summer fieldwork at Mount Saint Mary's University, Los Angeles trains undergraduates in research methodologies (cancer laboratory techniques, cross-cultural survey research, and policy analysis); collects fieldwork data in global settings and the United States; and compares, analyzes, and presents the results at professional conferences and in publications. The program develops leadership skills and teamwork necessary for student success and retention in STEM fields. Participants learn about the molecular, environmental, and nutritional causes of cancer and about local and policy-level disparities in health-care access in the United States and globally. This combination of coursework, summer research, international field study, and leadership training can be an effective way to increase success and retention rates of undergraduate women in STEM fields.

AB  - Educational approaches that enable students to actively and directly participate in "real-world" projects are increasingly recognized as valuable pedagogical tools and, as such, being incorporated into university curriculums worldwide. Though not traditionally associated with political science courses, project-based international service learning presents a tremendous opportunity to bring classroom concepts and theories to life, provide an active approach to addressing international challenges, and assist students in the development of the hands-on, problem-solving, team-based, critical-thinking skills that are increasingly important to employers across all sectors. This article seeks to encourage political science faculty to incorporate international service learning--and/or project-based approaches--into their educational offerings. Through examination of the course "Global Synthesis in Liberal Arts and Engineering Studies" at California Polytechnic State University, we have identified multiple factors that can help promote successful execution of project-based international service learning as a pedagogical tool, and provide additional suggestions for faculty interested in adopting specific aspects of these educational approaches, and/or in doing so closer to home.

AB  - In this article we describe and evaluate processes utilized to develop an online learning module on mathematical modelling for pre-service teachers. The module development process involved a range of professionals working within the STEM disciplines including mathematics and science educators, mathematicians, scientists, in-service and pre-service secondary mathematics teachers. Development of the module was underpinned by Bybee's five E's enquiry-based approach and Goos et al.'s twenty-first century numeracy model. Module evaluation data is examined in relation to the quality of pre-service teachers' learning experiences and interview data from the study is analysed through the lens of 'boundary crossing'. While the evaluation of the module was generally positive, aspects that required improvement were also identified including more meaningful inclusion of pre-service teachers and other stakeholders in the development process.

AB  - Health care researchers and practitioners are increasingly asked to work across disciplines (or, in keeping with the conference theme, "Between the Tides") to deal with complex health issues. But working with individuals from different fields is more challenging than it sounds. Working across disciplines can result in tension and miscommunications. Furthermore, to explore interactions among disciplines requires breaking down disciplinary boundaries and creating a common framework and language to define, analyze, and develop new approaches. This paper explores the benefits and challenges of teaching transdisciplinarity in a discipline-centred world, including a description of the journey of one post-graduate research training program as it strives to help student researchers break down disciplinary borders and develop a common framework to approach a particular health issue--in this case, the problem of substance misuse and addictions.

AB  - The Scholars of Studying Teaching Collaborative engaged a dozen faculty members from 12 specializations and 4 colleges at a large public university in a 2-year teaching and research project with the goal of learning about and enacting a self-study of professional practice. Participants were selected from various disciplines to provoke alternative perspectives in whole group and critical friend teams. While we each conducted a self-study, we also designed and enacted a meta-study to assess our professional development within the context of the collaborative. We analyze the potential of engaging in collective self-study and report how the methodological challenges initiated transformational learning that bridged theory and praxis. Learning the self-study methodology was complex, but such concentration multiplied the impact of both personal and professional transformation. The study benefits faculty from a broad range of disciplines, at diverse stages in their academic careers, and working at every level of the academic hierarchy.

AB  - Bioprocess engineering is a highly interdisciplinary field of study which is strongly benefited by practical courses where students can actively experience the interconnection between biology, engineering, and physical sciences. This work describes a lab course developed for 2nd year undergraduate students of bioprocess engineering and related disciplines, where students are challenged with a real-life bioprocess-engineering application, the production of recombinant protein in a fed-batch process. The lab course was designed to introduce students to the subject of operating and supervising an experiment in a bioreactor, along with the analysis of collected data and a final critical evaluation of the experiment. To provide visual feedback of the experimental outcome, the organism used during class was "Escherichia coli" which carried a plasmid to recombinantly produce enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) upon induction. This can easily be visualized in both the bioreactor and samples by using ultraviolet light. The lab course is performed with bioreactors of the simplest design, and is therefore highly flexible, robust and easy to reproduce. As part of this work the implementation and framework, the results, the evaluation and assessment of student learning combined with opinion surveys are presented, which provides a basis for instructors intending to implement a similar lab course at their respective institution.

AB  - Social work education has a long and successful history of developing change agents through bachelor of social work, master's of social work, and PhD programs, but these programs often create boundaries limiting the reach and infusion of social work perspectives. With rapid changes in social, economic, and political contexts, students from all academic concentrations need to understand how community action and social change improves society. Using systems and community practice frameworks, this article provides an in-depth case study of one university's model of an undergraduate multidisciplinary minor bridging social work philosophy with other academic disciplines. We explore the model and its development, with specific discussion of the lessons learned in creating and sustaining a multidisciplinary minor, its effect on students, and its implications for social work.

AB  - Many organisations are under increasing pressures to recruit and retain creative individuals as a core asset in the emerging knowledge economy. In universities, such people are often academics who focus on high impact, innovative and interdisciplinary research. Yet, instead of feeling supported, many of these academics face structural, epistemological and socio-cultural challenges. This paper reviews the role of creativity across disciplines in higher education and draws on interviews of 10 senior interdisciplinary leaders from the UK and Australia to discuss motivational aspects of creativity, challenges of pursuing creative work and how creativity through interdisciplinarity can be supported in higher education. Leadership styles based on the various conceptions of creativity are proposed and further research is discussed.

AB  - This article analyzes the need for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) educational programs and academicians to develop interdisciplinary educational and training opportunities with other healthcare disciplines. A literature review was conducted on EMS education and interdisciplinary approaches in healthcare education. In general, support for both didactic and simulated interdisciplinary education in healthcare is supported by positive impacts on student learning and improved patient outcomes. Support for interdisciplinary approaches in EMS education was constructed by applying research on interdisciplinary healthcare education to the identified criticisms of EMS education. A critical analysis of the literature allowed for recommendations to be made on the implementation of and further research for interdisciplinary approaches in EMS education. This article supports EMS students to be educated in a way that is reflective of a profession that must work collaboratively to provide out-of-hospital healthcare.

AB  - This article considers how professional writing courses can prepare students in various disciplines for the workforce. Specifically, I argue for Writing in the Disciplines (WID) internships where students learn to write documents relevant for their careers while participating in practical work experiences. In the WID internships I describe, instructors collaborate with coordinators across campus to establish writing-intensive internships that focus on the needs of students and the community partner. This article illustrates the collaborative endeavors of three internships, highlighting the challenges and lessons learned from WID internships.

AB  - Teaching in higher education poses unique sets of challenges, especially for academics in the engineering, built sciences and information science education disciplines. This article focuses on how reflective collaboration can support academics in their quest to find unique solutions to challenges in different academic contexts. A reflective collaboration framework was applied during a three-year interpretive research process at an Engineering, Information Technology and Built Environment Faculty in a residential research intensive university in South Africa. Interdisciplinary reflective collaboration was found to bring richness and depth into investigations of complex teaching challenges. This framework provides a structure to support the transformation of teaching challenges into learning opportunities through the promotion of dialogue, critique and reflection between engineering and education academics.

AB  - The article studies a way of enhancing student cognition by using interdisciplinary project-based learning (IPBL) in a higher education institution. IPBL is a creative pedagogic approach allowing students of one area of specialisation to develop projects for students with different academic profiles. The application of this approach in the Ural State University of Economics resulted in a computer-assisted learning system (CALS) designed by IT students. The CALS was used in an analytical chemistry course with students majoring in Commodities Management and Expertise ("expert" students). To test how effective the technology was, the control and experimental groups were formed. In the control group, learning was done with traditional methods. In the experimental group, it was reinforced by IPBL. A statistical analysis of the results, with an application of Pearson ?[superscript 2] test, showed that the cognitive levels in both IT and "expert" experimental groups improved as compared with the control groups. The findings demonstrated that IPBL can significantly enhance learning. It can be implemented in any institution of higher or secondary education that promotes learning, including the CALS development and its use for solving problems in different subject areas.

AB  - The acquisition of both transversal and specific competences cannot be achieved using conventional methodologies. New methodologies must be applied that promote the necessary competences for proper professional development. Interdisciplinary projects can be a suitable tool for competence-based learning. A priori, this might be complicated, as subjects are traditionally studied at the university level in isolated compartments, with a fragmented structure. Taking advantage of the creation of new degree programs in Mechanical Engineering and Electronic Engineering and Industrial Automaton, in the 2010-11 academic year we decided to add an interdisciplinary project (IP) to our teaching methodology. The importance of this project lies in the fact that it requires the participation of all the courses in all the academic years in the degree program. The present article explains the methodology used in the interdisciplinary project and how it was implemented in the first year of the Mechanical Engineering and Electronic Engineering and Industrial Automaton degree programs. Furthermore, an evaluation is conducted of all four years of the interdisciplinary project, revealing the main problems with its execution and how they have been addressed.

AB  - Scientists, researchers, and educators have promoted the improvement of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education by incorporating an interdisciplinary approach to the study of STEM; but current research offers little guidance about how this change can occur. This study expands on a new body of research examining faculty leadership in institutional change. Utilizing the "tempered radical framework" developed by Meyerson and Scully (1995) and later applied to the higher educational context by Kezar, Bertram Gallant, and Lester (2011), the current research examines faculty leadership in the implementation of an interdisciplinary STEM bridge program in biotechnology. This qualitative study relied primarily on the analysis of interviews with key faculty at four community colleges. The data revealed that faculty leaders employ strategies identified by Meyerson and Scully (1995). Further, the results of this study indicate that characteristics of tempered radical leadership may be more important than specific strategies identified by Kezar et al. (2011). First, tempered radicals are boundary spanners, able to translate their vision to appeal to the values of different stakeholders. Second, tempered radical faculty leaders maintain cognitive complexity, or the ability to perceive change from a variety of perspectives, revealing the importance of collective sensemaking around the change effort. Third, tempered radicals are savvy organizational insiders able to navigate the organizational culture and its systems and are viewed as legitimate change agents within their institutions. Understanding the characteristics of effective faculty leaders may offer guidance to other faculty interested in leading interdisciplinary change in their institutions.

AB  - Higher education is challenged to produce innovative, collaborative and interdisciplinary knowledge in response to increasing social demands. Faculty are often ill-prepared to engage in such work, raising questions as to the balance between disciplinary identity and interdisciplinary engagement. This article examines the experiences of 40 students enrolled in an interdisciplinary PhD programme. How might scholars embarking on their academic career develop an interdisciplinary identity? The data suggest the importance of a strong disciplinary foundation, an understanding of the integrative process, the recognition of interdisciplinary outcomes and the ability to participate in collaborative research. The conclusions offer insight into how faculty and doctoral students might conceptualise interdisciplinary education.

AB  - This paper presents an effort to create a unified model for conducting and assessing undergraduate dissertations, shared by all disciplines involved in computer game development at a Swedish university. Computer game development includes technology-oriented disciplines as well as disciplines with aesthetical traditions. The challenge has been to create a unified process and assessment procedure while maintaining the individual disciplines' academic standards. The unification has been achieved through the development of the Interdisciplinary Dissertation Model--a shared model where the assessment is focused on fundamental academic principles, and there is a clear separation between summative and formative assessment and well-defined interaction loops between examiners, supervisors and students. Examiners from all involved disciplines have regular meetings focusing on creating an interdisciplinary view on the summative assessment of undergraduate dissertations. The model developed has been successful in that it allows for a unified process for disciplines from fundamentally different academic traditions. The quality of the examined dissertations has been evaluated in a national evaluation. The result shows that all participating disciplines meet the requirements from their respective communities. This shows that the proposed model successfully unifies disciplines without sacrificing the quality in any discipline.

AB  - This paper discusses the promotion of critical thinking through an interdisciplinary curriculum design using multidisciplinary faculty as well as details the implementation of an experiential short-term study abroad program in China. To achieve this educational goal of critical thinking, along with meeting the requirements specific to each course, the program was built on a framework using two interrelated approaches--theme-based interdisciplinary curriculum and cultural immersion. The theme-based interdisciplinary curriculum was constructed on three principles (the ability to pose great questions that encompassed drawing knowledge and skills from each discipline, acquiring global awareness, and developing glocal awareness). Cultural immersion was accomplished through carefully selected site visits, activities, and assignments. Students' experiences, reflections, and applications were assessed through formative and summative evaluation.

AB  - The roles and functions of a school psychologist are multifaceted. School psychologists are traditionally trained in areas of assessment, intervention, consultation, and program evaluation, though they often participate in prevention and crisis intervention efforts and program evaluation (Harvey & Struzziero, 2008). School psychologists work at district, building, and individual student levels to provide comprehensive and effective services to children and families. Despite a wide range of responsibilities, the school psychologist works in conjunction with other school professionals (e.g., general and special education teachers, speech-language pathologists, audiologists, social workers, principals) and parents to foster individual student success. This chapter presents the general roles and responsibilities of the school psychologist, as well as the school psychologist's role within an interdisciplinary team when making appropriate educational decisions.

AB  - This article examines the ways in which art and aesthetics provide powerful and rich models for inquiry and connection, facilitating fresh perception, conceptualization, and engagement in qualitative research. The very engagement with research parallels the engagement with the arts. In this engagement, problem setting and problem solving, the conceptual and the embodied, the analytic and the holistic, are interconnected and interdependent. This article discusses a specific pedagogy used in the author's research courses to develop and nurture this inquiring mindset: a museum activity around consonant and dissonant artworks ("bounded systems") that targets the skills of observation and conceptualization, the identification of relevant contexts for inquiry, and the generation of directions for further inquiry.

AB  - The concept of energy is widely employed in introductory science courses. However, the term energy is defined and utilized in different ways depending on the context, even within a given discipline. Through the lens of metaphor theory, these various definitions of energy are seen as metaphors that highlight and obscure characteristics of energy. Working under this framework, undergraduate students in introductory biology, chemistry, and physics courses were asked to write analogies that reflect their understanding of the role of energy in the context of ecosystems (n?=?49), chemical reactions (n?=?36), mechanical systems (n?=?65), and electrical circuits (n?=?44). These analogies were analyzed qualitatively using metaphor theory to gain understanding of how students conceptualize energy in these different contexts. The results of this study indicate that students use seven different conceptual metaphors to explain the role of energy in various scientific contexts: energy as a substance that can be accounted for, energy as a substance that can flow, can change forms, can be carried, can be lost, can be an ingredient or a product, and energy as a process or interaction. This result gives teachers a framework to use in evaluating student ideas about energy.

AB  - This study examined the use of authentic experiential-based videos in self-explanation activities on 32 polytechnic students' learning and motivation, using a mixed method quasi-experimental design. The control group analysed a set of six pre-recorded videos of a subject performing the standing broad jump (SBJ). The experimental group captured videos of two subjects performing six variations of the SBJ. They then proceeded to analyse those videos as with the control group. All students then attempted a worksheet designed to elicit various levels of principled understanding of the topic on "projectile motion". In addition, data on students' motivation to learn and learning outcomes were measured by using three subscales of the Motivational Strategies for Questionaire (MSLQ)--task value, critical thinking, and self-efficacy--both before and after the intervention. Data were also collected through online pre- and post-tests, classroom observations as well as reflection journals. No significant differences between the experimental and control groups in terms of the post-intervention results were found ("p" greater than 0.05). However, the results suggested that use of experiential-based videos and video-based tools may in fact be more beneficial for students who are weaker in critical thinking and self-efficacy, to gain a better understanding of their learning.

AB  - Professional development becomes relevant and effective when teachers are actively involved, collaborate, and when it is linked to teachers' daily school practice (Hunzicker in "Prof Dev Educ" 37:177-179, 2011). Preparation of teachers for a curriculum implementation such as the new subject Nature, Life, and Technology can be done by a professional development programme where teachers are actively involved (Visser et al. 2010). This study evaluates the designed and implemented professional development programme with respect to its effectiveness in terms of degree of teacher learning and development. Effects are evaluated for five learning areas: Instructional strategies, differences in students' prior knowledge, adjustments to the module, assessment methods and instruments, and field trips and guest lectures. Eleven teachers from four different schools participated in two professional development programmes, six teachers in the first professional development programme and five teachers in the programme for the subsequent module. Questionnaires and interviews were used to assess the effects in the different learning areas. The findings show that the professional development programme is a useful venture for teachers' professional growth in different learning areas.

AB  - Field training is seen as a central component of the discipline of Physical Geography and an essential part of the undergraduate curriculum. This paper explores the structure and relationships between fieldwork and theoretical courses and the abundant experiences of field training in the undergraduate curriculum of 37 Russian universities. It details a case study of the Faculty of Geography, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Russia's largest center of geographical scholarship and training with 860 employees, which admits about 1000 undergraduates and 180 PhD students annually. Here, the total duration of field training extends up to 18 weeks annually and involves 14 (11 Physical Geography) specialist departments.

AB  - Knowledge sharing and transfer are essential for learning in groups, especially when group members have different disciplinary expertise and collaborate online. Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) environments have been designed to facilitate transactive knowledge sharing and transfer in collaborative problem-solving settings. This study investigates how knowledge sharing and transfer can be facilitated using CSCL scripts supporting transactive memory and discussion in a multidisciplinary problem-solving setting. We also examine the effects of these CSCL scripts on the quality of both joint and individual problem-solution plans. In a laboratory experiment, 120 university students were randomly divided into pairs based only on their disciplinary backgrounds (each pair had one partner with a background in water management and one partner with a background in international development studies). These dyads were then randomly assigned to one of four conditions: transactive memory script, transactive discussion script, both scripts, or no scripts (control). Learning partners were asked to analyze, discuss, and solve an authentic problem that required knowledge of both their domains, i.e., applying the concept of community-based social marketing in fostering sustainable agricultural water management. The results showed interaction effects for the transactive memory and discussion scripts on transactive knowledge sharing and transfer. Furthermore, transactive memory and discussion scripts individually, but not in combination, led to better quality demonstrated in both joint and individual problem solutions. We discuss how these results advance the research investigating the value of using scripts delivered in CSCL systems for supporting knowledge sharing and transfer.

AB  - Creative teamwork in multidisciplinary teams is a topic of interest to cognitive psychologists on the one hand, and to both social and organizational psychologists on the other. However, the interconnections between cognitive and social layers have been rarely explored. Drawing on mental models and dissonance theories, the current study takes a central variable studied by cognitive psychologists--analogy--and examines its relationship to a central variable examined by social psychologists--conflict. In an observational, field study, over 11 h of audio-video data from conversations of the Mars Exploration Rover scientists were coded for different types of analogy and micro-conflicts that reveal the character of underlying psychological mechanisms. Two different types of time-lagged logistic models applied to these data revealed asymmetric patterns of associations between analogy and conflict. Within-domain analogies, but not within-discipline or outside-discipline analogies, preceded science and work process conflicts, suggesting that in multidisciplinary teams, representational gaps in very close domains will be more likely to spark conflict. But analogies also occurred in reaction to conflict: Process and negative conflicts, but not task conflicts, preceded within-discipline analogies, but not to within-domain or outside-discipline analogies. This study demonstrates ways in which cognition can be bidirectionally tied to social processes and discourse. (Contains 7 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - Hobbs and Coiro describe a new approach to the professional development of educators, librarians, and media professionals that emphasizes the value of collaborative, interdisciplinary relationships. The authors explore why creative collaboration using digital media texts, tools, and technologies is vital to support the professional development of educators. Creative collaboration experiences generate personally meaningful, transformative learning by promoting personal reflection in a social context. It is important to provide cognitive and emotional support for the risk-taking cycles of experimentation and trial-and-error process that is essential for learning to use digital tools. By using inquiry learning practices through collaborative and creative media production, adult learners thrive by taking on distinct and enmeshed roles that inevitably involve creative tension that stimulates and energizes innovation.

AB  - Purpose: Collegiate internships play an important role in the development of professionals. They provide students the opportunity to experience real world expectations embedded within actual vocational environments under the support of their collegiate faculty. Although there are a number of common reasons why internships are utilized in each academic area, the requirements for the experiences are substantially different across disciplines and level of coursework. The purpose of this paper is to explore some of the commonalities and differences that exist for internships across collegiate academic disciplines at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, and identify their salience for programs from an interdisciplinary perspective. Design/methodology/approach: For this conceptual piece, the authors took an introspective qualitative look at both programs and compared and contrasted them based on internally available documentation and information. Although this was theoretical in nature, the authors utilized materials available for certification and accreditation purposes for each of their programs. Multiple data sources were stakeholder interviews and conversations, site visits/observations, and site artifacts/documents. Findings: The authors found a great deal of both similarity and dissimilarity across programs, and these findings were utilized as grounds for programmatic introspection, evaluation, accreditation, and certification to better understand how stakeholder voice is involved in the processes. Table I provides an overview of items identified, and will serve as a guide for the remainder of this paper. Originality/value: An inclusive awareness will consider the voices of the student, university, employer, and other stakeholders, including co-workers and employers that currently do not offer internships. Given the rising cost of tuition and the wealth of competition in the market, the pressure is on for institutions of higher education to up the ante when it comes to providing quality experiential learning opportunities. The next step should focus on defining expectations and tailoring each internship program, and for that to be accomplished, all stakeholders must be "all in."

AB  - This article describes an interdisciplinary project that created awareness of female scientists in a public Montessori classroom. Every spring, the author's sixth-grade students write an educational play in which the entire class participates. Following an underwhelming response to asking students who are their favorite female scientists, the decision was made to combine writing about female and male scientists into a play with science demonstrations and songs to review science content. All students learned about female scientists' achievements and honed their writing skills. All the actors practiced their verbal fluency and reviewed literary elements such as setting, character change, foreshadowing, conflict, and theme. Through the integration of Greek mythology and science, students touched the classics and reinforced their understanding of science concepts such as water displacement and volume, light refraction, elements, and adaptations. Children connected on a socio-emotional level with the characters as they learned about their struggles and achievements, especially those of female scientists. Writing and performing the play enhanced the classroom community because students experienced a shared purpose.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a model to help engineering faculty overcome the challenges they face when asked to design and implement interdisciplinary curricula. Researchers at a U.S. University worked with an Interdisciplinary Consultant Team and prepared a steering document with Guiding Principles and Essential Elements for the design, implementation, and evaluation of integrative curricula in engineering education. The team also developed exemplar materials (Integrative Learning Module) to provide a practical example and demonstrate how the tools provided could be used in the development of new curricula. The Guiding Principles, Essential Elements, and Integrative Learning Module were evaluated by faculty and students who provided feedback for their improvement. Faculty indicated that the tools provided were appropriate guidelines for faculty, but they indicated that the Integrative Learning Module was too long to be a manageable example. Students agreed about the need for more interactive, real-world applications of engineering concepts, but they expressed differences of opinion regarding how humanities and social sciences topics should be addressed in the engineering curriculum. Students who participated in a course modeling the Integrative Learning Module were satisfied with its use and learning outcomes. After the course, these students were able to explain the importance of problem definition, process, and disciplinary integration in engineering work.

AB  - Systematic studies on the effectiveness of in-service teacher professional development (PD) are important for science education research and practice. Previous studies have mostly focused on certain outcomes of PD, for example, the effectiveness of PD for improving teachers' knowledge or students' learning outcomes. This study, however, explores multiple outcomes of PD, from teachers' change in knowledge and practice and how teacher change influences students' beliefs and ultimately their understanding of interdisciplinary science concepts. The sample included 509 students from 23 classrooms within 5 elementary/middle schools. The results showed that teacher attendance in professional learning communities and interdisciplinary science research related positively to teachers' scores on a pedagogical content knowledge test. Students whose teachers had more than 150 PD hours in the past academic year performed significantly better on an interdisciplinary science test. Follow-up analyses suggested that student understanding of the nature of science possibly mediates the positive effect between PD hours and student understanding of interdisciplinary science concepts.

AB  - In the research, the purpose was to implement and evaluate an interdisciplinary curriculum that aimed at developing social sciences pre-service teachers' understanding and knowledge about the nature of science. This research was based on case study design. In order to collect the research data, the methods of observation, interview and document analysis were used. For the analysis of the data, the inductive content analysis approach was applied. The results of the analysis demonstrated that the curriculum implemented had positive influence on the pre-service teachers' understanding and knowledge about the nature of science. In this respect, it was found that the curriculum helped develop the participants' lack of skills and knowledge about the subjects related to "nature of scientific models, nature of observations and values guiding scientists in their work and social lives" included in the content of nature of science. In addition, it was revealed that the pre-service teachers' lack of readiness made the implementation process difficult.

AB  - The HEI-ICI project involves cooperation between the University of Eastern Finland (UEF) and three African partners. The main aim of the project, now in its fourth year, has been to develop education in health sciences and to improve the quality of teaching. The target has been to develop the skills of selected junior faculty from the Public Health departments, library and IT centres at partner universities. The data was collected during the project in 2010-2014. Written and visual material was analysed using deductive content analysis. The main obstacles researchers were faced with while working in the project have been cultural: the project encouraged different cultures--not only European and African but also pan-African--to meet and work together. This novel approach to learning and teaching is based on the concept of cooperation, collaboration and trust between all of the participating partners; its foundation is the full ownership by the less developed Southern partner institutions.

AB  - The last few decades have been ones of complexity and contradiction. Long-term socio-economic restructuring has produced deep and growing wealth disparities, leveling great constraints on urban public schools that must confront the social and educational repercussions of chronic poverty. Long-standing political austerity, coupled with fallout from the great recession, has rendered private/corporate sector solutions to public problems increasingly expedient. Corporations have aggressively encroached into the gaps in provisions to public education, addressing problems that hyper-concentrated wealth has helped to engender. This literature review examines ideological debates surrounding one aspect of this shifting landscape: corporate philanthropic partnerships in education. Exploring research from education and business, this article rethinks the underlying assumptions, motivations, and implications of two bodies of literature and wider discourses that take counter-related positions on the role of corporate social participation: (a) public-private partnerships (PPPs) as manna and (b) PPPs as privatizations in education.

AB  - The complex consequences of current consumption practices, such as climate change and ecosystem degradation, necessitate increased interdisciplinary exploration. In order to raise student awareness of these consumption-related issues, we designed a first-year team-taught seminar on sustainability. This innovative interdisciplinary course links geology and sociology in examining real-world problems through a variety of reflective, experiential, and collaborative activities. Our assessment of this course was based on a qualitative review of 18 students' reflective blog posts as a direct measure of student learning. While we continue to work on deepening the interconnections between geology and sociology and promoting student agency, students were successful in understanding the multifaceted complex nature of sustainability and recognizing the personal and social implications of consumption. Given these positive outcomes, we encourage the development of similar interdisciplinary collaborations.

AB  - The results of an investigative process are reported that centre on the impact that modular curricular organization and its interdisciplinary activity are having on the teaching culture in the Degree in Social Education at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/ EHU). This understanding of the curriculum is a seminal change for teaching staff and affects their professional identity by encouraging co-responsibility throughout the process. Communicative methodology is employed, which assists in the integration of the people in the investigation, so that they form part of the process of study under equal terms. The production of data was done through in-depth interviews, discussion groups, and documental analysis. The Interdisciplinary Activity Module (IAM) was developed in small groups, of 12-15 individuals, through active methodologies, and the university teachers needed to incorporate it into their discourse and relations with other colleagues and with their students. The results show that an integrated curriculum provides a worthwhile training opportunity to achieve learning of greater significance and depth, and that it happens through changes in their ways of relating and acting as teachers.

AB  - Preparing science and engineering students to work in interdisciplinary teams necessitates research on teaching and learning of interdisciplinary thinking. A multidimensional approach was taken to examine student interdisciplinary learning in a master course on food quality management. The collected 615 student experiences were analysed for the cognitive, emotional, and social learning dimensions using the learning theory of Illeris. Of these 615 experiences, the analysis showed that students reported 214, 194, and 207 times on, respectively, the emotional, the cognitive, and the social dimension. Per learning dimension, key learning experiences featuring interdisciplinary learning were identified such as "frustrations in selecting and matching disciplinary knowledge to complex problems" ("emotional"), "understanding how to apply theoretical models or concepts to real-world situations" ("cognitive"), and "socially engaging with peers to recognise similarities in perceptions and experiences" ("social"). Furthermore, the results showed that students appreciated the cognitive dimension relatively more than the emotional and social dimensions.

AB  - For a structural engineer, effective communication and interaction with architects cannot be underestimated as a key skill to success throughout their professional career. Structural engineers and architects have to share a common language and understanding of each other in order to achieve the most desirable architectural and structural designs. This interaction and engagement develops during their professional career but needs to be nurtured during their undergraduate studies. The objective of this paper is to present the strategies employed to engage higher order thinking in structural engineering students in order to help them solve complex problem-based learning (PBL) design scenarios presented by architecture students. The strategies employed were applied in the experimental setting of an undergraduate module in structural engineering at Queen's University Belfast in the UK. The strategies employed were active learning to engage with content knowledge, the use of physical conceptual structural models to reinforce key concepts and finally, reinforcing the need for hand sketching of ideas to promote higher order problem-solving. The strategies employed were evaluated through student survey, student feedback and module facilitator (this author) reflection. The strategies were qualitatively perceived by the tutor and quantitatively evaluated by students in a cross-sectional study to help interaction with the architecture students, aid interdisciplinary learning and help students creatively solve problems (through higher order thinking). The students clearly enjoyed this module and in particular interacting with structural engineering tutors and students from another discipline.

AB  - Contemporary science educators must equip their students with the knowledge and practical know-how to connect multiple disciplines like mathematics, computing and the natural sciences to gain a richer and deeper understanding of a scientific problem. However, many biology and earth science students are prejudiced against mathematics due to negative emotions like high mathematical anxiety and low mathematical confidence. Here, we present a theoretical framework that investigates linkages between student engagement, mathematical anxiety, mathematical confidence, student achievement and subject mastery. We implement this framework in a large, first-year interdisciplinary science subject and monitor its impact over several years from 2010 to 2015. The implementation of the framework coincided with an easing of anxiety and enhanced confidence, as well as higher student satisfaction, retention and achievement. The framework offers interdisciplinary science educators greater flexibility and confidence in their approach to designing and delivering subjects that rely on mathematical concepts and practices.

AB  - This paper explores the experiences of 24 Early Career Researchers working in interdisciplinary and precarious employment conditions in which they are managing collaborations with multiple partners beyond the university as part of the AHRC's "Connected Communities" Programme. These conditions emerge from conflicting sources--from critical and emancipatory moves in knowledge production as well as from globalising neoliberal education policies. The paper draws on Archer's concept of reflexive identity to identify four different reflexive orientations developed by ECRs in these conditions: the disciplinarian, the freelancer, the worker bee and the social activist.

AB  - This article describes a study that investigated pre-service teachers' awareness of the interdisciplinary connections among mathematics, personal finance, and social justice issues. When pre-service teachers understand these connections, they can prepare their students to be responsible, participatory, and justice-oriented citizens in a global economy. Possessing and articulating this awareness are integral components of providing children and youth with the knowledge and skills to improve their life quality and bring about social change. The 68 participants in the study were pre-service teachers at two public universities in the United States, one in the Midwest and one in the Southeast. The participants at the Midwestern university were enrolled in general education classes, and the participants at the Southeastern university were enrolled in elementary, middle school, and high school mathematics methods classes in the Fall 2010 and Spring 2011 semesters. They completed surveys mid-semester, in which they were prompted to discuss mathematics literacy, financial literacy, and their social applications. The researchers found the majority of the pre-service teachers had narrow or intermediate conceptions of mathematics and financial literacy, discussing the need to understand mathematics and financial terminology, as well as their social connections. However, the participants were largely unable to articulate related social justice issues, seeing mathematics as an isolated discipline.

AB  - The aim of this article is to prove the advisability of using the interdisciplinary approach for the formation of learners' situational interest in physics. The general method of using the interdisciplinary approach in physics teaching has been created. The study of new material, the formation of abilities and skills, and the work on projects are the forms of the interdisciplinary links in physics teaching. The scheme for interest formation towards physics in the context of development of situational and individual interest has been analyzed. According to the interdisciplinary approach, the tools for the formation of learners' situational interest in physics have been allocated. These are phenomena of nature, phenomena of everyday life, link between theory and practice. The results showed that interdisciplinary approach in physics teaching increases the level of learners' situational interest. Proposed general method of using the interdisciplinary approach can be used for teaching other sciences.

AB  - This study examines and documents graduate pedagogy courses offered at a large Midwestern research university. Thirty-three graduate pedagogy course instructors from 32 departments (a majority of those offering courses) completed an online survey. We report on enrollment demographics, preparation of faculty to teach such a course, and how a statement of teaching philosophy is presented to the class. This research connects the analyses of individual pedagogy courses with the few national studies on teacher training, outlines assumptions about an emerging field, and lays groundwork for a comprehensive study of the landscape and outcomes of graduate pedagogy courses nationwide.

AB  - Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) sites widely serve as the first major research gateway for undergraduates seeking a structured research experience. Given their lack of prior research skills, and the highly compressed duration of the REU programs, these students frequently encounter barriers to a seamless transition into a new laboratory environment. We hypothesized that the design of a unified short course on laboratory and analysis techniques could serve as a pivotal orientation experience. Our goal was to rapidly align student expertise to their summer research goals while also integrating the student participants into a cohesive learning community. This article discusses the design and outcomes of a Cellular Bioengineering Boot Camp, which is offered at the outset of the 10-week REU site at Rutgers. The Boot Camp provides hands-on, supervised training for techniques and procedures that are common among projects. The training establishes a common language and baseline for the REU students and allows their first laboratory experiences to be with each other, and creates an immediate network of peers and mentors. Surveys before and after the Boot Camp and at the end of the summer indicated a significant improvement in student proficiency in the techniques that was retained throughout the summer. We believe that the Boot Camp approach can be tailored to the specifics of each REU site and its associated projects and research foci.

AB  - Common ground in the interdisciplinary research process is the pivot from disciplinary to interdisciplinary perspective. As thinking moves from disciplinary to interdisciplinary, what is the shape or structure of attention, how does intellectual content transform in the attending process? Four common ground techniques--extension, redefinition, transformation, organization--are characterized as modifications of attention using Gestalt theoretical principles and phenomenology. The illustrated attentional transitions support the claim that interdisciplinary common ground is a cognitive achievement.

AB  - This experiment of innovative university education shows the interdisciplinary work carried out in the studies of the Bachelor of Science in Education at the University of Andorra. The study was developed within two subjects: Communication Technology (TAC) and Cultural Heritage Education in Andorra. The main objective of this experiment is to foster the use of technological resources and digital materials, with the aim of drawing cultural heritage closer to the classroom. Based on a previous study of documentation and an analysis of online educational materials, the students have to design an e-book, which is understood to be digital material in the curricular field of cultural heritage. This digital material is a didactic proposal that focuses on the construction of knowledge by primary school students. During the elaboration of the materials the instructors introduce follow-up activities. The results of the experiment show that, from an interdisciplinary approach, and a problem-solving, learning-centered methodology, specific and transferable abilities in initial teacher training can be studied and evaluated.

AB  - This paper reports on an Australian initiative "Developing and Sustaining Pedagogical Leadership in Early Childhood Education and Care Professionals," where academics and professionals shared knowledge, experience and research about transdisciplinary practice. The project aimed to develop an understanding of the strategies and skills early childhood professionals and practitioners required to strengthen pedagogical leadership when working in multi-agency organisations. The conceptual framework underpinning the design, analysis and evaluation of the project was bricolage. Bricolage enabled the researchers, professionals and practitioners and other organisational members to consider the principles of multiplicity, complexity, relationality and criticality. The use of bricolage created an opportunity for a more comprehensive level of analysis to occur. A model of professional development emerged from the analysis of the data and was subsequently used to develop an open source learning website.

AB  - Integrating knowledge across disciplines has been shown to be a challenging, and yet it is a necessary skill that university students need to develop. Students who are able to connect different concepts, perspectives, and angles of a given topic are generally more engaged and have better understanding. However, designing lesson plans or assignments that integrate knowledge across disciplines is a challenge to most instructors. This paper describes our effort to provide an interdisciplinary and independent assignment that couples topics from a Physical Chemistry course with skills taught in an Introductory Computing course. It was shown that such an interdisciplinary assignment, though done independently, can help to boost students' learning. However, it helps only in the understanding of certain aspects of the topics. We present the design of the assignment and the lessons learned for other instructors willing to adopt this kind of interdisciplinary approach.

AB  - As societal challenges involving sustainable development increase, the need to effectively integrate this inherently multidisciplinary topic into existing curricula becomes more pressing. Multidisciplinary, team-taught, project-based instruction has shown effectiveness in teaching teamwork, communication, and life-long learning skills, and appreciation for other disciplines. Unfortunately, this instruction mode has not been widely adopted, largely due to its resource-intensiveness. Our proposed co-instruction model of multidisciplinary senior project administration was tested to see if it could effectively teach sustainability topics and duplicate the known benefits of team-taught instruction, while overcoming its resource-intensiveness. A case study of a co-instructed senior project was undertaken with students and faculty from electrical and mechanical engineering, business, political science, and industrial design. The participating students were compared to the control group, i.e. students who chose to complete a traditional disciplinary senior project instead. Extensive assessment was performed with pre/post quizzes, online surveys, focus groups, and course deliverables. The multidisciplinary projects outperformed traditional senior projects in 4 out of the 5 participating courses. However, the students in the multidisciplinary project rated their satisfaction with the experience lower on average than the control group. A strong, positive correlation between students' project satisfaction and rating of other instruction aspects (0.50 < r < 0.7, p < 0.01) was discovered, which has implications for all project-based instruction. Participating faculty generally found the process illuminating and engaged in scholarship and creative endeavors as a result.

AB  - This article qualitatively explores the potential of entrepreneurial leadership curricula to encourage interdisciplinary interest in agricultural issues and prompt diverse student engagement in agricultural leadership and innovation. The study focuses specifically on the activities and perspectives of 15 undergraduate students who completed an interdisciplinary entrepreneurial leadership course offered at a large land grant university located in the Southwestern region of the United States. The student participants, who worked in teams of two to three to develop innovative solutions to current agricultural challenges, represented 15 different fields of study--12 of which were outside of the disciplinary scope of agriculture. The potential implications of expanding agricultural leadership education beyond the disciplinary boundaries of the agricultural fields through entrepreneurial leadership curricula are considered. Particular attention is given to the likely implications of interdisciplinary learning on the development of a diverse entrepreneurial workforce that is motivated and equipped to lead in the initiation and implementation of agricultural innovation. The insights generated by the study illuminate the potential benefits associated with the development of interdisciplinary agricultural leadership curricula that supports the training and development of entrepreneurial leaders who can effectively forge and advance agricultural innovation.

AB  - Researchers conducted a qualitative analysis of students' experiences while enrolled in an interdisciplinary leadership minor with the intent to determine programmatic inputs that spur leadership development. Based on students' reflections, three domains of programmatic inputs for leadership development within the minor were identified. These domains include leadership development at the individual level, leadership development at the group level, and leadership development through experiential learning. Themes within these three domains are also identified providing additional insight into the participants' experiences while enrolled in the leadership minor. Based on these findings, researchers proposed a framework for leadership development within an interdisciplinary minor. Recommendations for future research and application of the proposed framework are discussed.

AB  - The Ariel University has a unique interdisciplinary program in healthcare management that targets experienced healthcare professionals who wish to earn an academic degree. Only one academic study has been held so far on the integration of graduates of an academic university-level school in healthcare management in the field. In the current study, the authors sought to investigate points of contact between the academic world and the professional field by following the professional integration of graduates of healthcare management at the Ariel University and their satisfaction with their training, job, and profession from an interdisciplinary perspective. A survey was held among all 1,327 graduates of the Department of Healthcare Management from 2002 to 2011. Data collection was performed through self-completed electronic questionnaires and personally distributed questionnaires, including questions on graduates' current place of work and satisfaction with their degree. The findings indicate that graduates are very satisfied with their interdisciplinary studies at the department. Students from the Arab sector, those who began their studies at an older age, and those who are more affluent, reported higher satisfaction with their studies. Most students intend to continue studying for an advanced degree in the profession.

AB  - In this article we illustrate the roles of school psychologists, administrators, social workers, teachers, and parents in school reform by describing the adoption, initial implementation, and formative evaluation of an evidence-based social and emotional learning (SEL) program within several rural Midwestern school districts in a geographically large county. As part of a countywide initiative aimed at improving children's mental health services, an interdisciplinary team collaborated to select and implement a universal school-based curriculum addressing SEL objectives. Professionals in the county's special education cooperative lead the reform effort, general education teachers deliver the curriculum, and school psychologists and school social workers have served as trainers and consultants to educators and building administrators. An ecological model of organizational consultation informs these efforts. We illustrate this model by describing its application to the collaborative school-based initiative addressing SEL objectives. We also discuss implications for future consultation research, training, and practice.

AB  - The article by Aileen Fyfe (this issue) raises a number of important issues about academic identity and the importance of the disciplinary community in the creation and maintenance of that identity. It also discusses some of the additional difficulties faced by interdisciplinary disciplines; lack of recognition (and thus institutional support), isolation of individual academics in "foreign" communities and a general anxiety and lack of self-confidence by the practitioners in that discipline as to the worth of their field. Finally, the article hints at the dangers these difficulties pose for the sustainability of the discipline--as lack of a clear identity and an institutionally marginal existence can make developing and attracting future practitioners difficult. In Fyfe's article, the focus was on the history of science. This article explores some of the many similarities, and differences, that exist for individuals in the field of economic history. For many economic historians, locating themselves within their discipline is still a major issue.

AB  - The chapter examines school administrator responsibilities to special education students and their families from case scenarios based on conflicts between parents and districts regarding services provided by schools to special education students. From these case studies based on real case law, readers are exposed to situations intended to pose questions as to whether administrators met their responsibility to ensure the rights of the special education students. Principals, superintendents, and special education administrators committed to work together to make their school environment and optimal place for children to learn. An equally important role for school administrators is to create and maintain cultures where faculty understand their advocacy role for all children, but in particular, those children most in need of support. Effective administrators hold themselves and other professionals in their district to high standards related to knowledge of school law, particularly special education school law; communication with parents and other professionals; and collaborations based on the value of what is best for the student. This chapter concludes with a section on ethical leadership or the values underlying administrative actions affecting individualized education program students, their families, and all students who are different whether due to socioeconomic status, cultural differences, or race.

AB  - A problem common to university faculty and students is an implicit sense of inadequacy regarding institutional hierarchies and disciplinary boundaries. Through a focus on multidisciplinarity, learning communities enable members to navigate multiple points of view within, between, and beyond apparent institutional boundaries. After having led a workshop that placed participants in the positions of both students and faculty members negotiating multidisciplinarity through learning communities, we conclude that learning communities' methodological leveling of traditional hierarchies implicit in higher education leads to a sense of belonging that enables students and faculty to take risks essential for authentic learning. Anxiety over participation in academic discussions both inside and outside the classroom, and from within and beyond one's disciplinary expertise, thus becomes productive rather than debilitating.

AB  - Many engineering programs stress the importance of technological innovation by offering entrepreneurship electives and programs. Integration of entrepreneurship into the required engineering curriculum has predominantly focused on senior capstone design courses. This paper describes a strategy for integrating entrepreneurship into a multidisciplinary sophomore-level design course. This early introduction provides an opportunity for students to further pursue their entrepreneurial ideas through a junior/senior level, project-based course. The Rowan Sophomore Engineering Clinics are integrated courses in which engineering design is taught concurrently with technical communication. This paper describes two entrepreneurial assignments that have been integrated into the Sophomore Clinics: a white paper, and an open-ended semester long design experience in which students propose their own entrepreneurial projects. The projects appear to lead to increased interest in entrepreneurship among students, as indicated by survey results and by an increase in students choosing to pursue entrepreneurial projects as juniors and seniors. While the Sophomore Clinic structure is unique to Rowan University, the entrepreneurial assignments themselves are readily adaptable to other engineering programs.

AB  - In 2009, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) called for more interdisciplinary and community-engaged approaches to teaching and learning in the agricultural and life sciences to better respond to the food system challenges of the 21st century. As a result, institutions from across the nation have responded with a number of experiential learning and service-learning frameworks and practices aimed to enhance the academic experience for both student and community stakeholders. Sustainable agriculture education, with its explicit focus on experiential learning, interdisciplinarity, and values-based programming, has emerged as a promising approach to strengthen the fabric of agriculture and life sciences education. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the complex role of service learning as a central approach to undergraduate teaching and learning where interdisciplinary teaching, experiential learning, and community engagement are core goals. Specifically, we conducted a single embedded case study of a sustainable agriculture education program at a land grant university to explore how this triad was organized and possible service learning outcomes. Our case study was informed by semi-structured interviews of faculty and community partner stakeholders, participant observations of faculty and students, and secondary data analysis of course syllabi and other programmatic artifacts. Despite different understandings and practices of service learning by faculty within this, we found a common core of best practices. We conclude with criteria and best practices to guide teaching and learning from this triad perspective.

AB  - Professional knowledge is highlighted as an important prerequisite of both medical doctors and teachers. Based on recent conceptions of professional knowledge in these fields, knowledge can be differentiated within several aspects. However, these knowledge aspects are currently conceptualized differently across different domains and projects. Thus, this paper describes recent frameworks for professional knowledge in medical and educational sciences, which are then integrated into an interdisciplinary two-dimensional model of professional knowledge that can help to align terminology in both domains and compare research results. The models' two dimensions differentiate between cognitive types of knowledge and content-related knowledge facets and introduces a terminology for all emerging knowledge aspects. The models' applicability for medical and educational sciences is demonstrated in the context of diagnosis by describing prototypical diagnostic settings for medical doctors as well as for teachers, which illustrate how the framework can be applied and operationalized in these areas. Subsequently, the role of the different knowledge aspects for acting and the possibility of transfer between different content areas are discussed. In conclusion, a possible extension of the model along a "third dimension" that focuses on the effects of growing expertise on professional knowledge over time is proposed and issues for further research are outlined.

AB  - In this paper the authors evaluate 85 elementary education teacher candidates' integration of technology into interdisciplinary units that the candidates wrote during the semester before their full-time student teaching internship. An inductive analysis of the units revealed that teachers used a wide variety of technologies with a large dependence on Internet-based technologies, interactive whiteboards, and iPad applications. Further analyses found that most of the technology uses were lower-level and focused on only basic skills. However, chi-squared tests for independence found statistically significant relationships between numerous factors and when technology was used in ways that addressed higher-order thinking skills. These factors included the structure of the lesson plans, the content of the interdisciplinary units, when the technology was integrated into the multi-lesson unit, and when the technology was integrated into specific phases of the lesson. Implications for teacher education programs and research that focuses on teacher candidates' TPACK are provided.

AB  - Physics of music is an area that is covered by interdisciplinary approach. In this study it is aimed to determine prospective music teachers' level of association with physics concepts which are related to music. The research is a case study which combines qualitative and quantitative methods. Eighty-four students who were studying at the Department of Music Education participated to the study. A data collection instrument which included qualitative and quantitative items with an interdisciplinary approach was used in this research. The collected data were grouped and analyzed by finding percentage value for each item. The findings from the data analysis were interpreted and a case assessment was made. In addition it was asked if it was necessary to take such an education. The findings revealed that most participants were unaware of musical concepts relating to physics and had difficulty in associating these concepts or expressing what they know. However, a great majority thought that such an education was necessary in their department.

AB  - This paper focuses on how wise humanising creativity (WHC) is manifested within early years interdisciplinary arts education. It draws on Arts Council-funded participatory research by Devon Carousel Project and University of Exeter's Graduate School of Education. It is grounded in previous AHRC-funded research, which conceptualised WHC in the face of educational creativity/performativity tensions. WHC articulates the dialogic embodied inter-relationship of creativity and identity--creators are "making and being made"; they are "becoming." The research used a qualitative methodology to create open-ended spaces of dialogue or "Living Dialogic Spaces" framed by an ecological model to situate the team's different positionings. Data collection included traditional qualitative techniques and arts-based techniques. Data analysis involved inductive/deductive conversations between existing theory and emergent themes. Analysis indicated that "making and being made," and other key WHC features were manifested. We conclude by suggesting that WHC can help develop understanding of how creative arts practice supports the breadth of young children's development, and the role of the creativity-identity dialogue within that, as well as indicating what the practice and research has to offer beyond the Early Years.

AB  - This paper presents a case study of didactic infrastructures to direct Study and Research Paths (SRP) in teacher education within the context of interdisciplinary inquiry. The disciplines of school mathematics and school biology, and their didactics, are made to interconnect through the investigation of a generating question concerning the illness diabetes. The resulting interdisciplinary knowledge as evidenced through students written diaries is analysed using the Anthropologic Theory of the Didactic and shows the challenge of combining two disciplines and their didactics at the same time. Two particular forms of didactic infrastructure to guide the self-sustained process of SRP are proposed and scrutinized: "Selective picking" and "Side questions." Selective picking is shown to be a promising, yet indirect, infrastructure to steer the SRP without taking away the desired autonomy of the students. Side questions, initially proposed by Ives Chevallard, are considered in light of the case, and a number of suggestions for their characteristics and use are put forward.

AB  - This study delineates two Taiwanese TESOL teachers' efforts of combining English writing with entrepreneurship education to cultivate English majors' interdisciplinary competence in academic writing classes. An integrated business-and-writing approach was proposed to foster English majors' academic writing skills and entrepreneurial capacities. In this study, farming metaphors ("The two farmers," "Planting the seed," "Growing the seed," and "Harvest") will be used to portray the instructors' shared journey of guiding students to complete a creative business planning project. Feedback from students reveals that students gained content knowledge about the business world, and they learned how to write a business plan. For the two instructors, their endeavors to transform English writing courses to link academic knowledge with real-world purposes have encouraged them for more cross-campus collaborations to inject new energy into higher education institutions. To conclude the paper, pedagogical recommendations are provided to foster English majors' learning of English beyond disciplinary boundaries.

AB  - This work describes an experience conducted by a group of professors from different departments at the University of Girona (Catalonia, Spain) which arose from the need for interdisciplinary work in university classrooms in order to promote competences relevant to the professional sector. As part of this experience, students from different degree programs were challenged to work collaboratively and in an interdisciplinary manner on a project related to the management of a school cafeteria designed for a real educational center. The work promoted the development of competences that are otherwise difficult to attain through activities that lack an interdisciplinary approach, which are key in today's professional world, such as multi-professional teamwork. Based on this experience, the feasibility of students from different areas of study carrying out a final degree project (FDP) that meets real, contextualized needs and requires the contribution of knowledge from different disciplines is considered.

AB  - Leadership content and pedagogical strategies are fundamental to health professionals' education. All health professionals must be able to lead effectively and thrive in today's complex health systems. Students must be involved in meaningful didactic and experiential leadership development early in their academic progression, and educators are positioned to lead in this initiative. This paper describes pre-post findings from an application of Kouzes and Posner's Student Leadership Practices Inventory with students who completed an interdisciplinary undergraduate leadership development program and observers' perspectives of these students' leadership characteristics. Outcome data found positive change in pre-post data except for encourage the heart for the student participants and challenges others for the observers. Critical reflection and authentic assessment of actions that occurred during the leadership program could have shifted students' realization of behaviors they actually did not demonstrate as originally thought at the beginning of the program. Observers' scores tended to be higher than students' scores; however, minimal change in posttest scores could be attributed to not using the same observers for the pre and post assessments.

AB  - In this work we report on a collaborative project at a large Northeastern University, in which we explored how to best collaborate to develop interdisciplinary teaching units, which integrate intercultural citizenship (Byram, 2008) into world languages, mathematics and social studies sixth grade curricula. We argue for the importance of addressing current critical areas in education. After introducing a framework that allows teachers to focus on the development of intercultural citizenship while at the same time fostering skills in the diverse content areas, we report on how we worked with a group of graduate students, teachers and administrators in order to co-design interdisciplinary units focused on intercultural citizenship. An example of such an interdisciplinary unit is provided along with lessons learned about how we can facilitate this type of interdisciplinary collaboration. Our recommendations are based on qualitative analyses of the notes, memos and observations documented by the authors. Specifically, we share four emergent themes that illustrate how this group of educators successfully collaborated in this project: (1) Respecting disciplinary identities and boundaries, (2) Extending the understanding beyond the disciplines, (3) Ensuring a collaborative learning environment, and (4) Offering opportunities to continue the work beyond the course.

AB  - The need that emerged in Development Studies to trespass across disciplinary boundaries is discussed. An interdisciplinary characterization of Human Sustainable Development is sketched. Some attempts at the University of the Republic in Uruguay to foster related work that connects sciences and natural sciences are briefly described. This work spans research, teaching, institutional building, and university reform. It has been affected by the difficulties of pursuing interdisciplinary work when the growth of knowledge promotes specialization and academic structures are shaped by disciplinary concerns. Nevertheless, emergent lessons from the experience reported here suggest that trespassing across disciplinary boundaries in Development Studies may contribute significantly to fostering interdisciplinarity.

AB  - Communities of practice (CoP) are rich learning spaces that support knowledge creation, social engagement and practice improvement. In some university settings, there is a buoyant interest in creating and supporting interdisciplinary knowledge and practice. The purpose of the study was to apply an action research approach to explore the emergence of interdisciplinary communities of practice in a university context and to reflect on the practice of convening a CoP. How do communities of practice emerge and what approaches and practices nourish these groups? The authors of this study share a reflection on their role as convenors of CoP and on their work facilitating the emergence of these interdisciplinary groups.

AB  - The science of biology has been transforming dramatically and so the need for a stronger mathematical background for biology students has increased. Biological students reaching the senior or post-graduate level often come to realize that their mathematical background is insufficient. Similarly, students in a mathematics programme, interested in biological phenomena, find it difficult to master the complex systems encountered in biology. In short, the biologists do not have enough mathematics and the mathematicians are not being taught enough biology. The need for interdisciplinary curricula that includes disciplines such as biology, physical science, and mathematics is widely recognized, but has not been widely implemented. In this paper, it is suggested that students develop a skill set of ecology, mathematics and technology to encourage working across disciplinary boundaries. To illustrate such a skill set, a predator-prey model that contains self-limiting factors for both predator and prey is suggested. The general idea of dynamics, is introduced and students are encouraged to discover the applicability of this approach to more complex biological systems. The level of mathematics and technology required is not advanced; therefore, it is ideal for inclusion in a senior-level or introductory graduate-level course for students interested in mathematical biology.

AB  - Public health has constituted itself as a distinct academic discipline. The present paper attempts to understand ontology of this discipline. A study has recently been carried out which concerns, first, conceptualization of ontology of public health, secondly, nature of public health, and thirdly, curriculum development. Ontology is a philosophical doctrine that refers to an understanding about the basic elements theorized about. As the paper unveils, the tenet of public health is that the health state is not a matter of "individual" only; rather this is a question of the "collective" too. Diverse aspects take forms of intellectual construction which are transformed into the subject of the discipline. They are categorized as worldview, theory, methodology, instrumentation, and application. The constructions are internalized in the discipline's nature to be "epistemic," "interdisciplinary" and "componential." In order to produce knowledge, the discipline involves an epistemic process consisting of "priori" and "posteriori" approaches. Public health, though the prevailing thoughts and practices are derived from biomedical paradigms, contains an interdisciplinary trait that draws from the fields of formal, organic, inorganic and social sciences. The discipline comes to be appeared as an integral whole being componential. The aforementioned categories of intellectual constructions are viewed as the basic elements of public health. Elements exist and operate in a center/periphery binary relationship. Center (worldview), while it holds the whole structure of the discipline together, limits the movement of rest elements and keeps them in the periphery. The paper concludes by pointing out few issues for developing curriculum for universities.

AB  - Within higher education there is widespread support for developing students' interdisciplinary skills. Despite this, evidence for, and practice of, cross-faculty interdisciplinary sustainability learning remains in its infancy. Recent articles have shown that Australia is no exception. This article provides a case study of interdisciplinary learning and teaching within a cross-faculty Education for Sustainability (EfS) undergraduate subject involving science, arts, business, and health students at an Australian university. A description of the subject and its theoretical context provides a platform for presenting the findings of a mixed method enquiry into how pedagogy supports interdisciplinary sustainability learning. The sequential explanatory research design involved a post-subject quantitative survey analysed using SPSS, augmented by qualitative student journal data (n = 67) using phenomenological analysis within NVivo. The study found that students, regardless of discipline background, valued the processes and pedagogy used to promote interdisciplinary collaboration and awareness. The experience left students feeling more skilled and confident of their ability to contribute to future interdisciplinary sustainability collaboration. This case study, replete with a subject description, theoretical context for an innovative pedagogical approach and study results, provides higher education professionals with a template for deliberative curriculum and pedagogy that promote interdisciplinary knowledge, skills and confidence that may contribute to transformative learning that supports EfS goals. The article presents a strong case for future EfS curriculum frameworks and strategic education policy to include deliberative interdisciplinary pedagogy. It also challenges higher education institutions to create flexible systems that facilitate cross-faculty interdisciplinary learning that is necessary for preparing students for the future.

AB  - We present a preliminary theory of innovation in social work science. The focus of the piece is two case studies from our work that illustrate the social nature of innovations in the science of social work. This inductive theory focuses on a concept we refer to as transformative innovation, wherein two sets of individuals who possess different expertise and different network connections come together to solve a problem and in so doing transfer ideas from one network and field of expertise to the other. This transfer of ideas inevitably involves the transformation of ideas, such that the final innovation is something new to both groups of people, and as such innovative.

AB  - Much of the current literature on plagiarism focuses on students, attempting to understand how students view the concept of plagiarism, the best ways to prevent it, and the impact of collaboration on the concept of original authorship. In this article, we look at the role of plagiarism in 761 conference abstracts written by graduate students, early- to late-career faculty, and industry representatives, representing institutions from nearly 70 countries. These abstracts were submitted for participation in an international conference focused on the liberal arts hosted by our institution over the past four years. This study analyzes the corpus for patterns of plagiarism among professional academic writers. Our findings indicate that, while other demographic categories were not consistent indicators of text-matching, full professors were the most prevalent group to produce self-plagiarized abstracts. Overall, our study illuminates the significance of power dynamics in conferences' efforts to maintain academic integrity.

AB  - In this plenary address, I suggest that Complexity Theory has the potential to contribute a transdisciplinary theme to applied linguistics. Transdisciplinary themes supersede disciplines and spur new kinds of creative activity (Halliday 2001 [1990]). Investigating complex systems requires researchers to pay attention to system dynamics. Since applied linguists study language systems that change (for example, as they develop in learners), this is a useful perspective to bring to bear on many of our concerns. To introduce Complexity Theory, I list twelve principles undergirding this perspective and elaborate on three of them: those to do with dynamism, complexity, and the role of context. I then discuss several studies of L2 development that have been informed by the perspective. I conclude by suggesting that the ultimate promise of Complexity Theory is the help it provides in humanizing science. (Contains 1 footnote.)

AB  - Framed in Michele Foucault's theories of discipline and technologies of the self, this paper explores the possibilities for teaching and researching across disciplinary boundaries within the academy. In Foucault's studies of systems of thought, he conceptualized practices--like sexuality--to be instances of what is possible to be, think, and do within a historical moment. In the ethnographic study reported on in this paper, we examined perceptions and practices of discipline-based academics seeking to work across traditional scholarly boundaries as instances of "what was possible to be, think, and do" in transdisciplinary teaching and research in "higher education." Connecting transdisciplinary knowledge production with possibilities for critically engaging with sustainability as a social movement and imperative, we identify questions about and the promise of higher education as a place where this work can be done.

AB  - The study aimed to investigate the songs created by the student teachers in music in the focus of special education through an interdisciplinary approach based on the Rash measurement model and the Maxqda analysis program. This case study adopted the mixed research design. The participants consisted of 12 student teachers in music and 10 jury members in 2018-2019 academic year. In the quantitative analysis of the study, 10 expert jury members in the field of Music Education evaluated 12 songs using an evaluation form consisting of 8 items via the Rasch measurement model, and in the qualitative context, the views of the jury members on the songs were examined through the Maxqda analysis program. The jury members were selected in accordance with the maximum diversity sampling model on voluntary basis. All the songs focused on the achievements in the special education course. The results revealed that the most difficult item was the 'musical creativity level', whereas the easiest item was 'the degree of suitability for purpose in the creation of lyrics'. In the study, it was recommended that field courses and didactic courses should be integrated in the field of music education.

AB  - Although science education, including biochemistry and molecular biology education, starts before students commence university, for many students, undergraduate programs are their first real introduction to biochemistry and molecular biology. Students often report that biochemistry and molecular biology are relatively difficult topics hence the use of varied and well-thought-out approaches are critical to fully engage students. This session provided insights into undergraduate curriculum design.

AB  - Laboratory classes are a central element of all biochemistry and molecular biology programs. These play a role in developing students' hands-on and technical skills and also offer much more. The design of laboratory classes depends on many factors including the programs the students are enrolled in, the level they are at, employment destinations, and learning outcomes. This conference session considered the design and outcomes of laboratory experiences for undergraduate students.

AB  - This critical reflection briefly chronicles the transition of a general education program from a distributive model to an integrative model and the resulting Capital Capstone Course (CCC) at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC). The article describes a year long, team-based, experiential course that "caps" off our Interdisciplinary General Education program (IGED). The authors illustrate how "backward design" and backward/forward communication of Student Learning Outcomes inform the ongoing revision to the program and the CCC.

AB  - Science history shows us that interdisciplinarity is a spontaneous process that is intrinsic to, and engendered by, research activity. It is an activity that is done rather than an object to be designed and constructed. We examine three vignettes from the history of science that display the interdisciplinary process at work and consider the implications for education. We consider recent examples of interdisciplinary science education, including where interdisciplinarity involves students in authentic scientific research. We conclude that the reconciliation of research and education is a meaningful role for interdisciplinary practice in science education. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - In an era of rapid knowledge transmission and creation spurred on by advances in technology and globalisation, calls for interdisciplinarity to solve "wicked" problems are common. In the same era, universities are increasingly adopting new public management practices. The extent to which these practices affect knowledge production is an underexplored area. Results from a longitudinal study of Australian graduate business school academics are used to examine the impact of government policy and institutional change on engagement in interdisciplinary teaching and research. While disciplinary identity is a common barrier to interdisciplinarity, the nature and culture of graduate business schools were potentially able to overcome this barrier. However, the introduction of a national research measurement exercise and a concomitant strengthening of new public management practices, with subsequent institutional restructuring, revived disciplinary silos. The case study has particular relevance to universities in other countries where new public management is established.

AB  - This paper examines the representation of rural education research orientations--defined in terms of methodological approach, academic focus and place-consciousness--within the literature and across academic disciplines. A content analysis of 155 abstracts from articles published in the Journal of Research in Rural Education and Rural Sociology between 1997 and 2008 reveals that most rural education research is not quantitative, not academically-oriented and not place-conscious. Furthermore, the abstracts show that Rural Educators are underrepresented in academically-oriented research while Rural Social Scientists are overrepresented in that dimension. The implications of these findings for collaboration are discussed and a policy-relevant, innovative, transdisciplinary research agenda is outlined. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)

AB  - The purpose of the qualitative descriptive study is to engage community college faculty in systematic reflection of their perceptions of the impact of redesigned accelerated developmental education courses on their pedagogy and student success. Study participants include twenty-six English, Mathematics, and Reading faculty who have experience teaching traditional and accelerated developmental education courses at a community college in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States Using a self-report questionnaire and structured interviews, the researcher conducted thematic content analysis, and the following major themes emerged as faculty reported that: 1) teaching accelerated developmental education courses is rewarding due to student success and stronger rapport with students; 2) backward curriculum design and pedagogy differentiates teaching practices in accelerated courses; 3) teaching accelerated courses provides faculty with insight on non-cognitive issues and affective needs that impact student learning and 4) teaching accelerated courses may result in newfound faculty perspectives on developmental education reform, effective pedagogical strategies, and student ability.

AB  - This study was conducted to identify challenges and potential strategies to streamline work-integrated learning placements for multidisciplinary teams of students undertaking degrees in sustainability. Face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire were conducted with 15 academics and senior university staff, from four universities in Australia, who had extensive experience conducting WIL programs for undergraduate students. Key findings were that placing small teams of students was uncommon but partnerships with established specific professional vocational degrees are feasible. Management of multidisciplinary teams require four components: a central portal with a designated person(s) to coordinate and oversee all WIL programs; a university committee with representatives from each school and a chair that rotates between schools to vet WIL projects; a generic work-ready skills program that commences in the first year; and a project-based WIL placement with students self-mentoring and host supervisors providing generic supervision.

AB  - This article studies the relationship between students' perceptions of teaching and learning in a multidisciplinary honours programme and their impact on graduate attributes acquisition. The study, conducted among 73 honours students in a Dutch research university, evaluates perceived improvement in graduate attributes through annually collected survey data pertaining to student motivation, perception of the teaching and learning environment, engagement in the programme and registered course marks. The evaluation study reveals that to the extent of the perceived development of graduate attributes, three factors play crucial roles: students' performance motivation, the amount of teacher support in creative and critical thinking, and students' inclination to approach the honours track as a learning community.

AB  - This text offers an educational perspective on the challenges surrounding the implementation of integration (and interdisciplinarity) of mathematics and sciences and technology (M-S&T) in education and in the initial training of secondary school teachers. We find that the core nature of scientific and school disciplines in initial teacher training and in youth education needs to be redefined. This study is partly based on our past and present research on the teaching and learning of M-S&T. The main results show that the challenges of integration (and interdisciplinarity) are multiple mainly because of strongly established academic traditions in teacher training and also because of other variables explored in this text. Even though progress was made in the way didactics classes are taught in universities, much remains to be done. We will conclude with four avenues of future study and research development considering that M-S&T have very similar program contents.

AB  - Viewed through the lenses of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), this article critically evaluates the growing controversy surrounding the teaching of human rights in Canada. In line with critiques and with previous empirical studies on the implementation of the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of the Child in Canada and abroad, the author presents a reconsideration of underlying theory and an alternative model for citizenship education. In light of the growing knowledge deficit and as a contribution towards citizenship education, the author also re-presents a "transdisciplinary" CRC model for teaching young people's human rights from primary to postsecondary levels. In support of the main argument and its transdisciplinary model, the author includes the following sections beginning with a comparative overview of ideological and theoretical issues confounding Canada's child rights legislative and research agendas. Second, a theoretical discussion takes place with a view to reconstructing children's rights education within the context of an emergent, transdisciplinary human rights pedagogy. Third, empirical support for this shift in thinking is presented through a secondary analysis of interview data from the author's doctoral study comparing Canadian and Scottish children's rights education policies. Finally, a key finding from that research suggesting that CRC Article 42 was conceived by treaty drafters as an international indicator for treaty compliance is reconsidered as a transdisciplinary heuristic for pedagogically integrating human rights and citizenship education.

AB  - Over past decades we have witnessed considerable debate questioning the capacity of contemporary research to address the challenges posed by complex societal developments. As a consequence the need for rethinking cultures and practices of knowledge production has moved high on the policy agenda. In this context transdisciplinarity has become one of the key-notions standing for more openness towards and engagement with non-scientific actors all along the process of knowledge production. While there is much debate, little is known about the every-day research practices in such contexts. This paper focuses on early stage researchers and how they manage to reconcile the demands of transdisciplinarity with other normative requirements in contemporary research. Using the concept of "epistemic living spaces", which addresses how researchers see their room for epistemic and social manoeuvre within research, the paper explores the possibilities and limits of contemporary research structures to accommodate this alternative way of producing knowledge. Introducing the concept of "transdisciplinary knowledge regime", the article finally argues that this kind of knowledge production cannot be understood through solely focusing on the specific epistemological and normative prescriptions, but demands close consideration of the complex entanglements between the epistemic, the institutional, the social and the ideological perspectives in contemporary research. All this also raises new issues of responsibility towards early stage researchers.

AB  - Recent neurophysiological advances may support the advisability of delaying decisions when possible and practical. An empirical study, based on an educational dilemma, compared the outcome of postponing an educational decision overnight or for a longer period. 340 teachers read a report on an educational dilemma and gave an immediate opinion. About half of the group reviewed their decision after an overnight delay; the rest did so after a month. Participants were not involved with the dilemma between sessions. The cognitive aspects of the question addressed by participants in the immediate and delayed decisions were compared. After a month's delay, more cognitive aspects were utilized than in the decision taken after one day. The immediate decision was least comprehensive. Postponement of educational decisions offers the opportunity to utilize a richer variety of cognitive sources.

AB  - Peer assessment provides students with multiple benefits during their learning process. The aim of our study is to examine students' perception of peer assessment. Questionnaires were administered before and after the peer-assessment process to 416 students studying 11 different subjects in four different fields taught at the University of Girona. Results suggest that students have a positive predisposition towards this methodology, both before and after its implementation. Students perceive it as a both motivating and recommended methodology that facilitates the acquisition of learning at different levels. As for its limitations, students highlight the responsibility that comes with it and a certain amount of distrust in fellow students' abilities to peer-assess.

AB  - Although research in the field of language teaching and learning has appeared to enhance classroom pedagogy, I argue here that these advances have had a relatively small impact on actual foreign language learning. Unlike in most school subjects, the recipients of language pedagogy, i.e. the students, arrive in the classroom with several predetermined advantages or impediments that have a mitigating influence on the effectiveness of teaching practices, and these are not generally considered in sufficient detail by language teaching research (LTR). Recently, however, new findings arriving from research in biological science, using equipment and techniques that penetrate the brain, are providing remarkable insights on how languages are learnt. This success from the laboratory is contrasted with the limited improvements resulting from traditional LTR based in the social sciences. Thus, I contend that research into how languages are best taught requires a more interdisciplinary approach that includes methods and instruments from the biological sciences.

AB  - Introducing students to a multidisciplinary research laboratory presents challenges in terms of learning specific technical skills and concepts but also with respect to integrating different technical elements to form a coherent picture of the research. Here we present a multidisciplinary series of experiments we have developed in the Electronic, Optical, and Nano Materials group at Sandia National Laboratories to introduce students to essential experimental methods and concepts spanning thin film synthesis, crystallography, electrochemistry, and optical spectroscopy. With minimal assistance from a qualified instructor, students apply a sol-gel method to synthesize electrochromic tungsten oxide (WO[subscript3]) thin films and evaluate their performance with electrochemistry, UV-vis spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. We find that the color changing WO[subscript3] films capture the students' attention, are technologically relevant, and make excellent materials platforms for multidisciplinary research as they invite investigation with a range of laboratory techniques. The variety of experimental methods combined here challenges the students to correlate the interplay between structure, processing, and properties central to materials science. The modular nature of this experiment set permits it to be tailored to the time constraints of individual students and also allows it to be applied to upper-level materials science or chemistry laboratories.

AB  - Our commentary responds to the five articles of the special issue on multidisciplinary collaboration to support struggling readers. From our perspectives informed by experiences working with diverse student and family populations in urban settings, preparing pre- and in-service educators and specialists to do the same, and working in federally funded technical assistance and dissemination centers focused on equity issues in general and special education, we highlight themes and raise issues across the articles. Accordingly, we discuss learning to read in the broader context of literacy acquisition, and examine issues of effectiveness, power, and privilege within consultative and collaborative professional relationships aimed at addressing diverse learners' reading capacities and outcomes.

AB  - There is a universal demand for well-prepared professionals in all disciplines, and society has entrusted professional schools with the task of preparing such individuals (Ralph, Walker, and Wimmer, 2008). Within this context, field or clinical instructors and university faculty have an academic and professional responsibility to teach, supervise, and evaluate students' field or clinical experience to ensure that each graduate of their program is competent. However, there is evidence that some instructors and university faculty experience difficulty in identifying and making decisions to fail students who display incompetent or unsatisfactory practice (Bogo, Regehr, Power, and Regehr, 2007; Brown, Neudorf, Poitras, and Rodgers, 2007; Hawe, 2003). A qualitative descriptive design was used to explore the issue of "failure to fail" in professional programs including Nursing, Education, and Social Work. Results indicate that: (a) failing a student is a difficult process; (b) both academic and emotional support are required for students and field instructors/ preceptors/ faculty advisors; (c) there are consequences for programs, faculty, and students when a student has failed a placement; (d) at times, personal, professional, and structural reasons exist for failing to fail a student; and (e) the reputation of the professional program can be diminished as a result of failing to fail a student. Recommendations for improving the quality of field or clinical experiences and support for students and field instructors/preceptors and will thus improve the quality of our programs and graduates are presented.

AB  - Biochemistry and molecular biology education starts before our students get to university. From a very early age, they start learning informally about science beginning with the basics of science and as they progress through their school years they should be exposed to more advanced topics such as biochemistry and molecular biology. This session at the conference focused on three very different examples of engaging school students with biochemistry and molecular biology.

AB  - In many health-related programs biochemistry and molecular biology are core subjects, but these subjects are often not the students main focus. This challenges educators to develop curriculum that demonstrates the relevance of biochemistry and molecular biology and engages these students. This conference session discussed the value of biochemistry and molecular biology education in the health sciences and the methodologies which can be implemented.

AB  - Earth's critical zone (CZ) is the uppermost layer of Earth's continents, which supports ecosystems and humans alike. CZ science aims to understand how interactions among rock, soil, water, air, and terrestrial organisms influence Earth as a habitable system. Thus, CZ science provides the framework for a holistic-systems approach to teaching Earth surface and environmental science, especially related to environmental sustainability. Here, we describe efforts by an interdisciplinary team to create a full-semester, university curriculum that introduces upper-division students to CZ science. Course topics include a background in CZ science, key concepts and methods of CZ science, and units on land-atmosphere interactions, water budgets, landscape evolution, and biogeochemistry. The course culminates with a unit on human interactions within the CZ. Through interactive activities that use data sets from U.S. CZ observatories, the course emphasizes how a CZ framework is appropriate for teaching concepts across scientific disciplines, concepts of environmental sustainability, and the usefulness of CZ science for considering humanity's grand challenges. Materials can be integrated into existing courses or used as an independent course to maximize instructor flexibility; all materials were piloted in eight separate courses across a range of university settings. Although preassessments and postassessments of geoscience literacy did not show much change, students overwhelmingly agreed that they could use what they learned to help society overcome grand challenges. Thus, the holistic-systems approach advocated by CZ science and explored throughout this curriculum provides a unique opportunity to engage students in thinking about complex issues related to environmental sustainability.

AB  - This paper aims to interrogate the potential and challenges in interdisciplinary working across disciplinary boundaries by examining a longitudinal partnership designed to research student experiences of digital technologies in undergraduate medicine established by the authors of this paper (one from Education and the other from Medical Education). The paper is situated in current methodological trends including the changing value of replicability and evidence-based methods and increases in qualitative and mixed methods studies in medical education, whilst education research has seen growing encouragement for randomized controlled trials and large-scale quantitative studies. A critical analysis of the partnership interactions is framed by Holland's positional and imagined identities, negotiated across "figured" worlds and the concept of epistemic games that guide knowledge construction. We consider social, political and cultural challenges; and how "in-between" sites of knowledge were established where the academic identity of each was shaped by engaging with the other and new theoretical, methodological and ethical understandings were co-constructed. The paper concludes that despite the ongoing challenges, "bottom-up" partnerships can contribute to a growth in interdisciplinarity which might itself be understood as a boundary object. Interdisciplinarity necessitates improvisation and boundary crossing and can, therefore, always be considered a matter of negotiation, creativity and collaboration.

AB  - This article outlines the theoretical rationale and process for an integrated-science approach to teaching sensation and perception (S&P) to undergraduate psychology students that may also serve as an integrated-science curriculum. The course aimed to introduce the interdisciplinary evolution of this psychological field irrespective of any presumed distinctions between hard and soft science. The class began with perceptual science's foundations in Fourier decomposition and culminated in more recent developments with the perceptual science's interest in pattern-formation phenomena from fluid dynamics, and class illustrated this transition with various applications in music, art, and materials science. Post-course responses to the Research on Integrated Science Curriculum survey demonstrated that our students made significantly large gains in course elements, specifically making the most of the students pre-existing experiences. We find that students are ready and willing to engage in the study of S&P by setting aside neuroscience's sometimes constraining assumptions.

AB  - Despite the promise of research conducted at the intersection of computer-assisted language learning (CALL), natural language processing, and second language acquisition, few studies have explored the potential benefits of using intelligent CALL systems to deepen our understanding of the process and products of second language (L2) learning. The strategic use of technology offers researchers novel methodological opportunities to examine how incremental changes in L2 development occur during treatment as well as how the longitudinal impacts of experimental interventions on L2 learning outcomes occur on a case-by-case basis. Drawing on the pilot results from a project examining the effects of automatic input enhancement on L2 learners' development, this article explores how the use of technology offers additional methodological and analytical choices for the investigation of the process and outcomes of L2 development, illustrating the opportunities to study what learners do "during" visually enhanced instructional activities.

AB  - Education for sustainable development (ESD) persists as an important concept within international policy and yet, despite considerable debate, there remains a lack of consensus as to a pedagogy for ESD in schools. This paper presents findings from a study investigating how an interdisciplinary approach to ESD in England developed one class of 16- and 17-year-old geography students' understandings of sustainability. The research used students' drawings of sustainable cities alongside questionnaires and semi-structured interviews to explore their understanding of sustainable development within a constructivist, case study framework. The study found that the use of poetry within a geography lesson developed students' appreciation of the social and economic dimensions of sustainability, although their focus persisted around the environmental. As such, it is argued that an interdisciplinary approach to ESD encourages students to engage more critically and affectively with the concept of sustainable development, thereby developing a more holistic appreciation of it.

AB  - This paper takes an institutional perspective on the topic of sustainability in order to analyse how this "idea" enters science teacher education through an interdisciplinary approach. It shows how the development and implementation of a course for Danish pre-service teachers was conditioned and constrained by a complex web of interactions in and among the teaching disciplines of biology, geography and physics/chemistry and among the institutions of school, teacher college and university. The data collected are used to identify influences among the disciplines as well as disciplinary differences, conceptualised through a new reference model that separates the analysis from the usual sustainability dimensions. The findings reveal how sustainability as a teaching topic can be a unifying idea in an interdisciplinary setting. Disciplinary differences evidently impact course planning and implementation significantly, but not exclusively. By elaborating on the interactions between these circumstances, the paper provides insight into the processes of developing interdisciplinary teacher education.

AB  - In this essay I pose questions to literacy teacher educators and classroom teachers to inspire them to review their epistemological beliefs about teaching, learning, and knowledge. I also provide some history of transdisciplinarity, and introduce readers to "Miss Smith", a composite of five middle school teachers who hold a transdisciplinary orientation. Next, I connect some important tenets of transdisciplinarity to a holistic inquiry conducted by Miss Smith and her students. An expert in curriculum and educational policy then offers a response commentary about the power and challenges of transdisciplinary teaching. I conclude the essay with some final questions for readers to prompt their thinking about the dominant standards-based assessments in United States schools today and the feasibility of a future transdisciplinary curriculum.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this self-reflective paper is to focus on practical efforts to combat inequality and foster intercultural dialogue in education. It introduces "knowledge alliances", a type of social practice open for education technologies. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is structured in a theoretical and an empirical part. The theoretical part ledge production is divided in two sections: the first one summarizes transdisciplinarity and Paulo Freire's dialogical pedagogy as two innovative approaches to knowledge sharing, production and appropriation. In the second section knowledge alliances are presented as innovative forms of lasting learning and research partnerships. The empirical part presents a case study and discusses the potential and limits of this specific knowledge alliance. Findings: The paper demonstrates the importance of a partnership approach to combat inequality and discrimination. Knowledge alliance is a normative as well as an analytical concept to grasp the dynamics of lasting and transdisciplinary cooperation. For multicultural education, their implementation can be supported by learning technologies. Research limitations/implications: The paper is a self-reflection on a lasting learning and research cooperation which offers deep insights into practical challenges. The limitations of these socially innovative practices are the lack of ex-ante scientific rigor. Practical implications: The paper argues in favour of lasting cooperation. Social implications: The paper shows the necessity to link practice and theory in knowledge alliances which last beyond the single project. Originality/value: The paper introduces the term knowledge alliances and the related normative and analytical implications. (Contains 6 notes.)

AB  - The study aimed to investigate the benefits of teaching pre-vocational education (PVE) through the collaboration of the other teacher with the PVE teacher. The study adopted experimental and descriptive methodologies. An experiment was conducted through collaboration of teachers of different subjects in Pre-Vocational Education (PVE) to teach a class for a full school year (the experimental group), and another class was taught by the PVE teacher only (the control group). The number of students in each class was 35 students. To identify the effect of the experiment from the teachers point of view a semi-structured interview was conducted with each one of the participant teachers, while students responded to an attitudes scale in addition to practical and theoretical achievement tests. Results revealed that collaborative teaching that was undertaken co-operatively by the PVE teacher and teachers of other subjects better improved students' achievement and attitudes towards PVE in comparison to teaching only by the PVE teacher. It was also found that there are other benefits of multiteacher collaboration on the delivery of PVE; among these were: better training on practical skills, better integration with other school subjects, better record of students' progress that is required for guidance purposes, in addition to better time utilization of classes.

AB  - This article presents a "telling case" of an interdisciplinary, team-teaching experience that explores how participants eschewed "ethnocentricism" of their fields of study in order to learn from each other, while providing instruction to students and analysing data collected from the class (a graduate course on literature and pedagogy). Through the process, the participants (a professor of English education and a professor of literature) ground the perspectives of literary interpretation in their field of study and "languaculture," and developed a conceptual framework that guided their interactions and analysis of the discursive actions of the class. An ethnographic perspective served as the conceptual frame and informed how the participants observed, described, and developed claims about classroom interactions. Through this study, the participants answer calls for more examples of how faculty in higher education engage in interdisciplinary teaching and research and the need for faculty to develop conceptual ethnographic frameworks for their collaborations.

AB  - A design studio is a critical venue for design students, as they are educated to develop design thinking and other skills through studio courses. This article introduces a design studio project in which Korean and Malaysian students worked jointly for one semester to design affordable urban housing. The Korean students were interior design majors and the Malaysian students were architecture majors; thus it was thought that the students' areas of expertise were likely to differ. It was also anticipated that the students would display cultural differences in terms of housing and planning practices. The motive for starting the joint design studio was the idea that a cross-cultural collaborative working setting could redefine students' thinking styles and stimulate students to obtain non-routine perspectives on the design of buildings and spaces. Through observation and interviews, we explored how students tackled affordable housing problems within the context of cross-cultural and interdisciplinary design education. Collaborative learning in a joint studio situation supplemented students' expertise, re-orienting approaches to design and opening up a holistic approach to the design issues of affordability, sustainability and community. Overall, the practical learning in the joint studio project validated the importance of exploring alternative solutions based on varied levels of information, and input of those from different educational and cultural backgrounds. The cross-cultural and interdisciplinary collaboration allowed for a previously unavailable enhancement of design education by encouraging students to obtain divergent thinking for innovative design ideas.

AB  - Both the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) and its Division for Early Childhood (DEC) recognize that one of the critical factors in the provision of evidence-based practices for children with special needs and their families is a well-prepared workforce. Therefore, CEC has developed initial and advanced personnel standards to be used to design, implement, and evaluate preservice and advanced programs within colleges and universities and for national accreditation of those programs. They should also guide the development of in-service content and state certification policies. DEC's initial and advanced specialty sets include knowledge and skill statements that inform the CEC standards. Similarly, the National Association for the Education of Young Children and related services professional associations have promulgated personnel standards. With the trend toward inclusive and interdisciplinary service delivery for young children with special needs and their families, collaborations have developed across associations to align their standards for greater ease of use by relevant stakeholder groups. The development of these alignments and their potential application by higher education faculty, in-service providers, state policy makers, and researchers is discussed within the context of what the current research suggests regarding inclusive and interdisciplinary practices.

AB  - The Federal University of São Paulo, Baixada Santista Campus was founded in 2006 with five degree-granting programs in physical education, physiotherapy, nutrition, psychology, and occupational therapy. The guiding principle behind the programs' educational mission was centered on the development of health care professionals capable of working in interdisciplinary teams with an emphasis on holistic patient care. This pedagogical structure required peer-mentoring programs in order to integrate different areas of knowledge and to improve learning strategies among new generations of students. The authors' objective in the present report is to discuss the strategies and activities of the peer-mentoring program in histophysiology and gross anatomy in an interdisciplinary and interprofessional curriculum. Evaluations by students, mentors and professors are presented, along with a statistical analysis of variance comparing student performance in the module assessments according to their participation in the peer-mentoring activities. The results demonstrated that students who participated in peer-mentoring activities enjoyed a higher rate of academic success than those who did not participate. In addition, student and mentor evaluations of the peer mentoring program were highly positive. The program enabled mentors to gain a deeper knowledge of the subjects addressed in the learning modules, as well as to develop intrinsic teaching skills during their time as mentors. In short, the authors believe that the peer-mentoring program has been validated for its effectiveness in raising student academic performance.

AB  - In the current research study the use of Wikis as an online didactic tool to apply project-based learning in higher education was reported. The study was conducted in university teacher education programmes. During the online activities, participants developed interdisciplinary projects for the primary school working collaboratively in small groups in a Wiki virtual environment within the Moodle platform. Science was at the core of the projects and acted as an organising hub to finding links with other disciplines. A mixed-methods approach involving the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data was adopted in the current research study. The authors developed the following three instruments in order to measure both processes and outcomes of the online activities: the interdisciplinary project-based learning questionnaire, the reflection questionnaire and a rubric for assessing interdisciplinary projects. The current paper focuses only on the qualitative data, which were subjected to an inductive content analysis. Results provided evidence of the processes involved during the collaborative activities and that online activities can develop teachers' abilities to design projects in interdisciplinary contexts. The discussion highlights the aspects of the online environment that made the collaborative work effective in learning. Future implications and suggestions for teacher education programmes are discussed.

AB  - Interdisciplinary work is increasingly becoming a larger expectation in research and teaching. Moreover, prominent kinesiologists have proposed interdisciplinary research as a solution to perceived and/or real fragmentation issues that have developed within the field and across, and even within the various subdisciplines. For such an important topic, however, there is a lack of research surrounding interdisciplinary research in kinesiology. This may be due to the ambiguity surrounding interdisciplinary research, an often misunderstood and misapplied concept with deep philosophical roots. The purpose of this article is to help those in kinesiology understand and use interdisciplinary concepts in their work. Toward this end, the article provides an overview of the literature and suggests kinesiology-specific definitions for interdisciplinary and intradisciplinary research. Additionally, the article gives examples of interdisciplinary research projects. Finally, the article will expand beyond scholarship and explore the importance of interdisciplinary teaching and service as well.

AB  - This study contributes to existing methodological knowledge by showing how a transformed research methods curriculum, which is beyond the milieu of schooling, can engage postgraduate students in a critical dialogue on how knowledge is produced in industry and higher education. Initial insights are drawn from two interpretive studies that employed interdisciplinary methods, and guidelines are developed to encourage educators and industry experts to be reflexive about producing knowledge that is needed for managerial decision making. Further insights were also drawn from in-depth interviews with 20 postgraduate students and six research supervisors across different universities. The findings demonstrate how the adoption of interdisciplinary research skills is interconnected with moving research students from a position of being disengaged to being engaged when conducting research, and consequently producing managers that are better equipped to deal with the challenges facing industry in a globalized business environment. The authors argue that by embracing traditional and innovative interdisciplinary research skills in the research methods curricula, future managers are presented with richer information that will help to solve industry-related problems. It is further argued that this will also help to sharpen the skills needed in emerging economies to deal with challenges in the world of work.

AB  - Health professionals and policymakers are asking educators to place more emphasis on food and nutrition education. Integrating these topics into science curricula using hand-on, food-based activities may strengthen students' understanding of science concepts. The Food, Math, and Science Teaching Enhancement Resource (FoodMASTER) Initiative is a compilation of programs aimed at using food as a tool to teach mathematics and science. Previous studies have shown that students experiencing the FoodMASTER curriculum were very excited about the activities, became increasingly interested in the subject matter of food, and were able to conduct scientific observations. The purpose of this study was to: (1) assess 4th graders food-related multidisciplinary science knowledge, and (2) compare gains in food-related science knowledge after implementation of an integrated, food-based curriculum. During the 2009-2010 school year, FoodMASTER researchers implemented a hands-on, food-based intermediate curriculum in eighteen 4th grade classrooms in Ohio ("n" = 9) and North Carolina ("n" = 9). Sixteen classrooms in Ohio ("n" = 8) and North Carolina ("n" = 8), following their standard science curricula, served as comparison classrooms. Students completed a researcher-developed science knowledge exam, consisting of 13 multiple-choice questions administered pre-and post-test. Only subjects with pre-and post-test scores were entered into the sample (Intervention n = 343; Control n = 237). No significant differences were observed between groups at pre-test. At post-test, the intervention group scored (9.95 ± 2.00) significantly higher (p = 0.000) than the control group (8.84 ± 2.37) on a 13-point scale. These findings suggest the FoodMASTER intermediate curriculum is more effective than a standard science curriculum in increasing students' multidisciplinary science knowledge related to food.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to argue that substantive changes are required in both curricula and pedagogical practice in higher education institutions to challenge dominant epistemologies and discourses and to unsettle current ways of thinking about, and acting in relation to, the environment. Central to such a shift, it is argued, is the need for higher education curricula to be interdisciplinary and for pedagogical practices to work to build capacities in students for critical and reflective thinking. Design/Methodology/Approach: In this paper, a case study of our reflections is offered on a subject designed to promote capacities in students for critical and reflective thinking via an interdisciplinary approach. The paper uses data from student reflective essays and student course evaluations to make an argument for the success of this approach. Findings: Genuine transformative learning can occur within a constructivist informed pedagogical approach to teaching for sustainability. Research Limitations/Implications: Research implications are that genuine transformation can occur in students' thinking processes (which the paper argues is critical for effective education in sustainability) with appropriately designed courses in higher education. Practical Implications: More effective environmental actors and thinkers, who can critically engage with the complexity of environmental problems. Social Implications: Social implications include a more effective and socially just higher education for sustainability Originality/Value: The authors know of no other narrative that addresses attempts to educate for sustainability using this approach.

AB  - Interventions that comprise interdisciplinary collaboration including behavioral elements are effective in addressing lifestyle disease risk factors. However, it is not known how best to conduct this collaboration for sustainable change. The aim of this study was to systematically examine the evidence for the effects of interdisciplinary interventions on lifestyle disease risk factors including weight, lipid levels, glycemic control, and blood pressure. To do so, a systematic review of the literature was conducted using the databases Scopus, Medline, and Web of Science (all years to September 2014). Eighteen articles describing 16 studies of interdisciplinary interventions were identified. Consistent results were found for effects on weight loss but not for effects on blood lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure. Effective interventions involved collaborations between dieticians, exercise physiologists, and psychologists and incorporated intensive initial participant engagement. Few studies investigated the long-term effect of interventions, but where this was done, the maintenance of favorable changes required ongoing participant support. Current evidence suggests that interdisciplinary interventions are effective in promoting weight loss and that ongoing support of participants is key to maintaining results beyond initial study duration. Future studies should examine long-term effects in pragmatic trials that address translation to practice.

AB  - To assist learners in obtaining professional abilities, meet social demand for talent, and achieve favorable educational outcomes, academic courses generally have unique syllabuses, learning goals, and teaching purposes according to their characteristics and specialized knowledge and skills. Furthermore, it could help the students of Industrial Design enhance the connection with employment after the graduation when they understand the characteristics of auxiliary devices and equipment before entering workplaces. Meanwhile, the students being cultivated the design capability could improve and innovate tools, as the improvement of auxiliary devices and the practical design of innovative products and the functions from a professional engineer are close to the users' demands. In this study, the Delphi method, a group decision-making technique, and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) multiattribute decision-making function was adopted to establish a decision-making model for designing multifunctional products for assessing the students of Industrial Design in learning effectiveness in innovative engineering product design and development. In addition, a practical multifunctional product-design case was investigated to demonstrate the application of the model. This study found that integrating interdisciplinary courses and instruction by industry professionals and introducing industry-academia cooperation had a considerable influence on interdisciplinary teaching and learning.

AB  - Interdisciplinary approaches to research in the sciences have become increasingly important in solving a wide range of pressing problems at both global and local levels. It is imperative then that science majors in higher education understand the need for exploring information from a wide array of disciplines. With this in mind, interdisciplinary instruction has the potential to bring new insights and methods to enhance learning and promote critical thinking skills while itself modeling the benefits of interdisciplinary practice in research. This paper explores an interdisciplinary collaboration between a librarian and a chemist seeking to improve student research and critical thinking skills through the utilization of problem-based learning. A module exploring the interdisciplinary nature of science was implemented for an advanced Biochemistry class and delivered in a library setting. Initial findings of this pilot project suggest that the implementation of a carefully constructed, problem-based curriculum has the potential to improve research skills and multidisciplinary thinking as well as engender a more holistic view of chemical research.

AB  - This article highlights the multianalytical study of exuded liquid from an ancient Egyptian sealed alabaster vase by Master's students in an applied chemistry for cultural heritage course. Master students are introduced to the field of Archaeometry that see the collaboration of experts in different areas of research such as conservators, curators of museums, physicists, chemists, etc. The sample is a residue exuded on the linen strip sealing an ancient Egyptian alabaster vase (inventory number S.8448) from the collection of the Museo Egizio in Turin (Italy). The students start to plan the noninvasive investigation by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) for the inorganic compounds characterization, followed by the extraction of the organic components (such as oils, fats, and waxes) to be analyzed by high-resolution [superscript 1]H and [superscript 13]C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and 2D NMR correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), and long-range heteronuclear correlation (HMBC) techniques and by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Reference standards, spectral databases, and published data on similar artifacts served as the basis for the interpretation of the instrumental results. The approach was introduced in the course of Applied Chemistry for Cultural Heritage for Master students in Archaeology (University of Palermo, Italy), where the need is to know how to approach the scientific investigation together with the conservation scientists and how to manage with a very low amount of sample. Pedagogically, the approach introduces students to the main techniques currently used in the field of Archaeometry while reinforcing fundamental concepts in sample collecting and multicomponent microsample analysis. This interdisciplinary approach provides a unique experience that demonstrates chemistry's broad applicability outside of the traditional laboratory. Students are guided to identify the inorganic and organic components of the exudate liquid: the first one is ascribable to clay minerals iron oxides, which could impart the brown color to the sample; the second one is ascribed to triglycerides of various kinds, which probably comes from vegetable oil.

AB  - Self and peer assessment offers benefits for enhancing student learning. Peer moderation provides a convenient solution for awarding individual marks in group assignments. This paper provides a significant review of peer-mark moderation, and describes an award winning, web-based tool that was developed in the UK and is now spreading across the world as an open-source web application. It is available for use in any discipline. Qualitative research, at the home institution over several years, reinforces the evaluation of quantitative data extracted from the system and from an extensive user survey to confirm, update and strengthen the previous literature. The research also describes new insights into the thoughts of students, who appear to recognise the transparency that automated moderation offers. The statistics suggest few incidences of team-collusion when entering data, but indicate that peer-marking behaviour is influenced by group size, selection method and year of study. Students comment positively on the recognition of their levels of achievement within a team.

AB  - Recently, there are many good examples of how multi-disciplinary learning can support students to learn collaboratively and not solely focus on a single professional sector. During the Fall 2011 and Spring 2012 semesters, we have attempted to gather students studying different professional domains together. Students from the Department of Computing (COMP) and the School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) are involved as partners and team members to work on joint student projects. One group of SHTM students is planning a conference event in 2012 with over 300 guests. These students act as the clients who require a banquet management system as well as a delegates managing application. Another group of SHTM students is to manage the development projects with the support of IT consultants who are in fact the COMP students. During the Fall semester, different communication channels have been set up to facilitate the inter-group and intra-group communications with the support offered by an e-learning system, Blackboard. Furthermore, there are classroom presentations given by the SHTM students and prototype demonstrations prepared by the COMP students. Pre-project and post-project questionnaires have been given to all participating students in order to assess their gain in professional and business knowledge in 2 different areas, namely database application development and conference management. During the Spring semester, another group of COMP students continued the development and made the 2 systems available on the Web. The two systems were used in a real conference and have received many positive feedbacks. In this paper, we would like to report the group dynamics of our students, achievement and difficulties encountered in this multi-disciplinary project. (Contains 5 tables and 5 figures.)

AB  - Often the traditional creative arts curriculum does not sufficiently respond to, nor reflect, contemporary work practice. Multidisciplinary teams are now increasingly the norm in creative arts practice especially when driven by technological innovation. Drawing on contemporary research that centres on the benefits of multidisciplinary collaboration, Creative Exchange is a direct attempt to implement multidisciplinary practice within a tertiary learning environment. Outcomes aim to prepare students for dynamic engagement with the challenges and possibilities of their future workplace in the creative arts industries. After the initial planning stages and based on recent research findings, the scope of Creative Exchange has broadened from collaborative engagement within the creative arts to a broader rationale that includes non-creative arts' disciplines e.g. Information Technology, Business and Journalism. In order to develop a sustainable solution this approach was formalised in the POOL MODEL framework (Fleischmann, 2008a, 2008b, 2010) within which Creative Exchange saw its first implementation in 2009 in the School of Creative Arts at James Cook University.

AB  - The University of California-Merced's Core 1 has potential to foster genuine interdisciplinary thinking by asking students to conceptualize knowledge across fields of inquiry. Core 1 introduces students to the range of scholarly inquiry at the university all in the span of one semester-long, writing-intensive, integrated curriculum that encourages them to make their own connections among the disciplines while practicing both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Examining Core 1 in the context of general education literature affords new insights into tensions between general education course delivery and content and the meaning of general education for contemporary university students.

AB  - Radiation oncologists require an in-depth understanding of anatomical relationships for modern clinical practice, although most do not receive formal anatomy training during residency. To fulfill the need for instruction in relevant anatomy, a series of four multidisciplinary, interactive learning modules were developed for a cohort of radiation oncology and medical physics residents. Instructional design was based on established learning theories, with the intent of integrating knowledge of specific anatomical regions with radiology and radiation oncology practice. Each session included presentations by a radiologist and a radiation oncologist, as well as hands-on exploration of anatomical specimens with guidance from anatomists. Pre- and post-tests distributed during each session showed significant short-term knowledge retention. According to qualitative surveys and exit interviews, participants felt more comfort with delineating structures, gross anatomy, and radiograph interpretation at the end of each session. Overall participant experience was positive, and the modules were considered effective for learning radiologic anatomy. Suggestions for future interventions include more time, increased clinical application, additional contouring practice and feedback, and improved coordination between each of the three disciplines. Results and conclusions from this study will be used to inform the design of a future multi-day national workshop for Canadian radiation oncology residents.

AB  - The paper employs interdisciplinarity as a theoretical lens for describing meaningful content/ language partnerships and establishing an ontology for such partnerships. Interdisciplinary collaboration, as defined by scholars, entails the integration of knowledge across domains and the clear valuing of all contributors in addressing an issue located at the intersection of multiple domains. The paper begins by reviewing the literature on modes of collaboration and definitions of interdisciplinarity to establish the theoretical framework. It then describes research on learning, including situated learning and metacognition, that highlights the need for teaching collaborations marked by interdisciplinary approaches. Finally, the paper examines the ways in which an interdisciplinary framework can mediate issues surrounding power and trust among content and language collaborators, and concludes by highlighting the ways in which interdisciplinary collaborations can occur in a variety of institutional structures.

AB  - Interdisciplinary projects offer a strategy for German programs to become more visible and valued in the university context. Freedom Without Walls at Chapman University offers a case study of a project that situates the German program within an institution's larger goals. When building a project, the German program should look first to existing expertise, interests, and resources on campus. Connection with the institution's mission and vision is also essential. With funding from the German government to U.S. universities, Freedom Without Walls encompassed events in art, poetry, film, communications, and other disciplines as well as a gala and a team in the 5K run/walk.

AB  - In California, individuals with autism and co-occurring mental disorders, and their families, face two serious barriers when attempting to access the mental health services they need. The first is that the State Mental Health Specialty Service guidelines specifically exclude autism as a qualifying primary diagnosis for eligibility for mental health treatment and funding. The second is the lack of understanding and awareness regarding the challenges faced by individuals with classic autism and co-occurring mental disorders and their families. These two barriers, combined with the absence of a clear protocol for referral and assessment, have made access to services for clients and their families difficult. The Adult Autism Spectrum Disorder and Co-Occurring Mental Health Disorders project was an opportunity to study potential assessment tools and referral guidelines. We evaluated the use in a clinical setting of the Schedule for the Assessment of Psychiatric Problems Associated with Autism--a research instrument designed specifically for the psychiatric evaluation of patients with autism--to assist in diagnosing co-occurring mental health disorders. The experience gained in this study helped identify effective treatment options as well. After the assessment, clients were offered choices among several possible treatments fitting their specific needs. Our experience indicates that while adapting a research tool to everyday clinical service may encourage a more rigorous standardized approach to clinical assessment and evaluation, it may be difficult to employ such a tool in a clinical setting because of service needs and managed care constraints of serving a large and diverse population.

AB  - This paper examines the recommendations contained in Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) aimed at encouraging the integration of knowledge, skills and understanding across different areas of the curriculum. It first outlines what is said in the official CfE documentation and supporting materials produced by Education Scotland, noting the absence of references to earlier work on curriculum integration and interdisciplinarity. The sections that follow focus on four issues that are critical for the coherence and success of attempts to promote interdisciplinary work: the way in which interdisciplinarity is conceptualised; ensuring that cross-curricular connections are convincing and intellectually challenging; devising pedagogic strategies that are effective; and addressing operational obstacles to interdisciplinary work. The paper ends by posing a series of questions that need to be considered if the aims of interdisciplinary learning are to be achieved. It is suggested that, at present, these aims are well-intentioned but rather ill-defined.

The research grew out of an interest in exploring the nature of our work and the practices that contribute to its success. Our self-study revealed that our work process consists of five stages and is the product of careful weaving of our different disciplinary lenses. The five stages are creating a collaborative environment, initial inquiry, shared inquiry, scholarly connection, and in practice and beyond. We describe these stages in detail, illustrating our use of dialog, reflection, and scholarly inquiry across our disciplines to improve our teaching.

AB  - Purpose: A modern business graduate is expected to have strong disciplinary skills as well as the soft skills of communication and team work. However today's business graduate needs to be more than the traditional "I-shaped" graduate of the past and more of the "T-shaped" graduate employers are looking for. Many undergraduate business degrees profess to offer integration of the curriculum but on investigation this occurs mainly through a capstone subject at the end of the degree. Today's business graduates need a more integrated approach to their learning. This paper aims to outline the transformation of a traditional business curriculum to one that is inter-disciplinary, outlining the necessary steps and conditions including the most challenging--faculty buy in. Design/methodology/approach: The review of the Bachelor of Business degree at University of Technology Sydney (UTS) provided an opportunity to explore the option to embrace an integrated curriculum. The authors outline how the review was shaped, the need for change and the approaches to interdisciplinary business education, and an approach to designing an interdisciplinary curriculum. They also provide two case studies. Findings: Approaches to developing an integrative curriculum can take many forms, but the most effective is one that is embedded throughout an entire degree program. This must start with a cornerstone subject to set the road map for the student's study. This subject needs to demonstrate how each discipline interrelates and how at the end of the degree through a capstone subject, this knowledge is again brought together to deal with more complex issues using the more sophisticated tools studied throughout the degree. There also needs to be a strategy that integrates the various first-year disciplinary subjects traditionally included in an undergraduate business degree. Originality/value: This paper aims to outline the transformation of a traditional business curriculum to one that is inter-disciplinary and integrated. The outcome of such an approach produces graduates with the inter-disciplinary skills that employers are looking for. (Contains 8 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - Course-integrated Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) involve large numbers of students in real research. We describe a late-year microbiology CURE in which students use yeast to address a research question around beer brewing or synthesizing biofuel; the interdisciplinary student-designed project incorporates genetics, bioinformatics, biochemistry, analytical chemistry, and microbiology. Students perceived significant learning gains around multiple technical and "becoming a scientist" aspects of the project. The project is demanding for both the students and the academic implementers. We examine the rich landscape of support and interaction that this CURE both encourages and requires while also considering how we can support the exercise better and more sustainably. The findings from this study provide a picture of a CURE implementation that has begun to reach the limits of both the students' and the academics' capacities to complete it.

AB  - Various experts and institutions, including the United Nations, have stressed the complexity of the 21st century's global sustainability challenges. Higher education institutions should be at the center of research and education to meet these challenges. However, these institutions also find themselves in crisis, in part due to the economic recession, but also due to traditional disciplinary barriers that do not always incentivize interdisciplinary collaborations and public outreach. Challenges to interdisciplinarity are discussed, and examples of successful approaches are presented to demonstrate possibilities for prioritizing problem-oriented research and education tied to community and industry partnerships across higher education.

AB  - Purpose: The overall purpose of this paper is to clarify the current state of the debate with regard to competencies for interdisciplinarity (ID) for sustainable development (SD) in higher education, to provide further analysis, and to make suggestions for next steps on this basis. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs a critical literature review to identify key themes and gaps in the debate and considers how competencies for ID might be further supported. Findings: The literature review demonstrates developments towards action competencies in ID for sustainability but with an over-reliance on students guiding their own practice and reflection. Findings highlight potential elements of a more widely informed knowledge literacy, including philosophical, sociological and cultural aspects, that is needed to support the development of these competencies. Research limitations/implications: The paper is limited to discussion of foundational aspects and does not cover possible pedagogical strategies, nor does it cover ways of assessing the attainment of competencies. The literature review is also limited by reasons of space. Practical implications: There is a need for a concerted research effort in order to develop coherent sets of competencies to equip students for ID for SD and other-related fields. Social implications: These competencies are at the heart of the new forms of inter-agency and inter-professional working that is increasingly recognised as essential to deliver care and sustainability in a joined-up world. Originality/value: The originality is high as very little in the sustainability literature to date specifically analyses competencies and supporting knowledge for ID in an accessible manner.

AB  - The goals of this article are to appraise second language acquisition's (SLA) disciplinary progress over the last 15 years and to reflect on transdisciplinary relevance as the field has completed 40 years of existence and moves forward into the 21st century. I first identify four trends that demonstrate vibrant disciplinary progress in SLA. I then turn to the notion of transdisciplinarity, or the proclivity to pursue and generate SLA knowledge that can be of use outside the confines of the field and contribute to overall knowledge about the human capacity for language. I propose an understanding of transdisciplinary relevance for SLA that results from the ability: (a) to place one's field in a wider landscape of disciplines that share an overarching common goal and (b) to develop critical awareness of one's disciplinary framings of object of inquiry and goals and others’ likely reception of them. Finally, I argue that it is by reframing SLA as the study of late bi/multilingualism that the remarkable progress witnessed in the last 15 years will help the field reach new levels of transdisciplinary relevance as a contributor to the study of the ontogeny of human language and a source of knowledge in support of language education in the 21st century.

AB  - In this paper, the author (Todorova, Petia) addresses the problems students of humanities and social sciences face in the choice of methodology which they should employ in the theoretic discussion of a given task. This is due to the fact that in the course of their education the necessity of methodological competency is largely neglected and is rarely included as part of their curriculum. Todorova introduces the transdisciplinary approach that allows for the understanding of the complexities of the modern world which is a primary feature of its scientific legitimacy, and adds that the use of transdisciplinary approach is a way to broaden one's academic view on life. This may be achieved by expanding scientific knowledge, by creating a common model of tackling complex subjects, and by improving the methods used in dealing with such complex subjects.

AB  - In this paper, the authentic education system defined with multidisciplinary perspectives (Watagodakumbura, 2013a, 2013b) is viewed from an additional perspective of analytical psychology. Analytical psychology provides insights into human development and is becoming more and more popular among practicing psychologist in the recent past. In addition to human development frameworks already used in defining the mentioned authentic education system, the new viewpoint from analytical psychology gives further insights into the applicability of the concepts and features presented in describing the said system. The main concepts of analytical psychology such as conscious/unconscious, psychological types, the shadow, the self and archetypes are used in elaborating further on the concepts and features of the authentic education system with multidisciplinary perspectives. Consequently, much broader perspectives of the authentic education system discussed are highlighted in this paper.

AB  - This paper reports an interdisciplinary research (IDR) initiative conducted by two lecturers from different university faculties who found they shared an interest in using animations to support teaching and learning. The research comprised an exploratory pilot to test the feasibility, and to explore the impact on learning, of having undergraduates create stop-motion animations of the anatomy of the developing embryo. Whilst this challenge meets definitions of IDR, in that there was a problem of mutual concern and a systematic investigation into that problem, it may be argued that such a small team could evidence only narrow interdisciplinarity. However, the two researchers' views, informed by their different disciplinary experience of research, were very different. This impacted on decisions about how to conduct educational research and their feelings about the authenticity of the different methods proposed. The two researchers' reflections on this initiative show how their perspectives changed over time. It is questionable though whether true interdisciplinary integration was achieved and we conclude that a more helpful approach is to focus on the notion of "researcher as bricoleur", with each research team member selecting, contributing and repurposing relevant knowledge and experience.

AB  - Gaining access to interdisciplinary research sites poses unique research challenges to technical and professional communication scholars and practitioners. Drawing on applied experiences in externally funded interdisciplinary research projects and scholarship about interdisciplinary research, this article describes a training protocol for preparing graduate students to understand the dynamic nature of access in interdisciplinary work as well as to develop a capacity for making a case about the value of their expertise in interdisciplinary research contexts. The authors situate the training protocol in the context of three distinct phases of case-making (individual, relational, and speculative) and note how the conditions for negotiating access vary within and across these phases. The authors conclude by describing implications to graduate students and faculty for theorizing access in this way and developing training to support graduate students' negotiation of access in interdisciplinary work.

AB  - Our paper describes the design and delivery of an online interdisciplinary social science research methods course (ISRM) for graduate students in sociology, education, social work, and public administration. Collaborative activities and learning took place in two types of computer-mediated learning environments: a closed Blackboard course management system and a public facing "openly-networked connected learning" environment designed to facilitate cross-discipline connections, student engagement, and digital fluency. A course formative assessment based on student feedback and instructors' reflections informed the lessons learned about the design and delivery of the course. Our assessment suggests that many of the connected learning goals can be met through the closed course management system rather than through the open platform.

AB  - The goal of this qualitative study is to provide theoretical knowledge and design principles for a creative educational environment characterized by simultaneous study and exploration of science or math, and the arts: Write a Science Opera (WASO). To do so, we used a theory of creativity in education which links collaborative co-creation in creative activity, and identity: Wise Humanizing Creativity (WHC). Data were collected from teachers in interventions during which the WASO environment was implemented in two Norwegian primary schools. The topics of study were the multiplication table at the first school, and temperature at the second. Data relating to these participants' experiences and perceptions were coded and analyzed in order to articulate the kind of creative activity witnessed. The data, which consisted of interviews and reflective notes, were analyzed based on Educational Design Research (EDR) theory in order to explore design principles which could enrich WASO in the future, as well as to provide theoretical knowledge to other educational researchers.

AB  - Internationalization has been an important concept in higher education over the past two decades. The way that internationalization is manifest has consequences to academic disciplines, including geography. A new system of liberal arts colleges in the Netherlands has created opportunities for interdisciplinary education, representing a departure from the traditional model of European higher education. At Leiden University College the focus on global challenges created an opportunity for geography to be integrated into a diverse interdisciplinary and international curriculum. The positioning of geography into the curriculum, however, occurred because its adaptability and breadth, which enabled it to be incorporated into diverse facets of the overall teaching programme. To be successful, however, geographers should be cognizant of specific facets of the discipline suited for an international context. The case study herein reviewed highlights important differences between the U.S. and Dutch (European) context. Additionally, important points for academic geographers (academics) who are in interdisciplinary programmes (i.e. not a geography department) are emphasized, which relates to the development of course materials to suit an international context. The identification of key thematic and methodological disciplinary strands serves as bridges to interdisciplinary opportunities, which was essential to geography's successful establishment within an international curriculum.

AB  - The purpose of this interdisciplinary study was to explore the impacts of tablet technology in a college classroom on students' perceptions of their own learning. Students were asked about oral, written, and graphical communication and critical thinking skills. Mid-semester and end-of-semester surveys were administered to tablet-enabled classes for collection of self-report data. Additionally, objective performance data were gathered from sections of the same courses taught using traditional methods and compared with learning outcomes of those taught using tablets. Students reported that using tablet technology was beneficial for all three types of communication skills. Findings also indicated that tablet usage contributed to a positive effect on dimensions of critical thinking. Implications for these findings are discussed.

AB  - Digital scholarship is becoming a contested area. The huge potential offered by the affordances of the technological possibilities has been illustrated by a range of contributors both in this issue and elsewhere. Other commentators are less convinced about the nature of the changes and the inevitability of changes to the practices of academics. Reviewing the arguments here, this article emphasises the importance of cultural communities and collaborative partnerships between disciplines, and looks to the potential of a new openness in scholarly practices for fostering and being fostered by such interdisciplinary working. The challenge for the future of digital scholarship in humanities research is to grasp the obvious possibilities of this new technological landscape to develop an approach to this work which will fulfil its potential.

AB  - Students in computer science and information technology should be engaged in solving real-world problems received from government and industry as well as those that expose them to various areas of application. In this paper, we discuss interdisciplinary project experiences between majors and non-majors that offered a creative and innovative opportunity for collaborative learning. Active-learning exercises allowed students to express their creativity and apply concepts learned from each discipline. Feedback from this effort resulted in the development of the Seven C's (Competencies) for collaborative learning that were ascertained for successful completion of an interdisciplinary project. We feel that these interdisciplinary and collaborative efforts increased student appreciation, enhanced team skills, and created a positive learning environment for the application of concepts.

AB  - Modern American higher education has blurred lines and roles of academic affairs, student affairs, and enrollment professionals. In a climate that pushes us to be assessment-driven, collaborative, outcomes-orientated, and student-centered, it is key that we have tools to clearly analyze our own campus culture and structures. Many of the areas that we teach in the higher education setting, such as cross-cultural theory and business process, can prove helpful when applied to our own campuses. These theoretical frames can assist higher education practitioners to make genuine assessments as to campus readiness for change and create solid plans for how to achieve next goals.

AB  - Interdisciplinary approaches do not merely satisfy an abstract longing; in post-educational life--especially in a secular, Western, post-modern culture--young people must confront complex issues that transcend any one discipline. Educational systems accordingly have a duty to offer frameworks for understanding this complexity that go beyond any single discipline. In this sense, interdisciplinarity promises a very practical tool kit. Washington State University Honors College has developed a productive interdisciplinary model geographically centered on Iceland and incorporating four academic angles, or disciplines. Kim Andersen and Gary Thorgaard have taught this upper-division honors course, Interdisciplinary Iceland, three times (in the fall of 2010, 2011, 2012) with an average of twenty-five students. In addition, a faculty-led trip to Iceland during the summer of 2012 (also involving Norway) provided valuable experience. In hopes that their course might serve as a practical model for others honors programs, they describe how the course came about, the content areas of the course, the student accomplishments and reactions, and the benefits and complexities of their particular model.

AB  - Global leadership programs framed within singular cultural contexts do not promote authentic leadership. Unilateral methods may exclude individual multicultural experiences or identities, and further, encourage a one-size fits all approach to leadership. An interdisciplinary global leadership course aims to promote authentic unlearning and inclusive leadership education via learning for liberation projects which address a global social justice issue. Student groups direct their own journey and inspire unlearning by interacting with others who are culturally and ideologically different. The project is supplemented by research, frequent reflexivity and intercultural dialogue in order to transform students into authentic and empowered culturally relevant leaders.

AB  - This paper will share the arts-integration methodology used in Project AIM and address the question; "How is translation evident in interdisciplinary arts instruction, and how does it affect students?" Methods: The staff and researchers from Project AIM, (an arts-integration program of the Center for Community Arts Partnerships at Columbia College Chicago), have collected data through student surveys and interviews and teacher and teaching artist interviews to research arts integration as a process of translation. The evaluation team observed planning sessions and classroom instruction, reviewed unit plans, assessment rubrics, instructional handouts and artifacts of student work. Data collection was focused on six of the thirty-two residencies that took place in Project AIM during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 school years. Residencies were selected to ensure variability in terms of art and academic disciplines included in the residency, grade level and school. The process of translation--making meaning across languages of learning and mediums of expression--has informed our data collection and analysis. We have borrowed the terms "source language" and "target language" from the field of second language instruction. Just as a translator searches for words/phrases in a target language to express words/phrases in a source language, Project AIM students search for words/images/gestures/sounds in a target discipline to express what they know in a source discipline. These translations across mediums of expression serve to deepen understanding across content areas. Key Findings: Our research has found: (1) Teachers and teaching artists' development of three specific translation approaches: "scaffolded," "multi-representational," and "interwoven," with each methodology serving different identified needs of instruction; and (2) A statistically significant increase in student learning across four variables measuring higher order thinking skills: (1) When I am going to create something, I can make a plan; (2) I can invent a new way of doing a project; (3) I can create something that represents my ideas; and (4) I can understand many different points of view about the same subject.

AB  - Steven R. Forness is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). His research has primarily focused on early detection and eligibility of children with psychiatric disorders for special education services in public schools. As part of an ongoing oral history project, a conversation was held with Dr. Forness on the past, present, and possible future of the field of providing services to children with emotional-behavioral disorders. Dr. Forness stresses the increasing importance of providing an interdisciplinary approach to meeting these needs. Among the many topics discussed, Dr. Forness gives his views on (1) why he thinks that positive behavior support [PBS] has had positive impact on the field of educating children with emotional behavior disorders; (2) how teacher trainers can provide opportunities where team members can use that interdisciplinary model; (3) the components he would suggest be designed into a master's program to work with children with emotional-behavior disorders; (4) the negative influence of postmodernism; (5) the future for educators in this field; and (6) suggestions for those entering this field.

AB  - In 2000, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study was conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). It is a worldwide study of 15-year-old students' performance in mathematics, science and reading skills. The study showed relatively poor results for German students' scientific literacy (Prenzel et al., 2001). Although the 2009 PISA study reported that these competencies had improved, there is still a demand in the German education system for the development of methods to improve student performance (Rönnebeck et al., 2010). In the light of this evidence, interdisciplinary teaching (IdT) is often considered to be a useful strategy. IdT is acknowledged as a form of education that is able to impart cross-linked and relevant knowledge to students beyond the bounds of individual disciplines (Ministerium für Schule und Weiterbildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen, 1999). This article presents two studies examining IdT's effectiveness in biology and physical education (PE) in the sixth form. This realisation of IdT has not yet been investigated by other studies. The two studies intend to answer the question "Does IdT support the students' skills and knowledge concerning practical application and problem solving better than subject-based teaching?" The first study was conducted with six courses and 141 students, and the second study had six courses and 206 students. Both were conducted for 3 hours a week for a period of 6 weeks. In order to compare effectiveness with that of regular lessons, the studies used a so-called test and control group design. This means that a test group took part in IdT lessons as mentioned above while a control group of peers received "regular" teaching as separate subjects. The effect of different lessons on the students' skills could then be compared. The findings of the studies indicate that there was an improvement in the test groups' knowledge, transfer and problem-solving skills as well as assessment skills in comparison with the control groups. Thus, the effectiveness of IdT units in biology and PE was demonstrated in these two studies. The realisation of the IdT concept presented in this article may function as an inspiration for teachers to use cross-disciplinary teaching units in their everyday teaching.

AB  - Teaching about energy in interdisciplinary settings that emphasize coherence among physics, chemistry, and biology leads to a more central role for chemical bond energy. We argue that an interdisciplinary approach to chemical energy leads to modeling chemical bonds in terms of negative energy. While recent work on ontological metaphors for energy has emphasized the affordances of the substance ontology, this ontology is problematic in the context of negative energy. Instead, we apply a dynamic ontologies perspective to argue that blending the substance and location ontologies for energy can be effective in reasoning about negative energy in the context of reasoning about chemical bonds. We present data from an introductory physics for the life sciences course in which both experts and students successfully use this blended ontology. Blending these ontologies is most successful when the substance and location ontologies are combined such that each is strategically utilized in reasoning about particular aspects of energetic processes.

AB  - Researchers, administrators, and policy makers need valid and reliable information about teaching practices. The Postsecondary Instructional Practices Survey (PIPS) is designed to measure the instructional practices of postsecondary instructors from any discipline. The PIPS has 24 instructional practice statements and nine demographic questions. Users calculate PIPS scores by an intuitive proportion-based scoring convention. Factor analyses from 72 departments at four institutions (N = 891) support a 2- or 5-factor solution for the PIPS; both models include all 24 instructional practice items and have good model fit statistics. Factors in the 2-factor model include (a) instructor-centered practices, nine items; and (b) student-centered practices, 13 items. Factors in the 5-factor model include (a) student--student interactions, six items; (b) content delivery, four items; (c) formative assessment, five items; (d) student-content engagement, five items; and (e) summative assessment, four items. In this article, we describe our development and validation processes, provide scoring conventions and outputs for results, and describe wider applications of the instrument.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify how and why doctoral students do interdisciplinary research. A mixed-methods approach utilising bibliometric analysis of the publications of 195 students identified those who had published interdisciplinary research. This objective measurement of the interdisciplinarity, applying the Rao-Stirling index to Web of Science and Scopus citations, allowed for a comparison of students' interdisciplinary research outcomes from three different computer science programmes: a traditional programme, a multidisciplinary doctoral school and an interdisciplinary doctoral college. Applying a sociocultural approach, interviews with the 15 most interdisciplinary students were analysed to understand how dispositions and experiences of students and factors of the different programmes affect the circumstances and processes of becoming an interdisciplinary early career scientist. The data indicate that student motivations, previous skills and knowledge interacted with policies and programme structures including type of funding and supervisor expectations to play a crucial role in interdisciplinarity at the doctoral level. These factors can give rise to interdisciplinary research even in programmes without interdisciplinary focus and compromise the interdisciplinary goals of interdisciplinary programmes.

AB  - The article explains how to use a project-based method as an effective means of interdisciplinary interaction when teaching a foreign language on the example of The Institute of service, tourism and design (branch) of the North Caucasus Federal University (Pyatigorsk, Stavropol Territory Russia). The article holds the main objectives of the project-based method, forming their classification. The authors point out the need to conduct pre-project work by mindfully selecting the appropriate linguistic material, developing a definite system of tasks and exercises. Another important step is the selection of general or profile topics that could be of interest to students in terms of their future profession. In addition, the article describes several out-of-class projects as well as it provides basic requirements for using the project-based method while teaching a foreign language.

AB  - We describe the structure of a writing-intensive, chemistry first year seminar designed to support a three week, research focused summer bridge program. Writing assignments in the seminar helped students understand their research activities, learn to conduct themselves as scientists, and reflect upon their lab work. The writing intensive seminar helped to maintain order and cohesion across multiple research groups. The participants in the program have experienced higher rates of retention and graduation in STEM fields as well as higher rates of participation in high impact practices than their peers.

AB  - Despite the increasing availability of gerontological training programs, knowledge of their contents, characteristics, methods, and outcomes remains limited. However, the transition from multidisciplinarity to interdisciplinary orientations is now fundamental to such training, providing participants from diverse academic orientations and professional backgrounds with opportunities to interact across boundaries. In response to recommendations of the European Union Futurage "A road map for European ageing research" (FUTURAGE, 2011) concerning training and career-development needs of future cohorts of practitioners and scholars in aging, an International Summer School on Ageing (ISSA) was developed in 2012. Its aim was to initiate the practical implementation of some of the capacity building goals identified by Futurage. The design and structure of the ISSA was informed by the experience of Canada's Summer Programme in Ageing--run by the Institute of Aging of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research--and by the cross-border academic training activities organized by Lund University (Sweden) in Scandinavian countries. As Italy has lacked a tradition of comprehensive, interdisciplinary training programs in gerontology, the Italian National Institute of Health and Science on Ageing undertook to launch the inaugural ISSA. In this article, the core aims and methodology of the ISSA are presented, together with an analysis of its main outcomes, as measured by participant evaluations. These are discussed in the context of international debate on this topic.

AB  - The technological infrastructure for the use of instructional and professional videos is common in today's educational venues. However, there has been a dearth of awareness and training to help teachers critically analyze and effectively utilize video recordings of authentic classroom instruction for their professional development. This self-study examined the teaching and learning process, particularly knowledge and lessons that we, as teacher educators, learned from commentary regarding video analysis and pre- and post-surveys completed by the candidates in a graduate level special education course. The investigation explored the extent to which the guided video analysis process facilitated the candidates' learning of literacy instruction in order to teach high needs students by examining teacher-candidates' analysis of video-recorded lessons, followed by discussions with peers and further reflections on their own teaching.

AB  - This article reports the results of a qualitative case study investigating the self-authorship characteristics of learners in the context of an interdisciplinary curriculum. The study identifies the students' assumptions about knowledge, self, and relationships. The findings are based on evidence from reflective essays written by students upon completion of their undergraduate courses. The findings suggest that graduates in this program have come to see interdisciplinarity as a way of both thinking and living, and have additionally developed a sense of agency over their education and future careers. In their view, engaging with broader horizons and seeing multiple perspectives are the most valuable skills acquired through their interdisciplinary education. Above all, the students perceive the responsibility they have had for their own study program as contributing to their development as self-directed learners.

AB  - An important element of the California State University Channel Islands (CI) mission is to promote cross-disciplinary thinking in its graduates. This is accomplished in part by requiring each student to complete three upper division interdisciplinary general education (UDIGE) courses. The CI faculty worked across disciplines to create and offer many UDIGE courses, including a pair of courses focusing on two social institutions, art museums and zoos (Costache and Muraoka, 2004; Muraoka, 2009). These courses were developed and are offered in partnership with the institutions. Many class sessions are held off campus and students undertake culminating projects involving the institutions. This paper provides an update of these courses and information about new courses developed using this model that now include courses focusing on libraries, national parks, colleges and universities, and music museums. Finally, the paper presents lessons learned from offering these courses and challenges in sustaining these courses.

AB  - Objective: Evaluate the effectiveness of distance learning courses for the purpose of interdisciplinary continuing education in Speech Pathology and Dentistry. Methods: The online course was made available on the Moodle platform. A total of 30 undergraduates participated in the study (15 from the Dentistry course and 15 from the Speech Pathology course). Their knowledge was evaluated before and after the course, in addition to the user satisfaction by means of specific questionnaires. The course was evaluated by 6 specialists on the following aspects: presentation and quality of the content, audio-visual quality, adequacy to the target public, and information made available. To compare the obtained results in the pre- and post-course questionnaires, the test Wilcoxon was carried out, with a 5% significance level. Results: the teaching/learning process, including the theoretical/practical application for the interdisciplinary training, proved to be effective as there was a statistically significant difference between the pre- and post- course evaluations (p<0.001), the users' satisfaction degree was favorable and the specialists evaluated the material as adequate regarding the target public, the audio-visual information quality and the strategies of content availability. Conclusion: The suggested distance-learning course proved to be effective for the purpose of Speech Pathology and Dentistry interdisciplinary education.

AB  - The growth of interdisciplinary health services research training programs across Canada has in part been due to acknowledgement of and efforts to bridge a gap between researchers, policy makers and practitioners. Consequently, a new breed of interdisciplinary health services researchers (many of whom have specialization in knowledge translation) are now ready to meet complex system demands only to find limited career opportunities. We argue that the investments for advancing interdisciplinary health services training have not been paralleled with post-training positions in academia and elsewhere, and change must occur.

AB  - Project-based learning and interdisciplinary projects present an opportunity for students to learn both technical skills and other skills which are relevant to their workplace success. This paper presents an assessment of the educational impact of the OpenOrbiter program, a student-run, interdisciplinary CubeSat (a type of small satellite with dimensions of 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm and a mass of 1.33 kg) development program at the University of North Dakota, on participants with a major in computer science. The value of the program to participants is assessed in terms of key metrics through a comparison of their pre-participation and present-day levels. Particular focus is paid to identifying and quantifying the benefit of the program to students with a computer science major. The educational value of the program to computer science students is compared and contrasted to the value to students of other majors. The impact is assessed relative to their type of participation, duration of participation and other factors.

AB  - An effective guided inquiry forensic case study (a pharmacy break-in) is described for first-year students. Four robust introductory forensic chemistry and biology experiments are used to analyze potential drug samples and determine the identity of a possible suspect. Students perform presumptive tests for blood on a "point of entry stain" sample; perform chemical presumptive tests on the "suspected drug" alongside known standards of codeine, morphine, and amphetamine; and carry out thin-layer chromatography analysis of the drug samples. They examine the specificity of the Kastle-Meyer and tetramethylbenzidine tests, prepare polymerase chain reaction samples from the suspects' DNA samples, and perform gel electrophoresis to analyze the results. Students are required to analyze and integrate the results and to apply their acquired knowledge within the context of an engaging forensic case study. This first-year laboratory is part of a forensic case study vertically integrated into the curriculum.
