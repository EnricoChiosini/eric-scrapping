AB  - This study draws on the tradition of transdisciplinarity to extend the boundaries of interdisciplinary educational work. In this paper, we apply the concepts of liminality and third space to examine a case of a professional immersive experience (PIEx), designed in response to the catastrophic disruption of work-integrated learning opportunities by the COVID-19 pandemic. The study uses a participatory reflexive methodology to interrogate the range of ways liminality was manifest in PIEx. First, we examine liminal learning in the virtual environment, which facilitated the unfolding of connections between different spaces, locations and people. Second, we seek to understand the PIEx experience through the concept of third space, highlighting the fluidity of roles, where educators, students and industry partners generate new knowledge and practices together. Lastly, we examine the experience through the boundary-crossing lens of transdisciplinarity. We conclude by gesturing towards a new understanding of work integrated learning, as it could take place in the future, well beyond the walls of the university.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: The purpose of this research was to examine the potential outcomes of applying the outdoor transdisciplinary language instruction paradigm to primary school students' cognitive and emotional improvement with smart boards as an assessment tool. Background: Traditional approaches to teaching English in primary schools do not give particular consideration to outdoor transdisciplinary learning for students' cognitive and emotional improvement, especially in terms of effective assessment. Hence, in this study, outdoor drawing was integrated with teaching English to create a transdisciplinary paradigm and smart boards were adopted in the assessment. Methodology: A pre-test post-test quasi-experimental design using an equivalent control group was employed, in which learning performance, emotions (typically positive emotions), and reported satisfaction level were compared via an English vocabulary test, the Chinese version of PANAS, and a structured self-reported satisfaction instrument. E-prime 2.0 was used to register data for the three instruments and to complete the vocabulary identification phase while smart boards were adopted as an assessment tool to evaluate students' learning performance. The data collected were analyzed using an independent t-test and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test using SPSS 22.0. Contribution Unlike traditional research, which only utilized smart boards as presentation tools, this research provided evidence for the effective use of interactive technology as assessment tools for innovative language learning in primary school settings. Findings: Results indicated that outdoor transdisciplinary drawing developed more positive emotions and higher satisfaction among students and showed significantly higher learning performance compared with indoor transdisciplinary drawing. Moreover, smart board-based assessment scores showed that students were more effectively engaged as compared to E-prime-based assessment. Recommendations for Practitioners: The findings suggest that instructors should try to allow students to have more opportunities to explore language activities in school-based outdoor environments, which benefits their cognitive and emotional improvement. Moreover, using smart board-based assessments should be encouraged since more authentic performance could be elicited. Recommendations for Researchers: This research mainly focuses on the effects of learning environments and assessment tools in transdisciplinary language instruction. Hence, researchers can employ an updated design to focus on the transdisciplinary setting to investigate more interesting outcomes. Impact on Society: Schools should adopt more new interactive digital technologies to improve assessment for students' innovative learning in different contexts, which can help students develop more transversal skills, benefiting their employers and making them even more competent. More critically, government support is needed to encourage schools to use emerging technologies for educational reform in the classroom, and linkages between technology vendors and schools could be encouraged to provide subsidies and other measures to less financially able schools. Future Research: Future research could explore the differences in the interaction effects of class type and learning environments on students' learning outcomes. In addition, longitudinal assessments to investigate the intensity of the experimental intervention could provide more interesting results on the long-term effects and suggest more sustainable use.

AB  - Nursing as an academic discipline typically draws on a wide range of other disciplines. There is debate about whether this is a sound basis for the discipline, or whether nursing needs to develop a distinctive body of knowledge. The concept of transdisciplinarity, though little discussed in nursing, is of considerable value in understanding nursing as an academic discipline, and provides a possible resolution to the debate above. In order to get a better understanding of what transdisciplinarity might mean in a nursing context, we conducted a qualitative interview-based study of faculty in a UK school of nursing. The debate about nursing's status as a discipline was reproduced by the interviewees. Despite these differences, a degree of consensus emerged about the concept of nursing as a transdisciplinary discipline. Transdisciplinarity in nursing offers an overarching approach that is applicable to a broader range of disciplines. This approach offers the possibility of moving beyond some of the major debates in nursing as an academic discipline. This broad and pragmatic approach grounds nursing knowledge in nursing practice, which means that as a transdisciplinary discipline it does not overstate its claims to knowledge, but instead explicitly acknowledges tacit and "craftsmanship"-type forms of knowledge.

AB  - Multidisciplinary teams of school- and community-employed mental health, health, and educational staff work together in schools to offer a full continuum of mental health promotion, prevention, early intervention, and treatment services and supports. Intentional teaming structures and practices are essential to ensure teams deliver effective, coordinated services and supports. The current study investigated the extent to which continuous quality improvement strategies improved school mental health team performance during a 15-month national learning collaborative for 24 school district teams. All teams significantly improved their average teaming performance from baseline to the end of the collaborative (t(20) = -5.20, p < 0.001). Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles allowed teams to rapidly evaluate specific quality improvement changes to improve their performance. Teams with the most improvement focused on increasing multidisciplinary team membership, avoiding duplication and promoting efficiency, and connecting to community mental health providers/resources.

AB  - In this paper, we describe an innovative design for a multidisciplinary service-learning course on supply chain management in the industrial distribution program housed in the College of Engineering at a large research university in Texas. The purpose of this course was to increase students' technical expertise and build a mindset and skills needed to tackle current societal issues, raising their social responsibility and enhancing civic-mindedness. The course combined curricular learning with community service, applying the content of academic disciplines to practice. It brought students from industrial distribution and sociology together to help food pantries to improve their operational efficiencies so that the food pantries can serve more people and work toward their goal. In this project, student groups identified the specific needs of community food pantries. They recommended solutions to improve operational efficiency so that they could use their technical skills to address the challenges and make an impact on the communities. In addition, student groups interacted with partner agencies via technologies that aided distance communication, which facilitated partnerships in remote locations. We also evaluated this project. The results reveal that this project had an impact on students' personal and professional development as well as the community.

AB  - Researchers in higher education (HE) are a community of academics with backgrounds and experiences in a variety of scientific disciplines. For this reason, HE research is influenced by other disciplines from which HE researchers take theories, constructs and research methods. This article describes a large-scale analysis of the impact of different scientific fields on HE research. Special attention is paid to the analysis of the influences of psychology, sociology & political science, and economics as the disciplines that have the greatest impact on HE research. To assess this impact, we analyse citation patterns in seven key HE journals. Our empirical analysis confirms that HE research is indeed a multidisciplinary field and experiences a different impact of identified scientific fields for HE articles of different topics. We analyse the dynamics of such an impact and discuss the factors that may cause the growth of multidisciplinarity in HE research.

AB  - This study focused on the design of interdisciplinary STEAM educational strategies supported by the Internet of Things. The second cycle of a Design-Based Research approach was implemented, refined prior citizen science strategies designed, implemented, and analysed in a co-creation process, in the first cycle. The iterative implementations/evaluations aimed at answer the secondary research questions: How to develop citizen science strategies that foster students' participatory citizenship? Teachers designed citizen science learning materials, emphasizing the co-construction of knowledge and educational practices, under STEAM . Research instruments were used the participants -- students and teachers. A closer look at the data reveals the existence of students' voice amplification with evidence of ' their perception of having an active voice regarding the resolution of community problems after the teachers implement the STEAM educational strategies. This reinforces the need to foster the implementation of relevant participatory citizenship strategies, customized STEAM learning solutions that addressess the issue of low participatory citizenship, to involve students in community issues. A shift in the educational environments is essential within a STEAM approach, engaging students in real-world citizen science projects that encourage cooperation between teachers, stakeholders, and students, thus allowing students' personal and social development within the scope of educational intervention projects.

AB  - Chemists have always designed and deployed cross-disciplinary approaches that interface chemistry with other disciplines to proffer solutions to many human problems. We designed a laboratory experiment that implements chemistry concepts in a biological model to prime undergraduate students to appreciate interdisciplinarity as an approach to solving complex problems in contemporary society. The experiments can also be implemented with graduate students transitioning to chemical biology research. The experiment introduces students to classical and emerging chemistry and molecular biology techniques--mammalian cell culture, bioorthogonal metabolic labeling, azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction ("click" chemistry), microplate photometry, gel electrophoresis, and far-western blot analysis--that are routinely used in research at the interface of chemistry and biology. The students cultured a Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-K1) and metabolically labeled the cellular sialoglycans with azide groups. Next, they used a click chemistry reaction to bioconjugate a fluorogenic molecule to the labeled sialoglycans, enabling the detection of the glycans using microplate photometry or far-western blot analysis. The experiment created a context for a first-hand demonstration of bioorthogonal chemical reaction, a concept novel to most undergraduates with traditional chemistry (organic, inorganic, physical chemistry, and analytical) background. The experience allows the students to apply and connect organic chemistry, bioanalytical chemistry, and molecular biology concepts while learning techniques such as microplate reading, SDS PAGE, and western blot imaging that are indispensable to the growing fields of drug discovery, chemical toxicology, chemical biology, and molecular biology. This experiment is ideal for preparing and motivating students to pursue future research opportunities at the interface of chemistry and biology.

AB  - While interdisciplinarity has been promoted in universities for decades, research suggests that untenured faculty struggle to receive recognition for their interdisciplinary research. Informed by the microfoundations of institutional theory and discursive legitimation, we examine how members of academic departments participate in the legitimation and reproduction of tenure and promotion norms in relation to disciplinary and interdisciplinary research in a prestigious private university. Our analysis draws on 59 interviews with department chairs, directors of interdisciplinary centers, and disciplinary and interdisciplinary untenured faculty in the STEM fields, the social sciences, and the humanities. Our findings reveal three mechanisms and processes through which tenure and promotion norms become legitimated and reproduced in academic departments: 1) institutional micro-practices concerned with evaluation and gatekeeping, 2) discursive legitimation of the expulsion of interdisciplinarity at the pre-tenure stage, and 3) scholarly positioning through discursive boundary strategies directed at rationalizing the expulsion of interdisciplinarity or the expansion of existing tenure and promotion norms. Taken together, these findings advance our understanding of the tensions between the promotion of interdisciplinary research in higher education institutions, reproduction of the disciplinary order in academic departments, and interdisciplinary early-career scholars' career advancement.

AB  - Obtaining a doctoral degree requires acquisition of different types of skills and knowledge. The aim of this article is to explore multidisciplinary peer-mentoring groups (PMGs) facilitated by senior academics as a knowledge sharing practice in doctoral education. Drawing from interviews with participants of PMGs at a Finnish university, we found that the participants perceived that cultures and practices of doctoral education in departments and faculties, as well as limited support from supervisors might hinder knowledge sharing. They highlighted that a flat hierarchy and confidential atmosphere supported by the multidisciplinary group composition promoted knowledge sharing and emotional support. Based on these results, we argue that PMGs are a useful resource for facilitating knowledge sharing amongst doctoral researchers and thus have a capacity to benefit the individual as well as the organisation as a whole.

AB  - Developments of Industry 4.0 require a set of multidisciplinary digital competencies for future vocational teachers, consisting of specific knowledge, motivational aspects, cognitive abilities and skills to fulfill the demands of digitally interconnected work situations. The competence model that is adapted from future work scenarios of vocational apprentices in Industry 4.0 includes attitudes towards digitization and handling of digital devices, information literacy, application of digital security standards, virtual collaboration, digital problem solving as well as a demonstration of reflective judgment of one's actions in an interconnected and digital environment. Structural equation modeling was used to assess N = 205 pre-service vocational teachers between 18 and 35 years of age. The findings indicate the relationship of the proposed dimensions, measured through external- and self-assessments validate the proposed structure of the multidisciplinary digital competencies. However, attitude towards digitization can predict the self-efficacy of the relevant Multidisciplinary Digital Competencies but not the actual achievement in an external assessed scenario. Nevertheless, this study confirms that self-assessed multidisciplinary digital competencies can predict achievement in an external and qualitative-assessed competence test. Fit indices show an acceptable model conception, the reliability and construct validity of the model were confirmed. Findings suggest that the attitude towards digitization and the application of digital security standards are important, whereas the ability to solve digital problems seems to have a weak relation to the general multidisciplinary digital competencies of pre-service vocational teachers.

AB  - The construction industry is highly fragmented and is known for its adversarial culture, culminating in poor quality projects not completed on time or within budget. The aim of this study is thus to guide the design of quantity surveying (QS) programme curricula in order to help students develop the requisite knowledge and skills to work more collaboratively in their multidisciplinary future workplaces. A qualitative approach was considered appropriate as the authors were concerned with gathering an initial understanding of what students think of multidisciplinary learning. The data collection method used was a questionnaire developed by the Behaviours4Collaboration (B4C) team. Knowledge gaps were still found across all the key areas in which a future QS practitioner needs to be collaborative (either as a Project Contributor or as a Project Leader), despite the need for change instigated by the multidisciplinary revolution in building information modelling (BIM) education. The study concludes that universities will need to be selective in teaching, and innovative in reorienting, QS education so that a collaborative BIM education can be effected in stages, increasing in complexity as the students' technical knowledge grows. This will help students to build the competencies needed to make them future leaders. It will also support programme currency and delivery.

AB  - Learning analytics is a recent innovation that holds promise for improving retention in fully online programs. However, only a few case studies exist to show models for and outcomes of the implementation of learning analytics systems. This paper reports on a learning analytics implementation in a fully online, multidisciplinary program designed for nontraditional students using a pilot planning group with stakeholders from various roles. The processes for selecting reports, creating communication structures, and evaluating outcomes are outlined. Overall, faculty and advisors were positive about the project and found the reports to be helpful. The results suggest that the actions most often triggered by learning analytics reports were emails to students. Evaluation results suggest that the implementation of the learning analytics program and the interventions enacted had a positive impact on student success, though we acknowledge that it is difficult to isolate the impact of the learning analytics tool itself. We also address several challenges that came along with the implementation of learning analytics including understanding the efficacy of interventions, data security, and ethics.

AB  - Although an emerging field in the leadership literature, destructive leadership is an under-researched area in the context of education. Destructive leadership in schools is the focus of the article. To understand the phenomenon we first undertake a transdisciplinary review of the literature from across philosophy, psychology and sociology. We then apply the novel lens of autopoietic theory to identify the morphology of the phenomenon, that is, its underlying structure and the process that gives rise to destructive leadership. Through a synthesis of these discourses we propose an emergent theory antithetical to synergy, which we call 'dysergy'. We offer this theoretical frame to help understand destructive leadership and to guide future research and action.

AB  - The centennial of the First World War has offered instructors across the humanities an exciting opportunity to enhance students' disciplinary expertise while reflecting on the significance of an event that continues to shape the world today. Drawing on established courses on the history and literature of the war, respectively, the authors designed a seminar that invited students to explore both the experience and the memory of the conflict from an interdisciplinary perspective. Eager to model the kind of collaborative exchange hoped to see among students, the authors elected to team-teach the course, attending and engaging in all class sessions and co-grading all major assignments produced by the twenty students. Moreover, the authors were mindful to maintain a balanced syllabus, alternating between lessons in history and literature in order to demonstrate how work in one field both complements and enhances work in the other. While this balancing act provided students with an invaluable learning opportunity, it created an unexpected one as well. In addition to delivering a course that challenged students to work at the intersection of English and history, it was a surprise to observe how the attention to the incorporation of diverse sources and global voices also led students toward a transdisciplinary exploration that encompassed language, visual art, music, and archaeology. In this article, the authors will review the course design, assignments, and experiential learning components before sharing reflections on this unexpected pedagogical outcome.

AB  - Creating learning environments that integrate arts, sciences, and computing in education can improve learning in these disciplines. In particular, transdisciplinary integrations of these disciplines can lead to expansive alterations or dissolutions of epistemological, ideological, and methodological boundaries. We wish to support teachers in the creation of transdisciplinary learning environments that draw on art, science, and computing. We developed a classroom project genre, Luminous Science, that was designed to bridge disciplinary materialities, epistemologies, and representations through students' construction of computationally-rich representations of physical phenomena. We present a study of a multidisciplinary group of teachers co-designing a Luminous Science unit for their classrooms using sculptural lanterns with programmable media for both investigations and expressions of classroom gardens. We present a framework for examining what disciplinary understandings teachers drew on, how these ideas were utilized, and why they were brought together. We found teachers engaged in richly metarepresentational discussions wherein they applied values, epistemic criteria, and practices from all three constituent fields of study in their design work. We show how teachers developed units that simultaneously overlapped and diverged due to the pressures of navigating disciplinary and school structural challenges. Qualitative analysis of teacher discourse reveals how teachers liberated disciplinary boundaries, actively and critically explored synergies and tensions in disciplinary integration, and traversed goals that focused on both disciplinary improvement and holistic learning. Our study sheds light on how we can both study teachers who are designing for disciplinary integration and support them through professional development opportunities to encourage more transdisciplinary interactions that can expand what it means to do or teach art, science, and computing.

AB  - When arts curriculum is able to become transdisciplinary to reach fundamental understandings with other content areas, the level of transfer and thinking skills of the engaged students has the potential to be raised. This study investigated the implementation of transdisciplinary STEAM lessons across 14 classrooms in 7 states. Students (n = 318) in elementary (grades K-5) and secondary (grades 6-12) schools participated in transdisciplinary STEAM lessons. The results of this study indicate that the intervention was successful at increasing the understanding of creativity and that their engagement with thinking skills and habits was greater as compared to students who did not participate in the STEAM lessons. Thematic analysis of the open-response items revealed specific patterns in how students used critical and creative thinking across lessons. Overall, students showed increased creativity, application, problem solving, and collaboration, providing evidence of the effectiveness of the STEAM lessons to increase critical and creative thinking of students.

AB  - Diagnostic uncertainty is prevalent throughout medicine and significantly impacts patient care, especially when it goes unrecognized. However, we lack a reliable clinical means of identifying uncertainty. This study evaluates the narrative discourse within clinical notes in the Electronic Health Record as a means of identifying diagnostic uncertainty. Recognizing that discourse producers use language "semi-automatically" (Partington et al. 2013), we hypothesized that clinicians include distinct indications of uncertainty in their written assessments, which could be elucidated by linguistic analysis. Using a cohort of patients prospectively identified as having an uncertain diagnosis (UD), we conducted a detailed corpus-assisted discourse analysis. The analysis revealed a set of linguistic indicators constitutive of diagnostic uncertainty including terms of modality, register-specific terms, and linguistically identifiable clinical behaviours. This dictionary of UD indicators was thoroughly tested, and its performance was compared with a matched-control dataset. Based on the findings, we built a machine learning classification algorithm with the ability to predict UD patient cohorts with 87.0% accuracy, effectively demonstrating the feasibility of using clinical discourse to classify patients and directly impact the clinical environment.

AB  - According to extensive research, problem-based learning (PBL) in STEM education improves student learning outcomes and supports them in gaining practical skills necessary for upward future careers. Despite current efforts to promote PBL-STEM activities in education, their uptake in life science remains low. Several types of research involving college instructors indicate that instructor guidance of PBL-STEM activities is one of the crucial aspects for its successful usage in educational settings. However, to our knowledge, little research has been undertaken on the effectiveness of participants' PBL-STEM learning in coping with problems and dilemmas encountered during the STEM learning process. This research intends to investigate the efficacy and provide experiential references to demonstrate the existing gaps by a transdisciplinary approach. The effect on participants' professional learning interest, comprehension capacity, problem-solving ability, self-efficacy, and cooperation abilities is related to five dependent variables. Our findings from paired t-test analysis demonstrate that STEM participants had a significant difference before and after experiencing PBL-STEM learning objectives. In the light of a one-way ANOVA, STEM learner participation in this course was more important than gender and age in improving STEM literacy through classroom activities. In line with feedback interviews, students who engaged in experiential learning favored reciprocal advantages and mutual benefits within their groups through teamwork, practical application, and information acquisition. Given that the participants in this study were early adopters of PBL-STEM, any future research should aggressively encourage these students to create and implement solutions in the classroom based on their ideas.

AB  - "Mathematics Across the Sciences" is an applications-based course designed to strengthen students' mathematical skills in preparation for calculus or for a major in the sciences. Its development relied heavily on input from faculty members in several science departments. This article describes the course; many of the scientific applications taught; pedagogical strategies; and scholarship on inclusion, equity, and diversity in education. These descriptions make clear that the goals of inclusion and academic excellence are intertwined, and an interdisciplinary approach can help each to improve.

AB  - In this paper, we focus on the institutionalization of transdisciplinarity (TD) in higher education institutions and how they institutionalize Transdisciplinarity (TD). As such, universities have engaged in different activities to enact TD policies that aim at incorporating TD in their research and teaching. We take the Methodology Center at the Leuphana University of Lüneburg as a case study. We analyze the institutionalization process of TD to shed light on the obstacles that TD faces to become a widespread policy and practice at universities. In adopting a neo-institutionalist approach in our research, we develop a two-level analysis that allow us to compare the formal characteristics given to TD policies with the actual TD practices taking place in universities. Our findings reveal that TD institutionalization at the Methodology Center is at a mid-level and that overall TD institutionalization is an iterative process, in which the two levels mutually can reinforce or hinder each other.

AB  - This article argues that cross-disciplinary linkages -- that is, relationships among phenomena studied by those in different disciplines -- often serve to destabilize, at least temporarily, systems of stability that are theorized to operate within the sets of phenomena studied within most disciplines. It surveys across disciplines both systems of stability and mechanisms of instability, and derives several implications for interdisciplinary and disciplinary research practice. In particular it argues that systems of stability deserve to be included within conceptions of disciplinary perspective. It speculates on how a general connection between stability and instability might be explored. The article thus informs our understanding both of what interdisciplinarity is and how it is best performed.

AB  - The author demonstrates that entry-level students can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of complex problems through an explicitly interdisciplinary approach than through a merely multidisciplinary approach, using the process described in Repko's (2014) "Introduction to Interdisciplinary Studies." Repko takes the interdisciplinary process that is articulated in his earlier volume, "Interdisciplinary Research: Process and Theory" (2008, 2d ed. 2012), and adapts it for the introductory level. The author uses the example of an introductory Israel Studies course that focuses on the theme of Israel's conflicted identity as a Jewish and democratic state.At an appropriate point in the course, students analyze a case study by the author regarding Jewish marriage in Israel, found in "Case Studies in Interdisciplinary Research" (2012), as an illustration of the complete ten-step interdisciplinary research process described in Repko's earlier book, a process best suited for coursework beyond the introductory level. Students then apply Repko's more recent (2014) six-step entry­ level broad model of the interdisciplinary process to their own study regarding the status of Arab citizens of Israel.

AB  - Doctoral programmes in which candidates research their own practice can be characterised as having transdisciplinary (TD) qualities. While most of the emphasis in the literature and in policy on TD is on research in teams, we argue for an expansion of the scope in the conception and understanding of TD research to include the way it can be articulated and assessed in practice-led and practice-based doctorates. In this sense, it is worth exploring instances of doctoral programmes that potentially allow doctoral researchers to undertake projects that have TD qualities. In these doctoral projects, researchers draw from a variety of perspectives, for example from their work practices, the theorisation of those practices, experiential learning, multiple disciplinary knowledge and approaches as well as communications and networking with appropriate stakeholders. Drawing from previous scholarship of TD in other fields we analyse and evaluate the TD qualities of a particular doctoral programme. This analysis reveals a set of qualities recognised by the literature as TD and relevant to doctoral researchers: Researching collaboratively with stakeholders; Diversity of disciplinary expertise and assessment criteria; Integration of different methodologies; Situating the research in multiple contexts; Impact on the "situation" through novel procedures or products; Ethics and the importance of trust; Reflection/reflexivity. The paper posits a convergence between practice doctorates and TD research and demonstrates how TD qualities help doctoral candidates to situate their research at the interface between academia and their professional work and develop projects that have creative and beneficial relevance for practice.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop an analytical framework toward facilitating the quantitative measurement of interdisciplinary understanding regarding sustainable energy systems with an application in the area of capacity-building projects in higher education. Design/methodology/approach: The analytical framework is developed using the portfolio representation measurement approach in combination with a survey questionnaire. The subsequent assessment is carried out using the statistical measure of mean signed deviation to capture variation from an established baseline across the project group and visualized via radar diagrams. Findings: The results provide a quantitative assessment framework for evaluating the degree of interdisciplinary understanding in the project groups. The application of the framework to the DESIRE project indicates the most significant degree of variation across economic and regulatory dimensions of sustainability. Discrepancies in general and educational contexts are observed. Research limitations/implications: The exploitable value of the results is sensitive to the derivation of composite indicators of the dimensions defined as well as the survey design. The case study was carried out on an ex-post basis, potentially biasing the results reported and limiting their interpretability and theoretical value. Practical implications: The analytical framework can be used as a basis for assessing and engaging in discussions on interdisciplinarity understanding at the outset of capacity-building projects. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper is practical in scope and entails the development of a quantitative framework for measuring interdisciplinarity in the specific context of capacity-building projects in the field of sustainability research in higher education institutions.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity involves the integration of insights from different disciplines, which is made possible by a number of variables that are unique to each example of integration. The challenge for an instructor introducing undergraduates to interdisciplinarity is to help them learn what is transferable and relevant beyond a singular example of integration, and an interdisciplinary research process is excellent for this. Repko and Szostak's (2021) seminal text, "Interdisciplinary Research: Process and Theory," is one of the most popular methodologies used in teaching interdisciplinary studies. However, in an introductory module, it presents two key challenges: (1) the burden the process places on students to familiarize themselves with disciplines that might be new to them, in addition to learning a research process and practicing integration; and (2) the late appearance, in the process, of creating the common ground. In this article, I set out each challenge in turn and how I have responded to them. I conclude that the most important lesson students learn in an introductory module is the unsettling experience of the interdisciplinarian, who practices higher-order skills and relates in new ways to disciplines with which they are familiar.

AB  - In this paper we begin to explore how knowledges being generated in bioscience might be brought into productive articulation with the Sociology of Education, considering the potential for emerging transdisciplinary, 'biosocial' approaches to enable new ways of researching and understanding pressing educational issues. In this paper, as in our current research, we take learning as our focus. Our work brings together collaborators from across fields: sociology of education; molecular biology and biochemistry; cognitive neuroscience; fMRI imaging; and EEG. Through the paper we explore the generative potential of an encounter between life sciences and sociology of education. Through consideration of the conceptual and methodological elements of our 'Synchrony in Learning' research and engagement with our pilot experimental approach, our research is suggesting that our central concept, learning, is undergoing metamorphosis, challenging us to understand learning as a phenomenon produced through the intra-action of a multiplicity of forces and processes.

AB  - Sustainability science calls for new methodologies and collaborations that go beyond disciplinary boundaries. This points to a new role for sustainability science communication. Here, we explore how science communication can employ aesthetic formats (e.g., storytelling, performance, artistic installations) to promote transdisciplinary collaborations. We conducted a series of experiments in a master-level science communication course at the University of Copenhagen, engaging students, practitioners and researchers in experimental collaborations and qualitative data collection. Through thematic analysis of classroom observations and interviews, five elements of transdisciplinarity emerged: Acknowledgement of disciplinary identities, negotiation of diverse vocabularies, disruption of hierarchical structures, experience of novel insights and evident learning processes among participants. These moments challenged direct observation but became discernible through post hoc analysis. We suggest they constitute a sequence that together describes a transdisciplinary moment. We thus conclude that the aesthetic formats we employed were instrumental in disrupting conventional boundaries and enhancing collaboration across disciplines. However, we also acknowledge the complexities of achieving transdisciplinary moments and emphasize the importance of reflective practice.

AB  - In this pioneering interdisciplinary reader, Hilton Kelly and Heather Moore Roberson have curated essential readings for thinking about black education from slavery to the present day. The reading selections are timeless, with both historical and contemporary readings from educational anthropology, history, legal studies, literary studies, and sociology to document the foundations and development of Black education in the United States. In addition, the authors highlight scholarship offering historical, conceptual, and pedagogical gems that shine a light on Black people's enduring pursuit of liberatory education. This book is an invitation to a broad audience, from people with no previous knowledge to scholars in the field, to think critically about Black education and to inspire others to uncover the agency, dreams, struggles, aspirations, and liberation of Black people across generations. "Thinking About Black Education: An Interdisciplinary Reader" will address essential readings in African-Americans' education. The text is inspired by the editors' diverse backgrounds in interdisciplinary scholarship and professional communities. Necessary after 400 years of struggle for people of African-American descent to become fully-educated citizens with all the rights and privilege that true freedom brings, it can serve as a cornerstone during this quadricentennial moment by showcasing canonical, cutting-edge, and essential scholarship that people of African descent have produced in the United States. The collection includes many of the great foundational thinkers and writers of the last 100 years. Selections include work from: (1) Heather Andrea Williams; (2) James D. Anderson; (3) Elizabeth McHenry; (4) D. M. Douglas; (5) Vanessa Siddle Walker; (6) Thomas Sowell; (7) Trudier Harris; (8) Signithia Fordham and John U. Ogbu; (9) A. A. Akom; (10) Mano Singham; (11) Gloria Ladson-Billings; (12) Bell Hooks; (13) William F. Tate IV; (14) James Earl Davis; (15) Emery Petchauer; and (16) Michael J. Dumas and Kihana Miraya Ross. "Thinking About Black Education" is an essential text for a variety of Black Studies courses, but it should also appeal to a broader audience of students and scholars interested in racial equity and social justice across the disciplines.

AB  - Behavior analysts collaborating within interdisciplinary teams are likely to find themselves at difficult crossroads. Some of these crossroads include implementing alternative treatments, defining and determining risk and harm, and evaluating research and interventions. The purpose of this paper is to highlight some of these crossroads and provide guidelines on successfully navigating them. We contend that it is possible to navigate these crossroads while minimizing harm or risk for the client, adhering to the principles of science and behavior analysis, and remaining respectful of all members of the interdisciplinary team. That is, we can maintain the scientific tenets of philosophic doubt, empiricism, and experimentation, while remaining humble, and ensuring our clients access the most effective interventions available.

AB  - Group work is often used in university courses. This article examines group work in a widely interdisciplinary holography course that combines both art and science, for students from the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. In these interdisciplinary teams, how much specialization of labor (dividing work according to students' pre-existing abilities or personal interests) is acceptable? We present student survey responses regarding their attitudes toward interdisciplinary group work, and their practices in dividing the work, to determine how much specialization of labor is taking place within the interdisciplinary teams. The surveys indicate a mix of approaches among groups concerning the division of labor based on prior skills. In the presence of specialization of labor, students learned from their partners and displayed a positive attitude toward working with someone from a different discipline. We believe that the intriguing nature of the holography projects helped many students avoid dividing the work according to their prior skills, and helped them see the value of working in a widely interdisciplinary team.

AB  - Purpose: This article considers how the evaluation of research teams can better account for the challenges of transdisciplinarity, including their larger team size and more diverse and permeable membership, as well as the tensions between institutional pressures on individuals to publish and team goals. Design/methodology/approach: An evaluation team was retained from 2015 to 2020 to conduct a comprehensive external evaluation of a five-year EPSCoR-funded program undertaken by a transdisciplinary research team. The formative portion of the evaluation involved monitoring the program's developmental progress, while the summative portion tracked observable program outputs and outcomes as evidence of progress toward short- and long-term goals. The evaluation team systematically reviewed internal assessments and gathered additional data for an external assessment via periodic participation in team meetings, participant interviews and an online formative team survey (starting in Year 2). Findings: Survey participants had a better understanding of the project's "Goals and Vision" compared to other aspects. "Work Roles," and particularly the timeliness of decision-making, were perceived to be a "Big Problem," specifically in regard to heavy travel by key managers/leadership. For "Communication Channels," Year 2 tensions included differing views on the extent to which management should be collaborative versus "hierarchical." These concerns about communication demonstrate that differences in language, culture or status impact the efficiency and working relationship of the team. "Authorship Credit/Intellectual Property" was raised most consistently each year as an area of concern. Originality/value: The study involves the use of a unique survey approach.

AB  - This paper reports on the perspectives and operational practices of teachers implementing interdisciplinary units in five International Baccalaureate schools in Norway and Denmark with fewer than 100 students in their Middle Years Programme. The results help explain why interdisciplinary practice in secondary schools is relatively rare. The collaborative process of developing unique school-based interdisciplinary units, as required in each year of the program, was consistently valued by teachers, but no administration recognized the impact on their workload. On average, teachers estimated that over 17 hours were required to design and evaluate an interdisciplinary unit, and a further seven hours were required to assess and moderate student reflections. On average, schools allocated three hours of collaborative planning for this task. Small schools are uniquely enabled to offset some of the complexities of interdisciplinary practice that frustrate larger schools. In the interests of nurturing consensus cultures that support their interdisciplinary practice, the results indicate small schools should allocate additional collaborative planning time, organize teaching schedules around the interdisciplinary subject linkages, pair teachers in shared workspaces, and offer teachers involved in interdisciplinary unit implementation greater flexibility to attend staff meetings.

AB  - Background: The ability of the South African citizenry to overcome a myriad of challenges (which include the triple challenges of inequality, poverty and unemployment) can be called into question. This alleged inability could, in part at least, be linked to the role of higher education, which is at a vantage point of equipping the citizenry with the requisite values, skills and knowledge. Aim: The aim of the article is to discuss attempts that were employed towards imparting transdisciplinary and collaborative skills to students at Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT). Setting: The article reports on the collaboration between a number of stakeholders, viz. CPUT, University of Michigan, St. Mark's Church and District Six Museum. The aim of the collaboration was to develop an interactive Web map, which would display the socio-spatial information based on the baptismal records of the former residents of District Six. Methods: The article explores interconnections between transdisciplinary education, internationalisation of higher education and community service-learning. The discussion is based on the authors' reflective analysis of the deployment of the triad of concepts in the initiative reported on. Results: Intricate interdependencies were discovered between transdisciplinarity, internationalisation of higher education and community service-learning. Conclusion: It is proposed that future teaching and learning initiatives employ a critical lens and the notion of complexity to meticulously explore the aforesaid concepts towards extending the frameworks for higher education.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the role of multidisciplinary course requirements in shaping student attitudes toward sustainability and education for sustainable development. Previous research indicates that students conceptualize sustainability based on their academic discipline; thus, this research investigates whether there is a difference in student attitudes toward sustainability at Grenfell Campus, Memorial University of Newfoundland, where students are encouraged to cross the borders of their academic disciplines. Design/methodology/approach: This research reports on the findings from a mixed-methods study to assess the impact of program requirements on student attitudes toward sustainability and education for sustainable development at Grenfell Campus, Memorial University of Newfoundland. In phase one, an anonymous survey was administered to students regarding their perceptions and attitudes toward sustainability and education for sustainable development. The survey yielded 100 usable responses. Phase 2 consisted of a series of 10 semi-structured expert interviews with key faculty and staff at Grenfell Campus and a representative from the City of Corner Brook, which gave further insights regarding sustainability programming and campus culture. Findings: Contrary to previous research, the results of this research indicate that the School of Study does not have a statistically significant impact on student attitudes toward sustainability. This may be attributed to Grenfell Campus's Breadth of Knowledge requirement within the School of Arts and Social Science and the School of Science and the Environment, which requires that students take elective courses from a broad range of subject matter to develop their holistic awareness of social, cultural, scientific and political issues. Practical implications: The results of this research indicate that students who are exposed to broad multidisciplinary requirements may be more likely to have positive attitudes toward sustainability than students who focus on a single discipline. Originality/value: A limited number of studies investigate the impact of core program requirements on student attitudes toward sustainability. This paper promotes an effective way of raising sustainability-literate young people/citizens in a Canadian higher education context.

AB  - Background: In responding to the global problems facing humankind, there is great value in equipping science and engineering students with skills to function well in multidisciplinary teams. Little attention has been paid into the factors that influence multidisciplinary collaboration and teamwork of science and engineering students. Purpose: This research describes multidisciplinary teamwork of applied physics and mechanical engineering students in a challenge-based learning (CBL) course. The study aimed to: a) identify the facilitators and barriers to multidisciplinary teamwork and b) explore learning outcomes connected to working in multidisciplinary teams. Sample: 30 students registered to the course, two teachers, and three tutors participated in this research. Design and Methods: An instrumental case study was conducted in the context of a pilot CBL course. Data included interviews, reflection reports, observations, and design posters. Transcribed video recordings were searched in an attempt to demonstrate the codes revealed with the qualitative content analysis of interview transcripts and reflection reports. Results: The results indicated knowledge acquisition, application, and an awareness of other disciplinary approaches as the learning outcomes with some differences for engineering and physics students. The findings also yielded individual (e.g. knowledge of control theory), team (e.g. disciplinary perspectives), and course factors (e.g. disciplinary connections to the challenge) that influenced multidisciplinary teamwork. Conclusion: Multidisciplinary teamwork is supported by the unique ways of thinking and approaching problems of the two disciplines. Implications contribute to future research and thinking for similar learning environments while improving student learning in multidisciplinary teams.

AB  - The authors decided to create a transdisciplinary science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) lesson for children focused on Charleston, South Carolina iron-gate artisan Philip Simmons and his work. The lesson taught about the art of Philip Simmons, as well as symbolism, mathematics, the process of 3D printing, and some history of Charleston. The results were some original 3D printed, Simmons-inspired gates that made connections to several disciplines in the curriculum. This article begins with an introduction to the artist and his work, followed by a discussion of culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) and the importance of inclusion in the classroom. Then the history and nuances of transdisciplinary and STEAM education is examined. The details of the lesson are highlighted, along with a discussion of the outcomes of a transdisciplinary lesson that celebrates the African American artist Philip Simmons.

AB  - What constitutes a "good teacher" and "good teaching" has come under much scrutiny in an age of globalization, transnationalism, and increased demands for accountability. It is against this evolving landscape and the pathbreaking work of the Douglas Fir Group (DFG, 2016) that this special issue engages the following two broad questions: (a) In what ways is language teaching "identity work?" and (b) To what extent does a transdisciplinary approach to language learning and teaching offer insight into language teacher identity? We begin this Introduction with a discussion on identity research in second language acquisition and applied linguistics, and then address innovations in language teacher identity research, exploring how this work has been advanced methodologically through narratives, discourse analysis, and an ethical consideration of research practices. We then consider how the transdisciplinary framework of the DFG, and its focus on macro, meso, and micro dimensions of language learning at the ideological, institutional, and classroom levels, respectively, might contribute to our understanding of language teacher identity. In the final section, we argue that the host of complementary theories adopted by the six contributors supports the view that a transdisciplinary approach to language teacher identity is both productive and desirable. Further, the contributors advance the language teacher identity research agenda by taking into consideration (a) how teacher identity intersects with the multilingual (Higgins and Ponte) and translingual (Zheng) realities of contemporary classrooms, (b) the investment of teachers in developing the semiotic repertoires of learners (Stranger-Johannessen and Norton) and a socially inclusive learning environment (Barkhuizen), and (c) the emotions (Wolff and De Costa) and ethical practices (Miller, Morgan, and Medina) of teachers. Central to all articles in this special issue is the need to recognize the rich linguistic and personal histories that language teachers bring into the classroom in order to promote effective language learning.

AB  - This article provides a case-based critical reflection on integrating transdisciplinary knowledge in entrepreneurship education as a framework for empowering future entrepreneurs and innovators . The increased complexity of modern societies emphasizes new requirements for teaching practices intended to equip decision-makers with the tools necessary for navigating poly-crises and contributing to the sustainability of coupled systems. This requires an interplay between inter- and transdisciplinary knowledge aimed at developing a common body of knowledge within a specific domain. Within our educational case study, we used a transdisciplinary approach to design and implement a curriculum for enhancing complexity literacy and systems thinking. The specific learning outcomes can be categorized by referring to the qualification framework of knowledge-skills-competence that fosters an understanding of dynamic coupled systems. Our research shows the potential of transdisciplinary knowledge integration as part of a sustainable education for empowering future entrepreneurs and innovators. The analysis's results have implications for research and practice that incorporate such integration as part of transitioning to a new institutional framework at universities. Developing new, viable approaches to education has social implications that can be regarded as interventions targeted at achieving systemic impacts while enhancing the sustainability of education and society as a whole.

AB  - Higher education institutions recognize that today's problems are too complex to be conceptualized by a single discipline and are becoming increasingly committed to interdisciplinary work, as evidenced by the increasing number of interdisciplinary departments, internal funding opportunities, and research centers. Despite the widespread popularity and theorized benefits of interdisciplinary work, there is minimal research on predictors of team innovation of university-based interdisciplinary teams. To fill this gap in the literature, the authors developed and tested a comprehensive model of interdisciplinary team innovation. The results suggest that members of teams that had a shared vision, were task-oriented, and embraced debate, perceived their teams as innovative. Cognitively diverse teams that were task oriented, on the other hand, had higher team innovation performance. Lessons learned from this study are useful for all organizations that engage in interdisciplinary work and those professionals who work or advise interdisciplinary teams.

AB  - Data science is inherently collaborative as individuals across fields and sectors use quantitative data to answer relevant questions. As a result, there is a growing body of research regarding how to teach interdisciplinary collaboration skills. However, much of the work evaluating methods of teaching statistics and data science collaboration relies primarily on self-reflection data. Additionally, prior research lacks detailed methods for assessing the quality of collaboration skills. In this case study, we present a method for teaching statistics and data science collaboration, a framework for identifying elements of effective collaboration, and a comparative case study to evaluate the collaboration skills of both a team of students and an experienced collaborator on two components of effective data science collaboration: structuring a collaboration meeting and communicating with a domain expert. Results show that the students could facilitate meetings and communicate comparably well to the experienced collaborator, but that the experienced collaborator was better able to facilitate meetings and communicate to develop strong relationships, an important element for high-quality and long-term collaboration. Further work is needed to generalize these findings to a larger population, but these results begin to inform the field regarding effective ways to teach specific data science collaboration skills.

AB  - Translational medicine (TM) is an interdisciplinary branch of biomedicine that bridges the gap from bench-to-bedside to improve global health. Fundamental TM skills include interdisciplinary collaboration, communication, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving (4Cs). TM is currently limited in undergraduate biomedical education programs, with little patient contact and opportunities for collaboration between different disciplines. In this study, we developed and evaluated a novel interdisciplinary challenge-based educational concept, grounded in the theoretical framework of experimental research-based education, to implement TM in undergraduate biomedicine and medicine programs. Students were introduced to an authentic clinical problem through an interdisciplinary session with patients, medical doctors, and scientists. Next, students collaborated in groups to design unique laboratory-based research proposals addressing this problem. Stakeholders subsequently rewarded the best proposal with funding to be executed in a consecutive interdisciplinary laboratory course, in which mixed teams of biomedicine and medicine students performed the research in a fully equipped wet laboratory. Written questionnaires and focus groups revealed that students developed 4C skills and acquired a 4C mindset. Working on an authentic patient case and the interdisciplinary setting positively contributed to communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving skills. Furthermore, students were intrinsically motivated by (i) the relevance of their work that made them feel taken seriously and competent, (ii) the patient involvement that highlighted the societal relevance of their work, and (iii) the acquisition of a realistic view of what doing science in a biomedical research laboratory is. In conclusion, we showcase a widely applicable interdisciplinary challenge-based undergraduate concept fostering TM.

AB  - Educators, researchers, and institutions have long recognized experiential education's value for fostering ongoing learning and skill development. In recent years, experiential education has gained increased traction in higher education, based on recognized need for graduates to encounter and actively reflect on lived experiences in various disciplines. Yet, much of the research in graduate-level experiential education focuses on discipline-specific opportunities, often within the context of individual programs where students' career outcomes and program pathways are narrowly defined. In this paper, we examine experiential education as interdisciplinary practice. Through qualitative analysis of interviews, focus group, and data from a collaborative program evaluation, we respond to a gap in existing research to examine the perspectives of doctoral students from multiple faculties, programs, and degree types engaged in an interdisciplinary experiential education program. The study's findings contribute to a more robust understanding of the potential for experiential education as interdisciplinary practice, with direct examples of how doctoral students and higher education institutions are moving this work forward in this context. Research implications include examining similar interdisciplinarity in other contexts and reflection related to equity, diversity, inclusion, and Indigenization initiatives. Practice implications include aligning participant and program goals across disciplinary contexts.

AB  - The landscape of work continues to evolve post-pandemic, leading to a shift in focus within higher education from discipline-specific knowledge and skills to capabilities that are transferable and reflect real-world complexities. A review of higher education to meet future economic and social trends and skill sets is a feature of many countries including Australia, where work-integrated learning (WIL) has been identified as a priority. This research identifies how to successfully involve online students in interdisciplinary WIL to develop complex problem-solving skills, resilience, and adaptability -- all imperative for competing in a constantly changing and digitally reliant economy. Adaptable and scalable, online teaching provides an alternative to traditional student placements while supporting student collaboration on authentic real-world projects. This study reflects on student and industry feedback of an online, interdisciplinary WIL course over four years. The key learnings and, challenges of online interdisciplinary WIL are identified along with recommendations for further research.

AB  - This study explored how a group of academics in China and Europe used WeChat to build a Community of Practice online, which supported their interdisciplinary collaboration and professional development. We primary used a qualitative research design, combining with a data mining technique, and the qualitative data were mainly from multiple sources including online interaction excerpts, teachers' reflections, and interviews. The results showed that the participants were utilizing the WeChat App to build a virtual CoP for collaboration and professional learning in terms of three dimensions: mutual engagement, joint enterprise, and shared repertoire. Positive perceptions were identified in these participants on joining the different groups. Moreover, their research collaboration and knowledge in different fields were transformed positively. The participants were clustered in three groups and the results showed that their positive attitudes of engaging in the CoP could be reflected according with their tendency, perceptions, and willingness of using WeChat in the analysis. A framework for using mobile social media to transform CoPs into knowledge-building communities for academics' collaboration and learning was proposed based on the findings. Future directions are also provided.

AB  - As a "wicked problem," climate change requires interdisciplinary understanding and collaboration in order to prepare future leaders to develop solutions. To this end, as an ecologist and an anthropologist at a mid-sized university in the southeastern U.S., we designed a pair of interdisciplinary, research-intensive courses for first-year Honors students with the goal of improving understanding and communicating the urgency of climate change. We employed High Impact Practices (HIPs) and Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) to accomplish learning outcomes during both years of the course. Gains in scientific knowledge and climate change-specific knowledge were assessed with quantitative and qualitative analysis of pre and post-tests. Analysis suggests that the course improved climate change knowledge and sophistication of interdisciplinary thinking and increased student confidence in understanding of the process of science. This course structure offers an approach to providing a practice space for developing multifaceted solutions to wicked problems.

AB  - The importance of engaging students with complex societal challenges has led to the adoption of various interdisciplinary teaching and learning practices in both K-12 and higher education. However, interdisciplinary learning is one of the most complex domains of contemporary educational practice, and, despite its significance, remains significantly undertheorized and under-researched. This Special Issue highlights empirical research efforts toward understanding interdisciplinary learning in its complexity. It simultaneously aims to (1) advance ecological perspectives that encompass concepts and methodologies for studying complex heterogeneous learning practices and (2) apply these perspectives to the research of interdisciplinary learning - of how people learn across and beyond disciplines. This introduction provides a historical context for interdisciplinary learning, introduces an ecological stance toward researching learning across and beyond disciplines, and reviews critical theoretical and methodological challenges within interdisciplinary learning, arguing that the field of the learning sciences is well-positioned to address these challenges. It discusses how the contributions presented in this special issue shed light on theoretical, methodological, empirical, and design aspects of interdisciplinary learning and offer a basis for further design work and research.

AB  - Background: Influential philosophers have suggested that interdisciplinarity is crucial for ecosystem management and scientific practice, and for education to democracy. However, a historical review of the rise of disciplines points at their compartmentalization in schools. An analysis of "core construct categories" of three disciplines, shows that this compartmentalization may decrease when dialogic argumentation is enacted. This background led us to launch an interdisciplinary program in schools. In previous publications, we identified multiple constraints in its implementation and listed design principles for affording interdisciplinary dialogic argumentation. Method: We adopt a "narrative approach" to analyze classroom talk, and ask whether and how interdisciplinary processes emerge in this talk. Findings: Students maintain dialogic argumentation around Interdisciplinary Social Dilemmas, but guidance is necessary for integrating knowledge from different disciplines. When the teacher is attentive to student's unarticulated references to disciplinary ideas, she may subtly guide the emergence of interdisciplinary dialogic argumentation. Often, the teacher misses those opportunities and declaims the integration of knowledge in a non-dialogic talk. Contribution: Dialogic Education is crucial for the success of interdisciplinary programs in schools, but the actual emergence of interdisciplinary processes depends on the handling of organizational and institutional constraints, on huge design efforts, and on subtle guidance.

AB  - Engineering education has become increasingly multidisciplinary in order to prepare future experts to transcend disciplinary boundaries and to co-construct solutions to solve grand challenges. However, faculty members' perspectives and experiences have been largely ignored in the literature. To understand and support faculty members, the present study investigated faculty members' conceptualisations of multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinary education. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 faculty members from engineering, business, art and design with varied experiences with multidisciplinary teaching, course design, and programme management. We found that while some faculty members conceptualised multidisciplinary education as an encompassing concept, most used disciplinary integration to distinguish multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinary education. However, their conceptualisations of the differences between multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinary education were nuanced. Summarising the perceived nuances in different aspects of course design, we propose a typology to demonstrate the variety of types in faculty members' course design. By identifying the diversity and complexities of faculty members' conceptualisations, this study attempts to help faculty members achieve an in-depth understanding of their conceptualisations and practices, as well as support engineering educators in designing courses with disciplinary integration.

AB  - The development of multidisciplinary education requires people to communicate, learn, and design beyond the boundaries of their own domains. In this research, an education design framework is developed to facilitate and support university teachers in multidisciplinary educational design. In addition, it serves as an aid to potentially transform domain-specific action-oriented knowledge into domain-integrated action-oriented knowledge by supporting knowledge co-construction across domain boundaries. The educational design framework, grounded in seamless and hybrid learning paradigms and theory on wicked problem solving, is being developed in a design-oriented educational research. This resulted in a multidisciplinary educational design game, which aims to facilitate cross-border communication, knowledge co-construction, and educational design processes during multidisciplinary educational design and improve the quality of the resulting multidisciplinary educational design.

AB  - The paper aims to explore the impact of interdisciplinarity on sight translation training in scientific and technical domains. The authors concentrate on the distinctive features of transdisciplinarity and explain the concept of "weak" (used as a practical means) and "strong" transdisciplinarity (complex impact through several levels of reality). 80 future translators/interpreters took part in the research. The results of educational process observations during sight translation classes are presented. Three levels of competences in translating and interpreting (high, medium and low) are identified to conduct the quantitative and qualitative analysis of experimental data during sight translation training. The theoretical and practical analyses, generalisation and mathematical statistics methods were used to stipulate the impact of transdisciplinarity on sight translation training. This research has clearly shown that application of a transdisciplinary approach gives future translators/interpreters opportunity to receive cross-sectorial training in specific fields. Transdisciplinary in sight translation trainings has a positive impact on the development of students' professional identity.

AB  - Research indicates that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently exhibit dysregulation, which refers to poorly coordinated affective, behavioral, and cognitive responses to a given situation. We examined the characteristics of dysregulation in children presenting to a multidisciplinary ASD clinic for an ASD diagnostic evaluation. Sixty percent of children presenting for an ASD evaluation exhibited dysregulation. Dysregulation prevalence was higher in children without ASD versus with ASD (69% versus 56%). Severe dysregulation was higher in children without ASD (29% versus 16%). Both groups with severe dysregulation were equally likely to be taking psychiatric medications, however, children with ASD were less likely to be receiving therapy. These findings highlight the importance of implementing dysregulation screening and treatment protocols in ASD centers.

AB  - This article presents a critical reflection on the experiences of three university instructors (two teaching stream and one tenure stream) within a 6-month peer-to-peer mentoring for teaching community of practice (P2P CoP). As part of the P2P CoP, the authors (who were previously unknown to one another) formed a "teaching triad" at a tri-campus, research-intensive Canadian university. They regularly met in person for 1 hour on a weekly basis throughout the Winter 2019 semester to discuss teaching-related matters, undertook classroom visits to observe one another teach, and participated in pedagogical workshops with other P2P CoP members. In this article, the authors specifically reflect on (a) the opportunities presented for reciprocity within their triadic mentorship structure; (b) the value their different scholarly fields offered them in pursuit of professional development and open exchange; and (c) the broadened knowledge base of pedagogical techniques their multidisciplinarity afforded them throughout the P2P CoP. They interpret their experiences of building relationships to offer insights into the unique and transformative advantages of teaching triad mentorship models. These include faculty peer mentoring and professional development opportunities that are not merely formalized but institutionally supported and related benefits for other institutions of higher education.

AB  - Campus spatial organization has potential impact on the multidisciplinary innovation (MDI). This research aims to establish an evaluation theory and a method for MDI adaptability of campus spatial organization. Based on the literature review, it first proposes theoretical assumptions regarding the correlation among MDI abilities, social networks, and spatiotemporal behaviors of individuals on campus. Then, data on the three aspects mentioned above was collected through online survey which was conducted from February 4th to March 15th, 2020. A total of 524 valid responses were obtained from 572 undergraduates and graduates of various majors in Zijingang Campus (East) of Zhejiang University. The correlation mechanism of these aspects was empirically analyzed by structural equation model (SEM). By integrating individual data, the research generated three overall networks whose nodes are linked according to spatial proximity, behavior routine, and disciplinary connection, respectively. Furthermore, an evaluation method is proposed for MDI adaptability of the campus spatial organization, which is based on the comparison of the structural similarity of the nodes in different networks. Accordingly, the evaluation results were validated by expert ratings and user satisfaction. Finally, design strategies for the renovation of an innovative campus are discussed.

AB  - Behind the creativities and innovations in human history, there lie the humble practices of multidisciplinary studies that drive new revolutionary ideas and unconventional approaches. One such example is Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa"--one of the perennial portraits that bear witness to a transcendent level of creative art. It is one of his unique touchstones where he played with light and shade in such a way that both motion and emotion are entwined to the highest point of perfection in the ecstatic smile of the "Mona Lisa." By explaining how Leonardo created an unfathomable emotion in her smile and veiled her face by optics of uncertainty through the fusion of art and science, here we show why and how it can be considered as a prototype for multidisciplinary science education. The analysis of the inner details together with Leonardo's scientific epistemology advocates the importance of putting into practice repeated experiments and observations on widely diverse faculties for the emergence of innovative ideas, for the depiction of reality and for fostering creations.

AB  - Interdisciplinary education and education for sustainable development provide a complementary approach to enhancing learners' interdisciplinary and sustainability competencies. An interdisciplinary approach is considered a crucial method for enhancing university students' competencies in sustainability. However, the use of integrating sustainability issues for the purpose of enhancing interdisciplinary education in universities is still under investigation. In contrast to the analyses of sustainability studies programs, this case study explores how sustainability issues could enhance interdisciplinarity in teaching and learning in non-environmentally related courses that do not have special learning objectives related to sustainability. By borrowing Biggs' comprehensive model of teaching and learning in higher education, this case study analyzes an undergraduate general education course and a postgraduate course at a comprehensive research university in Japan from four perspectives: students' perspectives learning environment, learning process, and learning outcomes. This qualitative case study data were collected through mixed research methods, including questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with instructors and learners. Findings demonstrate that interdisciplinary teaching and learning can be enhanced by integrating sustainability issues into non-environmentally related courses. By integrating sustainability issues into the curriculum, students and instructors from various disciplines can collaborate with the intention of enhancing students' abilities to integrate knowledge and communicate with people from different backgrounds and experiences. The paper concludes by discussing the achievements of and barriers to incorporating sustainability themes into interdisciplinary teaching and learning in non-environmentally related courses at universities. Moreover, it provides implications of utilizing a complementary relationship between sustainability and interdisciplinarity to innovate and rethink teaching and learning in higher education to prepare students to build a sustainable future.

AB  - Purpose: To properly address complex sustainability issues, higher education institutes (HEIs), such as universities, need to implement innovative educational programmes that adhere to transdisciplinary principles. This study aims to contribute to the understanding of how to do so across and beyond a university. Design/methodology/approach: This study presents a module comprising two courses, the first of which centres on the identification of sustainability issues in student-led multi-actor dialogue sessions and the second on addressing those sustainability issues through interdisciplinary collaboration among master's students who are at the same time also working on their own thesis. The authors conducted continuous evaluations during the first two pilot years, including community (partners), faculty and student perspectives. Findings: The authors found that the module was successful in training students for inter- and transdisciplinarity. Moreover, high levels of commitment were observed from a diverse range of students and faculty across one HEI as well as positive responses from the community (partners) involved in the module. Further improvements of the module rely on active buy-in from programme directors and ensuring continuous collaboration throughout the co-creation process by streamlining the translation of the issues into manageable research projects with specific research questions. Practical implications: This study provides inspiration and lessons on how to implement university-wide inter- and transdisciplinary module into higher education. Originality/value: The module is innovative in combining university-wide and interdisciplinary learning with and transdisciplinary learning through long-term, co-creational collaboration within and beyond the university.

AB  - Background: Head and neck cancer (HNC) is amongst the 10 most common cancers worldwide and has a major effect on patients' quality of life. Given the complexity of this unique group of patients, a multidisciplinary team approach is preferable. Amongst the debilitating sequels of HNC and/or its treatment, swallowing, speech and voice impairments are prevalent and require the involvement of speech--language pathologists (SLPs). In 2018, an integrated patient unit (IPU) for HNC patients was established which includes healthcare professionals from diverse fields including SLPs. Aims: To characterize the demographic and clinical profiles of HNC patients and assess SLP therapy efficacy in these patients with respect to swallowing, speech and voice functionality. Methods & Procedures: Demographic and clinical information was collected for the first 100 HNC patients referred to SLP evaluation in the IPU. In addition, different measures of swallowing, speech and voice functionality were taken pre- and post-SLP therapy to estimate if and how the therapy improved the patients' performance in these aspects. Outcomes & Results: Analysis revealed that 84%, 36.2% and 33% of the patients suffered from swallowing, speech and voice impairments, respectively. Treatment types (surgery and radiation, chemotherapy and radiation) and the prevalence of speech and voice impairments varied amongst tumour locations (larynx, oral cavity, pharynx), whilst swallowing impairments were highly prevalent across all tumour locations. Speech impairments were more common in patients treated with a combination of surgery and radiation. Comparison between pre- and post-SLP therapy-related measures revealed that swallowing, speech and voice functionality significantly improved following SLP therapy. Conclusions & Implications: The holistic, multidisciplinary approach in the IPU contrasts with the more segmented care typically provided in out-patient/community clinics, making SLP therapy within the IPU uniquely integrated and effective. The protocol established at the IPU provides a valuable framework for SLP assessment and therapy in HNC patients exhibiting swallowing, speech and voice impairments with the ultimate goal of improving their quality of life.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratory research was not possible in different educational programs at Delft University of Technology and Erasmus University Medical Center due to the taken measures. Therefore, a team of faculty from both institutions developed an alternative transdisciplinary research group project that was fully performed online. The overall project was named the Corona Research Super Project. This project provided an opportunity for students to fulfil the requirements for their degree while complying with the guidelines of the University, Medical Center, and government. It also gave them an opportunity to participate in something that felt meaningful during a stressful time since all sub-projects contributed to developing knowledge on the current COVID-19 pandemic. This article describes the process of setting up this educational project, the resources provided to the students, and the format of transdisciplinary work. Furthermore, it also provides a theoretical view on how to think about research projects when you cannot be side by side in a laboratory and how to make this into meaningful research education. By sharing our experience of setting up this program in unprecedented times and providing a format, we hope that other universities will use this approach to develop comparable transdisciplinary educational programs. We believe that these sorts of programs are essential for in depth transdisciplinary training of scientists of the future

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the pedagogical tools that can enhance transdisciplinarity in higher education and stimulate sustainability transitions, based on the case study of a partnership between the University of Brasilia and an ecovillage in Brazil. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative study was carried out, based on professors' experience, students' reports and registration data. Emergent themes were discussed based on the concepts of sustainability transitions, transdisciplinarity and active/experiential learning methods. Findings: Undergraduate classes at the ecovillage have motivated students to work towards sustainability transitions by presenting them with new repertoires of sociotechnical configurations and social practices, by promoting a feeling of belonging and co-responsibility for the world and by a horizontal sharing of knowledge and affections that instigated reflections about their purposes in personal and professional life. Practical implications: This experience demonstrates the potential of transdisciplinary pedagogical approaches to education for sustainability that promote collaboration with different stakeholders and the reflection on individual and collective motives and values -- the inner dimension of sustainability. Originality/value: It describes an innovative and transformative initiative in the heart of Latin America.

AB  - Academic conferences are events geared to disciplinary specialization, and much of the SoTL literature regarding scholarly gatherings addresses their benefits for graduate student apprenticeship. In our organization of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Virginia Woolf, we explored other forms of pedagogy to augment an academic professionalization approach. In particular, we created opportunities for cross-disciplinary teaching and learning, which have particular potential for Humanities students who may end up applying their discipline-specific training in non-academic contexts and in unexpected ways. This paper explores the possibilities and limitations of the cross-disciplinary initiatives that we developed for Interdisciplinary/Multidisciplinary Woolf. Inspired by the interdisciplinarity of the early 20th century British author Virginia Woolf and the current critical movement known as the New Modernist Studies, we outline the theories behind our approach to conference pedagogy and reflect upon our intentions and methods. We also assess learning outcomes in relation to both apprenticeship and non-traditional models of conference-based instructional design, and consider the institutional structures and practices that both enable and limit the scope of cross-disciplinary research and its dissemination at the undergraduate, graduate, and faculty levels. By moving away from the field of literary studies and sharing our scholarly teaching perspective in the context of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, we attempt to put into motion the potentially transformative disciplinary boundary-crossings that motivated the 2012 Woolf Conference.

AB  - This article presents ideas and narratives of an experiment on the concept of energy developed for an honors seminar on energy and a mechanics course. We argue that energy is an idea best taught in an interdisciplinary manner. While most physics courses explore ideas such as mechanical energy and conservation of energy, it is imperative that a more practical view of energy as fuel be addressed since this has particular relevance to our students' future. We believe energy cannot be discussed without talking about entropy and that a proper introduction to energy can only be made by simultaneously discussing the idea of entropy. In this article, we present one lab activity related to carbon emissions from bicycling, designed to help elucidate this idea through the use of conceptual metaphors and embodied learning. The learning goals of the activity were to encourage students to understand that energy and entropy are intricately related and to have students gain a deeper understanding of the concepts by considering and discussing ways in which they apply to different contexts. We discuss the rationale, implementation, and outcomes of the activity.

AB  - In this paper, we present an overview of a series of 1-credit applied problem solving courses. The goal of these courses was to help students develop their oral and written communication skills, ability to work as a team, and general problem solving skills through preparation and participation in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) and Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM). In the first part of the course series, teams of students worked on past contest problems to simulate the contest experience over a 15-week semester. We provided feedback and guidance at each step of the modeling process, but students were ultimately responsible for all modeling choices. Students were required to write a 20-page report detailing their solutions (as in the contest) and to present their work orally. In the follow-on course, students participated in the MCM/ICM and shared their work in an oral presentation at a local conference or on campus. Here, we provide course details and share student feedback, positive outcomes (including a winning team!), and plans for future iterations of the course. We suggest that this type of experience provides an opportunity for students to engage with open-ended problems similar to those they may face in their careers.

AB  - Health systems face complex challenges -- even more so in resource-constrained contexts such as South Africa. Alignment of local educational systems with national development goals is needed to strengthen health systems. The further disruption of COVID-19 to educational and health systems underscores the necessity to adapt our curricula and practices. Integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), such as e-Learning and mobile health (mHealth) applications integrated with learning management systems, or virtual learning environments, offer a sustainable strategy for the enhancement of Health Science student training, graduate competency development and delivery of quality patient care. Uptake, or not, of e-Learning and mHealth at several South African universities was explored through a survey with staff (n = 65) from across the Health Sciences. Diverse perceptions, experiences and recommendations were found, including the prevalence and dis/advantages of e-Learning and mHealth in the Health Sciences. The perceived usefulness of specific features of each were highlighted. In closing, a multi-modal model of epistemology, axiology and ontology in healthcare technology, digital health and medical education -- including content, skills, technology development and challenges/constraints -- is presented.

AB  - In recent years, we have been observing the phenomenon of an emerging scientific field: "digital transformation research" (DTR). Due to the diversity and complexity of its object of research digital, transformation is not effectively researchable if confined to the boundaries of individual disciplines. In the light of Scientific/Intellectual Movement theory (Frickel and Gross 2005), we wonder how interdisciplinarity could and should be mobilized to further advance the development of the field of DTR. To answer this question, we (a) need to understand how interdisciplinarity is conceived and (b) how it is considered in research practice by researchers in the emerging field. This is important, as scientists' application of interdisciplinarity will highly influence an emerging field, shape its growth, consolidation as well as its academic establishment. We conducted six group discussions with 26 researchers from different disciplines and career levels (PhD students, postdocs, professors). The discussions were studied with a structuring qualitative content analysis. The results reflect the vagueness of the concept of interdisciplinarity. Interdisciplinarity is largely conceived as multidisciplinarity. Further, the interviewees mentioned more challenges than opportunities when it comes to interdisciplinary DTR. The present study widens the scientific understanding about how researchers of different career levels perceive, learn, and practice interdisciplinarity in DTR. It further provides valuable indications of how interdisciplinary research in an emerging field can be profitably shaped for practice.

AB  - Food, cooking, and eating are commonly used as contexts or legitimations to teach and communicate science. However, for teaching to have contextual credibility, the relationship between subject and context is a relevant area of study. The present contribution describes an analysis of curricula from three Nordic countries shedding light on conditions for interdisciplinarity and/or curricular integration between the subjects science/chemistry on the one side, and home economics on the other. A two-phase documentary analysis was conducted on curricula from Finland, Norway, and Sweden from 2006 to 2020, revealing substantial potential for interdisciplinary collaboration and/or curricular integration. This is seen both in common declarative knowledge content ('declarative knowledge overlap') and, more interestingly, meeting points between subject-dependent practices and ways of thinking ('transfer of practices and ways of thinking'). The second inductive phase produced 11 themes common to the subjects. Possibilities and challenges are discussed in relation to the subjects' epistemologies and ontologies, as well as practitioners' competencies, attitudes, and creativity for subject boundary-crossing. Consequently, we conceptualise teachers' roles as lying in the span between 'teacher as polymath' and 'teacher as collaborator'. The present work also provides a instrument for exploring curricular conditions for interdisciplinarity between subjects on a more general basis.

AB  - This paper focuses on a transdisciplinary research project in a historically underrepresented public school in Toronto, Canada. At the intersection of elementary science, technology, and arts-based curriculum, the project employs the feminist new materialist practice of "diffraction" (Barad, 2007) in an after-school robotics club. Following a Baradian ethics, an emphasis is placed on the process of designing machines, which illuminates the need for different modes of measurement in educational research that account for the ongoing relationships within collective learning environments.

AB  - Addressing many of the world's contemporary challenges requires a multifaceted and integrated approach and, in this respect, interdisciplinary research (IDR) is increasingly recognized as central to both academic interests and national science policies. In spite of the growing attention given to IDR, the impact of IDR remains under-investigated. In this study, we analyzed the influence of interdisciplinarity on citation impact (particularly, WoS citation) and broader impact (particularly, PloS usage) at the article level. We measured IDR in terms of three different elements of diversity-variety, balance, and disparity--as well as the integrated diversity overall. The results of negative binomial regression analysis with field fixed effects and robust standard errors show the positive effects of interdisciplinarity on both academic and broader impact. From an analysis of trends over time, the results show that higher interdisciplinary publications tend to attract more citations and have higher PLoS usage. Compared to citations, which need a more extended period to accumulate, the advantage of measuring impact with PLoS usage is its immediacy. Also, there are signs that PLoS usage and citations can mutually reinforce each other.

AB  - Background: Most people with stroke exhibit a variety of impairments that need to be addressed by a multidisciplinary team. Communication and swallowing disorders are common and should be screened very early. To guarantee a patient-centred approach, all patients, even those with speech and language disorders, must be actively engaged in the healthcare process. Effective communication is essential to success in many of the needed interventions. However, healthcare professionals often do not receive formal training in communicating with these patients, thus increasing the risk of preventable adverse events. Aims: To describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a post-acute stroke multidisciplinary team training using patient actors in a simulation approach. Methods & Procedures: A 2-day course focused on the transdisciplinary knowledge related to communication and swallowing that all members of the multidisciplinary stroke team should acquire was implemented. A case-based learning methodology used simulation and resorting to patients' actors. Learning outcomes were evaluated by comparing the results obtained in two knowledge tests, one for each topic, which participants performed before and after each day course. Reaction to the training was gathered concerning the content, teacher quality and course organization. The follow-up was performed 6 months later to assess training skills transfer to the workplace environment. Outcomes & Results: All the participants considered that the programme objectives were relevant or truly relevant and revealed that the programme's dynamic, rhythm and scenarios set were excellent. After the end of the programme, both communication and swallowing knowledge increased. Most participants had the opportunity to employ the acquired training skills in their work environment. The main barriers identified to implementing these skills were the 'need for additional training', the 'lack of time' or 'the lack of opportunities'. Conclusions & Implications: Simulation is a central method to increase and improve health professionals' skills when intervening with stroke patients. Using simulation with patient actors allows flexibility and diversification of clinical situations under analysis, which can provide a multiplier effect of reflection and learning. The implemented training achieved its objectives.

AB  - Physical education (PE) is a site that brings categories of difference under erasure, presenting a wicked problem for how a sense of belonging is cultivated for all learners to foster physical activity, health and wellbeing across the lifespan. This article explores how, we, as two teachers of PE, turned to postqualitative and 'new' materialist inquiry to generate a sense of belonging within a PE/environmental education nexus. Taking up Karen Barad's agential realism and Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's rhizome, we conceptualise this PE/environmental education nexus as a transdisciplinary approach to curriculum that enacts a knowing/being/thinking/doing between, and across, borders, boundaries, categories, fields and practices. We then show how this nexus was actualised in our teaching practices through two vignettes. As transdisciplinary approaches to curriculum are grounded in the lived, embodied and embedded (micro) politics of location, individuals are imbued with affective obligation to enact affirmative patterns of relating moment-to-moment. This means that a sense of belonging is always imminent, invented and co-created, bringing attention to situated obligations to enact good relations with ourselves, each other and wider planetary systems.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to describe how the multidisciplinary studies in the special issue expand and enrich the framework of authentic talent development in sociocultural context. Design/methodology/approach: The study presents a framework of authentic talent development in sociocultural context and identifies key themes from the seven interdisciplinary studies of the special issue to enrich and expand our understanding of sociocultural barriers to authentic talent development for individuals from low-income and minoritized communities, including women. Findings: The studies included in the special issue illustrate several ways in which social identity ascription truncates the talent trajectory of individuals from low-income and minoritized groups. They also show how ascription processes can be mitigated through policy, reformed organizational structure and practice and growth fostering relationships. Practical implications: The findings of this paper have implications for developing strategies to mitigate social identity ascription in talent development in the domains of public policy, schooling and the workplace. Originality/value: The special issue brings together contributions from multiple disciplines to holistically understand the nature of social identity ascription in talent development across the life course. Collectively, the contributions identify a number of complimentary tools at several levels that might allow effective mitigation of social identity ascription processes, facilitating authentic talent development for individuals from low-income and minoritized communities.

AB  - Interdisciplinary teaching by teams of diverse faculty is highly effective in providing students with intellectual tools for creating innovative solutions to 21st century problems. This article examines the effective practices for interdisciplinary teaching used by a five-membered, disciplinarily diverse faculty team with expertise in chemistry, design, education, and business/psychology. The team found convergence, reaching a common understanding of information through discussion, to be more important, and difficult, than conveyance, sharing new information. The influence of convergence and conveyance on the faculty team impacted their team dynamic and their content delivery, encouraging similar characteristics from their students. A collaborative case study approach, augmented with interviews and meeting notes, provide the qualitative data from which best practices for fostering an effective interdisciplinary faculty team in higher education are identified. The findings reveal the importance of, and processes for, balancing individual and team priorities within the broad areas of convergence and conveyance: recognizing intrinsic rewards, maintaining a shared focus, developing a team mindset, translating ideas across disciplines, and proactively working on good team practices. The article addresses the dearth of research on the effective practices of interdisciplinary teams in higher education concluding with practical examples and strategies for high performing faculty teams.

AB  - This qualitative study explores how educators can foster creativity across disciplines through a conceptual framework for creative interdisciplinary collaboration. The article introduces the Creativity Lab process model, which generates collaboratively developed, multifaceted but cohesive project ideas. The author argues that while creativity and collaboration are recognized as important 21st-century skills, opportunities for learning the granular mechanics of creative interdisciplinary collaboration are not yet fully integrated into higher education. The process model addresses this and offers a practical way to foster creative confidence in participants, encourage pluralities and possibilities through gamification, and emphasize integration and cohesion of multiple perspectives in ideas. The article concludes that educational institutions have an opportunity to build the capacity of students and faculty to become skilled at creative collaborations across disciplines, and the Creativity Lab process model offers a specific approach to doing this.

AB  - Collaboration across multiple perspectives enhances the potential for innovative solutions to the complex issues of our time. An interdisciplinary education (IDE) community of practice (CoP) proved to be a catalyst for bringing together interested faculty from across a large public college to create an IDE learning event focused on homelessness. Using a qualitative research approach, we explored the process and impact on student learning. Four main themes emerged: authentic engagement, transcending perspectives, collective responsibility, and cultivating curiosity. The first three themes identify the transformative power of IDE, while the last theme highlights the challenge of remaining open to differing perspectives. We learned the value of incorporating perspectives beyond strictly disciplinary views, such as narratives from those directly impacted by homelessness--to stimulate empathy, transformation, and the will to act.

AB  - Teamwork skills are an important part of business school curriculum typically taught using project-based experiential methods. This paper presents best practices for teaching teamwork skills to Gen Z students using a project-based learning, peer mentoring approach. With experiential learning theory as a guide, an interdisciplinary process was developed between an introductory programming course and a capstone business project management course to improve experiential learning and overcome issues like the free-rider problem. The opinions and sentiments of peer mentors were examined using text analysis and sentiment analysis. Peer mentoring between two interdisciplinary courses was found to reduce the free-rider problem and was beneficial for both classes.

AB  - Leadership is an elusive and widely debated concept across disciplinary boundaries and is often contested in scholarship of learning and teaching. This article troubles models and conceptualisations of leadership in Students as Change Agents (SACHA), an interdisciplinary challenge-based course offered at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. "Troubling" is understood as the unearthing or undermining of existing hegemonic assumptions about a concept. Through an analysis of survey data and qualitative interviews with students and staff on the course, along with group dynamic analysis, we explore a case of an interdisciplinary, challenge-based classroom as a space for, and of, contestation of leadership. In this article, we trouble leadership by (1) highlighting how the role of the coach and the interdisciplinary, challenge-based course design destabilize familiar patterns of teamwork and leadership and (2) emphasizing how notions of leadership are rooted in subtle disciplinary commitments. This analysis leads us to characterize "interdisciplinary leadership" as a temporal sensibility where interdisciplinary teamwork requires a high degree of flexibility and responsiveness. This research contributes to the practical facilitation of teamwork in these contexts where leadership can be better learnt and taught if understood as a temporal sensibility that can be taken up, put down, passed around, and shared by any and all members.

AB  - Metaphors are prominent across a wide range of research literatures, serving as imaginative sparks for innovative approaches to complex problems and provocative questions. Research metaphors are very often interdisciplinary in nature, with scholars drawing insight and inspiration from disciplines outside of their own. Yet, research metaphors are rarely developed through interdisciplinary collaborations between scholars in the disciplines in which content is sourced and those in the disciplines in which the content targets. Consequently, the meaning of research metaphors is often left under-developed or is fundamentally misaligned with the concepts and principles that are being drawn from source disciplines. Here, we as a social scientist and ecologist come together to review the ecological principles of hierarchy and interactions, and the application patterns of said principles within the organizational science literature. The review provides a case example of the conceptual complexities associated with research metaphor development and application. We illustrate divergences from and convergences with ecological sources, as well as inconsistencies in the ways in which organizational scientists define and apply the source content to the study of human organization phenomena. In doing so, we model the impact of interdisciplinary collaboration on the development and application of richer, more trustworthy research metaphors.

AB  - This study explored primary school teachers' self-efficacy beliefs about interdisciplinary teaching practices related to science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) education and project-based learning to understand teacher perceptions and practices and to recommend some teacher training according to the national curricular standards in Brazil. Qualitative data were gathered using semi-structured interviews carried out with in-service teachers, which were supplemented by a questionnaire featuring both closed-ended and open-ended questions. The data were subsequently subjected to quantitative analysis. The findings reveal that while most teachers are familiar with and incorporate project-based learning into their pedagogical approaches, their awareness of and training in STEAM education are limited. Nevertheless, teachers perceived themselves as being very competent across most STEAM domains, including interdisciplinary curricular integration and projects. Chemistry, physics and arts are exceptions, with lower levels of teacher self-efficacy when compared to the other disciplines. This article examines the implications of these findings for pedagogical practices and teacher training in Brazil, while addressing what are teachers' current perceptions of STEAM practices, encompassing project-based learning and interdisciplinarity. It identifies the training requirements necessary to enhance their confidence in teaching science, while integrating arts-related subjects.

AB  - Graphic elicitation and diagramming are useful for qualitative researchers. Diagrams of families have been used in clinical, education, and other applied settings as tools for description and analysis of family relationships since the 1950s. Despite the potential utility of family diagrams to qualitative researchers who seek to understand and theorize the complexities of family structures and relationships, participatory family diagramming, where diagrams of family relationships are co-created by researcher(s) and participant(s) and used as a foundation for interviewing, has largely remained an untapped resource. We describe how we used participatory family diagrams as design elements of multidisciplinary qualitative interview study projects and highlight the benefits of this practice. Our experiences demonstrate how participatory family diagramming enhances rapport with research participants, improves rigor, and aids in analysis of qualitative interview data. We offer practical suggestions for how to incorporate participatory family diagramming as a methodological tool into cross-disciplinary qualitative interview research.

AB  - Although undergraduate research experience has proven to have positive effects on student outcomes, such opportunities are not always widely available. Options can be especially limited for early-career engineering students who have limited research experience. One approach to addressing this issue is to partner engineering instructors with active research laboratories to build research experiences into general engineering courses. This article details a collaboration between engineering and chemistry faculty to develop a pipeline of interdisciplinary, research-based projects for second-year engineering students. Chemistry laboratories are a good fit for this approach because they require a wide array of machinery and hardware for experimentation. This work also takes advantage of recent trends toward do-it-yourself labware that has been used with increasing frequency in colleges and universities through expanded access to 3D printing labs. Specifically, we present 3D printing projects as a potential conduit between chemistry and engineering that can enable engineering students to use their design skills to contribute immediately to laboratory projects. Our findings show that this approach allows engineering faculty to meet course objectives while involving students in interdisciplinary research that offers tangible benefits to chemistry laboratories.

AB  - This case study explores the lived experience of three faculty from different disciplines engaged in an experiential undergraduate nursing study abroad (SA) course, which is largely absent from the literature. This research found specific personal and professional transformative effects of multidisciplinary SA experiences for faculty. Considerations for faculty planning to engage in multidisciplinary SA will be identified, including impacts of faculty dynamics and physical and psychological demands. These findings further highlight, document, and contribute to the growing literature related to the experiential impacts of SA on faculty professional development.

AB  - All students experience challenges and obstacles during their college years, yet an underexplored topic in higher education is the gender gap that exists for college students and how it manifests in college student development. It is important for higher education professionals to understand not only the gender gap in college but also how women experience college in the United States. This conceptual article will explore how adult women experience college and how continuing studies and adult education professionals working with college women may draw upon both counseling and student development theory to assist the students with whom they work and to foster their development.

AB  - STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) Education is one of the approaches that teachers adopt as they shift from content delivery focused teaching to skills development teaching. Also, effective STEAMING requires connection to issues outside the classroom (outdoor STEAM) and hence the coinage of the term Transdisciplinary Outdoor STEAM. However, research shows that teachers fail to design problems that match the framework of Transdisciplinary outdoor STEAM. In this study, we propose a model for using real-life crises such as COVID-19 or heatwaves or famine to support teachers in their effort to improve teaching practices in the 21st Century. The development of our model was informed by the theoretical framework for Transdisciplinary STEAM proposed by Quigley and colleagues (Sch Sci Math 117:1-12, 2017; J Sci Educ Technol 29:499-518, 2020) and the model for problem mathematical modelling cycle proposed by Blum and Leiß (Mathematical Modelling, pp. 222-231, 2007. https://doi.org/10.1533/9780857099419.5.221). We have also illustrated teaching-learning activities for this model to develop learners' expected skills in STEAM education. We argue that using this model may cater to the lack of educational technologies in low-resource countries and that it will promote an action-oriented spirit among students to deal with crises emerging in their contexts.

AB  - This paper reports on a qualitative study investigating the experience and perspectives of students using English as an international language studying transdisciplinary master's degrees related to culture industries at Goldsmiths, University of London. The particular focus of this paper concerns their experiences of writing several different genres on their degree programmes, including a category of written assessment that, in keeping with the transdisciplinary project of opening up disciplinary borders, transgresses typical genre parameters. We argue that (increasingly popular) transdisciplinary programmes of this kind challenge preconceived expectations about academic writing and require a high tolerance of ambiguity on the part of both students and EAP lecturers: established genre conventions may be destabilized and writing become a precarious yet inherently creative process. Our findings highlight the significance of students' identities with regard to negotiating these written assessments; they support the view that academic literacies' emphasis on student perspectives enriches text-oriented EAP pedagogy, and that insights gleaned from small-scale ethnographic studies of this kind enhance the embedding of subject-specific EAP academic writing development.

AB  - In recent years, researchers have shifted from pathologizing Black youths, when investigating the Black-White achievement gap, to focusing on factors contributing to their resilience and success. A critical review was conducted of three widely cited asset-based theoretical frameworks that are used to examine African American students' academic achievement. The review delineates the contributions and limitations of each model when studying African American students. In doing so, a new framework, linking the strengths of all three existing models, is presented as a tool to challenge existing educational practices and foster new theoretical and methodological contributions to this area of research.

AB  - Physics and mathematics represent closely intertwined fields, wherein physicists employ mathematical modeling to address intricate problems. A challenge encountered by physicists involves bridging conceptual understanding with mathematical equations, a task that educators can facilitate by supporting students in navigating these two realms of comprehension. Mathematical modeling has exhibited potential in assisting students in recognizing that the domains of physics and mathematics are not insurmountably complex. The present study investigated the capability of science preservice teachers (PSTs) enrolled in an introductory physics course to resolve real-life physics problems by adhering to the stages of mathematical modeling. Data were gathered through the Interdisciplinary Modeling Eliciting Activity, allowing students to collaboratively discuss problems and devise solutions. Analysis was executed utilizing the interdisciplinary mathematical modeling (IMM) framework. The activity provided an inclusive platform for all students, including those who typically remained reticent during classes, to actively participate in group discussions and articulate their ideas. Despite the successful navigation of the problem with the guidance of the IMM framework, groups encountered challenges in certain tasks such as parsing/grouping and generating a context. Overall, the study demonstrated promise in augmenting PSTs' enthusiasm for physics and enhancing their comprehension of mathematical models within the discipline.

AB  - Weight stigma is the negative social judgment of people based on their weight. Despite the negative consequences of weight stigma, its prevalence is well-documented including within the physical activity (PA) landscape. Research shows that a wide range of PA-related professionals hold negative attitudes toward fat people, including physical education teachers, kinesiology students, and fitness trainers. This article describes a collaboration across disciplines and fields to develop a weight stigma reduction intervention for exercise professionals. Weight Inclusive Thinking for Fitness Spaces (WIT FITS) is a two-hour, self-paced, interactive online course grounded in the Health at Every Size® paradigm and research-informed strategies for improving exercise professionals' attitudes toward fatness and fostering weight inclusivity in fitness settings. WIT FITS was the result of a three-year interdisciplinary collaboration with scholars from pedagogy, public health, sport and exercise psychology, and nutrition. Community partners involved in the development, implementation, and evaluation of WIT FITS included body liberation activists, web and instructional designers, and campus recreation leaders.

AB  - Climate change is a contemporary global crisis that necessitates pedagogical innovation for the middle school dance classroom. This article describes an integrated design for a dance and science unit. Building on students' kinesthetic abilities, teachers are able to create a unit comprising a series of lessons on bird migrations effected by climate change, culminating in a final performance. Students engage in research on climate change and its effects on global bird migrations and view past performances reflecting avian formations from Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov's "Swan Lake" (1895) to non-Western influences on dance. Yoga poses such as Swan, Eagle, and Pigeon evolve into dance phrases. The teacher facilitates students' selection of a musical soundtrack for the choreography of an ensemble performance with props and upcycled costumes. An assessment of the dance and science unit is performed through a continuous feedback loop during practice and through a final group interview after the performance.

AB  - Background: This paper explores K-12 interdisciplinary learning in the humanities (IL-Humanities), an area that, until now, has seen limited research focus compared to its STEM counterparts. We asked: (1) What are the outcomes of IL-Humanities in terms of interdisciplinary competences? (2) How do learners in these environments engage in cross-disciplinary knowledge building and transdisciplinary identity work? Methods: We assessed the efficacy of IL-Humanities across ten Israeli middle schools through a pre-post intervention/comparison design, utilizing the novel Interdisciplinary Competences Assessment (ICA). Qualitative insights into the learning processes within classrooms were derived using discourse analysis methods. Findings: Students' interdisciplinary competences were found to increase following the IL-Humanities interventions. Qualitative analyses offered "thick descriptions" of the process: Students leveraged cross-disciplinary transfer of knowledge to deepen their understanding of complex phenomena and used personal narratives to engage in identity work. Contribution: This study enhances interdisciplinary education research by: (1) providing and operationalizing a model of interdisciplinary competences as an assessment tool; (2) demonstrating the effectiveness of IL-Humanities environments in developing these competences; and (3) advancing our understanding of learners' engagement with cross-disciplinary knowledge building and transdisciplinary identity work.

AB  - True to the field of Cultural Disability Studies in Education (CDSE), this project adopts an explicitly interdisciplinary approach in order to explore representations of disability and the related social attitudes and experiences. Disability studies and radio studies are brought together to predicate and inform the analysis of a sample of education-centred discussions featured in "In Touch," a long-running BBC Radio 4 programme made for, and by, people who have visual impairments. Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) is applied to the sub-themes of mainstream-special schooling and social interaction, which are organised in accordance with the tripartite model of disability in order to avoid one-dimensional readings. The project cuts across the mainstream-special binary and reveals the epistemological value of non-normative community in both preparing for, and succeeding in, 21st-century academia.

AB  - This article examines an outdoor science activity based on Interdisciplinary Teaching and Learning of Science (ITLS) undertaken with a collaborative research methodology as a Research-Practice Partnership (RPP). The activity was implemented in a national reserve in Chile as part of continuing professional development and co-designed by in-service science teachers and researchers. The study had two research questions: 1) How do in-service teachers, working in a RPP, connect and articulate different science topics through methodological and theoretical interdisciplinary perspectives? 2) Can a RPP be a pedagogical resource to generate positive changes in professional development within the practice of managing outdoor science activities? The analysis was qualitative and based on content analysis of data collected from questionnaires about the teachers' perceptions and scientific posters designed by the teachers as part of their course. Teachers were able to connect interdisciplinary topics -- using theoretical and methodological interdisciplinarity -- to solve real problems that arise from the environment within a field trip. In addition, findings reveal benefits of RPP and ITLS, for the management of outdoors activities, supporting the importance and relevance of learning science outside the classroom. However, the boundaries between researchers and science teachers should consider the cultural worlds of participants in the partnerships.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to describe how a sustainability-focused program in higher education can provide training and key experiences for implementing transdisciplinary approaches. The case is a fieldwork-based training course called the Global Field Exercise (GFE) at the Graduate Program in Sustainability Science, The University of Tokyo. The GFE is a methodological training course that emphasizes generating locally relevant research questions on sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: This research is a case study regarding how a sustainability science program can offer a fieldwork-based training course that focuses on a transdisciplinary approach. Five students from diverse academic disciplines and cultural backgrounds participated in the GFE in QwaQwa where they conducted semi-structured interviews with six local entrepreneurs to identify the challenges and opportunities of entrepreneurship. The authors investigated the learning process and outcomes of the students through participatory observation in preparatory meetings, daily reflection sessions during fieldwork and a content analysis of feedback reports. Findings: Four learning outcomes of the students were suggested: the reexamination of assumptions, managing misunderstanding and miscommunication, mutual learning and being empathic toward the local people. Research limitations/implications: This paper suggests three key opportunistic experiences for the transdisciplinary approach: discuss the normative dimension of sustainability; build intersubjectivity among team members and adopt methodological pluralism; and become empathetic to diverse stakeholder groups to facilitate the cogeneration of knowledge. Originality/value: How to design training on a transdisciplinary approach in educational programs remains an area for further exploration. This study addresses this knowledge gap by establishing a link between sustainability education and sustainability in practice.

AB  - When the COVID-19 pandemic required all higher education learning to move to remote or online formats, students were challenged to maintain a sense of community and to advance in their education. By focusing on the immediate, human needs of students, IdeasCongress -- a community-engaged experiential learning course with a curricular emphasis on transferable skills -- flourished in the remote synchronous format. The only significant change was to shift the topic of the course to #RecoverTogether to guide our students in imagining a path through the pandemic while supporting local charities by developing plans for mitigating the impact that the pandemic was having on their service model. This paper outlines a case study of the course and reflections upon the experience of teaching during the pandemic restrictions, supported by student feedback from the September-December (Fall) 2020 semester. Based on this evidence, the approach appeared to be effective for student retention and engagement, and increased student feelings of connectedness to both the campus and the local community. The paper highlights key lessons learned while teaching and learning during challenging times and describes the teaching approaches used to support students.

AB  - The examination of teacher educators' own practices through self-study research has been well established and self-study aligns with the growing interest in open educational resources (OER) and open pedagogy. This research used a self-study method of a Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics (STEAM) OER project, Form and Function(s): Sustainable Design meets Computational Thinking. Two research questions were pursued: How do open pedagogy attributes contribute to a transdisciplinary STEAM OER pedagogical stance? And how can one apply visual artifact self-study as intentional critical friends to examine professional value and to enhance pedagogical self-understanding? The researcher analyzed visual artifacts of created and documented images that supported the process of her interrogations of transdisciplinary curriculum development and open pedagogy. The sites and modalities of the artifacts were questioned and answers recorded using a critical visual methodology. Klein's (2008, 2018) transdisciplinary thinking and the eight attributes of Hegarty's (2015) open pedagogy frame the interrogation of the images and the connections made to curriculum theorizing. The self-study provides conclusions to the role of visual artifacts when conceptualizing the gestalt of complex ideas and relations. The self-study provides warranted assertions for open educators and researchers interested in the practices of transdisciplinary, open curricular and pedagogical processes alongside the eight attributes of open pedagogy, and the role of critical self-reflection.

AB  - This article focuses on the questions of academic freedom, scholar activism, public science, and social engagement. The five authors represent scholars from different disciplines and scientific paradigms as well as diverse gender, sexual orientation, nationality, ethnic, and class backgrounds, yet they share a joint passion for academic 'activism'. The paper, therefore, reflects a multitude of transdisciplinary perspectives and positionalities. This dialogue was born out of the group's desire to investigate the role of scientists in public and political matters, including engagement in social justice. The interdisciplinary nature of the dialogue allows for comparisons between how activism is defined, perceived, practiced, and considered (un)welcome in the disciplines of Sociology, Psychology, Law, Media Studies, and Medical Sciences.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to describe a multidisciplinary approach implemented in teaching public policy analysis at university level. The approach fuses (a) contextual policy analysis with (b) bivariate and multivariate analysis techniques and (c) data analytics skills to improve the learners' competence to conduct "decisional" policy analysis. The teaching subject matter was based on European Union policies and Eurostat data and delivered over a period of 3 years in a semester course and summer school formats. The multidisciplinary fusion generated strong interest among learners and participants from various backgrounds and skill levels. At the end of the course, even those with little or no previous exposure in at least one of the teaching topics were able to quickly grasp the "big picture" and explore their newly acquired knowledge with their own analyses. As a whole, this is an educational design where the multidisciplinary fusion is instrumented in the scope of a single course, not as the combination of different courses in a curriculum. The outcome is a viable and contemporary way to sidestep the quantitative-qualitative analysis divide (where applicable) and help learners gain valuable insight into how seemingly different subjects eventually fuse into applicable knowledge. The multidisciplinary synergy that instigated the course design was mirrored in research effort by the authors leading to publishable work, suggesting that the approach can be adopted and adapted to foster or enhance multidisciplinary research efforts. Similar educational designs can be used in existing curricula to bridge seemingly "distant" subjects and improve the comprehension of how seemingly "distant" subjects relate to each other. As in the case described, in curricula where such subjects already exist, the "raw" expertise is already present and can be readily utilized.

AB  - Background: Although pollinators play an integral role in human well-being, their continued global decline reflects the need to provide and evaluate general pollinator knowledge to promote their conservation. Enhancing learners' understanding of the complexity inherent in pollination systems within the science classroom may help them make more informed decisions regarding pollinator conservation actions. By measuring conceptual understanding of pollination systems, science educators can identify learners' knowledge needs and inform their teaching in science classrooms. Based on previously developed theoretical frameworks describing pollination systems knowledge, we created and evaluated a new instrument to assess pollination systems and conservation actions knowledge. The Pollination Systems Knowledge Assessment (PSKA) is a multiple-true-false instrument containing 18 question stems and 70 accompanying T-F items encompassing three organizational components of pollination knowledge regarding (1) plant structures, (2) pollinator structures and behaviors, and (3) pollination systems function and pollinator conservation. Results: We refined the PSKA based on expert discussions, think-aloud interviews, and pilot testing before and after presenting a wild pollinator conservation unit within a postsecondary science literacy course. The PSKA elucidated learners' misconceptions and revealed discriminating items from the three organizational components of pollination systems knowledge. Conclusions: The PSKA may aid educators in exploring learners' conceptual understanding, identifying areas of misconceptions, and refining educational programming aimed at improving learners' pollination systems knowledge.

AB  - We are living in an era in which equity in education is framed and measured through individual academic achievement. Schools are viewed as economic engines for a better life . By virtue of providing adequate preparation for entering the economy and gaining a well-paying job, they are construed as capable of closing the opportunity gap. This misguided and ahistorical notion of equity fails to account for the nested nature of students, families, communities, and cities, and it disregards centuries of policy decisions that have shaped unequal conditions in communities and schools. While neoclassical economic theory has only more recently come to influence education, it has long driven national and international economic development. We know from research in the fields of human, community, and sustainable development that this economic approach does not attend to the spectrum of noneconomic needs that being met allow for individuals and communities to thrive. Nor does this approach address the roots of structural inequality. This paper draws from those fields to present a conceptual framework that can guide policymakers, researchers, and especially school, district, and state leaders to (re)consider the ways policy decisions challenge inequity. It does so by asking these stakeholders to center humanity through prioritizing intergenerational individual and community well-being. Further, the framework highlights the capacity of schools to serve as the driver of community uplift. Finally, this paper suggests that policy actors and practitioners participate in cross-sector collaboration to design policies that allow individuals, communities, and schools to flourish.

AB  - This article engages with the unsettled question of whether student response systems increase engagement in the classroom. The reported study used a multi-classroom, multi-disciplinary pilot deployment of the app-based student engagement platform Nearpod to test whether greater use of the technology yields greater student engagement. The study results were decidedly mixed, though they prompt a discussion of the construct validity of student engagement measures, particularly in a classroom with app-based platforms that reduce traditional signs of engagement (for example, raising hands). The results also have broader implications for engagement theory and call for problematizing the resulting questions being asked.

AB  - Purpose: To prepare students to address complex sustainability issues, they need to be trained in inter- and transdisciplinarity. This paper aims to contribute to better understanding how to do this, by providing insight into design elements and strategies deployed in inter- and transdisciplinary sustainability education. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature search was conducted to select inter- and transdisciplinary sustainability programmes. Through deductive and inductive qualitative analysis, design elements and strategies were identified and defined. Findings Eleven inter- and transdisciplinary programmes were identified. A comprehensive overview of their design elements and strategies is provided. Moreover, three patterns emerged: students were often only involved in the execution, but not in the preparation and evaluation stages of projects, and thus not trained in these; many programmes relied on diverse student representation for interdisciplinary learning and did not explicitly train interdisciplinary integration; and the societal value of transdisciplinary collaboration received little attention in the evaluation of outcomes and impacts. Research limitations/implications: Follow-up research into the effectiveness of design elements and strategies for inter- and transdisciplinary sustainability education is needed, because the field seems to be understudied. Practical implications: The comprehensive overview of design elements and strategies for inter- and transdisciplinary sustainability education holds the promise to inform design of novel programmes with similar ambitions. Moreover, the findings urge additional attention for explicitly training interdisciplinary integration and safeguarding the societal value of transdisciplinarity. Originality/value: This review presents new insights into strategies and design elements for inter- and transdisciplinary sustainability education.

AB  - This paper returns to the question of whether business schools alone can meet the challenges of enhancing creativity and innovation in entrepreneurial education. Policy makers have side-stepped definitional argumentation in order to embrace a more nuanced potential for entrepreneurial competency development, using multidisciplinary practice in learning and assessment that can be found beyond business and management discourse. Insights from other disciplines can be missed as different terminologies and definitions apply. Design education is inherently multidisciplinary and has been instrumental in facilitating significant policy-level changes. To delve more deeply into this phenomenon, the authors illustrate what actually happens in a classroom in which business and design intersect. Neuroscience research into the learning brain informs learning, teaching and assessment related to creativity, visioning and dealing with ambiguity -- through the progressive development of flexibility and adaptability. The authors introduce the Crit, a common feature of Art and Design courses, as a tool of assessment, concluding that, before we dig deeper into business and management discourses, sideways glances into design education will continue to offer benefits.

AB  - The goals of this paper are to explain the extent to which multidisciplinary peer observation practices may improve reflection among lecturers concerning their pedagogical practices and identify the kind of reflection it improves. In this sense, the paper presents a study with the objective of determining the importance that lecturers give to reflection upon their pedagogical practices as they are engaged in a multidisciplinary peer observation program. Data were collected through interviews and observation records. The results suggest a confirmation, among other aspects, of a commitment to a reflective discourse both in the work carried out by lecturers and as it concerns the pedagogical issues of their training.

AB  - Undergraduate student learning focuses on the development of disciplinary strength in majors and minors so that students gain depth in particular fields, foster individual expertise, and learn problem solving from disciplinary perspectives. However, the complexities of real-world problems do not respect disciplinary boundaries. Complex problems like global health demand holistic approaches and require collaborative teams that can integrate information from multiple disciplines. The author addresses the challenge of how to develop a learning environment for students that encourages integration of their novice expertise to develop transdisciplinary problem-solving teams with only one instructor. She reports on the design and evaluation of a single-instructor transdisciplinary, problem-based course as an avenue for promoting student collaboration and transdisciplinary thinking.

AB  - Transdisciplinary learning environments have potential to bring together the arts, sciences, and computing within schools. We investigate the student and teacher enactment of sensemaking practices that break down disciplinary silos. We describe a pedagogical approach, Luminous Science, where students make dynamic, computationally-rich artistic representations of data from a classroom garden. Then we present an analysis of students' sensemaking practices used during the transdisciplinary unit in three cases of art, science and computing classrooms. Qualitative analysis of a student group and teachers' curricular materials in each of these classrooms elucidates how teachers' enactment choices, organization, and facilitation of the unit we co-designed with them facilitated opportunities for students' transdisciplinary thinking and learning. We show that when teachers' enactments supported increased computational complexity and ties between artifact and phenomenon, then students participated in deeper transdisciplinary sensemaking. We discuss the implications for the design of curricular materials and professional development to support effective organization and discourse practices by teachers in orchestrating transdisciplinary sensemaking.

AB  - Technological progress, globalization and demographic changes have brought about transformations that have increased economic and social inequalities. A structural transformation in education could support economic growth and sustainability and could also be associated with common actions in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, together with social sciences, to mitigate the impact of these megatrends on inequalities. This research explores the effects of a technologically conceptualized transdisciplinary educational approach. A sample of 242 lower secondary school students was selected and a pre- and post-test research design was used to ascertain whether a two-level transdisciplinary educational approach used by technology teachers affected the development of students' technological literacy (TL). The task design included several real-life technological contexts and concepts wherein knowledge of other disciplines was needed to solve problems, create new knowledge and acquire higher-order skills while developing positive attitudes towards sustainable technology. A two-way analysis of variance indicated several significant effects of transdisciplinary education on the development of students' TL. These findings provide valuable insights into the nature of TL acquisition as a basis for curriculum design and the implementation of transdisciplinary technology education in the lower secondary school.

AB  - In this study, we describe similarities and differences in how faculty members from across disciplinary backgrounds conceptualize design. The study is situated in an innovative transdisciplinary undergraduate degree program centered on a studio-based learning experience co-taught by multi-disciplinary faculty. While faculty celebrated the opportunity to integrate multiple disciplinary perspectives, they showed a lack of awareness about differences in how they conceptualized design and design pedagogy, especially early on. In-depth interviews and sketches of eight faculty members provided insights on alignment around core concepts of design, design process, and design instruction. Common themes in design definitions included creation of something new, human-centered design, and focus on problem framing over solution development. There was disagreement on the relationship between design and other ways of knowing, such as problem solving and scientific reasoning. Most used process models incorporating non-linearity, iteration, prototyping, and balance between research and design ideation. While there were many similarities in teaching approach, the rationale given for decisions varied, highlighting underlying differences in how participants thought about teaching design. Instructional alignment is an important consideration in designing a transdisciplinary learning experience, but may be hard to achieve due to cultural and institutional disciplinary boundaries. Collaborative teaching efforts benefit when faculty engage in self-reflection, discussion, and engagement in meaningful synthesis work related to understanding what design is and how it can be taught. Such work will enable a team to create purposeful learning experiences which leverages the benefits of exposure to a range of design problems, contexts, users, and design "flavors."

AB  - Digitalization of our educational systems is moving faster and deeper into our institutions. I applaud it because it has the potential to save time and effort, allowing me to spend more time on the most important part of my work as a scholar. But I am regularly sick to my stomach about what I applaud, because there is no potential and any news or justice in it unless I conquer it. Moreover, unless I do--conquer that is, it works as much against (non)knowledges as the opposite, and this is speeding up. Hence, I speculate with the concepts of speed and force. I ask, how is it possible to add or speed up and strengthen digital diversity for justice to highlight the entangled contours of knowledges, inequality, equality and quality in education? My gut feeling tells me that my subjective professionalism is under siege and that I need to take back the concept of objectivity to survive. It is paradoxically slow but fast, paradoxically objective but subjective, strong but weak. It implies a liberating loss of control to importance. Education becoming "eventicized," professionals and teachers becoming transdisciplinary "dataphilosophers."

AB  - Embedding interdisciplinarity into a higher educational curriculum allows students to develop competence in synthesizing and applying knowledge and skills from across multiple disciplines to address problems and find solutions that would not be possible if only a single disciplinary lens is used. This review of the literature focused on reviewing the state of interdisciplinarity, benefits and challenges of introducing interdisciplinary curriculum into a higher education environment, as well as strategies and models that could be used in designing an interdisciplinary curriculum. It provides a platform for instructional and curriculum designers for integration of interdisciplinary approaches into a curriculum design.

AB  - Interdisciplinary programmes have proliferated across post-secondary education in recent decades. Despite this, little attention has been paid to the manner in which interdisciplinary programmes promote themselves to external constituents. To study this process, we conduct a content analysis of the online self-descriptions of 203 credential-granting interdisciplinary programmes across the Canadian university sector. We find that these entities embrace contrasting logics of superior knowledge, labour market outcomes and customisation. We interpret these findings through the lens of contemporary theorising within organisation studies, noting that their ambidexterity bodes well for their continued existence within the sector.

AB  - When using response to intervention (RTI) for special education eligibility decisions, multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) may use performance level and rate of improvement (ROI) as two metrics when evaluating student responsiveness. Although examining student responsiveness to instruction is a critical component of an evaluation using RTI, previous research suggests that final level of performance is the main factor in MDT decisions. ROI is influenced by pre-intervention performance and is also inherently captured in students' postintervention level, potentially limiting ROI's utility as a distinct indicator of performance. To address these issues with ROI, this study examined whether initial performance level and ROI improve actual MDT decisions about special education eligibility beyond the final level of performance. Results indicate that initial level of performance and ROI add no additional value to predicting MDT's eligibility decisions when using RTI despite identified students having significantly lower initial performance levels and lower ROIs than their nonidentified peers.

AB  - As the pressing problems of the real world are not organized into disciplinary categories, there is an urgent need to make doctoral education more interdisciplinary. As an extension of the border-crossing metaphor that is commonly used for interdisciplinarity, academic educators wishing to engage students in this activity might consider themselves as guides on an arduous journey. In this critical reflection, the author will justify why interdisciplinarity is needed, propose strategies for enabling it at the doctoral level, and comment on how such efforts will bring the doctorate up to date with the practical needs of the current century. His context is the curriculum of an interdisciplinary graduate programme situated in Singapore, where a typical class consists of students from various STEM disciplines. He reflects on his own efforts to devise strategies for promoting interdisciplinarity amongst his students, based on the pedagogical literature on interdisciplinary learning and his own interdisciplinary research.

AB  - This article puts forth new ways of thinking about "becoming multilingual" in transnational and contemporary times by investigating the significance of multilingualism for multilingual student teachers enrolled in French language teacher education programs within the provinces of Alberta and Ontario. As more diversity is present in French language education classrooms, we can no longer look at multilingualism in the same way, nor can we continue to view social identities as static. With the use of a longitudinal sociolinguistic ethnography and a discourse analytic framework in addition to specific case studies in teacher education, our findings reveal some of the student teachers' complex linguistic practices, attachments, and awareness of certain representations. Some of the findings demonstrate how certain representations get constructed, valued, negotiated, and contested, and the impact of attachment to linguistic norms on the development of multilingual repertoires. Our findings provide critical ways for us to observe not only what multilingual student teachers do with language but also how and why they do the things that they do, how they come to see themselves in different spaces, how they are seen by others in certain contexts, and how certain representations become meaningful as well as embodied and performed. This study will also have an impact on future generations of teachers in multilingual schools.

AB  - As the interconnectedness of the world grows, the need to prepare college students capable of addressing complexity likewise grows. In this context, the University of Dayton has developed and tested a transdisciplinary model for education. This model links multiple classes from different disciplines via a common theme and within a common space. It also employs an educational model premised on the following trajectory: disciplinary content development / transdisciplinary observation (empathy); transdisciplinary disruption leading to "A-Ha" observations which transform the disciplinary directions; and lastly transdisciplinary informed design and research. Central to this model is a 3,500 square foot common space used only by the classes participating in the experience. In this space classes share their reflections and content with other classes via both personal linkages and analog communications. The other classes respond to these from their disciplinary and personal perspectives. Thirteen classes, fourteen faculty, and over three-hundred students participated in a themed experience centered on the addiction crisis in Dayton, Ohio. Participants included faculty in applied creativity, engineering, health and sport science, education, theater, and religious studies. Also serving as co-teacher were community stakeholders. Assessment of the experience revealed variable student takeaways. Most prominent among these was student recognition that the experience had expanded their perspectives of the other disciplines. Most suggested that it had improved their ability to collaborate in a transdisciplinary environment and that it had significantly impacted their career aspirations. Fewer acknowledged the experience had improved their ability to create.

AB  - The scholarship of interdisciplinarity provides a potentially powerful response to anti-intellectual and anti-democratic impulses. It recognizes that proof and disproof are generally impossible, and that scientists can be biased in their evaluation of the evidence. Yet it proposes a set of strategies for transcending scholarly disputes in order to achieve more comprehensive understandings. Interdisciplinary scholarship also guides individuals to understand the perspectives of those we disagree with, and suspect that there is some kernel of truth in widely-held beliefs. Interdisciplinarians can urge a reasoned skepticism of both expert advice and democratic processes. We can potentially integrate across differences in values. If we can educate students in interdisciplinary attitudes and strategies -- ideally in K-12 as well as in the university -- we can prepare future generations for constructive and respectful discourse. Much of this article will focus on what we should teach our students and how we might change the academy to do so. However, the literature on interdisciplinarity also suggests some important institutional changes in the wider world. Citizens' fora -- often recommended in the literature on transdisciplinarity -- would allow typical voters to evaluate the evidence relevant to particular public policy questions. The interdisciplinary literature asserts that one need not have disciplinary expertise to draw intelligently upon disciplinary insights, or to integrate across competing insights. Interdisciplinary online resources could attempt to synthesize competing points of view on contentious issues.

AB  - This paper explores the influence of the concept of interdisciplinarity on the work of educational technologists and others involved in technology-enhanced learning (TEL) research. There is a growing recognition of the need for interdisciplinarity in solving complex research problems in many areas of science. Technology-enhanced learning is a relatively young area of research adopting a multidisciplinary approach to investigating the use of technologies for learning. This makes it a field that is worthy of exploration in terms of how the ways of working developed by its practitioners inform our understanding of the challenges of the field as well as its benefits. This paper reporting on work commissioned by the Joint Research Councils' programme on Technology Enhanced Learning provides a discussion of the growing literature on this topic, and a study of the working practices of academics in TEL research. An interview study of 18 participants was conducted as part of the project. The paper reports on the key findings from the interviews and concludes with some practical suggestions to help participants deal with the challenges posed by interdisciplinary working in TEL research.

AB  - The ability to work effectively in a diverse team is a valuable skill which is transferable to many contexts. As such, it is important to build this skill through deliberate, targeted, and meaningful learning activities in higher education. The Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) model enhances team diversity by combining students from different disciplines and years of study to work together on a research project within the curriculum. Additionally, VIP provides the option to remain on the project for an extended period over several semesters and gain team leadership experience. Our research investigates the recent implementation of VIP at the University of St Andrews. Using a survey of student perceptions and analysis of student reflective writing, this case study reports evidence that the VIP model adds value to the development of teamwork skills.

AB  - In conducting a multi-disciplinary, multi-degree study of all 83 higher education accrediting organizations in the United States and the 605 academic programs associated with them, our goal was to uncover patterns in the presence of leadership and general workforce competencies identified within the stated learning outcomes employed by these accrediting organizations. Our findings suggest strong variability across categories of leadership competence related to workforce competencies, where skills related to reasoning and communication were emphasized much more heavily than others such as intrapersonal development. These findings emerged across all postsecondary degree levels, from pre-baccalaureate to graduate programs, raising important questions for the leadership development of post-secondary students. Keywords: outcomes assessment, student leadership, professional development, leadership education, workforce development, competencies While colleges and universities often make the case that preparing students for future career success is critical, studies that examine the empirical support for the assertion curiously lag behind the advanced rhetoric. This paper will showcase research findings based on an analysis of 36,327 learning outcomes addressed within all 83 higher education accrediting organizations in the United States, representing 605 distinct postsecondary academic programs. Our goal was to uncover any patterns of emphasis in particular workforce and leadership competencies embedded within those learning outcomes and examine the extent to which those competencies are represented similarly across postsecondary degree levels.

AB  - Schools respond to the complex needs of students exposed to traumatic and adverse experiences as part of an interconnected system of care that includes health care, child welfare, juvenile justice, housing and a variety of other community services. As legislation increasingly mandates inter-organisational collaboration, attention has turned to consider the ways in which educators and professionals of other disciplines and services interact. This paper analyses the partnership between an educator and a psychologist in the development, delivery and evaluation of a trauma-informed practice program for schools. Using a case study methodology, the research used qualitative analysis of the authors' reflections on their partnership to identify factors that have enabled and sustained interdisciplinary educational work. The findings highlight key elements of sustainable interdisciplinary joint work--including knowledge sharing, opportunities for expansive learning, adapting to changing working relationships and overcoming systemic barriers for collaboration. These themes are discussed in the context of implementing trauma-informed practices in schools.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research provides new insight beyond a singular epistemological and methodological framework. Such collaboration can help increase readership outside a narrow disciplinary angle. Likewise, working with scholars outside one's field can help address new questions using a multidimensional approach. However, working within an interdisciplinary department can produce challenges, especially within small departments. Existing literature has addressed several challenges for academics working in small departments, including increased workload, limited course releases, and limited funding. This article addresses the professional isolation from working in a small interdisciplinary department and provides strategies to overcome these challenges.

AB  - There is a need for innovative approaches in the classroom to increase student preparedness to address and solve some of today's complex social problems. Interdisciplinary courses can be one way to accomplish this. This is an exploratory study to examine if an interdisciplinary web-based video series is associated with improvements in interdisciplinary competence. The course is taught using a flipped pedagogical approach in which a web-based interdisciplinary video series first delivers exposure of content to students and class time is then spent in solving real world problems in interdisciplinary teams. Goals of the study include introducing an innovative approach to teaching interdisciplinary courses, examining if it is associated with an improvement in interdisciplinary competence, and evaluating student receptivity. In this paper we describe this approach using a case study in obesity education.

AB  - Drawing on the experiences of a novel collaborative project between sociologists and computer scientists, this paper identifies a set of challenges for fieldwork that are generated by this "wild interdisciplinarity. Public Access Wi-Fi Service" was a project funded by an 'in-the-wild' research programme, involving the study of digital technologies within a marginalised community, with the goal of addressing digital exclusion. We argue that similar forms of research, in which social scientists are involved in the deployment of experimental technologies within real world settings, are becoming increasingly prevalent. The fieldwork for the project was highly problematic, with the result that few users of the system were successfully enrolled. We analyse why this was the case, identifying three sets of issues which emerge in the juxtaposition of interdisciplinary collaboration and wild setting. We conclude with a set of recommendations for projects involving technologists and social scientists.

AB  - The value of academic advising has been increasingly emphasized in higher education. In this study, attention is given to the most significant types of advice that a sample of cybersecurity faculty and advisors from the Commonwealth of Virginia recommend giving to cybersecurity students. The results show that faculty and advisors recommended that students be aware of six different aspects of cybersecurity education including the value of experience, the need for lifelong learning, the importance of hard work, the need to develop technical skills, the interdisciplinary nature of cybersecurity, and the need to develop liberal arts or professional/soft skills. Implications of the findings include the need to embrace the advising of cybersecurity students, the importance of helping cybersecurity faculty and advisors deliver effective advising, and recognition that good advising is more than simply telling students which classes to take.

AB  - Contribution: This research paper contributes to engineering education research with a framework for interdisciplinary learning outcomes based on students' experiences from participation in an interdisciplinary project for engineering students. A theoretical frame of reference is developed to analyze students' experience with interdisciplinary projects. Background: Engineers are important stakeholders in solving complex global challenges, and faculties have a very important role in educating engineers with the necessary competences. However, research finds many challenges when engineering students work with complex problems in an interdisciplinary setting crossing different disciplinary boundaries. Research Question: What cognitive learning outcomes are experienced by engineering students when working on interdisciplinary problem-based projects across engineering disciplines? Methodology: The case study draws on insights from interdisciplinary projects involving students from different yet related disciplines (referred to as narrow interdisciplinary projects) in spring 2022. The study followed 18 engineering groups during the spring semester of 2022. The students were all from The Faculty of Engineering and Science and belonging to the programs: Energy, Materials & Production, and Construction. The students worked together in clusters on different narrow interdisciplinary engineering projects (leadENG). Data was collected through eight qualitative group interviews and observations from meetings, status seminars, etc. Interview data was transcribed and analyzed in NVivo using a data-driven approach and afterward categorized according to the model for learning outcomes. Findings: A list of intended learning outcomes was compiled for students working on narrow interdisciplinary problems in relation to interdisciplinary understanding, reflexivity, enactment, and coordination. The findings highlight the importance of coordination in an interdisciplinary setup and suggest more focus on student leadership in engineering education.

AB  - Many higher education institutions have put interdisciplinary teaching and learning high on their agenda. We know students learn a lot from interdisciplinary education, and we know scholars learn from their educational scholarship, but what do scholars learn from engaging in interdisciplinary education? I interviewed seven mid-career scholars about what they learned and in what ways their work was appreciated. The findings illustrate that scholars learn about education, students, interdisciplinarity, their own discipline, the university, and themselves, and that the scholars felt their efforts were recognized by their interdisciplinary contexts, but not rewarded outside of those contexts. The study describes academic and personal struggles, pleasures, and joys of scholars starting to engage in interdisciplinary education.

AB  - With global increases in the population of older adults, there is a critical need for interdisciplinary collaboration to address the complexities of aging. Interdisciplinary research is well suited to facilitate trainee development; this venue provides opportunities for engagement in collaborative projects and networks, positioning trainees to become effective interdisciplinary researchers. This project examined the experiences of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows participating in an interdisciplinary trainee network for research on aging. The methods were informed by principles of reflexivity whereby participants reflected on their experiences of engaging in the network. Key findings included: the contribution of institutions and structures, transcendence of boundaries, and development at the level of the individual and community. Findings highlight the value of investing in trainee development in interdisciplinary collaboration, within and beyond aging research, and can inform the development of interdisciplinary trainee initiatives in other areas of research, policy, and practice.

AB  - In this paper, we consider the perceived effectiveness of using industry-based transdisciplinary, complex problems as a vehicle for final year undergraduate mathematics students to apply their knowledge and skills in realistic settings, preparing them for the world of work. The discussion centres on a recently designed, implemented and evaluated model for a capstone subject incorporating a work integrated learning project in a Bachelor of Mathematics degree. To provide background for the discussion, we present the motivation for introducing such learning activities into the programme as well as the design of the model itself. We also report on the outcomes of implementation of the Work Integrated Learning experiences, discussing participant perspectives and describing lessons learnt over the two years. We conclude with a set of identified characteristics of capstone experiences in mathematics, and with a call to re-conceptualize the ways design teams collaborate to support academics.

AB  - This article provides an example of how the traditions and values that have long underpinned the work of Christian higher education are of particular relevance to how Christian universities might partner with communities to address critical 21st-century challenges in groundbreaking new ways. The University of Dayton's Catholic and Marianist mission and identity calls for community engagement throughout the university and student experience, which gives rise to numerous other efforts across campus. Here we discuss one such effort: a collaborative project that arose out of a space called the GEMnasium, an innovative initiative that provided a new location for place-based community engagement and foregrounded applied creativity and transdisciplinarity as valuable ingredients in fostering reciprocal partnerships in pursuit of social justice. Informed by Gelmon, Holland, and Spring's (2018) conceptual framework for assessing civic engagement and service learning, we deployed a qualitative focus group approach to understand multiple stakeholders' experiences in, and the impact of, a workforce enterprise initiative known as the "Freedom Enterprise." Four thematic findings emerged from the data analysis process: (a) creating a shared community; (b) perseverance in building community; (c) faith-in-action/giving legs to the mission; and (d) uncertain long-term impact. After discussing the findings, we offer implications for community engagement in Christian higher education.

AB  - In this paper, the objective is to explore the area of pedagogy in the reform of kindergarten teacher education (KTE), which was implemented in 2013 in Norway. The data material is based on semi-structured interviews with 41 educators from six focus groups, and is analysed with a hermeneutical approach. The main findings is presented in three themes; i) "complexity of leadership," ii) "professional competition" and iii) "fragmentation of a subject." The principal conclusion highlights that pedagogy, as a subject, is weakened, unclear and less defined within interdisciplinary education. Implication for leadership in Higher Education Educations (HEI) indicates in general the need for a clarification of the content of the term "pedagogy" and particularly its role in the reformed KTE in Norway.

AB  - LGBTQIA + college students are navigating a variety of social environments on college campuses. Faculty support, interaction with the LGBTQIA + community, and LGBTQIA + curriculum content are important ways that help support LGBTQIA + students thrive in college. Camp Qmunity is an interdisciplinary LGBTQIA + summer intensive program that allows students to interact with faculty, build community, and learn LGBTQIA + content. This report describes the intensive program that began during the summer of 2020 and continues today. Student evaluations indicated the program increased their knowledge of LGBTQIA + content, allowed them to learn from other students, and felt like the project that resulted from the intensive program was one of the best things they ever did. In the future student roles in the projects will be solidified earlier on in the program. The purpose of this report is to highlight the student experiences reflected through their participation in Camp Qmunity.

AB  - This study aims to examine the impact of interdisciplinary computational thinking (CT) skills training on primary school teachers' perceptions of CT skills. The sample of the study consisted of 30 primary school teachers in Istanbul. In this study, where quantitative and qualitative methods were used together, qualitative data were obtained from the teacher identification form. Quantitative data were obtained from the scale for CT skills. After the pre-test was applied to the study group, "CT Skills Training" was applied. During the training, the basic concepts of CT skills and the subskills were covered theoretically and practically. From the quantitative data, the education applied was determined to have had a positive effect on the primary school teachers' perceptions of CT skills. From the qualitative data, it was determined that the participants had a positive opinion about the applied training and thought that they gained skills related to CT.

AB  - This study examines cybersecurity awareness in universities by analyzing related research output across different disciplines at the University of Johannesburg. The diffusion of innovation theory is used in this study as a theoretical framework to explain how cybersecurity awareness diffuses across disciplines. The University of Johannesburg Institutional Repository database was the data source for this study. Variations in cybersecurity keyword searches and topic modeling techniques were used to identify the frequency and distribution of research output across different disciplines. The study reveals that cybersecurity awareness has diffused across various disciplines, including non-computer science disciplines such as business, accounting, and social sciences. However, there are significant differences in cybersecurity awareness across academic disciplines, highlighting the need for targeted efforts to promote cybersecurity awareness in underrepresented academic disciplines and for intra and interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - This study explores how blockchain technology can be applied in the area of training in organizations, the benefits it brings, and the management challenges that blockchain technology raises. By exploring the decentralized, transparent, and intelligent contract nature of blockchain technology, we analyzed the application of blockchain technology to organizational training. The results show that organizations can achieve training resource sharing, supply and demand balancing, training certification, and intelligent contract enforcement based on blockchain technology. However, it also presents potential challenges, mainly regarding engagement across sectors, support from all members, global technology rollout, staff competency, data confidentiality, and return on investment. Case and industry analysis further validates the content of our research and demonstrates the potential and challenges of blockchain technology in the field of organizational training.

AB  - Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities (LEND) programs are interdisciplinary, graduate-level training programs that seek to promote improved outcomes for individuals with disabilities and their families. Many of these programs include individuals with disabilities as members of the self-advocacy discipline. In this study, 10 self-advocate trainees were interviewed to provide insight into the value of including self-advocates in training and the kinds of accommodations and supports that facilitated their success and inclusion. Interviewees endorsed the importance of including self-advocates in LEND programs. Although several accommodations were discussed as helpful, interpersonal supports from faculty and peers were equally important in ensuring their success and inclusion in LEND. The findings from this study provide support for the expansion of self-advocacy as a formal discipline in LEND programs.

AB  - The complexity of interdisciplinary research, including the time needed to understand multiple approaches and develop skills, within a university structure organised in disciplines, means that interdisciplinary research can be difficult for a developing researcher. However, early- and mid-career researchers (EMCRs) are key to the future of interdisciplinary research. This paper asks, 'Why and how do EMCRs become interdisciplinarians?' It draws on analysis of interviews supplemented by ethnographic observations from a research project exploring the development of interdisciplinary expertise in universities. This paper outlines six common intersecting career pathways through which EMCRs come to work across disciplines. The diverse and often ad hoc nature of interdisciplinary research careers implies that support systems, resources and training need to be adaptive and flexible.

AB  - Experiential learning in biomedical engineering curricula is a critical component to developing graduates who are equipped to contribute to technical design tasks in their careers. This paper presents the development and implementation of an undergraduate and graduate-level soft material robotics design course focused on applications in medical device design. The elective course, offered in a bioengineering department, includes modules on technical topics and hands-on projects relevant to readings, all situated within a human-centered design course. After learning and using first principles governing soft robot design and exploring literature in soft robotics, students propose a new advance in the field in a hands-on design and prototype project. The course described here aims to create a structure to engage students in fabrication and the design approaches taken by practitioners in a specific field, applied here in soft robotics, but applicable to other areas of biomedical engineering. This teaching tips article details the pedagogical tools used to facilitate design and collaboration within the course. Additionally, we aim to highlight ways in which the course creates (1) opportunities to engage undergraduates in design in preparation for capstone courses, (2) outward facing opportunities to connect with practitioners in the field, and (3) the ability to adapt this hands-on experience within a typical lecture structure as well as a hybrid online and in-person offering, thus expanding its utility in bioengineering departments. We reflect on course elements that can inform future design-based course offerings in soft robotics and other design-based multidisciplinary fields in bioengineering.

AB  - The Prospect Park Biodiversity Project was a SENCER collaboration project between the Departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry, and Mathematics at the New York City College of Technology. The goal of this project was to enhance students' participation and learning in STEM disciplines through a civically engaged framework. The project utilized the eco-complexity of Prospect Park Lake in Brooklyn, New York for an interdisciplinary study on the water quality. The project, which involved ten students and four faculty mentors, integrated microbiology, chemistry, and mathematics perspectives using active-learning pedagogies, including hands-on exploration and collaborative learning.

AB  - Learning synthetic biology is often seen as a far distant possibility, restricted to those who have the privilege of an academic career. We propose a student-centered discussion group around synthetic biology, aimed at people from high school onwards with different backgrounds to interact and learn about synthetic biology. We developed a 14-week long program with three modules: "Leveling," "Introducing," and "Discussion." By completing the first two modules, the members should be more comfortable with biological names, structures, concepts, and techniques. The modules developed are available in Portuguese, Spanish, and English via the Open Lab Idea Real website (https://ideareal.org/clube-de-biologia-sintetica/) and can be used to implement the Club either in place or virtually around the world. We put it to practice at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) creating the Club named BioSin. There are programs such as the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition focused on disseminating synthetic biology. Although iGEM is one fantastic way of learning about synthetic biology, there is a high cost. Because of that, a study and discussion Club is a tool to spread knowledge and engage with the study area.

AB  - This article provides a grounded theory study of student experiences while participating in a multidisciplinary pre-service training. Pre-service students from social work and education participated in culturally affirming multidisciplinary training in social and emotional learning and implemented what they learned in the training in their internships. An in-person focus group (N = 4) was used to capture student experiences during training and implementing what they learned. Findings from this grounded theory study have important implications for engaging pre-service students in multidisciplinary collaborations, including challenging them to engage with colleagues outside of their disciplines to incorporate culturally affirming interventions.

AB  - Scholarship has shown that writing groups are important sites of authority negotiation for student writers, yet little empirical research has examined how groups negotiate authority through conversation or how these negotiations influence students' developing expertise. Drawing on observations and interviews of an undergraduate thesis and a graduate dissertation writing group, I use the concept of "presentification" to analyze conversational moments in which group members referenced advisors, "making present" advisor authority to influence group collaborations. Specifically, I analyze these moments to show how writing groups can serve as low-stakes communities in which students negotiate their emerging sense of authority. I found that whereas less experienced writers looked to advisors to solve writing problems and used advisor authority to stand in for disciplinary expertise, more experienced writers voiced advisor guidance to help pose writing problems and negotiate their own stance as disciplinary experts. This study thus theorizes one process through which student writers negotiate emerging authority across sites of literate practice and in collaboration with others who may not themselves be members of the same disciplinary community.

AB  - This study introduces a learning activity that was designed based on two student-centered approaches to education: inquiry-based learning and multi-disciplinary education. Twenty-four second grade students participated in the study. The activity integrates geography, English, and technology and offers students opportunities for inquiry-based thinking. The goal of the activity is for students to find out what the seven continents are, where they are in the world, and create their own little maps. The students collaboratively explore world maps both in hand and on the interactive board. The extension activity is the area of differentiation and acts as differentiation by outcome. Data analysis revealed that all students met the learning goals. The main area for improvement on this would be to have the students mark their work by looking at a real map of the world instead of a completed version of their worksheet; this would make the assessment more authentic.

AB  - Background: Published best-practice guidelines and standardized protocols for voice assessment recommend multidisciplinary evaluation utilizing a comprehensive range of clinical measures. Previous studies report variations in assessment practices when compared with these guidelines. Aims: To provide an up-to-date evaluation of current global multidisciplinary practice patterns and the opinions of otolaryngologist, ear, nose and throat (ENT) and speech-language pathology (SLP) clinicians on initial assessment and differential diagnosis of adults with voice disorders (VDs). Methods & Procedures: ENTs and SLPs worldwide who had worked with VDs within the last 10 years completed an anonymous online survey. Themes explored demographic information about the clinical practice, information about diagnostic assessment pathways, clinical assessments routinely used for initial voice evaluation and clinician perceived value of clinical assessments important for diagnosis. Outcomes & Results: Patterns in the clinical practice of 88 SLPs and 21 ENTs from 18 countries with 1 to more than 25 years' experience were analysed. Clinicians provided services across a range of locations, and a range of assessment pathways was available for initial evaluation. Case history, laryngoscopy and auditory-perceptual measures were the most frequently selected assessments. Most clinicians favoured formal assessment measures for auditory-perceptual evaluation. Clinicians placed equal weighting on ENT and SLP assessment to aid diagnosis for muscle tension VDs and functional neurological voice disorders (FVDs). Conclusions & Implications: Practice patterns for initial diagnostic voice assessment are largely consistent with the currently published guidelines. Decisions for the selection of assessment tools vary according to VD classification, and assessment decisions appear to be guided by case history. Clinicians are not always following established protocols for obtaining reliable standardized measures. Further research is needed to understand the barriers to adhering to standardized protocols and to develop evidence for the use of case history in the process of VD diagnosis.

AB  - Despite a key feature of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and a core strength of liberal arts and sciences education, interdisciplinarity is also a noisy buzzword which does not always make sense from an institutional point of view. Traditional interdisciplinary fields take it for granted like fish in the water while, somewhere else, people keep a distance with questions. "Doing" interdisciplinarity faces additional boundary challenges due to strong gravitational forces that are national, historical, and increasingly from between college and workplace. For a higher education institution whose vision for robust interdisciplinarity is rooted across these boundaries, it is not enough to set up a curriculum, hoping that once and for all the train of interdisciplinarity will roar on. In reality, it may take a higher magnitude of interdisciplinarity and constant enabling mechanisms to balance out certain gravitational forces, such as the pro-STEM and pro-exam tendencies in Chinese higher education. This study surveyed the inaugural undergraduate class of Duke Kunshan University (DKU) as well as its undergraduate faculty to propose a theory of change for scaled interdisciplinarity. The resulting theory of change elaborates on an actionable definition of interdisciplinarity using a vocabulary common to college and workplace, a mobility lens for measuring and leveraging different and especially higher magnitudes of interdisciplinarity, and a linchpin mechanism for energizing this mobility so that interdisciplinarity is more entwined with other institutional facets of teaching, learning, and research.

AB  - Transdisciplinary approaches increasingly are needed to address complex environmental problems. Students can benefit from research and learning opportunities in which they investigate issues, integrate knowledge across disciplines, engage with stakeholders, collaborate with others, and devise solutions. This paper presents information on a 1-week intensive transdisciplinary course focused on climate, water, and agriculture for undergraduate and graduate students. The course, which was held at The Ohio State University's Stone Laboratory on Lake Erie, was offered over 3 years and utilized the local and regional context for investigation and inquiry. Presentations, discussions, experiential and field activities, and guest presentations were used as a way to promote student learning. Students felt positive about their participation and rated the transdisciplinary aspects of the course highly. Ideas from this course can be used to develop similar courses and learning experiences in other settings and on other environmental topics. Instructors are encouraged to utilize campus and local resources, recruit students from a diversity of disciplines, and align content and activities to build transdisciplinary skills.

AB  - Speech-language pathology and special education graduate student teams participated in an intensive summer practicum for social communication skills with children with autism spectrum disorders, utilizing a transdisciplinary approach that aligned to the frameworks utilized for implementation science. Questionnaires measuring transdisciplinary approach knowledge and comfort level were administered pre/post-practicum. Results of the questionnaires, written daily team reflections, course evaluations, and a focus group interview indicated an increase in all measures, including an increased knowledge of TA, increased understanding and comfort level with the other discipline, and a higher level of confidence and openness in working collaboratively utilizing a transdisciplinary approach.

AB  - This article proposes that the reader be nourished by avant-garde elements for new educational practices in the teaching and learning of mathematics. The writing is based on an investigation that was carried out with high school students from Puerto Rico. From a qualitative paradigm with a research design in action, it was explored how students in higher grades resolve situations within their environment. Emphasis was placed on how they analyze through situations in context, and how they build knowledge through the search for a possible solution to the problem through the Project Based Learning strategy. The emphasis in treatment was for students to experience a transdisciplinary environment. Their impressions from the study were the revealing focus of how students learn when they are presented with a situation in their environment, taking roles themselves, solving them it through a project. As part of the project they used their knowledge of science and mathematics to solve the situation. Similarly, they learned mathematical concepts that are part of the Trigonometry course and that are measured in the academic achievement tests called PR Goals, previously known as Puerto Rican Academic Achievement Tests (PPAA).

AB  - Partnership in higher education has gained prominence over recent decades, but recent studies have identified a lack of research exploring how partnership practices unfold in specific disciplinary contexts. This article explores how a transdisciplinary approach can be used to better understand and facilitate student-staff partnerships where staff and students have diverse disciplinary backgrounds and knowledge. We present a case study of the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation at the University of Technology Sydney, focusing on the adaptation of our curriculum co-creation processes by drawing on multiple knowledge types through a reflexive process of mutual learning. We conclude that explicit consideration of these principles, which are common to both transdisciplinary and partnership frameworks, have the potential to enhance consideration of diverse perspectives and the roles played by worldviews, norms and values when building student-staff partnerships around curriculum co-creation.

AB  - In recent years, several innovations have emerged in the field of education, including Blended-Learning, Massive Open Online Courses, Flipped Classroom and Gamification. In particular, several investigations have highlighted the effectiveness of student response systems, or clickers, in different subjects and disciplines. Although some literature reviews have been published on this subject, none of them offer a review of a large volume of publications from a multidisciplinary approach. Similarly, in the literature there are no studies that have analyzed scientific collaborations on this subject. To respond to these concerns, we proposed the use of a bot to retrieve information from a large number of papers (1696 documents co-authored by a total of 4091 researchers) included in the Scopus database. The disciplines covered include natural sciences, engineering and technology, medical and health sciences, agricultural and veterinary sciences, social sciences and humanities, and the arts. The review of the literature reveals that student response systems are generally well-perceived by teachers and students in all the disciplines. Another interesting result achieved from visual data obtained using network visualization software and word clouds is that student response systems are mainly used in some disciplines, such as physics, chemistry, medicine, and nursing. It is clearly observed that the relationship between researchers from the same country is stronger than between researchers from different countries. Finally, some reflections are included on the role of student response systems in online teaching, especially regarding the changes experienced after the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The Hungry Heartland project integrates service learning, media literacy, and multidisciplinary collaboration. It engages students from three disciplines to produce multimedia communication and raise public awareness about the lack of healthy food access in Kansas. Interviews and surveys were used to gather student feedback. Overall, students found the project a challenging learning experience, gained a sense of social responsibility, but remained conflicted about multidisciplinary collaboration. Lessons were drawn to inform future iterations of the project.

AB  - Academic administrators are witnessing unprecedented assaults on national humanities funding that would have been unthinkable three decades ago. Many, if not most, academic administrators and policy makers now view the cornerstone of liberal arts education as an educational anachronism, obsolete intellectualism that holds neither import nor utility in a world of technocratic globalized markets. This crisis in higher education begs two fundamental questions: (1) How has neoliberalism subsumed the diversifying intellectual mission of humanistic inquiry that was once the hallmark of postsecondary education; and (2) How can society use and simultaneously illuminate the ameliorative aspects of transdisciplinary, humanistic knowledge production in the quest to realize a more just, egalitarian society? This article describes how these questions will be addressed through a discussion of creolized political theory, Africana thought, and critical pedagogy that models the transformative social and political theories of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, W.E.B. Du Bois, Frantz Fanon, Paolo Friere, and Jean Anyon. Parris writes that such a syncretic, theoretical approach will not only reveal these thinkers' prescient epistemological vision, it will also disclose the pluralizing potentialities of creolization in the aforementioned fields, the humanities, and public education more generally.

AB  - Prioritizing vocabulary for instruction is central to English for academic purposes (EAP) research. Several word lists have been created to serve different needs, with many of them being restricted to a basic classification as general, academic, and technical words. Although discipline-specific vocabulary lists are useful for particular disciplines at one end of a continuum, and more general, common core vocabulary lists are useful for a range of disciplines at the other end, this study identified multidisciplinary words that lie in the middle and could be used by disciplines at either end of the continuum. The study identified important words in corpora of research articles collected from six disciplines with regard to common disciplinary domains in the hard and soft sciences. The target words of six disciplines were compared and examined with regard to whether they occurred in only one or many disciplines. With consideration for variability of word use across disciplines in the same disciplinary domain, words in hard sciences showed higher variability than others. The findings are discussed in terms of academic word identification, selection, and use in EAP classes.

AB  - The interface of art and science provides a broad range of educational and collaborative projects at various learning stages. Therefore, the use of historic artists' materials for teaching chemistry is receiving more attention. We prepared and used copper acetate (verdigris pigment) for a series of interconnected, lab-based activities, which can be applied to high-school-level chemistry, to undergraduate general chemistry, and further to heritage conservation science research for emerging art conservators. The synthesis and degradation processes of artists' materials like this pigment allow instructors to illustrate scientific concepts like redox chemistry, while extending the vision of science to arenas beyond the classroom.

AB  - Contribution: A novel multidisciplinary undergraduate course on alternative energy (AE) engineering that addresses gaps in current AE education, provides hands on skills, and matches topical coverage with societal needs. Background: Resource depletion and emissions associated with burning fossil fuels have led to growing worldwide interest in electricity production from non-fossil fuel, or alternative, energy sources. Recently there has been rapid growth of AE sources such as wind and solar photovoltaics. Societal and economic factors contribute to this continuing trend. Recent research has shown the urgent need for structured AE course curricula; engineering education in this multidisciplinary field is essential to support continued growth in this field. Intended Outcomes: A new approach to AE engineering education at the undergraduate level. Specifically, a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach that fills identified gaps in AE education. Application Design: The design of the course includes lectures, laboratories, and a hybrid power system design project focusing on economic integration of AE in power systems. Topics include principles of energy conversion, energy storage, and integration of solar thermal, solar photovoltaic, wind, hydroelectric and fuel cell AE sources into power systems. Societal needs are addressed through focus on industry structure, technology, economics and policies pertaining to AE. Findings: Learning outcome assessment demonstrate the validity of the proposed course for multidisciplinary alternative energy engineering education.

AB  - In Latvia, a new curriculum is introduced to provide the opportunity to acquire skills in multidisciplinary context. To achieve that, schools need to implement projects. In this paper, one example of a multidisciplinary project where fieldwork is involved is described. The aim of the research was to create support materials for teachers and students based on practice to experience multidisciplinary fieldwork to develop competencies. In the end, thirteen different support materials for teachers and students were piloted. [For the full proceedings, see ED619611.]

AB  - Peer review exercises are an essential part of many educational pedagogy models and have been shown to successfully provide undergraduate students with requisite active learning and critical reflection skills. Teaching the peer review process in an interdisciplinary honors research methods course, however, presents its own set of challenges. As students are exposed to new processes of editorial review, they are also tasked with evaluating material across subjects and discipline areas, making subjective components of editing more difficult. Authors describe a scaffolded model of peer review piloted in an interdisciplinary, upper-level honors research methods and ethics course and provide qualitative analyses of student reflections and assignment attributes to demonstrate the model's potential for student success. By presenting the peer review exercises as a series of sections that build incrementally in complexity and subjectivity (scaffolding) and dedicating class time for implementing peer-directed edits, authors provide an adaptable model that further strengthens research editing practices in honors education.

AB  - This article presents a project, Shapes of Water, funded by the Finnish Cultural Foundation, which gave music education students the opportunity to compose children's songs about climate change with the help of artists from two fields (contemporary circus and music) and a scientist (chemistry). The article outlines the ways in which the composing project challenged students' attitudes toward composing as a method for educating children about climate change, and brings together the experiences of the artists and scientist during the project. Finally, three focus areas are presented with recommendations for a sustainable eco-socially oriented approach to music education.

AB  - The main goal of this article is to explain the transdisciplinary training model developed at the National University of Education (UNAE) in Ecuador, based on the ancestral worldviews of "Buen Vivir" (Good Living). "Good Living" is a philosophical and political concept of the Kichwa indigenous peoples in the Andean Region, where human beings are interconnected with planet Earth and the whole cosmos. In 2008, Ecuador became the first country in the world to recognize the Rights of Nature in its Constitution, in order to face climate change and to restore the ecological footprint. This article first unifies scientific knowledge with ancestral wisdom, creating an inter-epistemological dialogue using a transdisciplinary approach. Second, the article explores the epistemological notions of transdisciplinary education: self-training, hetero-training, eco-training, and onto-training. Third, the article argues that as a result, Educational Sciences of Good Living emerged to (re)design regenerative cultures that face socio-ecological challenges of the Anthropocene age. In sum, the article argues that training transdisciplinary educators implies an intercultural, decolonial, and biocentric approach that promotes their inner spiritual self-awareness, among other perceptive, affective, emotional, rhetorical, poetic, epistemic, creative, artistic, cognitive, and philosophical dimensions.

AB  - In this review of research, we offer a meta-analysis of young children's learning and development within and across psychology, education, and linguistics. Engaging with Soja's concept of "Thirdspace," we mapped young children's learning and development transdisciplinarily, seeking to (re)conceptualize early childhood teaching in ways that are answerable to intersectionally minoritized children, families, and communities of color--those whose voices, values, perspectives, and knowledges have been historically and continue to be contemporarily marginalized. To do so, we identified seven principles with the potential to transform early childhood teaching practice. We posit that together these principles can shift the architecture of early childhood teaching, offering promising possibilities for fostering equity by allowing us to move toward emancipatory praxis and negotiate practical solutions to education's long history of inequities and oppressions.

AB  - This chapter argues for a research gaze that de-centres talk and attends to the body. It situates my reflections on methodological innovation and transdisciplinary collaboration in the context of studying the body and its meaning making capacities at the intersection of the social sciences and the arts. With a focus on the body as it is digitally mediated, the chapter draws on exploratory work within the MIDAS project, to discuss how social science methods might be brought into conversation with art and design based methods. It shows the potential of working at this intersection to generate novel themes and ideas for researching the digital body. I introduce three of these thematic synergies and reflect on how these could be mobilised by social research to interrogate and re-imagine the digital body: Fragmenting and zoning the body, Physical-digital trajectories of the body, and Engaging with the sensory material body. These themes are not exhaustive; rather I am using them to illustrate the indicative potential of an interdisciplinary approach to foster social science imagination and to move beyond the silences left by standard social science methods towards engaging with a creative potential for social science methodological innovation.

AB  - Higher education institutions (HEIs) are drivers of social change embedded in a society which is experiencing increasingly complex and multifaceted crises. This is partly attributable to the use of conventional and deterministic problem-solving curricula. A combination of a transdisciplinary approach and indigenous knowledge (IK) as transformative tools in complex systems is critical for pedagogy. This interface embraces the African heritage in Western epistemology putting it on a curricula pedestal which is currently Western-oriented. This article shows how a transdisciplinary approach and IK can transform pedagogies in HEIs through mutual learning and dialogue across disciplines by reflecting on the Life Knowledge Action/Grounding Programme which is a course offered at the University of Fort Hare, South Africa. The article suggests an integration of transdisciplinarity and IK as powerful catalysts for transformation in pedagogical design.

AB  - This study developed and validated an assessment that measures interdisciplinary understanding using the topic of carbon cycling, the Interdisciplinary Science Assessment for Carbon Cycling (ISACC). This work was motivated by the need to assess interdisciplinary understanding, defined as the ability to solve problems requiring knowledge and skills from multiple disciplines. Levels of a construct map for interdisciplinary understanding were generated and refined in the construct-modeling design process (Wilson 2005). Key concepts in carbon cycling to be assessed were determined based on experts' concept maps and analysis of the Next Generation Science Standards. The final version of the ISACC includes 11 multiple-choice (MC) items and eight constructed-response (CR) items covering nine key concepts. Of these 19 items, six are single-disciplinary items and 13 are interdisciplinary items. Four hundred fifty-four students in grades 9-16 were recruited and administered the ISACC. For the CR items, scoring rubrics were developed and used by a group of evaluators to code student responses. Two item response theory models, a two-parameter logistic model and a generalized partial credit model, provided evidence of the construct validity of the items. All items reflected unidimensionality and local independence and showed moderate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.782). All except one were a good fit to the models. The findings suggest that the ISACC is a promising tool to assess interdisciplinary understanding of carbon cycling. Future directions include research into test fairness across gender and ethnic/racial groups and further development to cover typical high school students' knowledge more thoroughly.

AB  - A call for educational reform motivated this school system to devise an enhanced version of STEM in their middle school. This case provides rich descriptions of how eighth grade middle school teachers, from multiple disciplines, enacted a STEAM team model that integrated Language Arts into STEM. These STEAM team teachers were systematically studied during field observations of 100+ class sessions using what they referred to as "transdisciplinary co-teaching," flexible scheduling, and multiple types of physical spaces to further engage students. Different dimensions of co-teaching were observed. The most frequently observed was "reconstructed," followed by "predisciplinary," "correlated," and "shared." Types of instruction other than "reconstructed," did not fit the school's proposed definitions of "transdisciplinary co-teaching." Thoughts are shared on lessons learned.

AB  - We present an investigation into the interdisciplinary role of physics in a physics-for-nonphysicists course at Pomona College. This work is guided by prior research into introductory physics for life science (IPLS) courses, but attends to significant differences in the scope and context of this course. We interviewed enrolled students, physics professors, and professors from nonphysics disciplines to explore the function of this course and the role of physics in the education of nonphysics science students. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed, then analyzed to identify emergent themes. These themes outline the authentic physics, including content knowledge and other, broader learning objectives, that play an important and distinct role in the science education of enrolled students. Stakeholders generally align in their emphasis of interdisciplinary relevance with some divergence in the specific articulation of that idea. The differences can be understood through the stakeholders' distinct areas of expertise, with nonphysics professors expressing value through relevance to their discipline and physics professors focusing on essential aspects of physics.

AB  - To prepare students to integrate diverse perspectives, colleges nationwide offer a wide range of interdisciplinary learning experiences. Within this educational context, students often need more than exposure to multiple perspectives in order to integrate ideas across disciplines. They benefit from instruction that scaffolds their efforts to integrate ideas. Yet, even faculty may find it difficult to identify the points of integration between disciplines that are rarely put in discussion with one another. In this Quick Fix article, we suggest that annotating a common text can help faculty uncover core concepts that bridge their respective disciplines. We describe the ways in which this preparation strategy informed an undergraduate-level interdisciplinary experience with students in microbiology and history courses.

AB  - This article describes how intra- and interdisciplinary learning experiences can activate the interests and capabilities among children in their early years. A developmental sequence delineates a series of stage-by-stage experiences describing the skill and content to be introduced and mastered in the teaching and learning process, which include developing readiness and receptivity, intradisciplinary thinking and learning, and interdisciplinary thinking and learning. The recognized differences among learners, the qualities inherent in providing advanced learning skills and concepts, and the development and reinforcement of basic and fundamental skills provides a readiness for more sophisticated learning in the early years. The importance of promoting understanding and facilitating the display of interests and capabilities among children in the early years can be activated by intra- and interdisciplinary learning experiences.

AB  - This practitioner research study examined the potential of arts education to support students' growth towards global citizenship including awareness, care, and understanding of--as well as active and responsible engagement in--current global challenges and social issues. We utilized research material generated during an interdisciplinary arts pedagogy course offered in subject teacher education at the University of the Arts Helsinki and Aalto University (Finland). During the course, students created teaching sessions in peer groups in which they explored pedagogical methods to enhance global citizenship through interdisciplinary arts education participation. In the study, we identified themes addressed in the teaching sessions: "Renegotiating (cultural) identity," "Facing otherness," "Experiencing empathy," "Coping with power and inequality," "Awakening to ecological responsibility," and "Engaging in critical and reflective thinking." Furthermore, we examined how arts education resonated with the aims of global education and discussed the many ways that arts education could support the cultivation of responsiveness and ethical awareness to advance transformative global citizenship.

AB  - Academics are challenged to shift from traditional lecture models to accommodate rising student expectations, digital delivery platforms, and inclusive evidence-based classroom practices. As a solution, co-teaching can add value to undergraduate students' and faculty's learning and problem-solving skills. We investigated effective co-teaching practices in higher education and its impact on students' learning outcomes. We analyzed co-teachers', teaching assistants', and students' interview and focus group data and an external evaluator's assessment of co-teaching classroom dynamics using thematic analysis; surveys on what co-teachers learned from teaching together; and students' self-reported learning assessments with co-teaching using descriptive analysis in two undergraduate Introduction to Public Health and Health Policy courses. Co-teachers learned from one another in teaching styles, troubleshooting, collegiality, and shared goals to improve students' learning outcomes. Given our limited student sample, students appreciated different co-teacher's perspectives, more resources and instructor help, despite not always receiving a balanced biomedical perspective.

AB  - We are living through a very difficult moment in human history where we are having to make almost daily decisions about our health, occupations, environment, economics, and democracy, while being bombarded with disinformation, misinformation, and "alternative facts" relative to those decisions. A highly developed information literacy capacity is a means to critically analyze all incoming information and make sound decisions for ourselves, our families, our communities, and our world (ACRL, 2000). Allen Repko and Rick Szostak's (2021) "Interdisciplinary Research: Process and Theory" aids in building this information literacy capacity in undergraduate interdisciplinary students through its examination of the disciplines students have been studying, while explaining to them the central components of interdisciplinary inquiry. It helps students understand the unique languages of disciplines, unpacks the limitations of individual disciplines in confronting complex, real-world issues, and then aids them in developing the tools and understanding the constructs they need to function as interdisciplinarians. This article will thoroughly explain the concept of information literacy and its value to interdisciplinary learners and demonstrate how "Interdisciplinary Research" can be used to foster student development of this skill. The article will conclude by discussing one specific assignment that engages "Interdisciplinary Research" to begin the process of building information literacy in undergraduate interdisciplinary students so that they may better understand the academic degree they are pursuing and set them on a pathway to apply their course of study in both their careers and the complex, real-world issues they will encounter in their ongoing lives.

AB  - Interdisciplinary learning does not just happen. One of the great challenges facing interdisciplinary programs is figuring out how to gain collective clarity around program identity (values, principles, and purpose) and make connections between mission-based curricular and co-curricular activities that support interdisciplinary learning for students. The EdD in Interdisciplinary Leadership Program at Creighton University has worked to develop a strategy for strengthening the role of interdisciplinarity both within and beyond the EdD program by establishing a local chapter of the Interdisciplinary Honor Society founded by the Association of Interdisciplinary Studies, Alpha Iota Sigma. This article focuses on the first steps of creating the chapter, as we document the process of making connections between the EdD program and the honor society, including a discussion of the findings from a quality improvement survey completed by some of the first honor society members on how the inaugural year of our membership in the organization helped support their interdisciplinary learning. The objective of this article is to aid interdisciplinary educators in enhancing the life-long interdisciplinary endeavor of their students and alumni by reviewing the scholarship on program identity and co-curricular offerings and by demonstrating the value of specific practices (such as joining the AIS Honor Society as we at Creighton did) that explicitly engage students in interdisciplinary learning outside the classroom.

AB  - The Interdisciplinary Social Media Fellowship is a two-semester program in which students gain internship credit by learning about social media marketing through a client-based experiential learning program. A faculty member created and ran a program in which five students from multiple disciplines followed a framework that defined their roles and processes to ensure interdisciplinary learning and successful social media practice. Students engaged with internal and external stakeholders to learn from various perspectives. The program created a win-win situation for the university and the students: students benefited through experiential and interdisciplinary learning, while the university produced engaging content relevant to various stakeholders.

AB  - An interdisciplinary Pop-Up Learning Community (PLC) allowed students from various disciplines with different levels of content knowledge to discuss their perspectives on and beliefs about climate change. The impact of this event on students' climate change beliefs was gauged by a survey from the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. This survey, the Six Americas Super Short Survey, consists of four questions relating to climate change belief. During the event, students participated in various activities, including faculty modeling of discussions about climate change using and highlighting their disciplinary perspectives and analysis skills, communications exercises, interdisciplinary table discussions, and writing in response to a social media message. After the conclusion of the event, students submitted reflections on their experiences at the PLC, which supplemented data collected during the event. Students gained an understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of climate change discussions and applied general education skills and knowledge to spoken and written conversations about climate change.

AB  - Purpose: This study examines the impact of participation in a STEM Enrichment Summer Bridge Program, funded by the NSF Houston-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, on undergraduate student success outcomes, particularly for under-represented students. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses propensity score matching and logistic regression analysis to examine the effects of participation in the STEM enrichment program on graduation and retention in STEM after matching on baseline socio-demographic and pre-college characteristics. Findings: The analysis found that program participation had a significant effect on increasing both the graduation rates and retention of under-represented minority students in STEM fields. In addition, results indicated that program participation had a particularly strong impact for Pell-eligible students in terms of course grades. Research limitations/implications: Data obtained for this study were limited to a single Hispanic-serving/Asian-serving institution, and therefore are not necessarily representative of the graduation and retention trends of the larger population of underrepresented minority (URM) students across the nation. Originality/value: This study uniquely adds to the existing body of literature surrounding the retention of URM students in STEM fields by accounting for baseline variables, such as pre-college academic achievement and socio-demographic characteristics, that could lead to bias in estimating results. Specifically, this study addresses limitations of previous studies by comparing participants and non-participants of the STEM enrichment program who are matched on a selection of baseline characteristics.

AB  - This paper reflects upon the mechanisms that enable development of curricular approaches to multidisciplinary architecture/engineering higher education. Building upon recent calls for integrated multidisciplinary building design practice, academics at UCL, industry partners and respective professional bodies embarked upon developing a new course that challenged disciplinary boundaries and defined the needs of a new design professional. Whilst there have been attempts internationally to better integrate architecture as well as engineering education, efforts have largely been focused on bolt-on solutions based on pre-existing education programmes. In addition, there has been little discussion (empirical or theoretical) on practical measures associated with developing multidisciplinary education in the built environment. Drawing on mixed data including documentary evidence, semi structured interviews and observations, the study begins to shed light on the approaches underpinning the development of a multidisciplinary built environment MEng course at UCL that integrates architecture, building services and civil engineering. The paper's contribution is threefold. First, the findings have implications for developing multidisciplinary built environment education curricula, through revealing key mechanisms including the need for shared attitudes and expectations. Second, the paper highlights the conditions that enable the negotiation of multidisciplinary curricula including institutional support, shared values and a collective need and willingness to explore new solutions. Third, the paper reflects upon the value of design studio learning as a critical integrative component to the delivery of multidisciplinary education in the built environment and STEM more widely.

AB  - Writing studies and writing center scholars have recently focused much- needed attention on how graduate student writers are taught, mentored, and supported. This scholarship also points to a persistent and stubborn conundrum: Graduate students must write their way into disciplinary belonging, yet most advisors lack a language for, or even awareness of, the specialized practices and tacit expectations shaping written discourse in their fields. While graduate student-serving writing centers help fill this writing-support gap, a reliance on English and humanities graduate students for staff reproduces a status quo in which the genre awareness and rhetorical vocabulary needed to mentor advanced academic writers are neither widely distributed nor recognized and valued. This essay offers the counter example of a graduate writing center whose consultants hail primarily from master's and doctoral programs in the sciences and social sciences. Using feminist social reproduction theory to examine this case study of one graduate writing center, the authors explore how multidisciplinary staffing resists the enclaving of writing process and rhetorical knowledge and points to a future in which the responsibility for mentoring graduate student writers is visible, valued, and shared.

AB  - This article is focused on the effectiveness of an innovative research-based learning model that employs chemistry-based research projects in developing high school students' research competency and attitudes. The chemistry-based research projects were carried out as a part of an informal program, in real-world laboratories on 330 high school students from 2010 to 2020 integrating different branches of chemistry, including physical, organic, inorganic, electrochemistry, and biochemistry, in addition to other science and engineering areas. The chemistry subjects harmonize with many science and engineering disciplines, thus providing an immense research scope in various multidisciplinary topics. The data were collected using a mixed method by performing an indirect assessment on the program effectiveness, conducting surveys on students, research assistants, and the research faculty mentors involved in the program. The program was primarily successful in developing students' research self-efficacy and fostering their research competencies in multidisciplinary science. Further research targets to analyze the long-term effect of the multidisciplinary research experiences on their attitudes toward higher education and research-oriented careers that can contribute to a knowledge-based economy.

AB  - Novel biomaterial development is a rapidly growing field that is crucial because biomaterial fouling, due to rapid and irreversible protein adsorption, leads to cellular responses and potentially detrimental consequences such as surface thrombosis, biofilm formation, or inflammation. Therefore, biomaterial technology's fundamentals, like material biocompatibility, are critical in undergraduate education. Exposing undergraduate students to biomaterials and biomedical engineering through interdisciplinary experiments allows them to integrate knowledge from different fields to analyze multidisciplinary results. In this practical laboratory experiment, undergraduate students will characterize surface properties (contact and sliding angle measurements) for the antifouling polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer using a goniometer and a smartphone, as well as quantify protein adsorption on antifouling surfaces via a colorimetric assay kit to develop their understanding of antifouling surface characteristics, UV-vis spectroscopy, and colorimetric assays. The antifouling PDMS polymer is prepared by silicone oil infusion and compared to untreated control PDMS. The polymer hydrophobicity was demonstrated by static water contact angles of ~99° and 102° for control and antifouling PDMS surfaces, respectively. The control PDMS sliding angle (>90°) was significantly reduced to 9° after antifouling preparation. After 24 h incubation of polymer samples in a 200 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution, the surface adsorbed BSA was quantified using a colorimetric assay. The adsorbed protein on the fouling PDMS controls (29.1 ± 7.0 [microgram]/cm[superscript 2]) was reduced by ~79% on the antifouling PDMS surface (6.2 ± 0.9 [microgram]/cm[superscript 2]). Students will gain experience in materials science, biomedical engineering, chemistry, and biology concepts and better understand the influence of material properties on biological responses for biomaterial interfaces.

AB  - It would be safe to say that nearly every student enrolled in college knows someone who has been impacted by cancer. After all, cancer killed nearly 8.2 million people worldwide in 2012 (International Agency for Research on Cancer, 2014). Using this fact as the impetus for change, we decided to make cancer the focus of a "transdisciplinary" (Marshall, 2014) collaborative effort to simulate a reciprocal-learning experience between undergraduate biology and visual art students attending a university in Southeastern Michigan. The goal of the 2015 project was to create an active and authentic collaboration utilizing the university visual arts and biology curricula. By engaging and connecting scientific and artistic critical thinking processes, we wanted to know: could we design a class structure that would enable collaborative teams of art and biology students to create a visual model that represents a hallmark of cancer designed so that the model could also stand alone on artistic merit? In other words, could cancer visualization be transformed into works worthy of gallery display while maintaining scientific accuracy? In this paper we discuss the planning, implementation, results, and impact this work has had upon the way we now envision transdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - Though the number of interdisciplinary undergraduate programs has increased rapidly over the past several decades, little empirical research has characterized such programs. In this article we report on our investigation of the characteristics of interdisciplinary programs and develop typologies to describe the multiple ways in which such programs are structured with respect to curricular and organizational features. Using cluster analysis, we show differences in both curricular structures and organizational features across programs, irrespective of the program's content focus. This typology will guide future research to explore differences in student learning outcomes across the interdisciplinary program types.

AB  - While scholars have found that undergraduate involvement in research is beneficial, the lack of such experiences in the social sciences and humanities is glaring. This paper analyzes how an emphasis on community through cohort models impacts undergraduate student experience in research, taking from the Emerging Scholars Program, an interdisciplinary research program where cohorts of undergraduates are matched with faculty and attend meetings, workshops, and presentations together. We find that the cohort model created a robust community that fosters positive relationships that develop professional skills and emotional support, allowing students to collaborate and aim more toward their professional goals. The results from this study offer valuable insights into how universities can ensure that students have meaningful research experience beyond the classroom.

AB  - STEM experiences that capture students' curiosity have a unique role in inspiring awe in science, enculturing science engagement, and recruiting students to pursue STEM careers. Here, we present a unique interdisciplinary STEM experience for elementary school students that teaches them to write computer code to test primate intelligence at a zoo where they test their code with real monkeys. In a pilot study involving 3rd to 6th grade students, we find that students can acquire "hard skills" in computational thinking during this short-term immersive STEM experience, with a significant increase in accuracy and problem-solving attempts at post-test. Furthermore, students' interests in animal science, computers, and robots remain stable or even increase following this experience, demonstrating the project's capacity to blend technical skills with authentic scientific exploration. Teachers' feedback highlights the positive impact on critical thinking and leadership. This research underscores the potential of free-form, authentic, interdisciplinary STEM experiences to simultaneously nurture computational skills and a passion for science.

AB  - In the context of rapidly evolving educational landscapes, enhancing the interdisciplinary competence of primary and secondary school teachers is essential to effectively address emerging pedagogical challenges. This paper aimed to map new trends and the possibility of interdisciplinary competence of primary and secondary school teachers. For this purpose, a systematic review was conducted. The resulting sample was further selected according to PRISMA guidelines, with screening and eligibility process conducted based on the inclusion criteria defined concerning the research objective. This research consisted 20 studies. The findings revealed a growing interest in this field from 2019-2023. Furthermore, the research methods were mainly qualitative research, followed by mixed research. Interdisciplinary competence of primary and secondary school teachers mainly consists of pedagogical knowledge of the relevant disciplines (PCK), pedagogical skills, communication and cooperation skills, teachers' non-cognitive factors. The strategies for cultivating teachers' interdisciplinary competence included professional teacher development programs, teacher cooperation models, teacher community operation, administrative support, and flexible management. Future research can focus on administrative reform, cooperation models, cognitive differences among teachers from various disciplines, the relationship between interdisciplinary competence and non-cognitive factors, as well as the construction of interdisciplinary learning platforms.

AB  - Despite the increasing recognition for the scientific and societal potential of interdisciplinary research, selection committees struggle with the evaluation of interdisciplinary proposals. Interdisciplinary proposals include a wider range of theories and methods, involve a more diverse team, pose a higher level of uncertainty, and their evaluation requires expertise from multiple disciplines. In this study, we investigate the possibility to support the evaluation of interdisciplinary research proposals with measures of interdisciplinary research quality. Based on the literature, we curated a set of qualitative criteria and bibliometric indicators. Subsequently, we examined their feasibility using interviews with interdisciplinary researchers and a re-assessment session of a grant-allocation procedure. In the re-assessment session members of an original evaluation panel assessed four original research proposals again, but now supported with our measures. This study confirmed the potential of qualitative criteria to assess the interdisciplinarity or research proposals. These indicators helped to make explicit what different people mean with interdisciplinary research, which improved the quality of the discussions and decision-making. The utility of bibliometric indicators turned out to be limited, due to technical limitations and concerns about unintended side effects.

AB  - There is an increasing interest in the integration of computational thinking (CT) in the K-12 curriculum. By integrating CT into other disciplines, the aim is to equip students with essential skills to navigate domain-specific challenges. This study conducts a systematic review of 108 peer-reviewed scientific papers to analyze in which K-12 subjects CT is being integrated, learning objectives, CT integration levels, instructional strategies, technologies and tools employed, assessment strategies, research designs and educational stages of participants. The findings reveal that: (a) over two-thirds of the CT integration studies predominantly focus on science and mathematics; (b) the majority of the studies implement CT at the substitution level rather than achieving a transformation impact; (c) active learning is a commonly mentioned instructional strategy, with block-based languages and physical devices being frequently utilized tools; (d) in terms of assessment, the emphasis primarily lies in evaluating attitudes towards technology or the learning context, rather than developing valid and reliable assessment instruments. These findings shed light on the current state of CT integration in K-12 education. The identified trends provide valuable insights for educators, curriculum designers, and policymakers seeking to effectively incorporate CT across various disciplines in a manner that fosters meaningful skill development with an interdisciplinary approach. By leveraging these insights, we can strive to enhance CT integration efforts, ensuring the holistic development of students' computational thinking abilities and promoting their preparedness for the increasingly interdisciplinary domains of digital world.

AB  - REDEVELOP is a graduate student training program funded by the NSERC-CREATE grant, starting in 2017. Its goal is to support the training of new professionals and researchers (> 100) who will be the next generation of science and engineering leaders and policymakers in Canada. The program has successfully developed a framework for operating almost completely virtually, well ahead of the world's transition to online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our psychology lab, The Individual and Team Performance (ITP) lab, has dedicated over a decade to researching and designing tools that enhance specific training and skill growth necessary for effective remote teamwork. In partnership with the REDEVELOP program, we support students in navigating the unique interpersonal and collaboration challenges posed by virtual team environments. We will discuss how a complex and multidisciplinary program succeeds in training graduate students to become stronger academics, practitioners, and communicators of knowledge.

AB  - For English as a foreign language (EFL) graduate students in STEM, with the need to publish in an international journal comes the double burden of developing general English language skills and discipline-specific writing skills. To help these students effectively, discipline-specific scientific writing (SW) instruction is necessary but has been scarce in Asian contexts. This study investigates how discipline-specific SW courses were developed for graduate students at a Korean science and engineering university, if the courses were successfully implemented, and what could be done to improve the offering of such courses. The study uses a mixed methods research design, informed by the research paradigm of pragmatism. The dataset used in the present study includes interviews, questionnaire surveys, and performance measurement. Interviews were conducted with six language and five content professors and nine teaching assistants, and 42 students involved in the development and offering of the SW courses. A purposive sampling approach was used in selecting interviewees. In addition, two types of questionnaire surveys were conducted among the students who had taken the courses: 225 participated in the university survey and 312 in the program survey. In addition, a pretest and posttest were given to measure students' improvement in their SW performances. For data analysis, text analysis and descriptive statistics were used. The results show that the courses were well received by all those involved. Students expressed appreciation for their instructor's individual attention and feedback on their writing. Moreover, students' posttest scores showed substantial improvement. On the other hand, the study raises such issues as difficulties in collaboration between the language and content professors and the need to enhance the course's relevance to students' major fields. The study concludes by offering suggestions on how to improve the interdisciplinary aspect of SW courses for STEM students and by providing a recommended model of interdisciplinary collaboration among language and content professors and teaching assistants.

AB  - International student mobility (ISM) has received much attention in the literature on international migration. However, most of the studies assume that investment in skills and knowledge by international students is guided by economic motivations only. Importantly, with an increase in the proportion of international student mobility in total mobility, students' motivations have become more complex. Different theoretical approaches across disciplines have been logically extended to study the mobility motivations of international students. Most of the existing approaches do not emphasize the noneconomic aspects of motivation and thus do not provide a holistic understanding of ISM. This paper proposes an augmented human capital framework that incorporates the noneconomic motivations of international students through the inclusion of psychic gains and the acquired stocks of personal and social capital.

AB  - This article describes and illustrates a physics course for first-year college students whose only knowledge of physics is that they do not like the subject. The physics content is driven entirely by what appears in the daily newspapers and generally covers most physics topics in a semester. This course was structured as a learning community that combined English and physics in a single 6-credit course. Most of the writing assignments were about physics. A semester-long overview is shared, as is the instructional model for Newspaper Physics. We also provide three examples of how this model is used. Findings indicate that students gained higher physics content knowledge, higher-order thinking skills, greater confidence in seeking help and understanding science, and more opportunities to work with peers outside of class. This study contributes community-based interdisciplinary teaching and learning strategies.

AB  - Interdisciplinary programs of study, especially within psychology, offer many benefits including addressing diverse student interests while encouraging the growth of skills, perspectives, and experiences in collaboration that would otherwise be impossible. A health psychology emphasis was created within the psychology major as an interdisciplinary program combining psychology, nutrition, biology, and health science courses. The effectiveness of this emphasis was evaluated in terms of student numbers and characteristics along with job and graduate school placements. Data were collected from three sources: descriptive information for all enrolled students, self-report data from students currently enrolled, and from student graduates. Emphasis growth was dramatic over 9 trimesters (180 to 438, +143.33%) with great diversity in student demographics and desired career paths. Graduates had high satisfaction (M=8.28, max 10), a majority (68%) were employed in diverse jobs, and 68% of those who applied were accepted into a variety of graduate school programs. The consistent diversity of student interests, vocations and graduate programs supports the interdisciplinary health psychology emphasis as an effective means of providing an interdisciplinary education. The health psychology emphasis provides a framework for other interdisciplinary programs of study in psychology and other fields.

AB  - Short metacognitive prompts--like "minute papers"--are simple enough to be widely adopted by instructors. But do they work? We investigate how they affect college students' performance in quantitative (Physics) and qualitative (Psychology) courses, comparing classes which received metacognitive prompts to those that did not. We find significant improvement in performance in Psychology and borderline significant improvement in Physics. While the interventions did not raise students' confidence, interviews with students revealed that the prompts helped them process course material and study for exams. This is one of few studies to directly compare the effectiveness of metacognitive prompts across disciplines.

AB  - In interdisciplinary Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education, empirical evidence is required that points to the educational contribution of mathematics. Specifically, researchers are not clear how mathematics weaves itself through the STEM education meta-discourse. This article contributes to pedagogical practices in educational institutions where STEM has been newly introduced - What are the perceptions and experiences of South African teachers on interdisciplinary STEM education, and how do mathematics and interdisciplinary STEM discourses leverage each other at schools of specialisation (SoS) in South Africa? Participant teachers were drawn from ten SoS in South Africa. SoS are STEM-dense schools in South Africa's Gauteng Province, the country's industrial and commercial hub. Interview data was collected on teachers' experiences and practices to explore the affordances of Mathematics and other STEM disciplines to influencing curriculum advancement. Situated cognition, mathematics as explorations and flow theory informed this qualitative study. In the findings, technology was regarded as raising learner motivation and mathematical achievement. Important to the study is that participants have a high regard for mathematics' role in interdisciplinary STEM education. In the study, teachers had no autonomy to pursue the STEM agenda, as they were bound to adhere to a prescribed curriculum, which hardly refers to implementation of interdisciplinary STEM education. Various recommendations are proffered, such as maintaining the positive perceptions participants have on the role of mathematics in STEM curricula. The research calls for equality and equity of all the STEM disciplines, as one STEM curricula cannot succeed without the other.

AB  - This special issue introduces recent research on mathematics in interdisciplinary STEM education. STEM education is widely promoted by governments around the world as a way of boosting students' interest and achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and preparing STEM-qualified workers for twenty-first century careers. However, the role of mathematics in STEM education often appears to be marginal, and we do not understand well enough how mathematics contributes to STEM-based problem-solving or how STEM education experiences enhance students' learning of mathematics. In this survey paper, we present a narrative review of empirical and conceptual research literature, published between 2017 and 2022. These literature sources are organised by a framework comprising five thematic clusters: (1) interdisciplinary curriculum models and approaches; (2) student outcomes and experiences; (3) teacher preparation and professional development; (4) classroom implementation and task design; and (5) policy, structures, and leadership. We use the framework to provide an overview of the papers in this issue and to propose directions for future research. These include: investigating methods and rationales for connecting the constituent STEM disciplines so as to preserve the disciplinary integrity of mathematics; clarifying what is meant by student "success" in interdisciplinary STEM programs, projects, and other educational approaches; moving beyond classroom practices that position mathematics as just a tool for solving problems in other disciplines; understanding what makes a STEM task mathematically rich; and asking how STEM education research can productively shape STEM education policy.

AB  - This study examines the efficacy of a novel college sustainability course in promoting relevant environmental knowledge and interest in careers related to environmental aspects within the Taiwanese educational context. The core content of the course covers the essential concepts of sustainability and introduces students to environmental issues and their interrelation with the nexus of food, energy, and water, as well as related economic and social issues. This action competencefocused course was designed to allow students to develop their understanding of sustainability through a combination of engaging lectures, novel group activities, case studies, exercises, and team projects. The sample consisted of 44 Taiwanese undergraduate and graduate students majoring in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Participants' interest in STEM careers and perceived knowledge were measured by a pre-test and post-test administered before and after the program, respectively. Analyses of variance, correlation analyses, and cross-lagged panel regression analyses were conducted to test four hypotheses. Results of repeated-measure analysis of covariance indicated that knowledge increased significantly from pre-test to post-test, but not career interest. Results of a cross-lagged panel regression analysis also indicated that pre-test knowledge was a significant positive predictor of post-test career interest. By creating an engaging class atmosphere and promoting experiential self-learning activities, this course was highly effective in enhancing students' knowledge of key sustainability aspects. Implications for interest development theory and sustainability pedagogy are also discussed.

AB  - It is crucial for engineers to anticipate the socio-ethical impacts of emerging technologies. Such acts of anticipation are thoroughly normative and should be cultivated in engineering ethics education. In this paper we ask: 'how do we anticipate the socio-ethical implications of emerging technologies responsibly?' And 'how can such responsible anticipation be taught?' We offer a conceptual answer, building upon the framework of Responsible Innovation and its four core practices: anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion, and responsiveness. We forge a more explicit link between the practices of anticipation, reflexivity, and inclusion, while also enriching them with insights from disability studies, STS, design theory, and philosophy. On this basis we present responsible anticipation as an activity of reflective problem framing grounded in epistemic humility. Via the RI-practice of responsiveness we present responsible anticipation as a creative approach to engineering ethics, offering engineering students a critical yet productive perspective on how ethics may inform innovation.

AB  - We explore the feasibility of surgical video combined with a multidisciplinary treatment (MDT) integrated teaching method in the clinical teaching of thyroid surgery and its impact on medical students' autonomous learning ability. Eighty-four clinical interns who studied surgical work in our hospital were randomly divided into two groups with 42 in each group. Among them, the observation group was given surgical operation video combined with the MDT integrated teaching method; the control group was given the traditional conventional teaching method. The feasibility of the two teaching methods in the clinical teaching of thyroid surgery and their influence on students' autonomous learning ability were analyzed by means of questionnaires and examination tests. In terms of the examination results (including theoretical knowledge and practical results), the observation group was significantly better than the control group (P < 0.05). In terms of teaching evaluation (including the improvement in self-study ability, the cultivation of clinical thinking, the improvement in expression level, and the enhancement of teamwork spirit), the observation group was significantly better than that of the control group (P < 0.05). In terms of teaching satisfaction, the observation group was significantly better than that of the control group (P < 0.01). In conclusion, surgical operation video combined with the MDT integrated teaching method can effectively improve students' learning efficiency in the clinical teaching of thyroid surgery. At the same time, students' comprehensive abilities, such as autonomous learning ability, teamwork, and the ability to analyze and solve problems, have been improved.
