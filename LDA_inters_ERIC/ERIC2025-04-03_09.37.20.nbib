AB  - Santa Clara University's Robotic Systems Laboratory conducts an aggressive robotic development and operations program in which interdisciplinary teams of undergraduate students build and deploy a wide range of robotic systems, ranging from underwater vehicles to spacecraft. These year-long projects expose students to the breadth of and interdependence among engineering disciplines, the span of processes in a system development lifecycle, and the challenges of managing a development process. Over the past five years, this program has provided more than 150 students with exposure to computer science and engineering topics, including software engineering, algorithm development, human-computer interface design, and artificial intelligence. This program provides exciting and compelling educational opportunities for students, offers real-world applications that naturally motivate the need for specific computing technologies, and serves a broader research and development program that utilizes the functional robotic systems to support externally-funded science and technology demonstration missions. The experience of the authors, as well as formal program assessment data, show that this program provides strong student motivation for learning, offers comprehensive and valuable educational experiences, and enhances student performance. This article reviews the Santa Clara robotics program, highlights the role of computer science and engineering in several projects, and presents the assessment data showing the positive results of this program.

AB  - This article considers interdisciplinary approaches to education for sustainable development (ESD) in initial teacher training (ITT) partnerships in the light of recent national policy initiatives. In identifying challenges for interdisciplinary innovation, it brings to bear research evidence from three sources: questionnaires sent to ITT partnership schools; questionnaire surveys of geography and science graduate student teachers; and questionnaire surveys of their school mentors. Key findings are that: schools are not yet well developed as sites for student teacher learning in the domain; student teachers generally have greater understanding of sustainable development than their mentors; geography mentors perceive themselves to be better prepared for mentoring in this area than their science counterparts (who feel ill-prepared); for both students and mentors, there are significant gaps in understanding of ESD compared with representations found in the literature. Some implications and possible ways forward for interdisciplinary ESD in teacher education partnerships are discussed. (Contains 4 figures)

AB  - The folk songs and ballads of early America describe life as experienced by the common people. They were sung within the family, by neighbors and at gatherings of larger communities. The stories told were carried in the memories of those who heard them. Once a strictly aural and oral tradition, the words came to be written down, and the surviving lyrics deserve increased attention as historic documents. In this article, the author describes the course she developed for her students at Calhoun Honors College. The course, which explored "truth" in song, focused on aspects of American history, communication, and sociology represented in the tradition of folk songs and ballads. A sample course outline is presented.

AB  - This article describes an experiential learning activity designed to promote the development of decision-making skills in international management students at the undergraduate level. Students from an undergraduate management science course in decision analysis served as consultants on a case assigned to teams in an international management class. Communication between groups and consultants was facilitated by the use of an Internet-based Web conferencing system. Surveys completed by international management students indicated that the exercise enhanced their understanding of the role of quantitative analysis in an important business decision and increased their confidence in the group's final recommendation in the case.

AB  - There is increasing concern about the plight of under-privileged gifted and talented children. Insights from disciplines outside our field can inform educators of the gifted and talented about what hinders talent development among the deprived. A model synthesizing constructs from ethical philosophy, sociology, and education reveals socioeconomic barriers to aspiration development, capacity development, and self-fulfillment. Various hypothetical life trajectories on the model illustrate the influences of these barriers on long-range talent development toward self-fulfillment and either egoistic individualism or relational altruism. Implications for gifted education include the need for more ethical awareness in the field and more realistic appraisals of hindrances to aspiration formation among the deprived.

Here, we suggest an effective and economically feasible educational framework where the graduates from the Information Technology departments, fully proficient in data collection, processing and management besides system analysis skills, would continue their graduate/postgraduate education in such disciplines without wasting any time in completing the deficiency programs through the use of free-elective courses which are already available in their curricula.

AB  - The new Interdisciplinary Unified Curriculum Framework (2001), as declared by its name, is based on the 1997 Unified Curriculum Framework, but a new stress is placed on interdisciplinary approaches to teaching and learning. The general aim of education remains unaltered. However, it is heavily emphasized that, in this new curriculum, the growth of a student's knowledge is considered as a unified and undivided whole. In the new curriculum, interdisciplinary aims are added for all subjects, and teaching paradigms are created where common aims are targeted through the connection of subjects. The creators of the new curriculum suggest that a connection between subjects should be made wherever it is possible so that knowledge can be seen and received as a whole, not fragmented. The main aim of this new curriculum is to organize the teaching material in such a way that "internal cohesion" and "unified development of contents" are achieved. In every discipline, the creators urge, the basic concepts should be defined clearly and any points of connection between them should be stressed. According to the official document for the music curriculum for all levels of education, the general goal of music education is for students to build up a personal identity, cultivate creativity, and prepare for life. Music is considered a basic, autonomous subject. However, it is accepted that creating and understanding music is connected with the other arts, as well as other subjects. It is, therefore, especially important to understand clearly how each subject is being integrated, as well as the aims and objectives sought from such connections.

AB  - The rationale for the first-year seminar is to introduce freshmen to the university. The basic components of a first-year seminar are academic integrity, skill development, a sense of community, active and collaborative learning strategies, and technology. All freshmen must take a first-year seminar that consists primarily of freshmen, although upperclassmen may take the seminar depending on the course number. In this article, the authors present an interdisciplinary study of the SARS virus which provides opportunities for students in different disciplines to discuss the origin; spread; and global, economic, chemical, and biological aspects of the disease. Students benefit from these active discussions with each other and share their knowledge with others in a semester-end poster session. The authors conclude that teaching a first-year seminar on the SARS virus was exciting and enjoyable. Moreover, the academic and intellectual challenge of preparing to teach a new course is rewarded many times over by the sharing and learning that occurred with the students on a daily basis.

AB  - In this paper, the authors argue that chemical knowledge in the classroom will be enriched by the application of characterizations of models drawn from a range of disciplinary backgrounds. This discussion highlights two important issues relating to chemical knowledge in the classroom: (1) the status of chemical knowledge in the classroom, particularly in the  context of models; and (2) chemistry learners' engagement in the modelling of the structure and function of matter, which is a central feature of chemistry. This discussion draws on evidence from several bodies of literature. First, the authors review the literature on the applications of history and philosophy of science in science education. This review illustrates the broader context for the study of chemical knowledge for educational purposes and highlights the weaknesses in the literature in respect of philosophical considerations of chemical knowledge in general. Second, they examine the role of models and modelling in philosophy of science, cognitive psychology, chemistry and chemistry education, and the  interdisciplinary characterisations that provide a context for the reconceptualization of the nature of chemical knowledge in the classroom. The interdisciplinary approach includes perspectives on philosophical accounts of models that begin to address a significant aspect of the nature of chemical knowledge. The discussion concludes with some implications for theory of learning, curriculum design, and teacher education. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - This article develops a model of problem-based learning (PBL) and shows how PBL has been used for a decade in one graduate management program. PBL capitalizes on synergies among cognitive, affective, and behavioral learning. Although management education usually privileges cognitive learning, affective learning is equally important. By focusing on real-world problems, PBL helps students appreciate multiple perspectives, recognize nonrational elements of decision making, and confront ethical quandaries. Together, cognitive and affective learning underpin the essential third element: behavioral learning about how to implement plans, lead teams, resolve conflict, persuade others, and communicate with multiple constituencies. Specific examples of PBL projects illustrate this inter relationship. (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.)

AB  - The use of constructivism and its various manifestations in education has been a topic of much interest in recent years. Inquiry into this theoretical framework has resulted in teacher educators' attempts to help their teacher candidates apply constructivist pedagogy in university classrooms, field experiences and student teaching at two US universities. The instructors developed a set of co-requisite, interdisciplinary methods courses entitled the Schoolyard Lab Program. Composed of two three-credit courses (science methods and language arts methods) and a one-credit field experience, the Schoolyard Lab program utilized the "Cognitive Process of Instruction (CPOI)" as its pedagogical basis. Joan Fulton designed CPOI as a seven-step process that relies on the learner's ability to describe a concept based on its distinguishing attributes, investigate and compare examples of the concept and, finally, apply the concept in new and authentic contexts. The Schoolyard Lab Program is the result of a 6 year period of development and has shown significant positive effects of CPOI on the self-efficacy beliefs of teacher candidates and in-service teachers who have experienced the program. The two faculty modeled CPOI practices in the university classroom. Teacher candidates were then expected to develop an integrated science and language arts unit plan, applying these same principles in elementary classrooms as they completed field experiences and student teaching. The authors of this article explain the CPOI format, how it conforms to important parts of the teacher education curriculum (such as lesson and unit development) and how this relates to the overall objectives of concept development, subject interrelationships and assessment strategies.

AB  - We describe an eight-week summer Young Scientist in Training (YSIT) internship program involving middle and high school students. This program exposed students to current basic research in molecular genetics, while introducing or reinforcing principles of the scientific method and demonstrating the uses of mathematics and chemistry in biology. For the laboratory-based program, selected students from Baltimore City Schools working in groups of three were teamed with undergraduate research assistants at Morgan State University. Teams were assigned a project that was indirectly related to our laboratory research on the characterization of gene expression in "Caenorhabditis elegans". At the end of the program, teams prepared posters detailing their accomplishments, and presented their findings to parents and faculty members during a mini-symposium. The posters were also submitted to the respective schools and the interns were offered a presentation of their research at local high school science fairs.

AB  - The reflections on interdisciplinarity cover several dimensions. One, among them, concerns the nature of what occurs between two disciplines. Does inter-disciplinarity relate to an intention, to a metatheory, to the object, or to a method? It is this ultimate space that we propose to study, supported by Reswebers (2000) proposition, putting the study of the homology of forms forward as a promising way to better understand the interdisciplinarity. Therefore, we have modelled the literature review methods for social work and nursing in order to clarify what expresses, on the plan of the method, either some form homologies or else some interdisciplinary possibilities.

AB  - The laboratory component of a first-semester general chemistry course for science majors is described. The laboratory involves a semester-long project undertaken in a small-group format. Students are asked to examine whether plants grown in soil contaminated with lead take up more lead than those grown in uncontaminated soil. They are also asked to examine whether the acidity of the rainwater affects the amount of lead taken up by the plants. Groups are then given considerable independence in the design and implementation of the experiment. Once the seeds are planted, which takes about 4 wk into the term, several shorter experiments are integrated in before it is time to harvest and analyze the plants. The use of a project and small working groups allows for the development of a broader range of learning outcomes than occurs in a "traditional" general chemistry laboratory. The nature of these outcomes and some of the student responses to the laboratory experience are described. This particular project also works well at demonstrating the connections among chemistry, biology, geology, and environmental studies. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)

AB  - To help children succeed in schools, professionals must work with the family system since "the family is the child's first teacher" and the benefits of involving families in educating children are evident in research findings. School professionals include teachers, school social workers, school psychologists, school counselors, and school nurses. Among different types of families that professionals encounter in schools, families of exceptional children have unique experiences that impose an additional dimension of difference. Working with families of exceptional children is pertinent to help them succeed. Encouragement and support from the family contribute to reducing the gaps in college access and completion among students with disabilities. In collaboration, families are "equal and full partners with educators and school systems" and this relationship "will benefit the student and the entire school system." To be effective in collaboration, professionals must know how to engage families of diverse backgrounds. Unfortunately, effective models to train future school professionals in working with families of exceptional children are lacking. National accrediting agencies provide "minimal guidelines for disability training for school counselors." State requirements for education programs to train future teachers and school professionals in the area of family involvement barely emerged in the past few years. Involving parents and contributing to a multidisciplinary team are two crucial areas of professionals' roles in assisting children with disabilities. In view of practical limitations of programs to provide specialized training to prepare professionals to work with families of exceptional children, and the reality that professionals must collaborate with one another to address children's specific conditions, the use of an interdisciplinary course to address specific topics and competencies related to serving special needs becomes a viable option. This article presents a study on the use of an interdisciplinary course to prepare school professionals to work with families that have exceptional children. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - We analyzed the collaborative process of mathematics and vocational-technical education (VTE) instructors in eight sites, located across the United States, as they developed one authentic, integrated mathematics curriculum unit. Over two years, we collected data on teachers' viewpoints on instruction, integration, and mathematics/VTE reforms. Site visits were conducted to gather additional information on teachers' views, teaching practices, collaboration process, school context, and quality of curriculum units. We found that although the quality of the units varied, the overall analysis suggested that is it is possible for interdisciplinary teams of teachers to create high quality integrated mathematics curriculum units if certain conditions are met. Having support from the school's community, meeting regularly with all the team members, focusing conversations toward student understanding, writing tasks that promote conceptual and integrated understanding of the concepts, and writing the unit together with reflective thought, all seemed to be critical elements in successful integrated unit writing.

AB  - Faculty from 5 disciplines (health administration, nursing, psychology, social work, and special education) collaborated to develop and teach a distance-learning course designed to encourage undergraduate and graduate students to seek mental health services employment in rural areas and to provide the skills, experience, and knowledge necessary for successful rural practice. The primary objectives of the course, developed after thorough review of the rural retention and recruitment literature, were to (1) enhance interdisciplinary team skills, (2) employ technology as a tool for mental health practitioners, and (3) enhance student understanding of Appalachian culture and rural mental health. Didactic instruction emphasized Appalachian culture, rural mental health, teamwork and communication, professional ethics, and technology. Students were introduced to videoconferencing, asynchronous and synchronous communication, and Internet search tools. Working in teams of 3 or 4, students grappled with professional and cultural issues plus team process as they worked through a hypothetical case of a sexually abused youngster. The course required participants to engage in a nontraditional manner by immersing students in Web-based teams. Student evaluations suggested that teaching facts or "content" about rural mental health and Appalachian culture was much easier than the "process" of using new technologies or working in teams. Given that the delivery of mental health care demands collaboration and teamwork and that rural practice relies increasingly more on the use of technology, our experience suggests that more team-based, technology-driven courses are needed to better prepare students for clinical practice.

AB  - Given increasing industry demand for integrative learning, marketing curricula need to emphasize interdisciplinary approaches to teaching. Although team teaching is a useful method for achieving cross-functional integration, there are very few frameworks for effectively implementing team teaching. Consequently, marketing educators seeking to offer team-taught, interdisciplinary courses have little direction on how to proceed. Against this background, this article describes the design and implementation of a team-taught, Marketing/Management interdisciplinary course on Technology and Innovation Management (TiM). On the basis of their experiences with the course, the authors provide instructors with a template for effectively implementing similar courses. (Contains 3 tables and 5 notes.)

AB  - International students travel in many ways. First of all geographically: they move from one country to another. Secondly, they travel through their own identities: they have to find a new place in a new context by familiarizing themselves with new values and customs, while making sure they meet the requirements their studies ask of them. Writing an academic text is almost always one of these requirements. Faculty assign their (international) students to write academic texts because they want to know whether or not they comprehend the content of the course they have offered. Some faculty also want to know whether or not students have familiarized themselves with academic genres and conventions, which may vary according to country or discipline. Consequently, when faculty ask international students to write an academic text, they are requiring them to undertake yet a third journey. In the process, international students may travel through a variety of genre conventions, exploring the conventions of their host country in combination with the conventions in their (new) discipline. In addition to these travels, they also have to find their own voices and their own identities while writing a text. Often, when they receive papers that they consider unsatisfactory, faculty assume that international students' capacities in academic writing are deficient. In this article, we will show how the design of two academic writing workshops for an international and interdisciplinary masters' program helped students in their interdisciplinary and international writing processes, not by working from a deficiency model, but by working from a contextual model. We will present the results in the conclusion by way of a pedagogical rough guide for teaching academic writing to international students.

AB  - Most teachers have attended countless workshops that advocated new teaching methods, materials, or techniques in addressing special student populations. They politely listen as a series of presenters enthusiastically introduce their information in written and verbal form. They return to the classroom, fully intending to use their new skills, but perhaps feeling a bit anxious about their actual applications and ensuing results. This author believes that teachers, like students, must be both physically and mentally involved in the learning process for it to be successful and meaningful. As a former elementary school teacher who is working toward an endorsement in gifted education, the author had the opportunity to participate in the 2003 Baylor University Interdisciplinary Creative Problem Solving Conference. Rather than sitting passively and absorbing information presented, she actively participated in the creation and implementation of an interdisciplinary approach to curricular design based upon a creative problem-solving model. She found the experience invaluable because she physically and mentally progressed through the steps of interdisciplinary curricular design and watched them come alive. The primary purpose of the annual conference is to provide gifted secondary students with a forum to interact and address real-life problems while participating in a problem-solving curriculum (M. Witte, personal communication, June 4, 2003). However, the conference also provides teachers of the gifted with an opportunity to interact, design a curriculum, and implement it using the problem-solving process. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - This phenomenological inquiry looked at 28 preservice teachers as they participated in a field-based curricula restructuring initiative that connected the disciplines of creative arts, science, and reading. The preservice teachers offered weekly interdisciplinary lessons to kindergarten and first grade students. A survey, teaching cases, and a group exit interview informed the study. Throughout most of the semester, the preservice teachers struggled with procedural and pedagogical content knowledge, concerns directly related to effective teaching. By the end of the semester, they felt comfortable teaching interdisciplinary lessons. Results suggest that preservice teacher curricular restructuring efforts are complex and that teacher educators need to consider the perspectives preservice teachers bring to the change process.

AB  - This article reports the results of a study with 70 senior undergraduate biological science majors enrolled in a required course on "Writing and Speaking in the Biological Sciences". Students enrolled in this course were expected to develop oral scientific presentations of their research projects that exemplified the norms of speaking in the biological sciences. Rather than gathering information from experts or providing explicit instruction on the conventions and structure of this particular genre, we surveyed the students enrolled in this class about their self-perceived communication challenges. Students overwhelmingly identified general issues of organization and concerns about delivery as their primary challenges and communication workshops were developed to address these concerns. According to the reports of the biology faculty who evaluated these students' presentations and grade data for the oral component of this course compared to previous sections of it, students demonstrated significant expertise in enacting a highly discipline-specific oral communication task. We attribute these students' ability to successfully deploy such discipline-specific discourse to their own tacit knowledge of their field combined with instruction in both the disciplines of rhetoric and biology.

SPC is seen as providing a standard set of criteria that serves as a common interface for data-based decision making, which may bring decision making under the control of established contingencies rather than the immediate contingencies of data fluctuation, and may help with failing treatments.

AB  - This case study of a team-taught learning community that integrates American history and literature focuses on student team presentations. We argue for the need to train students to learn actively, and we describe strategies for teaching students how to prepare for and present interdisciplinary team presentations. One finding is that training students for active learning does not detract from the content, but rather deepens and enriches it; another finding is that students are more likely to integrate disciplines successfully if faculty are skillful at integrating disciplines.

AB  - From papier mache to plaster and paper to moulage, making masks is a popular activity for both art educators and students around the world. Masks have been and are currently used by many cultures/societies for specific cultural rituals and spiritual, metaphorical, role-playing, and theatrical reasons. In short, their use and their creation are culturally driven. Therefore, it is important to take a relevant, people- or issue-driven approach to the exploration of masks from other cultures so as not to perpetuate an incorrect perspective. Simply looking at style and technique or using a mask as just a mask often results in misinterpretation, misrepresentation, objectifying, and romanticizing cultures other than one's own, which, in the long-run, create stereotypes and biased knowledge. In teaching through and about the art and visual cultures of one's own and other diverse groups' images and objects, it is important to consider what is being taught. In this article, the author uses mask making, a popular activity in art classrooms, to illustrate the ways that cultural sensitivity and interdisciplinarity inform teaching and learning practices in art education.
