Proposes alternative objectives for interdisciplinary studies, such as broadening students' perspectives and showing limitations of strictly disciplinary approaches. (12 citations) (AJL)

AB  - Two teacher researchers examined the nature of mentoring relationships occurring among and between team teachers at one middle school as they planned for and taught a common group of students. There were five types of (simultaneous) mentoring among teachers: collaborative, clerical, professional teacher, interdisciplinary content, and social/informal. Less isolated teachers moved away from singular views of teaching and problem solving. (25 references) (MLH)

AB  - The editor of ASCD's "Interdisciplinary Curriculum: Design and Implementation," Heidi Hayes Jacobs, has worked with hundreds of schools to discover best curriculum planning practices. She finds doing too much at once and forcing subject overlaps the biggest obstacles to interdisciplinary curriculum planning. Moving to standardized curricula intensifies the problem. (MLH)

AB  - In 1992, San Francisco State University's Department of Special Education was awarded a five-year U.S. Department of Education grant to establish an initial partnership training project for preparing professionals skilled at providing school-based or school-linked interagency services for children. Unlike University of Washington's large-scale reform initiative, San Francisco State State is responding to immediate need in California for appropriately trained personnel. (MLH)

AB  - Survey responses from 136 of 216 dental hygiene programs indicated that 31% included interdisciplinary activities in the curriculum; only 15% included both clinical and instructional interdisciplinary coursework. However, 74% felt that students would benefit from interdisciplinary experiences. (SK)

AB  - The inspiration for this article was not conceived over lunch, but more specifically over the box in which the lunches were packaged. Five colleagues brainstormed ideas for teaching a unit on trees for the third grade that would fit in our boxes. The disciplines involved were art, children's literature, science, social studies, and technology. Each person decorated the lunch box for their appropriate discipline and placed instructional items inside. Technology was infused throughout the unit.

AB  - This paper is a discussion of a team-taught interdisciplinary course that was designed to provide cohesion between the 12 departments that participate in the environmental studies major at Salisbury University. This course provides a model for addressing several positive and negative tendencies at work in interdisciplinary programs, and provides students with a first-hand experience in how multiple disciplines can work together to provide a more developed picture of a particular field or interest. This paper presents a discussion of the teaching experiences of faculty involved in the environmental studies course for two years. A framework for the development of such courses is included, as well as a discussion of the agreements and disagreements that can arise when students and faculty work within an interdisciplinary context.

AB  - This article describes an innovative curriculum module the first author created on the two-way exchange between statistics and applied ethics. The module, having no particular mathematical prerequisites beyond high school algebra, is part of an undergraduate interdisciplinary ethics course which begins with a 3-week introduction to basic applied ethics taught by a philosophy professor (the second author), and continues with 3-week modules from professors in various other disciplines. The first author's module's emphasis on conceptual and critical thinking makes it easily adaptable to service-level courses as well as readily expandable for more mathematically sophisticated audiences. Through in-class explorations and discussions, the module made connections to contemporary topics such as the death penalty, equal pay for equal work, and profiling. This article shares examples, resources, strategies and lessons learned for instructors wishing to develop their own modules of various lengths. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - With increasing specialization, most academic disciplines have become highly compartmentalized. Numerous organizations in higher education strongly encourage interdisciplinary collaboration at the faculty and student level. The purposes of this article are (a) to provide a conceptual framework for explaining how and why an interdisciplinary case study method is a catalyst for the development of students and faculty; (b) to document the conception, planning, organizing, and results of an interdisciplinary case study workshop; and (c) to provide recommendations to encourage change others who might want to apply this model to their own interdisciplinary efforts.

AB  - Primary sources in religion and history enable first year university students to connect "content-based" linked courses in the core curriculum. Fifty-four first year university students in three separate pairs of courses worked in teams to present oral critical reports on texts related to the Reformation, the Enlightenment, and the Modern Era: themes intersecting religion and history. Critical thinking skills equipped students to address content while team collaboration enabled both textual comprehension and formation of academic community. Both sets of skills informed related writing assignments. The overall learning experience facilitated development of intellectual connections between the two courses (a primary goal of linked courses). Greater clarity in assignments and more time in the linked course format would enhance the learning experience.

AB  - Two linked courses examining conservation science and art history of 17th-century Dutch painting are described. The two courses have been taught on campus and, most recently, as study-abroad courses in collaboration with the Center for European Studies, Universiteit Maastricht, The Netherlands. The highly interdisciplinary courses are intense, yet presuppose that students have no background in either science or art history. The courses have successfully drawn students who are science majors as well as nonmajors into the same classroom with productive outcomes. Strengths and limitations of the approaches taken are discussed and key resources from the courses are cited. (Contains 6 figures.)

Design and Methods: We reviewed educational and empirical literature. Results: Interdisciplinary care planning and the written care plan are mandated processes that are imbedded in the regulatory fabric and routines of the American nursing home. These processes evolved from the discipline of nursing, where care planning has had a long and controversial history. Implications: Practice implications are provided.

AB  - At many universities, much of the learning in the undergraduate curriculum is discipline based, with very little integration of material from different subject areas. Furthermore, not all undergraduate business students have the opportunity to take courses with a diversity component that exposes them to the cultural and other differences that exist in various parts of the world. While it would be optimal for all students to study abroad for at least one semester during college, financial and other considerations make this goal unattainable for many students. For this reason, structured study abroad trips may present the only opportunity for some students to incorporate a global experience into their education. In order to achieve the dual goals of fostering integrated learning and global studies, Rider University, a private, coeducational university located on two campuses in Lawrenceville and Princeton, New Jersey, offers interdisciplinary "business-science" courses with a travel component so that undergraduate science and liberal arts students and undergraduate and graduate business students can not only study, but also experience, the complex interaction of legal, economic, social, and environmental factors in an international setting. This article explains the importance of introducing global studies, interdisciplinary learning, and environmental law and sustainability into the business school curriculum and describes how the Nature's Business program accomplishes its goals.
