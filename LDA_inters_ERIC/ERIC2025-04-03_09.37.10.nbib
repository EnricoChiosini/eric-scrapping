AB  - Over the last few years research funding has increasingly moved in favour of large, multi-partner, interdisciplinary and multi-site research projects. This article explores the benefits and challenges of employing a full-time research fellow to work across multiple field sites, with all the local research teams, on an international, interdisciplinary project. The article shows how such a "floating" research fellow can play a valuable role in facilitating communication between research teams and project leaders, as well as in building capacity and introducing disciplinary specific skills. It also highlights some key challenges, including problems of language and translation, and the complex power relations within which such a researcher is inevitably embedded. This article contributes to the development of strategies for collaborative projects to facilitate coordination between research teams. It is based on a five-site, cross-cultural project, involving nine partners with a mixture of natural and social science backgrounds, researching aquatic resource use, rural livelihoods, work and education in China, Vietnam and India.

AB  - In a collaboration between the University of North Florida College of Education and Human Services and Sandalwood High School in Duval County, Florida, social studies and science education professors and a science teacher worked together to develop student understanding about the limited use of diesel-fueled cars in the United States when compared to the countries of Europe. On the basis of discussions with a Sandalwood science faculty member and calls for subject matter integration from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Research Council, the National Science Teachers Association, and the National Council on the Social Studies, we developed a collaborative teaching experience to both enhance high school science instruction and build stronger professional connections between college and high school faculty. Through this instruction, high school chemistry students examined the costs and benefits of using diesel vehicles and used this analysis to explain the differences between countries. This article illustrates conceptual planning processes used in developing inquiry-based classroom activities within a standards-based curriculum.

AB  - The K-5 school years are crucial, setting the framework for all subjects as well as critical thinking skills. The single most important component in a classroom is the teacher. However, in a formative timeframe for elementary-school aged children, the number of K-5 teachers that are educated with a Science, Technology, Engineering or Math specialization ("STEM") is substantially underrepresented. At The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) it was felt that the Department of Technological Studies was well positioned to provide a unique academic major by combining the T&E with the M&S components of STEM, resulting in a program breadth that matches the breadth of skills needed by a highly skilled K-5 teacher. Such a program was established at TCNJ and is formally referred to as the Math-Science-Technology or MST program. It was demonstrated that a multidisciplinary MST program was successful both in terms of growth and content knowledge. The MST program should be particularly well-suited to today's educational environment in which substantial numbers of students in STEM-related areas are lost, their scores are low on quantitative literacy, and they would likely score low on measures of technological literacy (Steen, 2001).

AB  - Although there is considerable activity in developing assessment protocols for undergraduate learning, there are few established models for assessment of student progress in multidisciplinary doctoral-level graduate education. To resolve this impediment in tracking graduate student development, we created a simple assessment tool based on the concept of T competency that allows graduate students to articulate explicit learning goals in disciplinary and multidisciplinary research. Our instrument allows quantitative measurement of a student's self-perception of his/her knowledge and interest in multidisciplinary inquiry. We use our T assessment tool to measure graduate student progress in an NSF IGERT-funded graduate program in coastal ecosystem management. The T model provides us a nomenclature to articulate learning goals, a quantitative means to evaluate current and future learning targets and progress in reaching those targets, and gives us another measure of assessing overall graduate program effectiveness. Our T tool is an instrument that should have considerable utility in measuring knowledge and interest in multidisciplinary research across a range of disciplines and graduate programs.

AB  - In order to maximize student development in an interdisciplinary context, we implemented and evaluated a business-biology team teaching approach. The class project involved teams of environmental science and business students analyzing an industry stakeholder interested in participating in the development of a community composting network. We compared the results of this team-taught section with a more traditionally-taught business section with a sustainability emphasis, with the objectives of identifying student learning gains and reflecting, as faculty, upon the experience. In the affective domain, there was initial discomfort with the interdisciplinary team teaching method on the part of both faculty and students. In the cognitive domain, both team-taught and traditional sections perceived significant gains in understanding both business and natural systems, although the treatment group alone made significant (P < 0.10) gains in linking interdisciplinary thinking and an understanding of both business and natural systems to future success. These findings suggest that the affective and cognitive transformations experienced in team-taught settings are important for teaching expanded worldviews and diverse perspectives.

AB  - The undergraduate Bioengineering Program at Lehigh University was established as part of the university's Bioscience and Biotechnology Initiative with support from the National Science Foundation through a grant from its Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC). The objective here is to describe the program development and implementation, as well as the challenges encountered. Bioengineering at Lehigh was designed as an interdisciplinary program, with an emphasis on experiential learning, entrepreneurship, and innovation. In this light, the goals established for the program implementation were focused on recruiting students, developing a rigorous curriculum, equipping laboratories, and fostering industrial partnerships. The curriculum initially had three key components: a core of basic requirements, three tracks allowing students to specialize within a field of bioengineering, and experiential learning. The key challenges faced are balancing breadth and depth of a curriculum in a diverse field, improving experiential learning opportunities, implementing changes while maintaining stability, and handling operations as a new program rather than as an established department. The effectiveness of these strategies has been assessed on an ongoing basis. For example, an integrated recruitment strategy was used to encourage student enrollment, the results of which were measured through surveys and admissions data. Requiring students to select one of the three tracks, which are Biopharmaceutical Engineering, Cell and Tissue Engineering, and Bioelectronics and Biophotonics, each with an advanced laboratory course, added depth to the curriculum. Based on several sources of feedback, numerous changes have been made to the curriculum, including the addition of more bioengineering courses, especially advanced electives. The incorporation of Integrated Product Development (IPD), which was already an established hallmark program at Lehigh, into bioengineering, was a major program change that enhanced the hands-on learning and innovation opportunities. Implementing such changes, and managing them effectively, have been necessary to maintain program stability.

AB  - The contemporary workforce requires technical and reading skills (Shanahan & Shanahan, 2008; The Conference Board, Corporate Voices for Working Families, Partnership for 21st Century Skills, Society of Human Resource Management, 2006). Technical skills allow workers to perform specific workforce tasks, while reading skills are generally needed by all workers. The model used in this study emphasizes the integration of technical and reading skills in the delivery of business content. The effective instruction of both technical and reading skills require that the teacher be knowledgeable in the content, have an appropriate teaching and learning context, and implement instructional strategies (Kehe, 2003). Business teachers indicated that they could provide more effective interdisciplinary instruction if they were provided additional training (Hite & Polkinghorne, 2006). Instructional reading skill strategies call for the teacher to recognize student reading experiences, deliberately select instructional strategies, explicitly alert students to methods of reading, and guide instruction with knowledge unique to the content-area (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 2000). This study posits Forget's (2004) MAX Learning instructional strategy for the interdisciplinary teaching of technical and reading skills in business courses.

AB  - A meaningful research experience with a strong mentor early in a student's educational career is formative. Many institutions recognize this and would like to have such an experience available to their best students, but it can be difficult to involve first-year students in a laboratory-based research because of their lack of background knowledge. However, it can be just as transformative for students to conduct a meaningful literature research project under the direction of an advisor. Such an experience can expose students to the culture of science and to the excitement of scientific research and can motivate them to pursue science majors and careers. This article describes a first-year, seminar-style class in which, under the direction of an advisor, students engage in a semester-long research project. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify critical components for service science curricula that address the unique competency needs of the service sector. Design/methodology/approach: The method for this investigation included a comprehensive review, analysis, and synthesis of service science, as well as service science management and engineering (SSME) related literature. As human capital is of unique importance in this business sector, particular emphasis was placed on examining the need for human resource development-related content in service science curricula. Findings: Expansion of the services sector globally has been unprecedented. "Some analysts predict that by 2020, services will account for 50 percent of world trade" (Downe et al.). Yet a global shortage of graduates with the skills needed for success in service sector jobs has been forecast. Compounding this talent shortage is the relatively small number of degree programs available to prepare professionals for service sector jobs. Because the growth in the service sector has outpaced improvements in productivity, quality, and innovation, and there is a lack of skilled talent to address these challenges, increasing attention is being placed on service science curricula. Originality/value: Given the economic importance of, and current deficiencies in, the service sector it is poised to make a significant impact by improving service science education.

AB  - From popular movies to New York Times bestsellers, organic food is widely acknowledged to be of growing importance. Many community college students are asking: How is organic food different from everything else in the grocery store? What impact does farming have on the environment? How safe is our food? A survey of reference works introduces organic food as a method of producing food and a social movement that values sustainable food, higher levels of nutrition and food safety, and environmentally responsible agriculture. The organic food movement incorporates a variety of subjects and exemplifies the need for interdisciplinary reference work.

AB  - From its inception, the field of Mind, Brain, and Education (MBE) has been conceived as an interdisciplinary science, and with good reason: The phenomena the field aims to understand often arise from interactions among multiple factors, span levels of analysis, and are context dependent. In this article, we argue that to reach its potential as an interdisciplinary science--and in order to explain such complex phenomena--MBE must be fundamentally organized around meaningful, discipline-spanning questions, and the questions must determine tools and research methods (not the other way around). Using examples from three central questions in MBE--"who," "when," and "how"--we highlight the limits of single disciplines, and the value of a question-driven interdisciplinary approach in MBE, with respect to questions that can be asked, the perspectives that can be considered, and the array of methods, tools, and models that can be made available. We believe that the future is bright for MBE, and that the field has a unique opportunity to provide meaningful answers to some of the most difficult questions in education today. However, realizing this potential depends on, as a first step, allowing the questions themselves to drive the field's work moving forward.

AB  - In the competitive market of higher education, government funding agencies consider universities accountable for ensuring a better alignment between educational processes, graduate capabilities and real world employability. Workforce leaders have developed new expectations about the capabilities of graduating students, expecting to employ graduates who have more sophisticated understandings of the complexity involved in undertaking projects and working in the field. Graduates are expected to demonstrate well developed inter-professional literacy, be able to successfully navigate across professions in workplaces, and to effectively contribute to large projects involving a diverse range of roles and responsibilities. There is growing awareness within the sector that universities should work in partnership with students to tackle local and global challenges and that often these challenges cannot be addressed adequately by a single discipline. Stone, Bollard and Harbor (2009) note that as society has become more complex, research questions have changed, and the "structures of earlier times no longer accommodate the research needed and the teaching that emanates from this research" (p.322). Increasingly, scholars are looking across traditional disciplinary boundaries in new ways to address socio-cultural concerns. The extent of scholarship into the rise and prominence of interdisciplinary collaboration in higher education, along with the external drivers that support this paradigm in education and practice, shifts discussion within faculties from the "benefits of interdisciplinary approaches to pragmatic questions of how to develop and sustain interdisciplinary programs" (Stone et al. 2009, p.323). This paper describes a framework for the introduction of common learning experiences (CLEs) in the Built Environment Faculty (BE) at the University of New South Wales to more adequately prepare students for future professional settings. The paper discusses the initiative in the context of recent research on interdisciplinary learning and teaching in the built environment and higher education more broadly, and discusses the conditions that are likely to support and sustain the initiative into the future.

AB  - Articles from the National Science Teacher Association (NSTA) publications were analyzed to investigate resources available for teachers who want to implement interdisciplinary approaches into the science classroom. All articles in each journal from 2004 through 2008 were read an analyzed; approximately 13% of Science & Children (elementary), 21% of Science Scope (middle), and 17% of The Science Teacher (high school) articles met the interdisciplinary approach criteria. Results show that overall, reading, writing, art, and technology are the subjects most commonly integrated into science. Surprisingly, math is rarely discussed across all school levels. Comparing the articles across different school levels, Science Scope articles have the highest number of integrated articles, whereas The Science Teacher had the fewest number of integrated articles.

AB  - Purpose To assess the effects of an interdisciplinary intervention on the trajectories of functional recovery among older patients with hip fracture during 2 years after hospitalization. Design and Methods In a randomized controlled trial with 24-month follow-up, 162 patients [greater than or equal to]60 years were enrolled after hip-fracture surgery at a 3,000-bed medical center in northern Taiwan. Patients received an interdisciplinary program of geriatric consultation, in-hospital and at-home rehabilitation, and discharge planning (n = 80) or usual care (n = 82). Patients' functional status was assessed by the Chinese Barthel Index before discharge and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after discharge. Covariates included demographic attributes, depressive symptoms, and cognitive functioning. Latent class growth modeling was used to examine distinctive groups of individual trajectories within the sample. Results Functional recovery followed 3 distinct paths, approximated by either a quadratic or cubic function over time. These paths were (a) poor recovery (6.8%), (b) moderate recovery (47.5%), and (c) excellent recovery (45.7%). The interdisciplinary intervention significantly reduced the likelihood of poor recovery (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 0.05, p less than 0.01) and moderate recovery (RRR = 0.17, p less than 0.01), relative to excellent recovery. In addition, the major risk factors for poor or moderate recovery were older age, lower prefracture physical functioning, as well as higher depression scores and lower cognitive functioning before discharge. Implications Distinct trajectories of functional recovery can serve as useful outcome measures in clinical research and practice.

AB  - The concept of new university reduces the depth of disciplinary understanding at the undergraduate level. Instead, interdisciplinary understanding has been put forward, where room is provided for the broader development of student. Receiving training from multiple perspectives will provide students with the skills necessary in an era of present competitive society. People with critical thinking and decision making skills are needed in the complex modern world. This study presents a model for faculties of arts and sciences. Graduates of Arts and Sciences Faculties experience employment problems. This could be overcome through providing students with opportunities to study minor subjects. In most developed countries, higher education institutions appear to implement a model in which students take general courses in their freshman year. They tailor a program of their own with the mentorship of their supervisors.

AB  - School accountability has funnelled educational practices into a path where teaching practices are heavily centred in Language Arts instruction. Focusing learning almost exclusively in the aforesaid area develops a one-dimensional process that could hold back certain students from a well-balanced education. This article presents a model of interdisciplinary teaching, building cognitive bridges between subject areas, implemented during the 2006-2007 school year with 29 English Language Learners (ELL) 4th grade students from an elementary school located in Southern California. The goal was to increase students' language proficiency and their academic performance by creating multidimensional practices that emphasised the idea that a subject area (i.e., Mathematics) is an open body of knowledge fed by other disciplines (i.e., Science, Social Studies). The outcomes of this project suggest that students exposed to interdisciplinary methodologies not only build language as a multidimensional tool but they also increase their academic performance.

AB  - Language is both a means and an end in educational systems. As a means to learning, it manifests itself in countless, shifting modalities; while as an end or objective of learning, it is often perceived as an autonomous, formal entity. Through a case study of an interdisciplinary secondary school project in Luxembourg, this paper explores the tension between formal, standardizing ideologies of language and the diversifying realities found in many classrooms and beyond. Beginning with discussion of different ideological stances towards multilingualism, language education and classroom participation, this paper analyses ways in which these ideologies impact educational systems in general, and language education in Luxembourg in particular, and advocates for heteroglossic, inclusive approaches to language education. The case study presented illustrates successful heteroglossic pedagogy, marked by inclusion of numerous languages, numerous content areas, numerous modalities of expression, and shifts in school participation hierarchies. At the same time, analysis of this case also illustrates continued influences of standard, monoglossic language ideology and areas of difficulty that need to be addressed in order to further develop and normalize effective multilingual pedagogy.

AB  - Science IDEAS is an evidence-based model that reflects interdisciplinary research findings that support the integration of literacy (e.g., reading comprehension) within science instruction in grades K-5. Presented is a framework for planning integrated science and literacy instruction in which six elements (hands-on investigations, reading, journaling/writing, propositional concept maps, application activities, prior knowledge/cumulative review) serve as a means of providing students with conceptually-coherent, in-depth science instruction. Reviewed is a multi-year Science IDEAS research initiative whose findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in engendering student science and reading achievement growth in grades K-2 and in grades 3-5 in a manner that facilitates positive transfer to grades 6-8. Based on the results presented and related research, curriculum policy changes that would increase the time allocated to science instruction in grades K-5 are suggested as a means of improving the present school reform movement.

AB  - Spatial thinking skills are vital for success in everyday living and work, not to mention the centrality of spatial reasoning in scientific discoveries, design-based disciplines, medicine, geosciences and mathematics to name a few. This case study describes a course in spatial thinking and communicating designed and delivered by an interdisciplinary team over a three-year period to first-year university students. Four major elements provide a framework for the sequencing of instruction and acquisition of 2D and 3D spatial thinking and reasoning skills in a computational design context. We describe the process of introducing students to computational design environments beginning with a fun and familiar tool in preparation for a more complex, industry-standard system (SolidWorks). A design project provides diverse student teams an opportunity to integrate and apply foundational spatial concepts and skills including sketching, 2D and 3D representations, as well as digital and physical modeling. Samples of student work illustrate the scaffolding necessary for students to successfully draw upon the spatial thinking and communication skills required to complete their team projects beginning with applying sketching techniques; modeling individual 3D parts; creating digital assemblies; and finally building the equivalent 3D physical model. Key instructional principles provide a framework for the analysis of what worked and what didn't in relation to spatial skills development in students. The lessons learned are identified along with potential future directions for teaching and learning scholarship in spatial thinking development within a computational design context.

AB  - Science Without Borders is a unique interdisciplinary science course that uses group and active-learning strategies and is in high demand among nonscience majors at a masters-level university. Registrar data showed that nonscience majors were far more likely to choose this course compared with other, discipline-based science courses. In an investigation of course catalogs of 60 randomly selected institutions of higher learning, only 5% offered a similar course. In this paper, we describe the course's unique structure and successful administration. In addition, pre- and postcourse surveys were administered to over 200 students in 10 different sections over the course of one academic year. These data showed that students demonstrated modest increases in science competency, but perceptions of science were unchanged. (Contains 3 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - This paper recommends that faculties of Social Work incorporate Disability Studies in their curriculum by embracing its interdisciplinary deconstructionist perspective. Disability Studies encourages Social Work to move beyond person-in--the-environment and anti-oppressive approaches to find more effective ways of removing barriers for persons with disabilities, and new opportunities to include them in the larger culture. Discussing the critical nature of Disability Studies, the authors point out how Social Work is learning to embrace the interdisciplinary nature of Disability Studies.

AB  - Cross-curricular programming offers unique opportunities to connect non-majors with science. In this article, the author describes personal experiences related to a novel initiative uniting science, civics, and citizenship that may serve as a model for course and program development at other colleges. In this model, students from multiple majors explored several historical and contemporary disease events. The primary pedagogical goals were to examine how both social and scientific forces shaped those events and how they have shaped society today; and to reflect on how those experiences can inform future scientific and social decisions.

AB  - With funding from the UK's Royal Academy of Engineering, the University of Edinburgh has developed a series of truly interdisciplinary design courses aimed at improving penultimate-year students' ability to operate across disciplines and improve their preparation for industry. Led by a Visiting Industrial Professor, the course on hydropower design requires students to provide a full feasibility study of a small scheme in western Scotland tackling issues from hydrology through to grid connection. The course has had several very successful outcomes which include: appreciation of other engineering disciplines; experience of teams where different skills and expertise are available; demonstration of the links between engineering design and economic viability; introduction to non-technical areas essential to the UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence; and enhancing interest in the hydropower sector in technological and career terms. The key message from this project is the need to ensure balance across tasks, within groups and staff support across disciplines. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - In response to a request from a campus student organization, faculty  from three fields came together to develop and teach an integrated  interdisciplinary course on water issues and social activism. This course, "Water as Life, Death, and Power", brought together topics from the fields of anthropology, biology and chemistry to explore water rights, access to clean water, and water treatment methods. Students enrolled in the course developed interdisciplinary projects related to a variety of local and global water issues to present real-world solutions at a university-wide student research showcase. This article describes the process by which the faculty learning community designed the course as a truly integrated whole, and reflects on the challenges and rewards  of teaching a course in this way.

AB  - In the current era of global society, adults need to cultivate cognitive and affective capabilities for interacting in a wide variety of work and living situations. Studying abroad can provide unique learning opportunities toward this end. Good intentions in offering study abroad experiences do not, however, always produce the kind of learning, development, and transformations that are intended. The author first describes an instructional design that was underpinned by adult education theory and practice, then presents the research methodology and findings of the study that evaluated the design.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine whether Socioscientific Issues (SSI) based learning environments affect university students' epistemological understanding of scientific inquiry differently from traditional science educational contexts. We identify and compare conceptions of scientific inquiry of students participating in an interdisciplinary, SSI-focused undergraduate human biology major (SSI) and those participating in a traditional biology major (BIO). Forty-five SSI students and 50 BIO students completed an open-ended questionnaire examining their understanding of scientific inquiry. Eight general themes including approximately 60 subthemes emerged from questionnaire responses, and the numbers of students including each subtheme in their responses were statistically compared between groups. A subset of students participated in interviews, which were used to validate and triangulate questionnaire data and probe students' understanding of scientific inquiry in relation to their majors. We found that both groups provided very similar responses, differing significantly in only five subthemes. Results indicated that both groups held generally adequate understandings of inquiry, but also a number of misconceptions. Small differences between groups supported by both questionnaires and interviews suggest that the SSI context contributed to nuanced understandings, such as a more interdisciplinary and problem-centered conception of scientific inquiry. Implications for teaching and research are discussed.

AB  - The low interest of the U.S. students in sciences is an ongoing issue. One approach to promote the sciences is outreach activities, often targeted at grades K-12. Yet, a limiting factor in these outreach initiatives is their long-term feasibility, especially from an economic perspective. Another challenge is how to introduce scientific information during brief periods of exposure. Furthermore, different problems may be encountered based on the geographic location of students. In populated urban communities, there are typically greater resources available than in low-density rural populations. With these challenges in mind, we describe an outreach initiative targeted to rural high school students. The workshop has been used for four years, and the network of participants is growing as interest spreads. This article can serve as a model for workshop development across various content areas. Such workshops can provide a useful recruiting tool while exposing students to the sciences. (Contains 2 tables and 1 box.)

AB  - Most university-level engineering studies produce technically skilled engineers. However, typically students face several difficulties when working in multidisciplinary teams when they initiate their industrial careers. In a globalised world, it becomes increasingly important that engineers are capable of collaborating across disciplinary boundaries and exhibit soft competencies, like communication, interpersonal and social skills, time planning, creativity, initiative, and reflection. To prepare a group of engineering and industrial design students to acquire those capabilities, an international summer school that combined industrial design with different kinds of engineering disciplines was organised on the site of Bang & Olufsen (B&O) in Denmark. This multidisciplinary engineering summer school was attended by students from six European university-level teaching institutions and was supervised by teachers from those institutions and industrial experts from B&O. The main aim of the summer school was to allow students to work in teams, composed of students from different knowledge disciplines and with different cultural backgrounds, with the purpose of developing innovative concepts and products, within a strong industrial perspective.

AB  - Collaborative international research projects represent excellent opportunities for students to obtain unique and life-altering educational experiences. Dynamic interactions with people from a variety of countries, institutions, and departments, in diverse situations, provides students with new perspectives, encourages them to operate in a multidisciplinary environment, and facilitates real-world problem solving. This article discusses important concepts and issues in geographic education that are based upon real-world experiences in the Himalaya Mountains of India and Pakistan, involving undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral research assistants. Multidisciplinary research/education activities reveal the importance of geography in problem solving and scientific inquiry. This work also highlights numerous issues and curriculum challenges required to establish a scientific foundation in geography, as traditional empirical approaches to geographic education and research frequently hide the complexities of dynamic systems and our world. Students require a multitude of perspectives that incorporate cultural and communication experiences, knowledge synthesis, field and laboratory work, and real-world problem solving. International research experiences can address some of these requirements, so that students can effectively solve problems in an increasingly international and multidisciplinary world. This personal article incorporates numerous examples from physical geography and geographic information science. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - This article focuses on how electronic information resources influence the information-seeking process in the social sciences and humanities. It examines the information-seeking behavior of scholars in these fields, and extends the David Ellis model of information-seeking behavior for social scientists, which includes six characteristics: starting, chaining, browsing, differentiating, monitoring, and extracting. The study was conducted at Tennessee State University (TSU). Thirty active social sciences and humanities faculty, as well as doctoral students, were interviewed about their use of electronic information resources for research purposes, their perception of electronic and print materials, their opinions concerning the Ellis model, and ways the model might apply to them. Based on the interview results, the researcher provides suggestions on how current information services and products can be improved to better serve social sciences and humanities researchers. The author makes recommendations for improving library services and technologies to better meet the needs of social sciences and humanities scholars.

AB  - This paper examines the degree of multidisplinary cooperation for Geographic Information Science (GIS) education programs that award GIS-related degrees or certificates at US colleges and universities. We classified departments and courses into ten major disciplines using Dewey Decimal Classification. In the 2007-2008 academic year, approximately 40 per cent of GIS education programs related to multiple disciplines and nearly 20 per cent were involved with more than three disciplines. Geography was the major provider of GIS education programs, but the ratio between geography-related discipline and other disciplines combined was approximately 1:3. Fostering multidisciplinary GIS education programs should strengthen geography in general as well as GIS education. (Contains 9 figures and 4 tables.)

AB  - In both transdisciplinary education and transdisciplinary research projects, bodies of knowledge must be brought together which are structured in fundamentally different ways. Besides the clear divide between practical, everyday knowledge and academic knowledge, there is also a range of distinct discipline-based outlooks; all of these are to be integrated in order to reach solutions to practical problems, and to create new knowledge that transcends disciplinary boundaries. The different forms of knowledge present within a transdisciplinary team represent an important resource for problem-solving. However, this raises the question of how--in spite of or because of these differences--knowledge can be exchanged and ultimately integrated in such a manner as to achieve common goals. The process of knowledge integration is key to the added value of transdisciplinary research; it is therefore well worth examining the process in a more differentiated manner. The paper draws upon findings from social psychology on information and knowledge transfer and group dynamics to illuminate the process of generating transdisciplinary knowledge. It intends to contribute to the further development of transdisciplinary collaboration practice. The paper also provides specific recommendations which are useful in research and education processes.

AB  - This column provides original articles on innovations in case study teaching, assessment of the method, as well as case studies with teaching notes. In this month's issue the authors describe an interdisciplinary approach to case study teaching that addresses the demand to balance the goals of process and content. The case study, Salem's Secrets (Nava-Whitehead and Gow 2008), is used both as an approach to introduce the scientific method and hypothesis testing and as a way to integrate learning across the curriculum. The case  examines the Salem witch trials that took place in the late 1600s in Salem, Massachusetts. Several hypotheses are presented to explain the symptoms experienced by the accusers, including mass hysteria, outright fakery, and fungal toxicity. Statistical evidence culled  from primary source records of Salem (Woodward 1969) and published in the journal "Science" (Caporael 1976; Spanos and Gottlieb 1976) is presented to students for analysis. In the end, students are expected to synthesize the information presented throughout the case to formulate a defensible conclusion supported by data that they consider  scientifically valid.

AB  - The implications of the transdisciplinary spatial turn are attracting growing interest in a broad range of areas related to education. This paper draws on a methodology for interdisciplinary thinking in order to articulate a new theoretical configuration of place-related identity, and its implications for a research agenda. The new configuration is created through an analysis of place-related identities in narrative theory, texts and literacy processes. The emerging research agenda focuses on the ways children perceive and represent their place-related identities through reading and writing as inspired by and manifested in texts.

AB  - The authors describe the prevalence, formation, maintenance, and evaluation of student aging interest groups. They conducted a cross-sectional electronic survey of the 46 academic medical centers funded by the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation. To evaluate their group of approximately 50 students, the authors conducted an electronic pretest and posttest of attitudes toward interdisciplinary education and knowledge about aging. Twenty-nine of 32 responding institutions funded by the Reynolds Foundation conducted a group; only medical students participated in one half of these groups. Panel presentations were the most prevalent group activity. Evaluation of their group revealed that an interprofessional service learning experience had the greatest impact on student perceptions of the educational preparation and competency of other disciplines. At posttest, medical students in their group had significantly less positive perceptions of actual cooperation between disciplines than did physical therapy or pharmacy students. Aging interest groups conducted by institutions funded by the Reynolds Foundation did not have a high level of interdisciplinary participation. Intermittent exposure to other disciplines during a small number of group activities may be insufficient to overcome "disciplinary split" and achieve interprofessional team orientation without changes in the structure of medical education.

AB  - This paper reports a small-scale study exploring the communicative interactions of secondary teachers and community educators with colleagues and learners in educational environments. This research is conducted in a changing educational landscape where there is a more holistic approach to education being adopted and where an extended Scottish curriculum is encompassing students from age 3 to 18. In this study, the reported incidents of communication relate to developing and maintaining relationships, and attending to issues of power and status. While there were clear similarities in the themes uncovered in both sectors, there were major differences concerning power and status. In the formal sector, educators reported matters regarding their status and position within the organisation, whereas informal educators were more concerned with aspects of power relating to the young people. These differences may reflect a disparity in cultural and organisational values that, if recognised and acted upon, could help to nourish aspects of interdisciplinary working to further enhance the educational experiences of young people.

AB  - This paper takes a specific university Department of Romance Languages as a case study to examine how the measures it adopted in view of increasing enrollment in Spanish in the nineties coincide with the recommendations in the MLA's 2007 report; it also examines how they have fared after some 12 years of implementation, advances explanations for their success or failure, and offers suggestions for improvement. While examining well-established language programs, it discusses issues of governance, faculty and curriculum pertaining to the overall field of foreign languages and cultures. The initiatives proposed here aim at placing language study in a field of interacting factors to better adjust to the "inter-" and "trans-disciplinarity" of today's world.

AB  - Increased demand, limited resources, knowledge gaps, and seemingly less time to produce results are the challenges facing researchers and others in higher education today. Working together across disciplines is almost a requirement to stay afloat in the competitive arena most principal investigators are finding themselves in. This study sought to synthesize existing research on leadership behaviors of these investigators in the agricultural discipline. The sections specifically addressed include team science, discipline structure, boundary work, challenges of interdisciplinary research, the direction of research, and leadership in interdisciplinary teams. After analyzing 32 articles, researchers determined that research should continue to investigate the role of leadership behaviors in primary investigators to continue to improve effectiveness.

AB  - This paper discusses the role of a writing centre in creating spaces for talk about and change in disciplinary writing pedagogy. It asks how collaborative partnerships between disciplinary academics and Writing Centre practitioners might be established and nurtured sustainably. Drawing on insights from two collaborations with academics in political studies and law, the article asserts that writing centre practitioners play a valuable role in talking about and changing the way academic writing and literacy is taught in the disciplines. This is shown by working consistently with the understanding that critical reading, thinking and writing are literacy acts rather than generic skills and must therefore be learned and practiced in the disciplines. By supporting disciplinary academics in re-examining course outcomes, materials and assessments, and moving away from a "skills approach" to writing, it is shown that building discipline-specific spaces for writing and literacy development is possible through these collaborative partnerships.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to share results of an exploratory qualitative research study designed to shed light on experiences of an interdisciplinary group of elementary school staff and graduate students in a school-based services project. A researcher conducted 20 interviews with staff and graduate students who represented the fields of education, nursing, and social work. Data revealed two primary themes--the importance and complexity of collaboration and differences between schools' adoption of project--and three secondary themes--need for increased nurse practitioner capacity, need for more parent involvement, and confusion over role and purpose. Building on these data, the authors provide an argument for and implications of school social workers as uniquely qualified to develop, lead, and facilitate interdisciplinary, community-university collaboration to increase meaningful family involvement and support children's success in schools through school-linked services.

AB  - This investigation examines English as foreign language college interdisciplinary and intercultural differences in learning strategy use and their implications for language processing. Positivism underpins this research at the levels of ontology (standardized variables), epistemology (detachment from the subjects) and methodology, using nomothetic research strategy (survey), instruments (questionnaires) and data analysis techniques (multivariate analysis of variance and analysis of variance). Main findings show interdisciplinary differences between the Humanities and Science majors in student use of compensation strategies in favour of the Science major while finding no intermajor differences in student use of other strategies. The findings indicate no ethnic differences in learning strategy use, since European, American and Eastern ethnicities almost use typical strategies. Therefore, disagreements on alleged unmediated deterministic relationships between ethnicity and cognitive processing remain in place. Instead, curriculum and instructional designs, strategy training and individual differences rather than cultural stereotypes influence language processing. For curriculum and instructional designs to facilitate language processing and pedagogy, effective strategies should underlie national, classroom-level and school-level curriculum developments.

AB  - That the value of interdisciplinarity in sustainability education is largely taken for granted reflects widely held views about the inherent complexity and uncertainty of sustainability issues and the need for holistic responses to them. Although there is an extensive literature on interdisciplinarity, there has been relatively little investigation of the ways in which teachers and learners deal with and respond to this central aspect of sustainability education. This paper presents data from two case studies of masters course in sustainability education, one in an English university and one in a Chinese university, and examines some of the contextual factors that support or limit their attempts to go beyond the bounded ways of thinking associated with more traditional academic disciplines. While some learners respond enthusiastically to interdisciplinarity, others experience forms of "cognitive dissonance". Interdisciplinarity requires individual teachers to operate as members of teams and to find ways of promoting dialogue between different perspectives, discourses and methods of approaching problems. The key to interdisciplinarity is an open attitude, a willingness to learn and an ability to engage with different ways of thinking about issues we face in common. (Contains 4 notes.)

AB  - The National Science Education Standards have highlighted the importance of active learning and reflection for contemporary scientific methods in K-12 classrooms, including the use of models. Computer modeling and visualization are tools that researchers employ in their scientific inquiry process, and often computer models are used in collaborative projects across disciplines. The goal of this project was to develop and field-test a module that used a computer model to teach marine sciences content in an applied, inquiry-based, and collaborative manner. Students used an estuarine transport model to explore the question of how circulation patterns affect planktonic organisms, demonstrating the interdisciplinary interaction of physics and biology. Our experience suggests that computer models, when used for inquiry, can help foster students' understanding of the nature of science and critical-thinking skills.

AB  - There is a strong need in the United States to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Drawing from sociocultural theory, we present approaches to establishing collaborations between computer engineering and mathematics/bilingual education faculty to address this need. We describe our work through the Advancing Out-of-School Learning in Mathematics and Engineering project by illustrating how an integrated curriculum that is based on mathematics with applications in image and video processing can be designed and how it can be implemented with middle school students from underrepresented groups.

AB  - Two green chemistry courses have been introduced into the liberal arts curriculum at Susquehanna University. Green chemistry was integrated into an existing course, Chemical Concepts, and offered as Green Chemical Concepts for nonscience majors. This course is designed to instill an appreciation for green chemistry in a large and diverse group of students. The course follows a separate interactive lecture and laboratory format, consists of an atom economy workshop, and ends with students' collaborative group presentations on "life cycle assessment of a greener product". A chemistry elective, Green Chemistry, was also developed and offered to science majors. It is important that students from various areas of science be exposed to green chemistry, as many innovative science discoveries are made today through interdisciplinary collaborative work. This course follows a unique workshop style, integrating lectures with laboratory activities, and ends with student proposal presentations on "designing a greener product or process". These courses will help students in all areas make intelligent decisions in the future and explore solutions based on green chemistry principles, which will eventually serve a greater community, thereby supporting the liberal arts mission.

AB  - Education policy in Australia has accelerated its aim to increase participation of under-represented groups in tertiary education including students who are culturally and linguistically diverse and have low socio-economic status. These students generally have not had prior access to privileged academic discourse, which can further disadvantage them in their participation and progress in tertiary education. In this article, we outline a cross-discipline curriculum initiative and pedagogy that draws on critical literacy and the metaphor of discourse community to integrate language and academic skills into community services qualifications. We argue that this--supports the genuine participation of under-represented (non-traditional) students. It aspires to not only support students' entry into the new academic terrain, but to enable students to adopt a critical stance to the discourses in which they are learning to participate. This we argue is crucial, when expertise is not just a way of meeting its ostensible purposes, but is also a way of exercising power. Although we report on the application of this initiative to entry level curricula (Diploma), we suggest that it has relevance and application to Bachelor levels in a range of disciplines, both in supporting pedagogy and for transition to Bachelor level study.

AB  - This paper focuses on an educational encounter between staff, students and the River Spey, Scotland in September 2009. The themes of water and embodied and culturally constructed ways of knowing the river were used to inform a creative non-fiction narrative that was drafted during and shortly after the journey, and was later refined. Textual descriptions of both significant and seemingly mundane aspects of the experience were built up through observation, discussion and reflection upon actual events as the authors "sought a solution" to writing a narrative-based representation of the experience. This process endeavours to represent an "insider's" view of the experience through descriptions that strive to portray the "meaning, structure and essence of the lived experience[s]" for a particular group of people at a particular moment in time. We propose that this kind of storytelling has the potential to represent important elements of outdoor educational experiences and the places where they occur that would be difficult to relay in other forms of research writing. The paper is presented in three parts: setting the scene; the textual representation of the Spey descent programme; and participants' evaluations and summary. (Contains 9 notes.)

AB  - Art education as a distinct academic discipline is relatively recent and closely related to the growth of specialist teacher qualification programmes in university education departments. Opportunities for art teachers to engage in research were first provided in advanced diploma courses and specialist masters programmes set up in university education departments. Later these were followed by specialist doctoral degrees. Since the majority of such programmes are located in education departments, research training has tended to be social science based. Recently there has been a flurry of publications by art and art education specialists devoted to explaining and extolling the idea of art practice as an alternative paradigm. This article analyses and discusses this development and the status of research in the specialist field, drawing on the author's recent experience of carrying out two systematic reviews of studies in art education. It examines strengths and weaknesses in the two research paradigms and suggests ways forward for improving training in art education research.

AB  - This paper describes an innovative teaching collaboration between two university professors to prepare undergraduate preservice teachers for planning, designing, and assessing interdisciplinary curriculum. Specifically, we were interested in whether deliberate efforts to integrate social studies and assessment methods courses would facilitate our students' learning compared to when such courses are taught in isolation (traditional instruction). Fifty-nine undergraduate elementary education preservice teachers served as participants. Approximately half received integrated instruction, the other half traditional instruction. In both instructional formats, preservice teachers were required to design and implement interdisciplinary units (i.e., lessons, assessments) during their clinical experience. Examination of interdisciplinary units revealed that preservice teachers receiving integrated instruction outperformed their nonintegrated coursework peers in developing, assessing, and reflecting on interdisciplinary content.

AB  - Higher education institutions and scientific funding agencies are emphasizing international projects that involve the integration and synergy between research groups, particularly if different disciplines are involved. Students with an education that reflects these trends will have more tools to succeed in the future, but it is challenging to provide this type of learning experience. Here we present the organization of a bi-national course with the goals to teach students protein structure/function relationships, which give them actual research experience in both computational and experimental laboratories, and engage them in an international networking experience. Two collaborative learning courses were organized at Loyola University Chicago (USA) and Universidad Nacional del Litoral (Argentina) for graduate and advanced undergraduate students. Multiple instructors at different stages in their careers gave lectures during the course and were able to interact with students on a one-on-one basis. Nearly every student from both institutions thoroughly enjoyed this approach, and they learned more about protein structure and gained important tools for their own research. We believe that this type of course design is applicable and transferable to other institutions and areas of science. We found that the combination of international networking and incorporation of actual research projects ignited the enthusiasm of students and instructors. Due to the success of these courses, we planned to incorporate them as regular series in our curriculum. (Contains 3 tables, 3 schemes, 2 figures, and 1 footnote.)

AB  - The combination of reverse iontophoresis and flame photometry provides an engaging analytical experiment that gives first-year undergraduate students a flavor of modern drug delivery and analyte extraction techniques while reinforcing core analytical concepts. The experiment provides a highly visual demonstration of the iontophoresis technique and engenders a more active participation in the analytical process. The construction of a safe and cost-effective iontophoresis system is described that has proven to be sufficiently robust for use within the undergraduate laboratory. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - The state of reading proficiency in the United States has been under attack for decades. Attempts to improve reading achievement through instructional practices have taken the profession through the "reading wars" to "balanced-reading" to "evidenced-based" methods. Unfortunately, the professional development of reading teachers persists in isolating reading instruction from the language processes and core knowledge that learning to read must build upon. The paper that follows is a call to action--a rationale for bringing together knowledge and skills across professional preparation areas--to achieve more effective reading instruction in the hope of closing the national achievement gap.

AB  - Product design is the convergence point for engineering and design thinking and practices. Until recently, product design has been taught either as a component of mechanical engineering or as a subject within design schools but increasingly there is global recognition of the need for greater synergies between industrial design and engineering training. Product design engineering (PDE) is a new interdisciplinary programme combining the strengths of the industrial design and engineering. This paper examines the emergence of PDE in an environment of critique of conventional engineering education and exemplifies the current spread of programmes endorsing a hybrid programme of design and engineering skills. The paper exemplifies PDE with the analysis of the programme offered at Swinburne University of Technology (Australia), showing how the teaching of "designerly" thinking to engineers produces a new graduate particularly suited to the current and future environment of produce design practice. The paper concludes with reflections on the significance of this innovative curriculum model for the field of product design and for engineering design in general. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - This manuscript describes faculty and student experiences and future activities of a multidisciplinary group of university faculty who are implementing inquiry-based learning (IBL) in their classrooms for the first time. This opportunity to implement the IBL instructional method was provided to the faculty through a grant from the university's Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE). The goal of this paper is to provide a discussion on the implementation of IBL in the classroom and students' responses to IBL. The multidisciplinary group was from the following disciplines: philosophy, journalism and mass communications, business and technology education, public health, civil engineering, and social work. This manuscript describes the (1) fundamentals of the CTE inquiry grant, (2) fundamentals of IBL, (3) IBL strategies and implementation, (4) students' responses to IBL, and (5) the implications of IBL for higher education.

AB  - Increased emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches to research and graduate education is a common feature of academic strategic plans written since around 2000. This emphasis follows from the coupling of two propositions, one about the characteristics of academic research and the other about the hierarchy within America's higher-education system. Strategic commitment is not implementation, and progress towards interdisciplinarity has varied across universities. Four national studies over the course of a decade, which included site visits, interviews with university administrators and faculty members, and reviews of relevant documents at a cross-section of major research universities, all reveal that movement at some universities has been rapid, at others slow, and at others blocked. Despite their strategic-planning documents advocating greater attention to an interdisciplinary approach to research and graduate education, well-known universities show four distinct patterns of responses. This article discusses four paths that are discernible in the post-2000 implementation of strategic-planning commitments to interdisciplinary activities. These include: (1) capitalizing on strengths; (2) changing paths; (3) making the most of modest means; and (4) staying stuck. The article also discusses three factors that affect the pace of implementation namely: (1) the status quo; (2) leadership; and (3) resources.

AB  - In this article I explain why I wrote the set of teaching notes on Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) and why they look the way they do. The notes were intended as a student reference to question, highlight and write over as much as they wish during an initial practical demonstration of the threshold concept being introduced, in this case inferring the existence of quantized electron energy levels in atoms from class room observations. That is why the notes commence with an overview of how a handheld spectroscope works followed by how they are used for analysing emission spectroscopy observations. The notes decode the noun phrase "Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy" into its individual sequenced components by defining Light Spectra [right arrow] Spectroscopy [right arrow] Emission Spectroscopy [right arrow] Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (AES) [right arrow] Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. There is every expectation that the teacher delivering this introduction has provided a class set of hand held spectroscopes to the students and a variety of demonstration emission sources such as hollow cathode lamps for mono atomic helium and neon plus a sodium vapour lamp. This concrete experience can now be developed into abstract knowledge and analytical applications in line with the South Australian Stage 2 Chemistry Curriculum Statement (CS) requiring students to understand the principles of AES and AAS. It is also an explicit departure from the more traditional secondary school method of presenting electron energy levels in atoms as a form of ritualized knowledge. The teaching notes that follow show how practical inquiry in the secondary school class room can remain the foundation of scientific method and learning with even the most troublesome of knowledge, such as electron energy levels in atoms.

AB  - Purpose: The paper aims to gain a better understanding of how different disciplines work together to develop new technologies. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs qualitative methods in the form of semi-structured interviews and observations. A socio-cultural approach is taken and the concept of the activity system is used to examine emerging practices. Findings: In the process of creating common practices the community overcomes some of the challenges normally associated with disciplinary diversity. What develops cannot really be described as a convergence of knowledge, more as an intertwining of work practices. Research limitations/implications: Although only tentative conclusions can be drawn from a single case study, the findings may have implications for the organisation of multidisciplinary tasks. Originality/value: The paper suggests a conceptualisation of emerging interdisciplinary practice and provides a descriptive account of knowledge creation in a new field within nanosciences and nanotechnologies.

AB  - From media news coverage to fluctuating gas prices, the topic of energy is hard to ignore. However, little connection often exists between energy use in our daily lives and the presentation of energy-related concepts in the science classroom. The concepts of energy production and consumption bring together knowledge from several science disciplines to both enhance student understanding and seek solutions to important global problems. This article provides an overview of activities and discussions teachers can use to address the questions raised about biofuels in biology, chemistry, and physics classes. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - Although interdisciplinary teamwork is a recommended practice and important for coordinated interdisciplinary programming in special education, there is limited research on pedagogical practices to prepare professionals to work together effectively. This study examined the effectiveness of a graduate interdisciplinary teamwork course taught through two distinct learning formats (week-long face-to-face and hybrid) on graduate students' teamwork knowledge, skills, and dispositions. Using the How People Learn framework (National Research Council, 2000), further analysis was conducted to consider the relationship of students' prior teamwork experiences to their entry-level knowledge and satisfaction with course features. Results indicated that students in both learning formats reported improvements in teamwork knowledge and skills; however, differences in learners' prior experiences and their satisfaction with the course, course structure, assignments, and activities was found. Further examination of pedagogy is needed to characterize how professionals are prepared with knowledge, skills, and dispositions for effective teamwork.

AB  - The unity of knowledge represents an old idea with new manifestations. During the last decades integrated approaches in teaching and learning have become increasingly popular. Applications of integrative approaches between the arts and other school subjects exist in many countries around the world, offering insights into the problems and challenges that such efforts can result into. In this paper a short review of the relevant literature in support of integrative curricula, as well as problems and concerns caused by their application, will set the basis for the description of the practice-based research project that is reported. The project brought together a kindergarten teacher and two researchers, under a collaborative model of inquiry in a pre-primary school setting in Cyprus. An attempt was made to enrich the teaching of musical concepts through the use of activities and practices borrowed from other disciplines. More specifically, the study sought to investigate whether children's understanding of the music concepts taught was evident, what was the children's response to the designed units and what were the teacher's perceptions of the educational atmosphere before and after the application of the designed units. Six half-hour music lessons, comprising two different units--pitch and tempo--were taught and videotaped. The design of the different units and the organization and choice of activities, apart from drawing from the literature on integration, was heavily based on the theory of multiple intelligences by H. Gardner. A "follow-up" video stimulated recall interview was conducted at the end of each unit. The videotaped lessons, the observation field notes, the interviews with the teacher, the teacher's self reflection as well as the feedback by the researchers, provided both a wealth of data as well as interesting interpretations. The findings suggest that the pre-primary school children that participated in the study responded with enthusiasm to innovative activities that related music with other subjects. In addition, each child was given the opportunity to better understand the concepts taught through his/her own ways of learning. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Policymakers and industry leaders are calling for a 21st century education that is more interdisciplinary in nature, including the ability to solve problems and think creatively. Traditional teaching practices that present subjects as separate and distinct disciplines do not encourage students to make connections between subjects in school and in the inherently interdisciplinary nature of their daily lives. It is important for educators to help students link multiple subjects with the world outside the classroom, encouraging reform that implements a multidisciplinary approach and real world applications. Efforts to include true interdisciplinary experiences in today's schools face many obstacles: teachers as subject specialists, class time schedules, traditional school structures limiting teacher time for curriculum development or collaboration, and lack of understanding of interdisciplinary learning. Rather than true interdisciplinary experiences, students usually participate instead in thematic or multidisciplinary approaches. This article describes a study that examined the experiences of a teacher team: two elementary school teachers, a music teacher and a science teacher, as they developed and implemented innovative, interdisciplinary curriculum based around BioMusic. This emerging field of research combines physical and biological sciences of sound and animal communication with concepts from the discipline of music. Through BioMusic, this project involved designing curricula to provide opportunities for elementary school students to gain a deeper understanding of their world, expanding beyond the traditional classroom presentation of music and the physical properties of sound.

AB  - "Drama for Schools" ("DFS") is a professional development program in drama-based instruction shaped by theories of critical pedagogy and constructivism. In 2007, the Director of "DFS" invited an educational psychology faculty member to develop a research and evaluation component for the program. This article discusses and troubles this interdisciplinary partnership through the lens of praxis, the continual cycle of thought, action, reflection and response. In this article, we touch upon implications of activated praxis such as (a) how "DFS" has evolved in its identity as a research-based program model; (b) how outcome measurement was embedded into program implementation; (c) the experience of disseminating findings in both arts-based and educational research spaces; and (d) how long-range planning was guided both by research and program priorities. We conclude with identification of how this process has resulted in praxis for participants across all levels of the partnership. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Abstract: Students' perception of 8 criteria (rationale of the problem; interdisciplinary learning; facilitator asked essential questions; learner's skills; assessments; facilitation procedures; team's use of resources [team collaboration], and facilitator within a problem-based learning context) were assessed for a food biotechnology course that was part of a 3rd year biotechnology program. The mean score for "perceived learner's skills" was the lowest whereas those for "facilitation" and "facilitator" were the highest. Selected qualitative comments from students were also analyzed. This study demonstrated interdisciplinary learning as the students could make meaningful connections across different science disciplines. Further investigation is needed to develop possible strategies to accommodate the challenges in making meaningful connections across science disciplines as well as to develop a defined hybrid method for analysis of students' responses.

AB  - Ethical approaches to practice and research in counselling and arts/psychotherapies demand an urgent attention to body politics. Bodies are not neutral; gender, sexuality, ethnicity and class are socio-political aspects that shape our mental, emotional and physical selves and inform our ethical values. Drawing from the author's embodied practice as interdisciplinary practitioner-researcher, the aim of this paper is to examine the inseparability of ethics and bodies and explore how autobiographical, relational and political aspects of our selves-in-motion give rise to and build upon "ethically important moments". The paper concludes with expanding possibilities; that highlighting ethical tensions within the lived experiences of bodies-in-motion allows for politically progressive approaches to practice that reflect the emerging paradigm shift of a post-Cartesian and interdisciplinary age.

AB  - Introducing the general education curriculum in a required first-year seminar can be challenging. However, it provides a great opportunity to influence students' perceptions. The results of this study indicate that doing so increases student appreciation for general education and increases student confidence in general education course selection. This should enhance the classroom learning environment for all as students approach general education classes with greater interest and understanding. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - This article describes and evaluates an interdisciplinary, experiential service-learning project that combined environmental studies and marketing courses at a liberal arts college over a 2-year period. The inherent tensions between these two disciplines regarding issues of environmental protection and conservation make this project's contribution unique. The project is in line with the increased emphasis on environmental issues as a key strategic consideration for both marketing academics and practitioners. Environmental studies students identified and prioritized solid waste streams. Marketing students developed social marketing initiatives aimed at reducing the high-priority waste streams. The two best initiatives were implemented by students via pilot projects in environmental studies and marketing courses. Students in environmental studies were able to identify and apply ways in which marketing tools can be employed to promote social causes and effect positive environmental behavioral change. Marketing students applied marketing concepts to a real-life situation, while gaining a greater awareness of environmental issues and the role of businesses in environmental stewardship. The authors summarize the project's learning objectives, planning and design, implementation, and assessment of learning outcomes. Challenges and obstacles encountered and recommendations for the development and implementation of similar learning projects are also discussed. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Purpose: The African American Outreach Satellite (Satellite) provides educational outreach to facilitate African American recruitment for longitudinal studies at the Washington University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). This descriptive article characterizes the Satellite's recruitment methods, plan for community engagement, results of recruitment efforts, and potential for replication. Design and Methods: The Satellite developed a comprehensive outreach and recruitment plan that identifies and addresses barriers to research participation. The Satellite conducts community outreach and recruitment programs and training for health care providers. Results: Enrollment of cognitively healthy and mildly demented African Americans for participation in all ADRC studies increased following implementation of the recruitment plan. Current African American participation rates for ADRC studies include 39% for lumbar puncture, 43% for positron emission tomography with Pittsburgh Compound-B, 52% for magnetic resonance imaging, 95% for apolipoprotein E genotype testing, and 100% for clinical and cognitive assessment. Implications: The Satellite reduces barriers to research participation, encourages retention through sustained interactions with participants and their families, and develops lasting partnerships with community organizations and health professionals who care for African American elders.

AB  - There is growing interest in interdisciplinary training programs for law  students. The goal of these programs is to prepare law students for the real world interdisciplinary settings they will face in their careers. However, there exists little research to provide evidence of the utility of such training. This study examined the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary psychology and law training program on law students using a multi-method approach (i.e., knowledge tests and focus group discussion). Findings suggest that interdisciplinary training of law students increased law students' knowledge of law and psychology, was enjoyed by law students, and had a beneficial impact on law students' educational experience.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to unpack notions of class, culture, and race as they relate to multidisciplinary team (MDT) professionals and their perceptions of prevalence in child sexual abuse cases in Native and non-Native rural Alaska communities. Power and privilege within professional settings is significant for all social work professionals and influences the ways in which systemic issues of power and privilege mediate decision making. Fifteen MDT participants from two separate rural communities were interviewed. Emergent themes include perceptions on incidences and reporting of child sexual abuse, cultural dissonance, and systemic challenges. Policy and practice implications are discussed.

AB  - Microteaching, a standard method for developing teaching skills, places high importance on peer feedback, which is guided by post-session feedback forms. This paper focuses on how feedback forms can shape what becomes understood as important to teaching. A sample of 10 microteaching evaluation forms drawn from North American postsecondary education institutions were examined using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Through a mixed-methods, interdisciplinary approach combining quantitative form classification based on distinct teaching elements with qualitative analysis drawing on Foucauldian and post-structural feminisms, key challenges are identified in the way that peer feedback forms may shape perceptions of what constitutes "good teaching". We interpret that the close attention paid to the management of the body and the disproportionate focus on presentation and style may foreclose other modes of teaching beyond a conventional lecture-based class. This leads to a discussion on the ways in which the evaluation forms can be enhanced to provide a more effective educational tool. (Contains 8 notes, 1 table and 1 figure.)

AB  - As qualitative research methodologies continue to evolve and develop, both students and experienced researchers are showing greater interest in learning about and developing new approaches. To meet this need, faculty at the University of Manitoba created the Qualitative Research Group (QRG), a community of practice that utilizes experiential learning in the context of social relationships to nurture social interaction, create opportunities to share knowledge, support knowledge creation, and build collaborations among all disciplines. While many other qualitative research networks such as the QRG may exist, little has been published on their early development or the activities that contribute to the growth and sustainability of active collaboration. To address this gap, the authors of the paper will share the steps taken in developing the QRG, including a needs assessment identifying members' strengths and support needs, regular communication through a listserv, to the successful workshop based on the community of practice concept. Lessons learned during the initial development of the QRG are shared with the intent of contributing ideas for developing and supporting qualitative research in other institutions and prompting further consideration of ways to support and enrich every generation of qualitative researchers.

AB  - Businesses function within a cross-functional, integrative setting, and this necessitates providing a learning environment for students that is comparable to real-life work projects. Two upper-level university classes in marketing and information systems worked collaboratively with a snack food business to design and build a Web site based on a conceptual framework model that met specific marketing and operational objectives. Student teams developed appropriate Web site strategies intended to meet the goals and objectives, and made formal presentations to the client. Information systems students then built the designed site. This collaborative, interdisciplinary project created a richer, more complex, and realistic learning environment.

AB  - Learning modules provide an effective means of encouraging cognition and active learning. This paper discusses several such modules that have been developed within a course on weather radar applications intended for students from Electrical Engineering and Meteorology. The modules were designed both to promote interdisciplinary exchange between the students and to guide them from a theoretical to an applied understanding of weather radar and the interactions of radio waves with geophysical media. The learning modules introduce students to various means of acquiring weather radar data from real-time and archival sources and ways in which to query and visualize them. They are also tasked with analyzing data from several actual and significant meteorological events and asked to assess the strengths and limitations of current methods of retrieving rainfall rates. Data sources include both weather radars and complementary surface-based instrumentation. The modules may be used in a variety of locations and by a diversity of students. Although developed for weather radar applications, the concepts discussed are applicable to other interdisciplinary classroom environments. (Contains 3 tables and 5 figures.)

AB  - Researchers have yet to agree on an approach that supports how adults best learn novel motor skills in formal educational contexts. The literature fails to adequately discuss adult motor learning from the standpoint of adult education. Instead, the subject is addressed by other disciplines. This review attempts to integrate perspectives across disciplines to enhance understanding of adult motor learning. The review suggests a disciplinary disconnect but finds several potential integrations: (a) a unifying framework between representational motor learning models and reflective practice; (b) the applicability of modeling approaches to experiential frameworks; (c) the relationship between chaining, motor programs, variability of practice, and analogy learning to "doing" and "action" in experiential learning; and (d) the role of embedded motor learning approaches within situated environments. Research should continue to examine how aspects of didactic approaches affect the effectiveness of the modeling approach and how situated learning environments naturalistically use motor learning approaches.

AB  - What patterns of multimodal rhetoric characterizes the most successful texts meant for learning--inside or outside school? This article argues that the balance between cohesion and tension in the interplay between modes is an issue at the core of this challenging question. Texts meant for learning need both cohesion and tension in order to be both understandable and engaging. While cohesion has long been a central issue of interest among researchers of multimodal texts, the same can hardly be said about multimodal tension. The article offers a discussion of the concepts of multimodal cohesion and tension, relating them to three dimensions of user-text interaction: the dimensions of perception, interpretation and performativity. This elaboration concludes with the outline of a framework model for analytical purposes. The model is, thereafter, used in an illustrative analysis of an award-winning multimodal feature story collected from the online site of the "New York Times". (Contains 19 notes and 4 figures.)

In this paper, I aim to explore the appropriateness of the materials we English as Foreign Language (EFL) teachers use in our classrooms, and to present a number of reasons why it might be worth reconsidering a more interdisciplinary approach.

AB  - Middle school students are naturally curious about their expanding possibilities. This stage of their lives is a time of transition, of figuring out who they are and where they belong in the world. Many students also think that the world they look at through the classroom window is distant and unconnected to the world of chalkboards and pop quizzes they inhabit between the hours of eight and three. Models of middle school education have often included teacher and community expectations developmentally inappropriate for young adolescents; in fact, middle school students were often treated more like smaller versions of high school students. A newer model of the middle school seeks to explore many areas of recreational as well as academic and vocational interest. However, exploration opportunities are limited only to what the school can imagine. In this article, the author talks about interdisciplinary instruction and how this approach makes learning more effective for all students especially adolescents.

AB  - This study evaluates the work of a multi-disciplinary Behaviour Support Team developed to support schools in managing problematic behaviour. An evidence base to inform future service delivery is developed, using a model of evaluation which incorporates both quantitative, outcome data and more explanatory qualitative data, incorporating the views of service users. Focusing on the first year of service delivery, interventions are evaluated as effective by client schools and positive changes in pupil behaviour are demonstrated. The mechanisms contributing to successful interventions are analysed, including the importance of maintaining a collaborative and systemic approach to problem resolution. The evaluation suggests ways in which educational psychologists working in multi-disciplinary teams can enhance schools' capacity to manage challenging behaviour. (Contains 2 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - Interdisciplinarity in doctoral education currently is strongly advocated by governments and universities as important in developing knowledge useful in addressing significant public problems. However, the efficacy of these claims has not been subject to empirical investigation. Using longitudinal data covering a 13-year period, this research addresses this limitation by examining how variation in interdisciplinary emphasis in social work doctoral programs affects the scholarly orientation and productivity of graduates. The findings suggest that interdisciplinary doctoral education makes a difference, with graduates from programs with higher levels of interdisciplinarity demonstrating more generalist scholarly orientations, and achieving higher levels of scholarly productivity.

AB  - This study investigates librarians' satisfaction with general interdisciplinary databases for undergraduate research and explores possibilities for improving these databases. Results from a national survey suggest that librarians at a variety of institutions are relatively satisfied overall with the content and usability of general, interdisciplinary databases, especially for undergraduate research. Concerns surface, however, with regard to specific features such as indexing and subject headings; additionally, responses from librarians at two-year institutions indicate that general, interdisciplinary databases are not as useful for 2-year college students. Findings are further discussed in the context of recommendations for librarians and database vendors. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - Any attempt to discern the purpose of honors education and to integrate it with the unique ethos of a Christian institution can prove to be difficult. Yet, describing and articulating a sense of purpose is essential for an honors program to justify itself. This essay contends that a philosophy of education based on Augustine's "Confessions" can provide such a sense of purpose to an honors program, not to supplant its modern aims but to complement them. The "Confessions" can be seen not just as a spiritual autobiography but also as an intellectual autobiography. Augustine's intellectual journey narrates a kind of Christian education that strongly contrasts with the utilitarianism and materialism of the contemporary academy. The major elements of Augustine's approach to learning have been the basis for a distinctive culture in the honors program at Palm Beach Atlantic University. By pursuing an Augustinian kind of education, the university's honors program has tried to define itself as a distinct subculture within, and an enhancement to, the university's interdenominational Christian mission. In this essay, the author describes how Augustinian values help to shape a distinctive subculture in the honors program of his nondenominational institution. With its emphasis on formative (as opposed to instrumental) knowledge, and its concentration on cultivating a "well-ordered soul," the honors program at Palm Beach Atlantic seeks to promote what Augustine calls a life of "rest in the Lord."

AB  - A new team-taught course focused on interdisciplinary teaching and integrative learning was offered at Grand Valley State University during the Summer of 2008 at a regional campus in Holland, Michigan. Faculty from Engineering and Business developed this community-based, alternative-format course to engage students in the question: "What will the community look like in 10 years?" A unique, four-week-long course emerged: Socially Conscious Innovation. Given the nontraditional nature of the course, the faculty engaged a fellow faculty member and a campus administrator to solicit feedback in the following areas: course architecture, interdisciplinary team teaching, and community involvement. This article outlines the educational philosophies and guiding principles used in developing Socially Conscious Innovation, and provides a summary of faculty, administrator, and student feedback used to improve the course for the upcoming year.

AB  - Discussions related to constructivist learning theories have become more prevalent within various subdisciplines of Kinesiology. This discourse, however, has typically been placed within the context of K-12 education. The purpose of this article is to examine constructivist theories (cognitive and social constructivism and situated learning theory) within the context of higher education. We first place "constructivism" within the context of education in general, and then examine through relevant literature its uses within kinesiology. We then describe examples of "constructivist" pedagogy and learning within our program and higher education in general. Ultimately we urge further discourse related to constructivist learning theories within higher education subdiscipline fields in Kinesiology.

Seeking to enhance stakeholders' understanding of evaluation concepts and practices, and in an effort to create evaluation cultures, organizations have been implementing a variety of strategies to help their members learn from and about evaluation. Though there is a great deal of ECB occurring in a wide range of organizations, there is no overarching conceptual model that describes how ECB should be designed and implemented to maximize its success. If ECB is about learning how to think evaluatively and how to engage in sound evaluation practice, then something is missing in our work. The purpose of this article is to describe a model of ECB that may be used for designing and implementing capacity building activities and processes as well as for conducting empirical research on this topic.

AB  - Multidisciplinary courses are being developed at a number of US colleges and universities to highlight the connections between the rise or fall of world civilizations and the sustainable or unsustainable uses of soil and water resources. The content presented in these courses is complex because it includes concepts from disciplines as varied as geology, soil science, politics, economics, history, and anthropology. The learning goals for the courses include developing skills in the critical analysis of complex "real-world" problems for which there is often no simple or correct solution. Didactic materials for such courses are limited. Field trips to sites around the world that present some of the issues covered in the course would be ideal, but are logistically challenging. We considered that a series of virtual field trips (VFTs) to sites around the world would allow us to present students with complicated real-world situations, with which to practice critical analysis skills. The VFTs envisaged are neither tutorials nor field/lab exercises. Rather, they are meant to be complex, multi-faceted representations of a past or current civilization and how it affects or is affected by its environment. We expect that the students will use the VFTs to explore the relationships between physical geography and culture and how the decisions or actions of a civilization impact natural resources and the environment and thus affect its fate. A goal of the VFTs is that through consideration of their experiences, students arrive at novel associations that lead to dynamic in-class dialogue about the material presented and a deeper understanding of the intricacies of the situation in the field. This article describes the process of assembling a VFT, and analyzes the technological and didactic choices the process requires. Our experience with a pilot VFT suggests that no single medium (i.e., video clips, interactive maps, animation sequences, etc.) is comprehensive enough to meet the course learning goals. Thus, a web-based, open architecture format was selected for the VFTs because of its simplicity, flexibility and extensibility. Each medium was selected for its ability to support the course learning goals. The learning process was mediated by the VFT text, questions for thought, and in-class discussions. Preliminary results with the pilot VFT are encouraging. (Contains 7 figures.)

AB  - This study examined the use of collaborative interdisciplinary authentic tasks as a context in which learners develop and use self-regulated learning (SRL) processes. Participants included sixty-four students from a U.S. middle school whose residents are largely from low-income families. Students worked in groups to design and carry out an authentic, interdisciplinary project over a 9-week period. A Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) analysis suggested that students' individual SRL increased over the course of the project and that co-regulated learning (CRL) moderated this relationship. Furthermore, one group was selected as an exemplar case to provide an explanation of how co-regulation occurred and influenced SRL in this collaborative group. Theoretical and practical implications of the research are discussed.

AB  - The authors explore the implications of recent proposals for a focus on power and social change in community psychology research and add needed contextual and methodological specificity. An expanded model of psychopolitical validity is presented that merges Isaac Prilleltensky's (this issue, pp. 116-136) domains, or stages of empowerment (oppression, liberation, wellness), with four ecological context domains (physical, sociocultural, economic, political) and greater clarity regarding levels of analysis. The physical-environmental context is used to illustrate some of the questions that may be generated by the expanded model. After discussing the role of democratic freedoms and institutions and the equitable distribution of decision-making power in sustainable community development, the case is made for action research as a potent paradigm to move the field toward those goals. Multilevel and spatial analyses and transdisciplinary research (conceptually and/or methodologically integrative collaboration across multiple disciplines) are underutilized in Community Psychology.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to describe an assignment for a legal environment of business course that builds upon and reinforces strong business communication practices. The assignment discusses "piggybacking," which is the unauthorized use of another person's wireless Internet connection. In this assignment, the students are required (1) to evaluate timely business issues in a critical way and (2) to produce a short report, based on a selected position, that demonstrates both skill in professional writing and an understanding of the underlying business law implications of their perspective. Further, the students must discuss and defend their positions in a persuasive, analytical, and logical manner. This assignment and activity aim to guide students to more effective forms of business communication through substantive short report writing and a simulated public meeting that emphasizes oral presentation skills. Business students benefit from as much exposure to best communication practices as possible; as such, reinforcing these practices across undergraduate and graduate business curricula is essential. Courses in the legal environment of business are well-matched to this interdisciplinarity, and the reinforcement of best practices in these courses provides opportunities to assist all students to become the most effective communicators (and, therefore, the most effective business professionals) that they can be.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to share the experience gained in, and the efforts made toward, introducing and implementing a new course in the challenging and important area of geophysical signal processing at the Electrical Engineering (EE) Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM), Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The new course, titled "Geo-Signal Processing," was offered both at the graduate level and as a special topics course to undergraduates. The course was developed in collaboration with the Earth Sciences Department at KFUPM. This paper contributes new information because it stresses the multidisciplinary aspects of digital signal processing (DSP) technologies when applied to estimating the Earth's layered structure on the basis of seismic data. Unlike many Earth sciences seismic data processing courses, this Geo-Signal Processing course also emphasizes that the perspective taken by those working in DSP is different from that taken by geophysicists. The course presents DSP with particular emphasis on seismic data signals and the artifacts accompanying them while covering the principles and algorithms needed for processing seismic signals in both deterministic and statistical fashion. Topics include, but are not limited to, basic seismic theory, acquisition of seismic data, analysis of seismic signals and noise, deterministic filtering of seismic data, and statistical processing of seismic data.

AB  - Enterprise systems provide companies with centralized data management, business process support and integrated data flow between functional areas. Thanks to academic alliances offered by companies such as SAP, Oracle, Microsoft and others, universities can also take advantage of the integrated features of enterprise system to give business students an interdisciplinary learning experience. Businesses have found that having an enterprise system does not automatically lead to a competitive advantage and employees may not take advantage of better access to data for analysis and decision-making. There is a gap in the workplace between users' skills and what they need to know to fully utilize enterprise systems. To truly be "knowledge workers" employees need skills in five areas: (1) technical, (2) statistical and analytical, (3) knowledge of data, (4) knowledge of the business, and (5) communication/partnering. Business school graduates with hands-on experience with enterprise systems have a stronger set of knowledge work skills and are better prepared to use enterprise systems. This paper describes what one business school in the southwest United States has done over a five-year plan to incorporate enterprise systems software into several courses and teach an integrated curricula. The goals of the plan were to give students hands-on experience with enterprise systems, teach a cross-functional perspective of business and help students understand the way to use enterprise systems for decision support. One course in particular is highlighted in this paper because of its extensive use of SAP enterprise system software and ERPsim, a simulation that runs in SAP.

AB  - Unilateral enterprise resource planning (ERP) curriculum improvements from the instructor's perspective are likely to generate only limited success. Understanding student motivations and beliefs with ERP systems is the missing link to effective ERP education. Relatively little attention in the ERP literature has been given to student learning associated with ERP experience, and almost none to factors influencing current and expected student beliefs and behaviors relative to ERP. The complexity of ERP systems demands that beliefs and behaviors be considered when planning ERP curricula. In the present study, the Theory of Planned Behavior was extended to examine students' intentions to explore additional aspects of ERP after their class exercises. When considering all students, attitude and subjective norm had positive and significant effects on intentions to continue ERP learning. Subjective norm also affected attitude, and availability of support materials had a positive effect on subjective norm. Distinctive patterns are found for the construct relationships between student groups who valued ERP education (the engaged) and those who placed little or no value on ERP education (the undecided). Results from competing model analyses indicate that support materials influenced the engaged and undecided groups differently. Strategies for ERP curriculum design are provided.

AB  - This article focuses on the views of pre-service teachers regarding an appropriate model for integrating HIV/AIDS education at a Faculty of Education. The final-year foundation and intermediate phase teachers were introduced to integrating HIV/AIDS education in Mathematics education and reflected on their four years of training. By using self-study methodology, the opinions and experiences of pre-service teachers of the two models of HIV/AIDS education in teacher preparation were explored, aiming to improve the manner in which pre-service teachers could be prepared to teach in the social and educational context of HIV/AIDS. The pre-service teachers indicated that they are under-prepared to teach in this context. Pre-service teachers were of the opinion that they could, however, be better prepared through HIV/AIDS teacher education that includes both discipline/subject and integrated models of teacher education.

AB  - As a result of reduced formal instruction and reduced direct experience in the natural environment, students suffer from a deficiency in geographic literacy. Informal learning environments, such as a model railroad exhibit at a history museum, can be exploited to introduce key geographic concepts (e.g., scalar compression, landscape transformations, and human-environment interaction). Presented here are historically and geographically accurate visualization tools developed via community collaboration across disciplines (geography/education) and institutions (university/museum/community volunteers). This article highlights geographic learning that takes place in informal education settings. (Contains 8 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - There is increasing enthusiasm for teaching approaches that combine mathematics and biology. The call for integrating more quantitative work in biology education has led to new teaching tools that improve quantitative skills. Little is known, however, about whether increasing interdisciplinary work can lead to adverse effects, such as the development of broader but shallower skills or the possibility that math anxiety causes some students to disengage in the classroom, or, paradoxically, to focus so much on the mathematics that they lose sight of its application for the biological concepts in the center of the unit at hand. We have developed and assessed an integrative learning module and found disciplinary learning gains to be equally strong in first-year students who actively engaged in embedded quantitative calculations as in those students who were merely presented with quantitative data in the context of interpreting biological and biostatistical results. When presented to advanced biology students, our quantitative learning tool increased test performance significantly. We conclude from our study that the addition of mathematical calculations to the first year and advanced biology curricula did not hinder overall student learning, and may increase disciplinary learning and data interpretation skills in advanced students.

AB  - School psychologists often are involved with the provision of services to students with chronic physical health conditions and mental health problems. However, collaborative efforts between school psychologists and the medical professionals who treat these youth often are lacking despite the benefits that may result from interdisciplinary collaboration. To address this disconnect, the authors discuss various ways school psychologists and medical professionals can collaborate to enhance the provision of services to youth with health and mental health problems in a response-to-intervention framework. Specifically, the authors discuss ways in which school psychologists can improve interdisciplinary collaboration across multiple tiers of service provision. In addition, the authors provide a case example to illustrate the benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration among school psychologists, allied health professionals, and physicians.

AB  - Using contemporary insights from feminist critical theory and the literary device of synecdoche, we argue that transdisciplinary knowledge is productive because it maximizes serendipity. We  draw on student learning experiences in a course on "Gender and Science" to illustrate how the dichotomous frameworks and part-whole correspondences that are predominant in much disciplinary discourse must be dismantled for innovative intellectual work to take place. In such a process, disciplinary presumptions interrogate and unsettle one another to produce novel questions and answers.

AB  - Cultural events are of interest to scientists working in many scientific domains. Given this, an interdisciplinary science of culture may provide a more thorough understanding of cultural phenomena. However, interdisciplinary sciences depend upon the validity and vitality of the participating disciplines. This article reviews the nature of scientific enterprises and problematic conceptualizations of interdisciplinary science from an interbehavioral perspective. Metasystemic and systemic foundations for an interdisciplinary science of culture are proposed. (Contains 7 footnotes.)

AB  - This qualitative study examines two US interdisciplinary graduate programs which involve faculty and students from different disciplines. Haworth and Conrad's engagement theory of quality graduate education was applied. It was found that when interdisciplinary programs facilitate engagement by supporting diversity, participation, connections, and interactive teaching and learning, students report positive experiences. Engagement is particularly achievable when an interdisciplinary administrative unit (e.g., a school or center) grants degrees and serves as a tenure home for faculty. Students earning degrees in traditional departments had more difficulty connecting interdisciplinary requirements to their disciplinary work, and were often faced with incompatible program requirements or advice from faculty members. Although they desire to do interdisciplinary work, the students and faculty in traditional departments are required to meet additional and often conflicting requirements. Engagement may further be complicated because these participants feel divided between collaborations, social networks, and expectations that pull them in different directions.

AB  - This longitudinal case study of a single school examines changes in the educational beliefs of 10 elementary-school teachers who experienced a constructivist-based trans-disciplinary curriculum (CTC). After 3 years of experiencing a CTC, which emerges through theme-oriented and project-based learning, teachers' educational beliefs had changed to demonstrate multiple views rather than pure beliefs. Teachers' beliefs form a mosaic of complementary visions and the process of change in teachers' beliefs reflects the "overlapping" rather than the "staircase" metaphor.

AB  - Recent guidance for UK government policy makers has warned that HEIs face an uncertain future and has advocated transdisciplinary curricula. Earlier, in 2005, two other UK government papers highlighted the advantages of integrating design-related strategies into business environments and addressed the impact creativity could have on business performance. A key recommendation was to strengthen the relationships between businesses, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and creative professionals from design disciplines who could positively affect business performance and provide digital media, industrial design, packaging, graphic design, branding and advertising. If the successful entrepreneur has personal skills, attributes and behaviours that extend beyond the purely commercial, HEIs need to develop students with capabilities that meet the entrepreneurial challenges of the knowledge economy. This paper draws on entrepreneurship and business education strategies that have evolved out of art and design disciplines at Swansea Metropolitan University in the UK. The authors argue that curriculum development should incorporate "business" acumen in all programmes outside business schools and should develop the fundamental skills for developing and exploiting "creativity" in programmes within them. The provision of a symbiotic experience of business and creativity across the curriculum has many benefits, not least because it responds to calls from entrepreneurship educators for a paradigm shift to develop right-brain entrepreneurial capabilities as well as left-brain analytical skills. Such pedagogies are well-established in the design disciplines and the evidence suggests that they are important as a wide-reaching, cross- disciplinary enabling strategy.

AB  - Teachers involved in the implementation of a curriculum innovation can be prepared for this task through a professional development program. In this paper, we describe essential characteristics (identified empirically and theoretically) for such a professional development program that promotes the acquisition of competences by these teachers. The innovation deals with the introduction of modules from a new multidisciplinary subject, in which elements from physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and physical geography are integrated. A 3-step approach was used to identify the essential characteristics: (a) evidence from classroom practice, (b) characteristics of the new subject, and (c) theoretical and empirical evidence from curriculum implementation studies. Analysis of the data showed that 5 characteristics need particular attention in a professional development program.

AB  - In 1999, the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science introduced a new kind of compulsory arts education in secondary school aimed at stimulating cultural participation among Dutch youth. This article examines whether the course, called "Cultural and Artistic Education," succeeds in doing so. Data on 3,851 secondary school students (ages 14-16) in the Netherlands reveal that enrollment in Cultural and Artistic Education stimulates participation in high culture and, to a smaller degree, popular culture. The effects apply equally to students with different gender, ethnic minority, and family background status. A positive effect on attitude toward art only partly holds and is less convincing. No effects were found on the complexity of the attended cultural activities. (Contains 5 tables, 2 figures, and 1 endnote.)

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to describe the collaborative efforts between an Early Childhood Teacher Education Program and a Child Disability Health Care Program to incorporate a transdisciplinary model in the preparation of early childhood teachers in inclusive practice. Recent studies suggest essential components of teacher preparation in early childhood inclusion include: helping students construct a positive image of inclusive practice, incorporating a family-centered approach, and collaborating and relationship building across disciplines (Campbell et al. 2003; Pretti-Frontczak et al. 2002 and Able-Boone et al. 2002). In this paper, we describe the collaboration between the University of Michigan-Dearborn Early Childhood Teacher Education Program and Oakwood Health Care Center for Exceptional Families to co-teach and mentor early childhood pre-service teachers as they create a family-centered event for children with disabilities and their typically developing peers in a natural environment. Researchers analyze student reflection papers about the family-centered event for evidence of new learning about child disability and inclusive practice. The reflections demonstrate the power of the students' active role in creating and implementing family-centered activities in a collaborative context. Other key reflective components include rewards and challenges in creating inclusive contexts, integral role of families in supporting child relationships in natural settings, and collaboration and teaming.

AB  - Today's scientist is faced with complex problems that require interdisciplinary solutions. Consequently, tertiary science educators have had to develop and deliver interdisciplinary science courses to equip students with the skills required to solve the evolving real-world challenges of today and tomorrow. There are few reported studies of the lessons learned from designing and delivering first year compulsory interdisciplinary science subjects at regional universities. Even fewer studies assess the impact that teaching interventions within interdisciplinary courses have on students' attitudes towards mathematics and technology, and mathematics anxiety. This paper discusses the feedback received from the first student cohort of a new compulsory, first year interdisciplinary science subject at a regional Australian university which resulted in curricular revisions. These revisions included a greater emphasis on the subject relevance and increased student support in tutorials. Assessment practices were also dramatically modified. The change in student attitudes and anxiety levels "a priori" and "a posteriori" to the interventions was measured quantitatively and qualitatively. Post-intervention, female and non-mathematics major students had grown in mathematical confidence and were less anxious. It is important that positive and negative research findings are reported, so science educators can learn from one another, and can better prepare their students for the challenges they will face in bringing interdisciplinary solutions to contemporary real-world problems.

AB  - A common theme throughout physical education pedagogical literature is that interdisciplinary lessons can provide effective ways to help evidence that physical education can play a role in student learning in other disciplines (Fingon, 2011; Graham, Holt-Hale, & Parker, 2010; Lynott, 2008; Mohnsen, 2011). Educational scholars have also suggested that interdisciplinary connections may make "learning easier... more realistic and potentially more useful [to the student]" (Shell et al., 2010, p. 184). Interdisciplinary learning is a teaching construct that enables two or more teachers to work collaboratively to connect "content from at least two subject areas in an attempt to promote learning in both subjects" (Graham et al., 2010, p. 654). Therefore, an interdisciplinary lesson would be a lesson in which content from at least two subjects is integrated in two or more teachers' classrooms resulting in learning in both subject areas. This may be effectively accomplished through collaborative efforts between the physical education teacher and teachers in other curricular areas. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Because service-learning challenges participants to widen perspectives on social issues, we designed and assessed a multi-semester, multidisciplinary project with both academic and service objectives. In this project, undergraduate students developed a script and video centered on a board game designed to educate high-school students about their community, Chester, Pennsylvania. The script and video featured undergraduate students playing "Chesteropoly," with deeded properties reflecting Chester's current community agencies, as well as business, educational, entertainment, and government groups from past and present days. Next, students enrolled in an educational-psychology independent-study class developed a content-knowledge test; this test, along with assessments of social skills and self-concept, was administered to local high-school students from this disadvantaged community. Undergraduate participants assessed experiences through reflection journals, surveys, and focus-group interviews. Overall, the types of outcomes that we observed for our high-school and undergraduate participants reflected development of civic values, improvement of academic learning, and self-motivation.

AB  - The evolution of the professional and environmental conditions is forcing the university education to a change in the teaching-learning process. This implies a new definition in the roles and functions of university teachers from whom new ways of educational training should arise. These days, university teachers are called upon to encourage and facilitate their students' learning. This new role of the teacher should be to help put the University at the level of the requirements and possibilities of this era, and those to come as well. In order to make the innovation and the change real in higher education is essential to start from concepts like "cooperation and collaboration" within the teaching staff, between them and in their departments. According to the new use of the didactic and organizational planning in higher education, this aspect is an aim for the development of the teaching quality in universities. In higher education, there is an increasing need of a formation which not only increases the conceptual knowledge of the professionals but also provides them the instrumental and attitudinal resources required for the professional development of their tasks. The aim of this paper is to show the work which has been done by a group of teachers at the Faculty of Educational Sciences and Humanities during four years in the degree of Educational Psychology. The activities carried out (information stands, sensitization workshops, leaflets with scientific-technical information, among others) facilitate our students' apprehension of the basic elements of different subject matters and increase their skills of analyzing, contrasting, synthesizing, increasing knowledge, debating, etc. and, in addition, they can confront the need to give an answer--as a professional--to very different situations taken from the real world.

AB  - Professionals who provide health and related supports and services to children with disabilities in educational programs and community settings must practice in an evidence-based manner to ensure children and families receive the highest quality care. Vermont's Interdisciplinary Journal Club provides a successful approach to supporting professional development of rural professionals through a variety of knowledge translation activities, including: (a) building relationships and communities integral to the sharing and application of current knowledge; (b) overcoming barriers of time, distance and various levels of research skill; and (c) collaboratively identifying topics of interest and discussion that include skilled interpretation of research and experiential knowledge of stakeholders. This article describes the structure, processes and evaluation strategies of the Journal Club. Challenges identified over three years of implementation and related solutions may be helpful for groups who are interested in initiating a similar knowledge translation activity for rural interdisciplinary professionals on a regional or statewide level.

AB  - "Computing in the Humanities," an undergraduate course for Computer Science Department majors and minors and Web Programming minors at New York University, represents a unique collaboration between the Computer Science Department and the University Archives. The course's final assignment required students to select, digitize, and contextualize materials from the Archives' collections in an interactive Web site. The design and implementation of the course incorporates four current and important trends in both disciplines. First, the professor and archivist worked closely together before and during the course, which served to integrate the archival research component into the core mission of the course. Second, the students' projects provided increased subject access and dynamic Web content to the repository and meaningful work to the students. Third, this course produced students who "bridge" the needs of humanists with the capabilities of technology. Fourth, this course illustrated the growing importance of Web programming and project-based courses in undergraduate computer science education. (Contains 3 footnotes and 28 notes.)

AB  - Library and information science (LIS) is highly interdisciplinary by nature and is affected by the incessant evolution of technologies. A recent study surveying research trends in the years 2002-6 at various information science departments worldwide has found that a clear trend was identified in Masters theses and doctoral dissertations of social aspects of information moving into the spotlight. The study found that only a third of the research that was tagged on the ProQuest Digital Dissertations database under either or both "Library Science" and "Information Science" was actually conducted at LIS departments. The current study aims to examine the remaining two thirds of these papers, conducted in non-LIS departments. This will contribute toward our understanding of the field and its future development. The research findings indicate that there is a relatively clear division of research topics between the studies conducted in various information studies departments and those conducted in other departments that study information. The main difference found is the opposite foci of LIS and non-LIS studies. While LIS scholars focus on the information user, other fields, headed by business administration, computer science, education and communication, focus on the system, on information technology, the information industry and the management of information.

AB  - This exercise provides students hands-on experience with the topics of glycosidation, hemiacetal and acetal formation, proton nuclear magnetic resonance ([superscript 1]H NMR) spectroscopy, and kinetic and thermodynamic product formation. In this laboratory experiment, the methyl acetal of ribose is synthesized, and the kinetic and thermodynamic products of the reaction are identified using a 300 MHz NMR spectrometer with a variable temperature probe. The results of this reaction under two different sets of conditions reveal that alpha forms of ribosides are less stable than beta forms and that the kinetic products are furanosides, whereas the thermodynamic products are pyranosides. It can be performed as a single 3-h laboratory session or as a series of several sessions if students collect their own NMR spectra and use longer reaction times.

AB  - A mixture of integrative learning and interdisciplinary studies, appropriately conceived and well grounded in academic disciplines, constitutes the most effective education for a complex world. But how exactly should interdisciplinary studies and integrative learning be conceived? In this article, the author sketches a focused vision for integrative learning and interdisciplinary studies. He proposes a more focused way of thinking about integrative learning, one closer to the general cognitive approach underpinning the rubric for integrative learning developed by the Association of American Colleges and Universities' (AAC&U's) Valid Assessment of Learning in Undergraduate Education project, which defines integrative learning as "an understanding and a disposition that a student builds across the curriculum and cocurriculum, from making simple connections among ideas and experiences to synthesizing and transferring learning to new, complex situations within and beyond the campus." To prepare students to meet the challenges of a complex world, the author believes one needs to think of integrative learning as analogous to interdisciplinary studies. That is, one needs to define integrative learning as outside-the-classroom activity (off as well as on campus) that provides students with certain types of experiences that facilitate the integrative process, experiences through which they are confronted with new perspectives and are challenged to integrate insights from divergent perspectives.

AB  - Three general purposes of research in human development are to explain, predict, and modify behavior. Studies of listening during early childhood (birth through age eight) are of particular significance to the field because they enable researchers to describe listening processes from their very origins (explain), they demonstrate the effects of early listening experiences on later experiences (predict), and they offer practical guidance to adults who are committed to exerting a positive influence on the listening habits of the very young (modify). To those ends, this interdisciplinary review examines six different strands in the research literature: (1) listening research with infants and toddlers, (2) evidence for a listening/literacy connection, (3) the link between listening and socio-emotional development, (4) the listening needs of special populations, (5) studies of classrooms as environments for listening, and (6) curriculum issues in basic and higher education. The article concludes with a philosophical stance that holds the greatest promise for supporting young children's growth as listeners.

AB  - As educators in academic programs featuring interdisciplinary learning, the authors can attest that helping undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary studies major engage in interdisciplinary learning--that is, draw from two or more disciplines to advance understanding of a problem, question, or phenomenon--is no mean feat. Consequently, the authors have witnessed their students struggle to complete interdisciplinary activities. Yet, they have also marveled at the quality of their interdisciplinary work, particularly that created by seniors. This observation prompted the authors to wonder when and how students in interdisciplinary studies programs develop as learners. To explore this question, they interviewed ten students enrolled in an interdisciplinary studies major each semester of their undergraduate experience and examined interview data for patterns in relation to student development theory, specifically Marcia Baxter Magolda's research on college students' intellectual and personal development. Data were collected from students enrolled in a self-designed interdisciplinary undergraduate program at a mid-size public institution. After reviewing interview data, the authors identified distinguishing features of students' experience. The authors describe and interpret students' experiences in the first year, middle two years and final year. The data from this longitudinal study offer a comprehensive look at the developmental journey experienced by students in one undergraduate interdisciplinary studies program. The study demonstrates the interpersonal and intrapersonal as well as the epistemological benefits of an engaged, interdisciplinary, and residential learning community, but it also provides a glimpse into students' developmental journey and processes of meaning-making across the undergraduate experience.

AB  - To address the developmental deficits of children with autism, several disciplines have come to the forefront within intervention programs. These are speech-pathologists, psychologists/counselors, occupational-therapists/physical-therapists, special-education consultants, behavior analysts, and physicians/medical personnel. As the field of autism therapy moves toward a more comprehensive, holistic and interdisciplinary model, the complexity of an interdisciplinary service delivery model could pose significant challenges. The difficulty of carrying out this approach could lead to sub-par programs being established. With integration among the disciplines a necessity, the ethical principles and language common to all the contributing disciplines is argued as the appropriate integrating force. An outline of these principles and a draft code of ethics are offered to introduce high standards and expectations for all participating in such a program.

AB  - A teacher network was formed at an Australian university in order to better promote interdisciplinary student learning on the complex social-environmental problem of climate change. Rather than leaving it to students to piece together disciplinary responses, eight teaching academics collaborated on the task of exposing students to different types of knowledge in a way that was more than the summing of disciplinary parts. With a part-time network facilitator providing cohesion, network members were able to teach into each other's classes, and share material and student activities across a range of units that included business, zoology, marine science, geography and education. Participants reported that the most positive aspects of the project were the collegiality and support for teaching innovation provided by peers. However, participants also reported being time-poor and overworked. Maintaining the collaboration beyond the initial one year project proved difficult because without funding for the network facilitator, participants were unable to dedicate the time required to meet and collaborate on shared activities. In order to strengthen teacher collaboration in a university whose administrative structures are predominantly discipline-based, there is need for recognition of the benefits of interdisciplinary learning to be matched by recognition of the need for financial and other resources to support collaborative teaching initiatives.

AB  - A meeting organized under the auspices of the International Association for the Scientific Study of Intellectual Disabilities (IASSID) Academy on Education, Teaching and Research was held in March 2011 at the India International Centre in New Delhi, India, with the explicit purpose of helping establish a road map for future research in intellectual disabilities (ID) in India and to forge alliances among like-minded researchers and practitioners to move forward on countrywide research. The participants were drawn from nongovernmental and governmental groups, private consultancies, psychology, researchers, and policymakers, and they were interested in research dissemination, research methodologies, and research ethics. The participants developed a framework for research strategies and defined important areas for further research in ID for India. Based on the discussions, the following research strategy areas were identified: prevalence studies, human ethics, human rights, prevention, interventions, research syntheses of existing research that has been conducted in India, dissemination of existing research, building research capacity, and disaster preparedness. As each priority area required further discussion and feedback, agreement was achieved that such further discussions and collaborations would follow. The follow-up is a process which involves the simultaneous and synergistic development of policies and practices at the application and governmental levels.

AB  - To deal with recent reforms and the accompanying complexity of work in secondary education, ongoing collaboration between teachers has become more important. A community is seen as a promising learning environment to support and embed collaboration into the culture of the school. However, community theory for the design of teacher communities seems underdeveloped. Therefore, this study aims to formulate a set of design principles to foster the development of teacher communities in secondary education. The set of design principles is based on a review of literature, as well as on a best-practice case. The case study was used to validate design principles from the literature in the target context. The resulting design principles were based on context-intervention-mechanism-outcome logic that takes into account the context-dependency of interventions as well as the mechanisms that help with understanding of how interventions produce certain outcomes. Implications for practice relate to ownership and co-design of the arrangement. The set of design principles provides a practical basis for teachers and administrators aiming to facilitate community building in their school. Future research is recommended on testing the effectiveness of the arrangement in the target context by means of a multiple case study.

AB  - This article identifies how clicker use can support or augment existing principles of good teaching across different disciplines in higher education. While many of these principles will be familiar to instructors, the link between student response system (SRS) use and existing pedagogical methods is still often unclear, even for scholars who are well read in the literature. Functioning as a resource for both novices and instructors who have already incorporated clickers into their courses, this article synthesizes existing literature and offers empirical data from five courses in three disciplines to show how SRSs can be used to support contemporary pedagogical goals. The authors discuss five exemplary practices, providing sample clicker questions along the way, to show how clickers can be used to facilitate active learning in large courses. (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - A review of "The September 11th Education Program: A National Interdisciplinary Curriculum" reveals a sensitive and well-created program for the 5-12 social studies teacher to use in teaching about the challenging subject of 9/11. This program provides an opportunity for teachers to find a balance among understanding, critical analysis, creativity, reflection and action, and yet not allow the transformative events of 9/11 to go unnoticed in social studies classrooms across the nation. The curriculum consists of seven lessons about various issues surrounding 9/11 while simultaneously integrating key skills from the social studies and addressing the revised National Council for the Social Studies Curriculum Standards. Many of the resources used could be pulled out and used independently, and make the curriculum program an ideal starting point for the classroom teacher who is interested in teaching about 9/11 but perhaps unsure of where to begin.

AB  - Inspired by a similar study by Osborne et al. we have conducted a Delphi study among experts to identify key concepts to be taught in engineering and technology education and relevant and meaningful contexts through which these concepts can be taught and learnt. By submitting the outcomes of the Delphi study to a panel of experts in a two-day meeting we were able to add structure to the Delphi results. Thus we reached a concise list of concepts and contexts that can be used to develop curricula for education about engineering and technology as a contribution to technological literacy goals in education.

AB  - The need for a revised curriculum within the life sciences has been well-established. One strategy to improve student preparation in the life sciences is to redesign introductory courses like biology, chemistry, and physics so that they better reflect their disciplinary interdependence. We describe a medically relevant, context-based approach to teaching second semester general chemistry that demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of biology and chemistry. Our innovative method provides a model in which disciplinary barriers are diminished early in the undergraduate science curriculum. The course is divided into three principle educational modules: 1) Fundamentals of General Chemistry, 2) Medical Approaches to Inflammation, and 3) Neuroscience as a connector of chemistry, biology, and psychology. We accurately anticipated that this modified approach to teaching general chemistry would enhance student interest in chemistry and bridge the perceived gaps between biology and chemistry. The course serves as a template for context-based, interdisciplinary teaching that lays the foundation needed to train 21st century scientists. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Citation analysis of dissertations was used to explore the interdisciplinary nature of education graduate students' research. A sample of curriculum and instruction dissertations, and their bibliographies we studied using citation analysis methods and analysis of "Digital Dissertation" records. Research methodologies were also explored. Rather than crossing broad disciplinary boundaries, interdisciplinary work for these students occurred at the level of specific fields of study within curriculum and instruction, and at times education subdisciplines. Questions are raised about the nature of interdisciplinarity in graduate student work. As faculty research and academic structures continues to evolve, graduate student work also may change.

AB  - Aristotle launched Western knowledge on a trajectory toward disciplinarity that continues to this day. But is the knowledge management project that began with Aristotle adequate for the age of Google? Perhaps an undisciplined discourse more evocative of Plato can help us constitute new, more relevant inter- and transdisciplinary forms of knowledge. This article explores the history of disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity, arguing for a new, critical form of interdisciplinarity that moves beyond the academy into dialogue with the public and private sectors. Contemporary knowledge production should involve not only a horizontal axis stretching across academia but also a vertical axis where academic research is integrated into contemporary life.

AB  - Along the lines of the evidence-based recommendations, we developed a multi-disciplinary intervention for overweight children 7- to 12-years-old, primarily aiming at helping children to adopt healthier eating habits and a physically active lifestyle. The program combined nutrition intervention, based on a non-dieting approach, with physical activity intervention, implemented through the basic principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), along with parental support. The program was conducted by dieticians with the collaboration of child psychiatrists and pediatricians. Training and regular supervision upon CBT priniciples application was intended to enhance dieticians' efficiency. The intervention is currently being evaluated to determine its effectiveness in treating childhood obesity. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Inquiry-based and interdisciplinary teaching practices exemplify constructivist approaches to education capable of facilitating authentic student learning; however, their implementation has proven particularly challenging within certain contexts in the United States. This qualitative study considers one such context via an investigation of elementary teachers' views on teaching inquiry-based, interdisciplinary science and social studies in urban settings. Interview data from 15 teachers in three urban schools are presented. Findings describe how teachers' views compare to the respective national standards in each curricular area and detail the barriers they report to implementing such practices in their classrooms.

AB  - Teaching mathematics in real-word contexts is a strategy to make math relevant for undergraduate students. However, very little research exists on students' methods of integrating contextual and mathematical knowledge through writing. This study uses an interdisciplinary writing assignment to investigate the relationship between students' written portrayal of context and mathematical argumentation. A qualitative analysis of 41 essays found that writing contextual details was associated with the use of multiple data sources and with the mathematical support of an argument. Writing about contextual details allows a student to create a sense of cohesion between mathematics and the thesis of the essay. The study suggests that pre-writing activities connecting context and mathematics may help students integrate interdisciplinary knowledge. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - As perhaps the most encompassing idea in biology, evolution has impacted not only science, but other academic disciplines as well. The broad, interdisciplinary impact of evolution was the theme of a course taught at Marian College, Indianapolis, Indiana in 2002, 2004, and 2006. Using a strategy that could be readily adopted at other institutions, professors from other, non-biological disciplines were asked to speak with the class regarding the impact of Darwin specifically or evolution more broadly on their field of study. A political scientist, literature expert, language professor, historian, theologian, art historian, and sociologist have all participated in this course. Student comments have been overwhelmingly positive and suggest the course format affected their thinking with respect to both the humanities and the science of evolution.

AB  - In today's organizations team work has become an integral part of the day-to-day routine. For this reason, University professors are including group projects in many courses. In such group assessments, we advocate the use of interdisciplinary teams, where possible. As a case study, we report an interdisciplinary group technical project with members from a Master of Business Administration course and a Master of Science in Accounting course. We also describe the refinements made to the course in order to enhance the collaboration between students from two classes.

AB  - Two professors of reading redesigned, merged, and co-taught their respective methods courses (one elementary, one special education) to foster "literacy for all" through interdisciplinary content and collaboration. The characteristic needs of students with learning disabilities and the instructional strategies that promote their literacy acquisition were infused throughout the course. This study describes the professors' co-teaching process and the course learning activities designed to foster collaboration. Qualitative data reveal the impact on teacher candidates' conceptualizations of literacy and its instruction. Findings extend the literature on collaboration and co-teaching, specifically in the context of teacher preparation. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - An overview of research topics and findings from an interdisciplinary, programmatic line of research on writing over the past 25 years is presented. The cross-sectional assessment studies (grades 1 to 9) showed which measures uniquely explained variance in handwriting, spelling, and composing and thus validated their use in assessment. These and the longitudinal studies (grades 1 to 5 and 3 to 7) contributed to knowledge of the cognitive processes of writing, within a working memory architecture that orchestrates multiple component processes in time to achieve specific writing goals, especially the translation of ideas into words, syntax, and text, and transcription (handwriting and spelling) by pen and by keyboard. Combined brain imaging and behavioral studies of writing have provided converging evidence for brain-behavior relationships for handwriting, spelling, and composing and for the role of temporally coordinated working memory, including an orthographic loop with a graphic-motor envelope for word production. A series of instructional studies for at-risk writers, which was taught to all levels of language to overcome working memory inefficiencies, were organized according to the developmental steppingstones in writing acquisition and show that writing problems can be prevented. Other studies with older, struggling writers validated effective instructional approaches for helping struggling writers become reading-writers who integrate both written language skills in literacy learning.

AB  - This essay explores the challenges facing students and teachers in the interdisciplinary classroom. Based on observations of a team-taught interdisciplinary class and drawing on cultural historical activity theory, I argue that the psychological double binds that result from the clash of different disciplinary activity systems constitute both the greatest challenge and richest potential of interdisciplinary classrooms.

AB  - An interdisciplinary approach to education has become more important in the development of science and technology, which requires universities to have graduates with broad knowledge and skills and to apply these skills in solving real-world problems. An interdisciplinary experimental series has been developed for the laboratories in cell and molecular biology and advanced inorganic chemistry. Students performed the synthesis and characterization of a Ru(II) monoarene anticancer complex in the advanced inorganic chemistry laboratory, followed by testing its DNA-binding properties in the cell and molecular biology laboratory. The objectives of this experimental series are to introduce the students to the connections between different scientific subjects and to the importance of an interdisciplinary approach in solving practical scientific problems. Students learn important techniques such as synthesis and purification, [superscript 1]H NMR and IR spectroscopy, and electrophoresis that are used collectively in the development of pharmaceuticals.

AB  - Although screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) has been a popular model to address potential substance abuse issues in primary care, there is a need for innovative approaches for training providers and staff on SBIRT protocols. An interdisciplinary approach to SBIRT training, named ICARE, was implemented at 3 different medical settings. The ICARE team trained 85 employees at an academic family medicine residency center and 37 employees across 2 rural community health care clinics. Using an innovative "learner-driven" approach, the authors implemented a combination of didactic and interactive training strategies that included on-site coaching, patient simulation exercises, as well as large- and small-group learning.

AB  - This program profile describes a new approach towards integrating communication within Mechanical Engineering curricula. The author, who holds a joint appointment between Technical Communication and Mechanical Engineering at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, has been collaborating with Mechanical Engineering colleagues to establish a department-wide program with the goal of facilitating transfer of rhetorical instruction to engineering deliverables involving written and oral communication. To carry out this goal, the program incorporates a set of best practices informed by prior research in the areas of knowledge transfer, writing studies, and educational theory. These best practices and the theories informing them are described in this profile. In addition, the author offers preliminary lessons learned and presents implications for writing faculty interested in facilitating transfer through interdisciplinary initiatives.

AB  - At the University of Vermont, an interdisciplinary faculty team developed an introductory watershed science field course. This course honed field skills and catalyzed communication across water-related disciplines without requiring specific prerequisites. Five faculty (geology, engineering, geography, natural resources) taught the four-credit course, highlighting interactions between the hydrosphere, biosphere, and solid Earth. The course, based in the Winooski River watershed, followed the river from its headwaters downstream to its outlet in Lake Champlain focusing on data collection and analysis methods, while exploring threats to this freshwater ecosystem. This course was offered as a summer field course in 2007. Student learning was assessed using weekly summative assignments and final presentations incorporating field data and acquired knowledge. Attitude and knowledge surveys, administered before and after this first year, documented increased self-assessed learning, affinity for the field learning environment, and that the course provided training relevant to various disciplines. The fiscally unsustainable summer model, and course evaluations guided major revisions to the course. The second offering, in 2009, met weekly during spring term to provide students with context before a two-week field component. This field component was held immediately after classes ended to avoid the need to pay faculty summer salaries.

AB  - The understanding of complex physiological processes requires information from many different areas of knowledge. To meet this interdisciplinary scenario, the ability of integrating and articulating information is demanded. The difficulty of such approach arises because, more often than not, information is fragmented through under graduation education in Health Sciences. Shifting from a fragmentary and deep view of many topics to joining them horizontally in a global view is not a trivial task for teachers to implement. To attain that objective we proposed a course herein described--Biochemistry of the envenomation response--aimed at integrating previous contents of Health Sciences courses, following international recommendations of interdisciplinary model. The contents were organized by modules with increasing topic complexity. The full understanding of the envenoming pathophysiology of each module would be attained by the integration of knowledge from different disciplines. Active-learning strategy was employed focusing concept map drawing. Evaluation was obtained by a 30-item Likert-type survey answered by ninety students; 84% of the students considered that the number of relations that they were able to establish as seen by concept maps increased throughout the course. Similarly, 98% considered that both the theme and the strategy adopted in the course contributed to develop an interdisciplinary view. (Contains 2 tables and 1 box.)

AB  - Acquisition of conceptual knowledge is a central aim in science education. In this study we monitored an interdisciplinary hypermedia assisted learning unit on hibernation and thermodynamics based on cooperative learning. We used concept mapping for the assessment, applying a pre-test/post-test design. In our study, 106 9th graders cooperated by working in pairs (n = 53) for six lessons. As an interdisciplinary learning activity in such complex knowledge domains has to combine many different aspects, we focused on long-term knowledge. Learners working cooperatively in dyads constructed computer-supported concept maps which were analysed by specific software. The data analysis encompassed structural aspects of the knowledge corresponding to a target reference map. After the learning unit, the results showed the acquisition of higher-order domain-specific knowledge structures which indicates successful interdisciplinary learning through the hypermedia learning environment. The benefit of using a computer-assisted concept mapping assessment for research in science education, and in science classrooms is considered.

AB  - This paper argues that field courses can improve college students' interest and engagement not only in the environmental sciences, but also in the environmental humanities--including environmental history, philosophy, and literature. We base this argument on five years of experience teaching an environmental studies field course through the Wildlands Studies Program in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. In the paper we draw from field notes, discussions with students, correspondence with other instructors, and a survey sent to all of our former students. We conclude that three factors--the field immersion experience, the small group dynamic, and the curriculum design--all contributed to an increase in our students' interest and engagement in the environmental humanities.

Design and Methods: This paper looks at the evolution in geriatric social work assessment and outcomes research and concludes with observations of the changing landscape in health and aging. Results: Since the 1960s, the policies and the context of health care delivery have changed many times as have geriatric health screening and assessment of patients in need of social health care services. Research on social-behavioral and environmental factors critical in measurement of outcomes of health care has progressed significantly as theories of care and the research technologies that allow us to study these factors have become more sophisticated. Implications: Researchers from multiple disciplines need to study the questions which can build the evidence necessary for empirically supported social policy direction. Opportunities in interdisciplinary geriatric assessment and measurement of outcomes, which are presented to researchers today, are highlighted.

AB  - Using an integrative perspective drawn from vocational psychology and migration studies, this article explores the lives of irregular migrants, which represents a unique aspect of work-based migration. Irregular migrants are those individuals who travel from regions without much work to states that offer some means of employment, without formal immigration documentation. The relational and social contexts of migration of working people to states that offer employment (albeit limited and with many attendant risks) are presented. Using the broad framework provided by the psychology of working coupled with the relational perspectives of working, prominent resources and barriers in the working lives of irregular migrants are described, including social capital, social support, culture as a source of support, and social oppression. Future directions for research that can inform public policy are provided at the conclusion of the article.

AB  - The Mathematics Education and Neurosciences project is an interdisciplinary research program that bridges mathematics education research with neuroscientific research. The bidirectional collaboration will provide greater insight into young children's (aged four to six years) mathematical abilities. Specifically, by combining qualitative "design research" with quantitative "experimental research", we aim to come to a more thorough understanding of prerequisites that are involved in the development of early spatial and number sense. The mathematics education researchers are concerned with kindergartner's spatial structuring ability, while the neuroscientists are studying kindergartner's automatic quantity processing and its effect on mathematical development. The outcomes of these investigations should contribute to practical ways of fostering and supporting young children's mathematical thinking and learning.

AB  - This article argues the importance of including religion in the curriculum of undergraduate studies. Religion is, at its nexus, an ideology, a belief system that reverberates through literature and history. Such knowledge in itself is invaluable for students, introducing them to the difference between ideology and fact and to how ideology becomes intertwined with politics, economics, and other social forces. Introduced to such concepts, students begin to gain a more informed vision of religion which affords them the opportunity to engage in more complex, synthetic interdisciplinary studies in a way that better mirrors our world. They become engaged in critical thinking that takes them beyond their own personal belief systems. (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - Procurement in the corporate world is increasingly complex, multi-faceted and interdisciplinary. This paper explores existing knowledge specifications relating to procurement management competencies and proposes a new procurement management competency framework (PMCF) and a competency-based postgraduate programme for postgraduate students in Ghana. A three-tier iterative and inductive methodology was used to develop the proposed framework and a literature survey and focus group discussions were used to explore the competency requirements for procurement management practice. The reliability, consistency and applicability of the framework were each tested using a modified single-phase Delphi survey. Five logical knowledge constructs were identified as providing the foundations for a modern public procurement system: financial; social; corporate governance; technology and globalization; and research and teamwork. The PMCF combines strategical, managerial and technical competencies and incorporates economic and social dimensions of procurement functions. It is hoped that the research findings will be of use to academics and those in industry involved with the education and training of future generations of procurement professionals.

AB  - Malcolm Knowles' theory of andragogy is best known in the world of adult education as a conceptualization of how and why adults learn. The following practice-based article that has applied Knowles' theories and precepts to an undergraduate program reflects on how those concepts work with people whom Knowles might well have not considered "adults." The Interdisciplinary Studies program at The University of Southern Mississippi allows learners to formulate their own degree plan within broad boundaries, focusing on two disciplinary concentrations with a final research or creative project as a "capstone." This article reviews the process within which this program came into being and considers its inner workings. The authors reflect on the motivations that Knowles considered the foundational difference between "adults" and "children" and compare their own, somewhat traditional, base of learners to those precepts, finding that perhaps there are more similarities than differences when the learner is in control of his or her learning.

AB  - This article explores some of the challenges of conducting longitudinal studies relating to emotional and behavioural difficulties, with reference to the small number of studies that exist in this area. The authors distinguish between longitudinal and follow up studies, drawing on examples from a range of disciplines. They then begin to explore the new avenues for researching the lives of young people presented by the growth in popularity of social networking sites such as Facebook. The article also breaks new ground by drawing on the disciplines of philosophy and neuroscience in order to begin to theorise the notion of time. This is a fundamental element of the longitudinal view, but one that is not generally addressed in studies that invite people to look back over their lives. (Contains 7 notes.)

AB  - This article seeks to demystify, through deconstruction, the concept of "interdisciplinarity" in the context of qualitative research to contribute to a new praxis of knowledge production through reflection on the possibilities and impossibilities of interdisciplinarity. A review and discussion of disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity leads the authors to formulate and explore the following questions: What is interdisciplinary knowledge? What is it that researchers observe as interdisciplinarity? Why do researchers pursue it? In demystifying interdisciplinarity, the authors focus on the legitimacy of the sign interdisciplinary and the process of (interdisciplinary) knowledge production. After investigating the former, the authors explore the latter by metaphorically mapping the terrain of knowledge production and conclude by proposing that interdisciplinarity, as a sign, may have the function of enabling knowledge-producing organizations to leverage resources by symbolically alluding to desired characteristics of knowledge-production processes whereas, as an act, it may de facto reproduce and maintain the disciplinary organization of knowledge and knowledge production.

AB  - The concept of "wicked issues", originally developed in the field of urban planning, has been taken up by design educators, architects and public health academics where the means for handling "wicked issues" has been developed through "reflective practice". In the education of teachers, whilst reflective practice has been a significant feature of professional education, the problems to which this has been applied are principally "tame" ones. In this paper, the authors argue that there has been a lack of crossover between two parallel literatures. The literature on "wicked issues" does not fully recognise the difficulties with reflective practice and that in education which extols reflective practice, is not aware of the "wicked" nature of the problems which confront teachers and schools. The paper argues for a fresh understanding of the underlying nature of problems in education so that more appropriate approaches can be devised for their resolution. This is particularly important at a time when the government in England is planning to make teaching a masters level profession, briefly defined by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) benchmark statement as "Decision-making in complex and unpredictable situations". The paper begins by locating the argument and analysis of "wicked problems" within the nature of social complexity and chaos. The second part of the paper explores implications for those involved in policy formation, implementation and service provision. Given the range of stakeholders in education, the paper argues for a trans-disciplinary approach recognising the multiple perspectives and methodologies leading to the acquisition of reticulist skills and knowledge necessary to boundary cross.

AB  - One reason we have difficulty finding sustainable solutions is in part because we are unable to see the bigger picture. Capra (2000) argues, "To become ecologically literate we must learn to think systemically--in terms of connectedness, context and processes" (p. 270). We have attempted to structure connected learning experiences through our transdisciplinary approach to teaching for learning science, mathematics and ecological aspects of society and environment. We support Jucker's (2002) view that we must have lateral rigor across disciplines and vertical rigor within disciplines in order to best prepare students for teaching. This paper explores the theoretical underpinning of this complex approach to undergraduate teaching and reports on how our teaching team has worked collaboratively to structure a sequence of three, one semester integrated, core courses that explicitly uses an educating for ecological sustainability theme as the basis for each course and associated assessment.

AB  - This study evaluated attitudes toward interdisciplinary education by appraising the Interdisciplinary Health Communication (IHC) Certificate program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as a case study. Sixteen affiliated faculty and thirteen students enrolled in the IHC program as of 2008-2009 were surveyed. Although the attitude was overall positive, multiple barriers exist (e.g., lack of administrative support, registration difficulties). The faculty developed courses and administered teaching strategies unique to the IHC program. Students expected certification would translate into better job opportunities. Recommendations for successful initiation and maintenance of interdisciplinary certificate programs are discussed along with suggestions for future research. (Contains 74 notes and 3 tables.)

AB  - Purpose: The research study seeks to explore the relationship among strategic gaming, the learning organization model and approach, and transfer of learning as key success strategies for improved individual and organizational performance and sustainable competitive advantage. This research aims to identify and elaborate on the strategic integration of interdisciplinary organizational areas leading to the development of a learning organization. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses a cross-sectoral case study approach to learning by focusing on the newly designed Advertising-SCM (Ad-SCM) simulation consisting of a strategic organizational game where experiential learning in organizational practice was emphasized and, subsequently, student learning outcome assessment results were analyzed. Findings: The Ad-SCM simulation game project strengthened the interdisciplinary business education for the learners by preparing them to connect to the corporate world effectively through the use of strategic gaming that modeled learning organization practice and transfer of knowledge, skills, attitudes and job relevant qualities to excel in the workplace. Interdisciplinary strategic games are valuable tools for learning and knowledge management within and across organizations, and need to be further investigated. Research limitations/implications: The research is useful for educators to try interdisciplinary, innovative projects to reinforce learning across all organizational disciplines in an inter-organizational setting, and improve organizational performance for a sustainable competitive advantage. The research is of great value to industry professionals as it motivates critical thinking through the use of the "learning organization" as an interdisciplinary learning zone and investigates the key issues in cross-sectoral business management areas. Practical implications: Interdisciplinary strategic gaming enables industry involvement to build up cross-disciplinary management exchanges between employees and provides real-life case scenarios for interdisciplinary research projects. This research explores the possibility of transfer of learning during the individual's academic pursuits leading to the reduction in training costs and improved return on investment for organization in the future. Originality/value: The paper utilizes an innovative research stream highlighting the relationship among the use of strategic gaming, becoming a learning organization and transfer of learning for effective learning and knowledge management.

AB  - The academic workforce is among the oldest (Commonwealth of Australia, 2005) and arguably has the most highly qualified professionals within Australia. Yet career management for this group is seldom discussed. This paper considers Australia's ageing academic work-force and the human resource management challenges and implications this poses for Australian universities, through an interdisciplinary discussion of the literature from three key areas: higher education, psychology and career. The paper will argue that an ageing academic workforce raises crucial sustainability issues, and that universities need to be responsive to this phenomenon and to the complexity of the academic career. It will also draw attention to the lack of evidence to date of university career management policy and practice which incorporates both life and career stages, and which proactively addresses academic careers and ageing. Given an increasingly globalised and competitive labour market, it is in both the university's and the individual academic's best interests to work proactively and collaboratively in order to create a mutually beneficial future.

AB  - Using data collected through case studies of 21 research universities in the United States, I reviewed the efforts institutions are undertaking to meet the growing demand for interdisciplinary knowledge. I adopted the framework of transformative change, where change occurs over time and brings important shifts in the way an institution views itself. Findings indicated that implementing interdisciplinary initiatives is accomplished not only through changes in how institutional work is organized and the facilities in which the work is carried out, but also through concurrent shifts in the institutional culture related to interdisciplinary endeavors.

AB  - In the interdisciplinary course, Aging to Infancy: A Life Course Retrospective, the Institute of Medicine's recommendations for education were embraced through the role modeling provided by faculty both across and between disciplines. Over the five years since its creation, the course has introduced students to aging in a positive manner, establishing the foundation for higher level courses within each program's curriculum. The course also introduces students to the interdisciplinary healthcare team and reinforces the need for practitioners who value the interdisciplinary approach and expect it in their place of work. These are best practices for an interdisciplinary course. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Since society and science need interdisciplinary works, the interesting topic of chaos is chosen for interdisciplinary education in physics. The educational programme contains various university-level activities such as computer simulations, chaos experiment and team projects besides ordinary teaching. According to the participants, the programme seems useful and good. In addition, we discuss some issues which can be important to interdisciplinary education in physics: for example the possible difficulties in programme design, the expertise barriers of non-major fields, the role of non-theoretical education in understanding and the project-type team activities.

AB  - Using a grounded theory approach, this investigation addresses how an interdisciplinary research (IDR) team negotiates meaning and struggles to establish and sustain a sense of collective communication competence (CCC). Certain communication processes were foundational to building CCC, such as spending time together, practicing trust, discussing language differences, and engaging in team tasks. Demonstrating presence, engaging in reflexive and backstage communication, and shared laughter facilitated and often expedited CCC development, whereas sarcastic humor, unproductive debates of expertise, expressions of boredom, and jockeying for power challenged and deteriorated the team's CCC.

AB  - Contemporary universities in the developed world face a plethora of increased--and changing--responsibilities. We are the global university, responsible for the production of worker citizens who will be "prepared" for an extraordinarily diverse set of challenges across all facets of their lives. Much of our research concentration in the academy necessarily requires a plural, diverse approach to developing the appropriate capabilities for our students. Multidisciplinarity is the simple reality of the professional world. Universities have at their disposal sophisticated self-aware multidisciplinary practitioners. Or do they? How is multidisciplinarity perceived and understood in university departments and research teams? What are the tangible measures of successful multi-disciplinary practice? Drawing on a cultural studies framework, this paper will consider the challenges to academic identity and collegiality which reside in the assumed move to multiple ways of knowing in discovery and scholarship. How do we open to, and learn from, each others' disciplinary tools, traditions and epistemologies? How are such collegial approaches--concrete collegialities--embedded in our starting discipline? What are the understandings and limitations we face in seeking to move to a rich meaningful "inter"disciplinary practice? I will explore these questions in relation to the UN Decade on Education for Sustainability and Sustainable Development. (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - In this study, science faculty and educators collaboratively developed a plan to evaluate an interdisciplinary science curriculum and its administration policy. The science faculty were engaged in determining criteria for evaluation and interpreting data. The collaborative evaluation stressed graduate attributes in the affective domain and provided a dynamic for curriculum revision. Four cohorts of students voluntarily completed scales that measured their attitudes toward interdisciplinary study, course-taking patterns, and career choice. The results suggested that students' involvement and learning loadings were crucial to the effectiveness of the reform. Moreover, the traditional policy at Asian universities that requires entrants to declare a major should be changed, as most university entrants are not certain enough about their interests and abilities to make an appropriate decision about their major at such an early stage.

AB  - Supply chain management is an area of growing interest in both industry and academics. A number of new text books are available for courses in the area, and a number of Colleges of Business are adding relevant curriculum. However, questions arise as to what Supply Chain Management comprises, as to needed courses in the area, and an appropriate delineation as to which department is best suited to offer such a program. Issues business educators will face in an effort to initiate supply chain management programs are discussed.

AB  - The demand for interdisciplinary teaching and research suggests the need to understand how universities are undertaking and fostering interdisciplinarity. Through an examination of strategic and master plans at 21 research universities, this article explores how institutions plan and foster interdisciplinary engagement through the use of space on campus. The construction of such space acknowledges that the discrete functions of the university, frequently attributed to the disciplines and departments, are not generally conducive to interdisciplinary engagement. Physical space is a necessary component for successful interdisciplinary initiatives both functionally and symbolically. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - Despite substantial usage of case study analyses as learning tools in diverse fields of study, business graduate students often arrive with little to no prior knowledge in how to effectively use this tool. Using the Sams efficacy model (2009) strategic to business education this study identified a dearth in the usage of case study analyses in business graduate courses and also provides a step-by-step process to increase critical analysis and efficacy through the usage of case studies. Findings demonstrate that critical analysis is developed through a combination of teaching tools through additive strategies to impact more learning modalities at the graduate education level. A counter-intuitive finding was that formative written feedback did not significantly increase the development of case study analyses skills; this finding supports the additive model. This research brings forward universal best practices for developing critical analysis, as self-efficacy in business applications also increases.

AB  - Contests are usually applied in the academic environment to simulate real professional situations that require from the participants a more pro-active attitude than the one shown in conventional coursework. Although they are commonly applied in the scope of a unique course, the contest described here was an extracurricular experience applied in an Information System undergraduate program. The evaluation of the contest is also presented; the objective was to assess the role of the contest as a tool to bring together interdisciplinary subjects, complementary to the traditional disciplinary structure of the program curriculum. The results indicate that a significant portion of the participants noticed increase in their knowledge after the contest, which is verified by statistical tests. However, students from the first stages received more benefits, probably because such students were more motivated and had more available time to be involved in the contest activities.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the role that a collaborative teaching approach, referred to as a community of practice (CoP), had on a team of four second grade teachers' implementation of a science-based interdisciplinary curriculum. Data was collected in the form of extensive observation notes gathered over 10-weeks of twice weekly team meetings and two 45 minute interviews with each participant. From the field notes developed two vignettes for the purpose of illustrating the members CoP in action. Combining my analysis of the vignettes and the interviews resulted in three emergent themes: 1) benefits, 2) contributions, and 3) their commitment to professional development. From this study I learned that establishing a CoP was viewed as a necessary component of the team's implementation of their science-based interdisciplinary curriculum. Implications for encouraging preservice and inservice elementary teachers to develop CoPs to support science teaching, specifically interdisciplinary teaching, are discussed.

AB  - The author argues for an interdisciplinary perspective to study the complexities of educational equity and transcend the limits of previous research. He focuses on the racialization of disability as a case in point; specifically, he reviews the visions of justice that inform the scholarship on racial and ability differences and situates their interlocking in a historical perspective to illustrate how race and ability differences have elicited paradoxical educational responses. The author also examines how the convergence of contemporary reforms is creating fluid markers of difference that change meanings across contexts, thus having distinct consequences for students' identities and schools' responses. He concludes with an outline of guiding ideas for interdisciplinary research on inequities that emerge at the intersections of race and ability differences.

AB  - This qualitative study examined the integration of arts and academic curricula at a performing arts school by focusing on the curriculum as it is understood and perceived by the students. The study centered on five students at a performing arts magnet school who were chosen based upon contrasts in their arts classes in order to represent a range of participation in the various performing arts. Findings indicated that students were unable to recognize the integration of arts in the teaching materials, strategies, and interaction in academic courses. Results also indicated that the more teacher-centered instructional materials and pedagogical strategies utilized in the arts courses, although less cohesive to the students, allowed the students to perceive the integration of more academic activities and behaviors in those art classes. The authors argue that the students' familiarity with scholastic behaviors, understood by students as "doing school," impacted the students' capacity to perceive the cohesiveness of the academic curricula and recognize the integration of these behaviors and activities in the arts courses.

AB  - For successful and productive careers, undergraduate students need effective communication and critical thinking skills; information literacy is a substantial component in the development of these skills. Students often perceive communication courses as distinct and separate from their chosen discipline. Faculty from the Departments of English and Horticulture and the library at Iowa State University collaborated in a foundation communication course (English 250). The course incorporates five components--finding information sources; evaluating information sources; and preparing an annotated bibliography, a research paper, and a research poster--all within the context of horticulture. The objective of the collaboration was to integrate communication and information literacy concepts into English 250 and relate these concepts to the students' discipline of horticulture. Assessment data and focus group discussions strongly validate students' appreciation for an interdisciplinary approach to teaching communication and information literacy skills within the discipline.

AB  - Inspired by "BIO2010" and leveraging institutional and external funding, Truman State University built an undergraduate program in mathematical biology with high-quality, faculty-mentored interdisciplinary research experiences at its core. These experiences taught faculty and students to bridge the epistemological gap between the mathematical and life sciences. Together they created the infrastructure that currently supports several interdisciplinary courses, an innovative minor degree, and long-term interdepartmental research collaborations. This article describes how the program was built with support from the National Science Foundation's Interdisciplinary Training for Undergraduates in Biology and Mathematics program, and it shares lessons learned that will help other undergraduate institutions build their own program.

AB  - This account identifies some of the tensions that became apparent in a large interdisciplinary technology-enhanced learning project as its members attempted to maintain their commitment to responsive, participatory research and development in naturalistic research settings while also "enacting" these commitments in formal research review processes. It discusses how these review processes were accompanied by a commitment to continuing discussion and elaboration across an extended research team and to a view of ethical practice as an aspect of "phronesis" or "practical wisdom" which demands understanding of specific situations and reference to prior experience. In this respect the interdisciplinary nature of the project allows the diverse experience of the project team to be brought into play, with ethical issues a joint point of focus for continuing interdisciplinary discourse.

AB  - A gerontological clinical nursing practice with an interdisciplinary focus was developed to provide opportunities for student nurses to expand their knowledge about aging, hone assessment skills, and critically examine beliefs about older adults. The practice included theory about older adults and a rotation through a variety of clinical settings where students had practice opportunities with older adults. Based on the written and verbal feedback the authors gathered from students and clinical staff, the authors not only learned that was there improvement in students' knowledge, skills, and interactions with older adults, but they also gained greater understanding of the working of an interdisciplinary team and were able to provide a leadership role to the team through their geriatric assessments and knowledge of older adults.

AB  - Given the complexity of current social structures and environmental problems, attaining a truly sustainable society seems rather improbable today. Not only has society not been planned for the complexity of the preconditions and effects that sustainability entails, sustainability is also unlikely given current individual consumption patterns, prevailing economic worldviews, and the short-term focus of political processes. In this context, transdisciplinary research is seen more and more as key to attaining social change towards sustainability. In order to do this, non-academic actors must be extensively involved in knowledge production, and normative considerations have to be explicitly incorporated. This paper targets three key areas for discussion. These are participation, value rationality and mutual learning. The interactions of participation and value rationalities through mutual learning processes are developed through two examples of ongoing transdisciplinary research and collaboration in Western Sweden.

AB  - The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Center for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) carried out the "Learning Sciences and Brain Research" project (1999-2007) to investigate how neuroscience research can inform education policy and practice. This transdisciplinary project brought many challenges. Within the political community, participation in the project varied, with some countries resisting approval of the project altogether, in the beginning. In the neuroscientific community, participants struggled to represent their knowledge in a way that would be meaningful and relevant to educators. Within the educational community, response to the project varied, with many educational researchers resisting it for fear that neuroscience research might make their work obsolete. Achieving dialogue among these communities was even more challenging. One clear obstacle was that participants had difficulty recognizing tacit knowledge in their own field and making this knowledge explicit for partners in other fields. This article analyzes these challenges through a knowledge management framework.

AB  - Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of the BRIGHTEN Program (Bridging Resources of an Interdisciplinary Geriatric Health Team via Electronic Networking), an interdisciplinary team intervention for assessing and treating older adults for depression in outpatient primary and specialty medical clinics. The BRIGHTEN team collaborates "virtually" to review patient assessment results, develop a treatment plan, and refer to appropriate team members for follow-up care. Design and Methods: Older adults in 9 academic medical center clinics and 2 community-based clinics completed screening forms for symptoms of depression and anxiety. Those with positive screens engaged in comprehensive assessment with the BRIGHTEN Program Coordinator; the BRIGHTEN virtual team provided treatment recommendations based on the results of assessment. A collaborative treatment plan was developed with each participant, who was then connected to appropriate services. Results: Two thousand four hundred twenty-two older adults were screened in participating clinics over a 40-month period. Eight hundred fifty-nine older adults screened positive, and 150 elected to enroll in BRIGHTEN. From baseline to 6 months, significant improvements were found in depression symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale, p less than 0.01) and general mental health (SF-12 Mental Component, p less than 0.01). Implications: The BRIGHTEN Program demonstrated that an interdisciplinary virtual team linked with outpatient medical clinics can be an effective, nonthreatening, and seamless approach to enable older adults to access treatment for depression.

AB  - Addressed is the current practice in educational reform of reducing time for science instruction in favor of traditional reading/language arts instruction. In contrast, presented is an evidence-based rationale for increasing instructional time for K-5 science instruction as an educational reform initiative. Overviewed are consensus interdisciplinary research and complementary multi-year findings of the Science IDEAS model demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating conceptually-relevant reading within science instruction in improving student achievement in both science and reading comprehension. Based on research summarized, increasing time for integrated K-5 science is advocated as a meaningful reform-based approach to science learning and reading comprehension proficiency that, in turn, better prepares students for subsequent success in science and content-area reading comprehension across upper elementary and middle school grades (3-8).

AB  - Learning communities are a growing tool in use at colleges and universities around the country. In large part, these communities have been created in the hope that they will increase interaction among students and teach them to apply knowledge in meaningful ways. In addition to generating student interaction, learning communities should strive to bring faculty together in collaborative settings. We should ask ourselves: how do faculty fit into the learning community? In a case study the author reflects upon his experience as a faculty member in a large multidisciplinary learning community. Recommendations provide guidance to those who are looking to develop teaching/classroom linkages with other departments on their campuses.

AB  - In today's competitive college market, "interdisciplinary studies" are a major selling point for colleges and universities. Yet, on closer examination, it is apparent that the academic structure and place of the majority of interdisciplinary programs, departments, and centers are not substantially different from the academic disciplines, departments, and divisions they were originally designed to challenge. The shift to university-as-service-industry has led to a need for increased specialization to provide specific marketable skills or sites of interests that can attract the student/customer. This most cynical reading sees institutional support for interdisciplinary studies as an attempt to create and foster niche markets. Furthermore, in striking this deal, interdisciplinary studies became complicit, if not responsible, for the fragmentation of the university into a series of localized specializations isolated from, and in competition with, one another to attract niche customers/students. Thus the interdisciplinary departments, programs, and centers found willing partners but at a price: their interdisciplinarity. Far from marking the dawn of an interdisciplinary era, this pact with the devil has marked the end of real interdisciplinarity. Is the very success of interdisciplinary studies leading to its demise? And are they displacing and discrediting the traditional disciplines along the way? Not yet, but these are real and pressing possibilities. In this article, the author proposes to take the threat seriously and use these questions as a springboard to think through the past, present, and future of interdisciplinary studies in an attempt to find productive and substantive ways for it to work and flourish within the current university system. The author suggests that everyone should work to usher in an era when interdisciplinary departments, programs, and centers do not supplant or replace the traditional disciplines but serve instead to create pathways and intersections, bringing faculty and students together for the common endeavor of intellectual exchange.

AB  - The objectives of the research reported in this article were to develop and evaluate an interdisciplinary primary school Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) curriculum as a collaboration among the subject areas of "kateika" (Japanese home economics), art, and music. In our curriculum, which focused on the improvement of "sensibility and creativity" as embodied knowledge, the students were encouraged to use their five senses, express their feelings and ideas, and to freely explore their imaginations. Our sample consisted of 38 sixth-graders in the primary school attached to a national university. Assessment of curriculum effectiveness revealed that the students learned to think about alternatives while questioning convention, to use all five senses, and to look at things from different angles. The students were also encouraged to explore and pursue their personal interests and to develop the motivation and determination to put forth effort in order to succeed.

AB  - The theories and tenets of multiculturalism and feminism require psychologists to extend awareness, knowledge, and skills for competent practice, research, and teaching. In addition, these theories and tenets challenge us to become social change agents. In the article "Training Counseling Psychologists as Social Justice Agents: Feminist and Multicultural Principles in Action," Goodman, Liang, Helms, Latta, Sparks, and Weintraub have carefully crafted an experience-informed template that will assist training programs in becoming active agents for social justice. This commentary raises questions and challenges that extend collaboration across and within disciplines to achieve a broader platform to support specific social justice agendas. Questions are raised and explored regarding the engagement and retention of student interest in engaging in social justice activism.

AB  - The biochemistry and molecular biology of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is difficult to convey to students in a classroom setting in ways that capture their interest. The understanding of the matrix's roles in physiological and pathological conditions study will presumably be hampered by insufficient knowledge of its molecular structure. Internet-available resources can bridge the division between the molecular details and ECM's biological properties and associated processes. This article presents an approach to teach the ECM developed for first year medical undergraduates who, working in teams: (i) Explore a specific molecular component of the matrix, (ii) identify a disease in which the component is implicated, (iii) investigate how the component's structure/function contributes to ECM' supramolecular organization in physiological and in pathological conditions, and (iv) share their findings with colleagues. The approach--designated i-cell-MATRIX--is focused on the contribution of individual components to the overall organization and biological functions of the ECM. i-cell-MATRIX is student centered and uses 5 hours of class time. Summary of results and take home message: A "1-minute paper" has been used to gather student feedback on the impact of i-cell-MATRIX. Qualitative analysis of student feedback gathered in three consecutive years revealed that students appreciate the approach's reliance on self-directed learning, the interactivity embedded and the demand for deeper insights on the ECM. Learning how to use internet biomedical resources is another positive outcome. Ninety percent of students recommend the activity for subsequent years. i-cell-MATRIX is adaptable by other medical schools which may be looking for an approach that achieves higher student engagement with the ECM.

AB  - This study examines ability of an interdisciplinary group project to develop student's abilities to work successfully in groups in a creative context. Group dynamics were investigated via interaction effects between students in a Graphic Design and Marketing class project. A repeated measures survey technique was used to assess student's perceptions of group projects and their attributes. As a result of the project, student perceptions concerning the importance of creative contributions, as well as group participation factors became more positive, demonstrating that interdisciplinary group projects with students in a creative discipline offer business students a unique "outside the box" learning opportunity.

AB  - The world faces a number of complex challenges that are sometimes referred to as "wicked problems." Universities have been relatively poor at preparing graduates for such challenges, yet it will be the future professionals who need to tackle the problems. This essay looks at two related projects that have attempted to advance the skills training of graduates for a complex world, in the context of educating engineers and scientists in sustainable development. A Delphi study conducted in the UK suggested that systemic, student-centred approaches were vital to the appropriate development of undergraduates to become engineers with skills in sustainable development. A pilot project sponsored by the UK Royal Academy of Engineering developed an inter-disciplinary course unit, using student-centred principles, to embed the principles of sustainable development, in its broadest sense, in the curricula of engineers and scientists. The essay includes an evaluation of this approach.

AB  - Increasingly administrators are concerned with inspiring and supporting faculty members in the creation of interdisciplinary programs in response to research and funding shifts and public need. This article presents an initiative undertaken at the University of Colorado Denver, demonstrating a method for identifying and launching a set of signature interdisciplinary programs for a diverse college environment that overcomes hesitancy and hindrances at the individual, departmental, and institutional levels.

AB  - As artists seek new ways to reflect an increasingly digital and global culture, theatrical dance in the UK and Europe has seen a growing collaboration and cross-fertilisation between forms of dance, theatre, visual art, film and technology. As the boundaries between artistic disciplines continue to blur, it seems clear that dance audiences need to examine how to engage with these increasingly multi-layered performances. How should the reader critically approach interdisciplinary dance performance? Can the current models and frames used for analysing dance be used to gain an understanding and appreciation of this cross-artform approach to dance-making? This paper explores interdisciplinary dance performance and examines three existing critical approaches that can be used by readers to analyse cross-artform dance. The paper provides a brief overview of the development of interdisciplinary dance performance and examines the work of current contemporary choreographers working in the UK and Europe. The paper then explores three current theoretical approaches that can be used to analyse dance: each of the selected models is described and applied to the dance work "Justitia" (2007) by Jasmin Vardimon. The paper seeks to identify the possibilities and limitations of the three critical approaches for the analysis of interdisciplinary dance. (Contains 1 note and 5 online resources.)

AB  - Interdisciplinary research requires that experts from multiple disciplines work together to combine methods and ideas in an integrative fashion to generate new knowledge. In many respects, the field of kinesiology is ideally positioned to take advantage of its inherent multidisciplinary design. Because of the multidisciplinary structure of kinesiology, we can develop research programs that draw on multiple disciplines within our departments. This kind of work is ongoing in fields such as biomechanics and motor control--working together in an integrative manner to produce new knowledge. We must also extend our work outside the boundaries of kinesiology and draw on expertise in such fields as engineering, biology, public health, and psychology and other disciplines to develop research programs that are competitive in federal funding initiatives. We must maintain our identity as a field of study and emphasize the fundamental importance of movement and physical activity for health and well-being.
