AB  - State coordinators of early hearing detection and intervention (EHDI) programs were asked to complete a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, or SWOT, analysis that consisted of 12 evaluative areas of EHDI programs. For the interdisciplinary area, 47 coordinators responded with 224 items, and themes were identified within each SWOT category. A threats, opportunities, weaknesses, and strengths, or TOWS, analysis yielded 8 recommendations that focused on specific themes. Out of these 8 recommendations, 3 strategies emerged: 1) increase communication through state EHDI program advisory boards or through a coalition of stakeholders and professionals; 2) develop a mechanism of linking or sharing data to reduce communication breakdown between providers and the EHDI program; and 3) monitor all goals and objectives to hold providers/agencies accountable for their part within the EHDI system. Addressed appropriately, these recommendations could improve interdisciplinary collaborations in state EHDI programs. (Contains 6 tables.)

AB  - Although collaborative research has become much more common in the social sciences, including political science, little is known about the consequences of collaboration. This article uses papers submitted to the "American Political Science Review" to assess whether the widely acknowledged benefits of collaboration produced papers that were more likely to be accepted for publication. The results indicate that collaboration per se made little or no difference, but that the disciplinary configuration of the authors did result in differences in the success of these submissions.

AB  - Conceptual models are useful for facing the challenges of environmental sciences curriculum and course developers and students. These challenges are inherent to the interdisciplinary and problem-oriented character of environmental sciences curricula. In this article, we review the merits of conceptual models in facing these challenges. These models are valuable because they can be used to (a) improve the coherence and focus of an environmental sciences curriculum, (b) analyze environmental issues and integrate knowledge, (c) examine and guide the process of environmental research and problem solving, and (d) examine and guide the integration of knowledge in the environmental-research and problem-solving processes. We advocate the use of various conceptual models in environmental sciences education. By applying and reflecting on these models, students start to recognize the complexity of human-environment systems, to appreciate the various approaches to framing environmental problems, and to comprehend the role of science in dealing with these problems.

AB  - This paper shows the scientific foundations of a natural phenomenon of undoubted interest and applicability in our day, fluorescence, and its possibilities for teaching at three educational levels: primary, secondary and university. It begins by describing the nature of the phenomenon and continues by explaining how we work with students of the levels mentioned. The method of teaching starts questioning them on fluorescent tubes and fluorescent material. These questions will lead to further research into three topics: 1) fluorescent materials; 2) features of the visual system; and 3) lighting systems, types of lamps and its characteristics. The work then demonstrates its usefulness as an interdisciplinary phenomenon and as a mean of motivating students' learning.

AB  - The increasingly interdisciplinary nature of today's scientific research is leading to the transformation of undergraduate education. In addressing these needs, the University of Houston's College of Technology has developed a new interdisciplinary research-based biotechnology laboratory curriculum. Using the pesticide degrading bacterium, "Brevundimonas diminuta," as an anchor organism, the curriculum follows a logical progression starting with isolation and identification of pesticide degrading soil microbes, gene cloning, gene expression, bioprocessing of the gene product and commercial applications, thus demonstrating the life cycle of a typical biotechnology product. These series of laboratory protocols use a guided inquiry method to teach appropriate techniques and skills and help students build a bridge between materials presented in courses and applications in real life. Students then apply these concepts and techniques in independently designed investigations. The modular nature of this curriculum makes it flexible for integration into a variety of courses and could serve as a model for interdisciplinary education.

AB  - The first semester Tax I student seems to be interested in the ethical issue of why citizens should report their income and only take legitimate tax deductions when it is unlikely that anyone will ever know. This paper addresses this issue from an interdisciplinary approach of accounting, philosophy, and political science. The accounting perspective discusses the issue from the expectations of the tax preparer and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The philosophical perspectives provides background of a citizen who might want to "do the right thing" for the sake of the common good. The political science perspective explores the political nature of the individual and corporate citizen and their approach to civic virtue.

AB  - Medieval Day at Reynolds turned a typical Friday class day into an interdisciplinary learning event, which joined faculty and students into a community of learners. From classrooms issued tales of Viking and Mongol conquests, religious crusaders, deadly plague, and majestic cathedrals and art, all told by costumed faculty members with expertise in medieval studies. In the commons area, medieval enactors helped participants learn how to card, spin, and weave, to dance, and to use broad sword techniques. This event at this college involved faculty, staff, and students in an interdisciplinary teaching and learning experience. In this article, the primary organizer of Reynolds's Medieval Day discusses its origin, details the schedule of events, and dispenses advice for any who might be interested in creating a similar college-wide experience.

AB  - Higher education is constantly changing and looking for innovative educational solutions in order to increase the level of the student's knowledge and skills. As an important part of this set of educational policies, a new process is emerging for the ideation, planning and implementation of multidisciplinary case studies for students with the aim of developing their knowledge, meaning learning, skills and abilities that necessary for a more complete picture of the problems. In this regard, this paper shows the main results obtained with the realization of joint innovative activity experience developed by multidisciplinary areas in the Business Administration Degree (Management, Corporate Finance and Statistics). This joint activity was proposed on a voluntary basis for those students interested in working in a complete practice with other students and also as a way of replacing the individual activities of each area of knowledge. Fourteen groups of 4-5 people have done this case study, on average, the percentage of participation is about 70% of the students. The design of this methodology with an evaluation system implies students receive a significant percentage of their continuous evaluation. Also, it has allowed the students to achieve at a practical level, the how to and knows how (versus levels, ordered from low to high level of knowledge: do's, shows how, knows how and knows) of a particular set of generic and specific skills.

AB  - This paper describes a novel Electrical Machine and Power Electronic Training Tool (EM&PE[subscript TT]), a methodology for using it, and associated experimental educational activities. The training tool is implemented by recreating a whole power electronics system, divided into modular blocks. This process is similar to that applied when analyzing a piece of industrial equipment by the functions of its various parts. The EM&PE[subscript TT] is divided into five areas: the power block, the electronic switch command, instrumentation, the control system, and the application environment. The training tool lets a user analyze each functional block and the relationships between functional blocks; it can be used either in local or remote mode, thus ensuring optimal effectiveness of the proposed learning methodology. The students can redesign the hardware and software blocks before reassembling them; this allows various different experimental projects to be run concurrently in the same training tool. The results presented here show that EM&PE[subscript TT] improves engineering students' technical skills and their motivation in experimental work. (Contains 14 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - The purpose of the study reported here was to investigate the iterative design development of an Academy for 11-18 year olds focusing on the following research question: "What are the features of the multi-disciplinary interactions and associated modelling techniques, which lead to the development of an Academy proposal which meets its Education Brief?" A case study approach bounded by time and focus group was adopted (Cresswell, 1998). This approach was adopted in order to create a rich picture of the social setting and to illustrate the complexity of the process referred to as "learning led design" from in depth analysis of the education brief, through iterative development in consultation with key stakeholders to the presentation of final proposals. Findings illustrate that collaborative interactions are an important feature of effective design development with cross disciplinary creative collaboration being the key to the development of successful outcomes.

AB  - The Writing and Learning Mentor programme (WLM) at University College London (UCL) supports a cross-disciplinary network of PhD students who act as writing mentors to students in their departments. WLM also offers the mentors a space in which to reflect on their own writing practices. The focus of this article is our work with the mentors and their sense of themselves as writers. Following a consideration of institutional and theoretical contexts for WLM, we describe how the programme operates. We then consider writer identity and the significance of the multidisciplinary nature of the programme. We argue that the programme's foregrounding of a "writing as social practice" model (as opposed to a skills-based paradigm) encourages participants to think anew about the relationship between writing, learning and the discipline; this approach also enables them to articulate and reflexively explore their experience as emerging professional writers in their fields.

AB  - The purpose of health education is to positively influence the health behavior of individuals and communities, as well as living and working conditions that affect health. The goal of a Healthy Lifestyles course that is offered to undergraduate students enrolled in a university general education program (e.g., liberal arts education, core curriculum) is to build fundamental skills and to promote voluntary behavior change activities. As defined by Moore (2006), liberal education is "a philosophy of education that empowers individuals, liberates the mind from ignorance and cultivates social responsibility" because it "provides students broad exposure to multiple disciplines and more in-depth study in at least one field or area of concentration" (p. 46). As much as this definition of liberal education is shared among those in liberal arts education programs and the health education profession alike, it was challenging to convince a group of diverse faculty from multiple programs (arts, sciences, social sciences, etc.) at a public university to approve a new general education course centered around health behaviors. During the past 20 years, the faculty at this public university resisted including a Healthy Lifestyles course in the requirements of the general education curriculum. This article discusses the process used to add a required Healthy Lifestyles course to the general education program. The effects of this innovation and its limitations will be discussed, as will the effects of the course on students. The benefits of including a health education course in the general education program will also be addressed. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - With the increasing emphasis on global learning as part of the redesigned institutional mission of American higher education, there will arguably be a need for a variety of global learning experiences across the undergraduate curriculum. Efforts to incorporate global learning in course content at home by globalizing or internationalizing the curricula are already underway at many institutions of higher education. This article offers a set of recommendations for educators wishing to globalize their courses by adopting an interdisciplinary approach to global learning specifically through the use of role-play simulations. As a problem-based pedagogy, role-play simulations are uniquely equipped to deliver interdisciplinary and global learning outcomes since both fields are explicitly geared towards practical problem-solving. It will be argued that an interdisciplinary approach to global learning through the use of role-play simulations offers a number of pedagogical advantages to traditional teaching techniques.

AB  - Management of "wicked problems", messy real-world problems that defy resolution, requires thinkers who can transcend disciplinary boundaries, work collaboratively, and handle complexity and obstacles. This paper explores how educators can train undergraduates in these skills through applied community-based research, using the example of an interdisciplinary research program at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, USA. Participating students strengthened their abilities to handle setbacks in the research process, improved communication and teamwork skills, and gained familiarity with interdisciplinary investigation. Programmatic elements that could transfer well to other settings include studying local human-environment problems, working in multigenerational, small groups, and using multiple methodologies.

AB  - This article provides educators in business schools with a new interdisciplinary experiential lab game called Supply Chain-Marketing (SC-Mark) Shark Tank game, which can be implemented in both Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Marketing courses. The SC-Mark experiential lab game is a real-life business environment simulation that explores complexities in advertising industry service supply chains. One hundred sixty-one undergraduate students participated in the game at two business schools over two semesters. The effectiveness of the game was measured and analyzed, qualitatively and quantitatively, based on text analysis of the feedback received from participating students. The results revealed five themes that helped student teams understand how advertising companies integrate and improve their service supply chains--buyer-supplier relationships, supply chain functions and operations, consumer focus and orientation, community focus, and overall risk management.

AB  - Background/Context: Billions of dollars are spent annually on professional development (PD) for educators, yet few randomized controlled trials (RCT) have demonstrated the ultimate impact PD has on student learning. Further, while policymakers and others speak to the role schools should play in developing students' civic awareness, RCTs of PD designed to foster civic learning are rare. This randomized controlled trial contributes to the knowledge base on the effectiveness of PD designed to integrate civic learning, ethical reflection, and historical thinking skills into high school humanities courses. Focus of Study: The study examined the impact of a PD intervention in two areas: (a) teacher self-efficacy, burnout, and professional engagement and satisfaction; and (b) the academic, civic, social, and ethical competencies of 9th and 10th grade students in the teachers' classes. Population/Participants/Subjects: The study involved 113 teachers and 1,371 9th and 10th grade students in 60 high schools from eight metropolitan regions in the United States. Intervention/Program/Practice: The intervention, Facing History and Ourselves, provides PD through a five-day seminar, curricular materials, and follow-up coaching and workshops to help teachers develop their capacities to implement an interdisciplinary historical case study unit using student-centered pedagogy. Research Design: The study used a school-level, randomized, experimental design to investigate impacts of the intervention for teachers and their 9th and 10th grade students. Findings/Results: Intervention teachers showed significantly greater self-efficacy in all eight assessed domains, more positive perceptions of professional support, satisfaction and growth, and greater personal accomplishment. Intervention students demonstrated stronger skills for analyzing evidence, agency, and cause and effect on an historical understanding performance measure; greater self-reported civic efficacy and tolerance for others with different views; and more positive perceptions of the classroom climate and the opportunities afforded for engaging with civic matters. Fidelity analysis found these causal effects despite the fact that roughly half of the intervention teachers did not fully implement the program. Conclusions/Recommendations: Educators need evidence-based approaches for teaching complex social, civic, and political issues enabling students of diverse mindsets and backgrounds to engage constructively with one another while obtaining necessary skills and knowledge. These findings provide empirical support for a professional development approach that engages teachers in fostering academic and civic competencies critical to both participation in a democracy and success in college and career.

AB  - This paper discusses the ethical issues faced in undertaking research about the role of learning in the subjective experience of chronic illness, where data were taken from social media. Drawing on psychology and education, this paper discusses the ways in which authors from these disciplines are laying the groundwork for legitimate online research by actively debating the public versus private nature of online spaces. The paper explains how this debate informed the development of an ethical approach to research. Relevant ethical guidelines and previous research are used to support the argument that individuals' informed consent is not necessary in online contexts where data exist within the public domain, and where risk of harm to users is low. This paper provides an insight into one educational researcher's journey through the process of doing ethical social media research, and suggests ways forward for others embarking upon that same journey.

AB  - This article reviews the literature on challenges faced by engineering faculty in educating their students on community-engaged, sustainable technical solutions in developing countries. We review a number of approaches to increasing teaching modules on social and community components of international development education, from adding capstone courses and educational track seminars to integrating content from other disciplines, particularly the social sciences. After summarising recent pedagogical strategies to increase content on community-focused development, we present a case study of how one engineering programme incorporates social work students and faculty to infuse strategies for community engagement in designing and implementing student-led global engineering development projects. We outline how this interdisciplinary pedagogical approach teaches students from the two disciplines to work together in addressing power balances, economic and social issues and overall sustainability of international development projects.

AB  - Since 2002, a multidisciplinary program has been used to encourage science students to build on their chemical knowledge and to appreciate how it applies to the world around them. The program is interactive and instills a new set of core learning skills that are often underrepresented in undergraduate curricula, namely, cooperative learning, communication
and presentation skills, and resource mining. The second-year science cohort of 220 students is divided into small groups. Each group proposes a topic through which to explore the societal role played by chemistry. The program has two components: a report written by pairs of students and
a short competitive group presentation. The multiple positive outcomes of the program have been assessed, including the less tangible benefit of a renewed connectivity between students and staff engaged in the pursuit of chemistry. (Contains 3 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - In July 2010, the faculties of Law, Business and Economics, and Medicine at Monash University, Australia commenced placing law, finance, and social work students in a multidisciplinary clinic at a community legal service operated by the University. Students from the three disciplines began seeing legal service clients at the same time as a team. Clients who agreed to participate were interviewed by the team of students made up of the three disciplines in order to address client issues holistically. This article canvasses some of the perceived learning benefits of this project for students and their supervisors. It investigates how and why supervision within this clinic is a unique experience for students and supervisors alike. It raises the issues of dealing with the different ethical and professional guidelines of the three disciplines. Ultimately, we conclude that multidisciplinary training may have a wide range of advantages for all parties. (Contains 2 footnotes.)

AB  - Project-based learning (PjBL) is argued to foster a more democratic approach to education, particularly through increasing students' autonomy over their learning. This article presents the findings of research into students' views relating to autonomy over topic choice and group constitution during a series of trial interdisciplinary PjBL activities with first-year geography, earth and environmental sciences (GEES) undergraduates in a UK university. Semi-structured interviews with participating students and tutors, in addition to audio-recordings of staff-student discussion during student-led presentation sessions, formed the data set analysed for this article. Findings suggest that while some degree of autonomy was welcomed, participants largely favoured prescription regarding research question and group membership. This has implications for the implementation of PjBL and its potential to foster democratization within the GEES disciplines.

AB  - International-mindedness is defined in many different ways in education discourse. Some of the definitions include the ability to be open-minded and respectful of cultures and peoples or having an awareness of the interconnectedness of people not only intellectually but also with growing empathy. Do music educators have any role in helping students acquire and develop international-mindedness? We would like to suggest it is an essential part of music education and an exciting way to teach/learn about cultures and music. We describe eight strategies of an Internationalized Approach to Instruction (IAI) that can make learning cultural musics more meaningful, accurate, and exciting for teachers, students, and the community.

AB  - The primary to high school student population in Jamaica has become more academically diverse, and schools are experiencing the pressures of implementing reform programs without adequate financial and professional development support. The schools facing the greatest challenges and needs in Jamaica are often those in the rural areas. Researchers applied the instructional consultation (IC) model to establish collaborative partnerships with educators in rural Jamaica for the purpose of sharing instructional experiences in literacy and mathematics. A definition of IC, the aspect of the model used, and a description of the project and outcomes are provided. Finally, lessons learned relating to the difficulties of staying true to the consultation process and future directions of this partnership are highlighted.

AB  - The impact of humans on aquatic systems is covered in French high schools in the "Premiere" level (ages 16 to 17) by students studying economics and social sciences. We designed experiments to teach critical thinking about water pollution and how citizens can act to minimise it. The experimental session, which lasts three consecutive days, takes place in a non-profit public training centre for experimental science located within a research institute. The classroom is divided into groups of four to seven students, and each group is tutored by a PhD student. High school students are presented with results from publications on fish mutations, develop hypotheses, perform experiments and discuss their results, just as researchers do in their daily work. Students learn to ask and answer the following questions on the biological, chemical, economic and social aspects of water pollution: What are the origins of biological and chemical pollutants in an aquatic ecosystem? How can the population be made aware of aquatic pollution? How can the willingness of the local population to pay for the protection of their regional ecosystem be evaluated? At the end of the experimental session, each group of students prepares a poster presentation and discusses with an external expert. (Contains 6 figures, 3 tables, and 3 notes.)

AB  - The call to "creativity" has become increasingly familiar as a catch-phrase of higher education policy. Much current academic and policy discussion, however, is based on assertions of the importance of "more creativity" without any clear sense of what the implications are for the disciplinary cultures that organise knowledge work within universities. This paper explores ways that transdisciplinarity can assist in making creativity more evident in the teaching and research activities of universities. It draws on transdisciplinary activity in the Creative Industries Faculty of one Australian university to explore this issue. The argument put here is that a transdisciplinary knowledge environment has a greater capacity to inform creative work futures. Such an environment is not so easily created in practice, as the paper demonstrates by elaborating lessons learnt from a transdisciplinary re-structure within the authors' own university context.

They address the encounter between client and counsellor leading to relational ethics, the relevance of everyday action theory and methods for the analysis of goal-directed processes as joint actions, projects, and careers. Research on the school-to-work transition illustrates this conceptualisation and analysis. Links to other disciplines concerned with vocational guidance are identified.

AB  - A fully realized disability studies (DS) of music is interdisciplinary, qualitative and accessible through common discourse, without jargon, disciplinary codes, or numerology. It embraces DS's social model theory, where "disability" is the social construction of "impairment," analogous to the relationship between "gender" and "sex." The interdisciplinary transcendence of forms and norms of individual fields is a scholarly/political stance consistent with liberatory DS goals. The recent emergence of music DS, with few precedents from traditional musicology/theory, has mandated greater interdisciplinarity, employing the full range of social and somatic scholarship, as well as popular culture references. The most critical issues in music DS are in education, beyond music-specific concerns, and best expressed qualitatively as individual and group narratives. The often covertly quantitative nature of music theory is outed as oppressive to people with disabilities and contrasted with the liberatory power of sharing stories.

AB  - In this article we propose a five-step sequenced approach to integrative interdisciplinary learning in undergraduate gateway courses. Drawing from the literature of interdisciplinarity, transformative learning theory, and theories of reflective learning, we utilize a sequence of five steps early in our respective undergraduate gateway courses to foster preliminary lessons crucial for integrative interdisciplinary learning. Collectively, these steps help students recognize their own worldviews evan as they will eventually understand and value the multiple disciplinary perspectives to be integrated in interdisciplinary work. The five steps discussed in this article are initial community-building activities, a class viewing of a segment from "The Muppet Show" featuring Harry Belafonte, a combination of class and small group discussion, an intellectual autobiography assignment, and our adaptations of "Smith Magazine's" Six-Word Memoirs.

The following study evaluated the impact of mental health treatment provided by the Assessment, Support, and Counseling (ASC) Center, an SMH health initiative located within a high school in rural western North Carolina during the 2011-2012 school year. Participants were high school students between 14 and 18 years of age, predominately Caucasian (91.3%) and female (65.5%). Treatment was evaluated based on score change on the Youth Outcome Questionnaire using the reliable change index (RCI; Jacobson & Truax, 1991) to track changes in symptomatology. Following ASC Center treatment, 63% of the clinical sample was deemed to have improved or recovered based on the RCI. While the study did not use an experimental design (with associated cautions regarding interpretation of findings), the results suggest that a moderate dosage of cognitive-behavioural therapy provided to adolescents in the context of a rural SMH programme is associated with reliable change for the majority of youth who take part in the treatment.

AB  - One of the dangers that we should be aware of when we study issues of language policy and planning is the fragmentary perspective by which they can be approached. Reality, by contrast, is interrelated and overlapping. This is why a complexity perspective stresses the importance of studying the contexts of phenomena, that is to say, their external relations. The direction to be followed here leads towards a better understanding of reality as a set of open systems that are in continuous exchange with the surrounding ecosystem, bearing in mind always that any apparent stability is the result of a dynamic equilibrium. Making headway towards an interdisciplinary approach is therefore necessary and imperative. Headings such as "status/normative/institution" vis-à-vis others such as "solidarity/normal/individual" seem to imply a basic distinction in the definition of sociocultural reality. To discover and understand the dynamics of the interaction between these two major categories is, in fact, one of the most important subjects waiting to be addressed by language planning and policy strategies and more broadly by sociolinguistics. An interrelated set of guiding questions for the field could thus be stated as follows: "What group or organisation, in pursuit of what overall objective or intention, wants to achieve what, where, how and when; and what do they actually achieve, and why?" With this approach, even if how a group or organisation obtains its desired goal -- that is, its actual intervention -- is included as one of the main elements in a piece of research, the research will not focus exclusively on this topic, but will frame the intervention and identify how it is interrelated with all the other elements involved globally in this phenomenon, trying to establish a clear theoretical understanding of the entire interwoven set of events and processes.

AB  - The US National Science Foundation's (NSF's) Undergraduate Biology and Mathematics (UBM) program significantly increased undergraduate research in the biomathematical sciences. We discuss three UBM-funded student research projects at Clarkson University that lie at the intersection of not just mathematics and biology, but also other fields. The first project focused on optimizing a network model for how the brain detects and reacts to threats, an important problem in neuroscience. The second project sought to classify species of lizards based on geometric features of their shapes. This is a classic problem in evolutionary biology that became an innovative problem in mathematical imaging science when the students developed methods to analyze on features extracted from image data. The final project was psychology based and aimed at developing statistical methods for analyzing the behavioral and psychosocial effects of caffeine use by college students. This article describes the logistics of our UBM research program, the student projects, and, most importantly, the lessons learned working with students and other researchers from a wide range of backgrounds in the formal setting of an NSF-funded undergraduate research program.

AB  - As our understanding of complex environmental issues increases, institutions of higher education are evolving to develop new learning models that emphasize synthesis across disciplines, concepts, data, and methodologies. To this end, we argue for the implementation of environmental science education at the intersection of systems theory and service learning. A tight coupling of systems theory and service learning provides learners with the knowledge and skills required to tackle contemporary social-environmental challenges. The tangible benefits of a systems theory--service learning (STSL) curriculum occur in two principal learning areas: increased knowledge breadth and depth. Systems theory requires a broad assessment of social and environmental changes, whereas service learning promotes a brand of research and teaching resulting in a deepening of knowledge through field immersion. We present the tangible benefits of this deepening and broadening process along three axes: appreciation, research methods, and communication. (Contains 2 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - Research suggests that better educational preparation is necessary to assure that health care social workers have the competencies essential for high quality interdisciplinary palliative care practice. This study is a qualitative evaluation of those elements contributing to competence and confidence in interdisciplinary practice skills of second year MSW students. Analysis of student narratives yielded two prominent themes: (1) social work students' relationships to members of other disciplines, which included understanding of other professions' knowledge and scope of practice as well as respect for and from professionals of other disciplines, and (2) the social work students' self-representation as members of the profession and identities as team members. These study findings support the creation of courses that include students from disciplines represented in palliative care.

AB  - With the realities of standards-based accountability, it is imperative to model and demonstrate for students how subject areas and teaching methods transcend across traditional boundaries. In an effort to prepare future social studies educators to teach for global awareness and to meaningfully integrate critical literacy skills into their instruction, we initiated a collaborative model in our university's middle grades teacher education program with language arts and social studies methods courses. The development of cultural competency not only provides preservice teachers with the knowledge of diverse populations but also enables them to have an increased ability to affirm the cultures of others.

AB  - This article highlights aspects of an interdisciplinary (chemistry-applied linguistics) English for Specific Purposes (ESP) course- and materials-development project. The project was aimed at raising genre awareness among chemistry students and faculty, in addition to improving students' disciplinary reading and writing. As part of the project, full-length chemistry journal articles were analyzed. We describe select results of this analysis and the prominent role played by chemists in the process. Emphasis is placed on the organizational structure of chemistry journal articles, focusing on the Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion (A-IMRDC) sections. Two predominant organizational patterns emerged from our analyses, specifically A-IMR[DC] and A-IM[R(DC)], with brackets signifying sections merged under one major heading. Move-analysis findings are converted into easy-to-interpret instructional tools labeled "move structures akin to flow charts" for two target audiences (chemistry students and faculty). The rhetorical structure of the chemistry journal article is then compared to journal articles published in biochemistry, an overlapping discipline. The article concludes with pedagogical implications and suggestions for ESP professionals engaged in genre analysis. (Contains 6 figures.)

AB  - Transformative learning aims to awaken students to issues of injustice, and to promote their critical analysis of assumptions, beliefs and values that lead to and sustain social inequities, so that they may become agents of social change. This paper introduces the Sensitise Take Action and Reflection (STAR) framework, which encapsulates transformative learning principles, as a tool for educators to enhance student health professionals' capacity and preparedness to address health inequities they are likely to encounter in their future practice. Using an action research methodology within a three-cycle process, STAR was trialled and evaluated by an interdisciplinary team of health educators (n = 25) in an Australian university. Disciplines included: nursing, nutrition and dietetics, public health, occupational therapy and paramedic science. Data were gathered via individual interviews, focus group discussions and field notes, and were analysed inductively, with member-checking of emerging themes to ensure interpretive rigour. The results of this research suggest that STAR is easily understood by users, has relevance for health professional education, and holds promise for producing desired educational outcomes within and across health disciplines. Furthermore, this project could be considered a model for fostering inter-professional collaboration in health education, research and practice. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - With the rollout of edTPA, Common Core Standards (CCS), and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), there is renewed interest in teacher education programs providing an interdisciplinary approach to curriculum. Yet, future teachers are under increased pressure to pass standardized exams, such as the MTEL, WIFOR and PRAXIS, with a focus on content-specific instruction. Curriculum and assessment policy initiatives present contradictory messages regarding best practice. This research study examines an interdisciplinary approach to teaching content in one early childhood education teacher preparation program. Teaching that crosses disciplines and honors the content and epistemology of each discipline is complex and challenging to convey. Data for this yearlong study exploring student and faculty understanding of teaching from an interdisciplinary perspective at a small liberal arts college included semester-end surveys, focal student interviews, final projects, and faculty surveys. Based on this research, we suggest that integration of content area specialists in college curriculum courses, cross-institutional attention to effective integration strategies, and purposeful interdisciplinary field placements are needed as early childhood educators face continued policy reform.

AB  - Catholic colleges and universities traditionally are grounded in liberal arts education, yet many Catholic institutions also educate future scientists and engineers. We propose that a distinctively Catholic science and engineering education should include an emphasis on Catholic concepts of the common good and social justice, liberal arts education that enriches and informs science and engineering practice and vice versa, and commitment to service. Moreover, we propose that Catholic colleges consider implementing curricular changes designed to bring the humanistic and technical disciplines into closer alignment. New curricula could include a capstone undergraduate course that draws on interdisciplinary faculty with the goal of giving science and engineering students the tools needed to be ethical practitioners in a frequently unethical world. Such a course would also provide humanists with a better understanding of the technological world in which we all live, enabling graduates to make well-informed decisions throughout their lives.

AB  - An interdisciplinary laboratory experiment involving second-year undergraduate organic chemistry and introductory inorganic chemistry undergraduate students is described. Organic chemistry students prepare a series of amine-bis(phenols) via a Mannich reaction, and characterize their products using melting point; FTIR; and [superscript 1]H, [superscript 13]C, DEPT-135, and HSQC NMR experiments. In the inorganic chemistry laboratory, students utilize these amine ligands to prepare a series of octahedral titanium complexes, and characterize the resultant complexes using FTIR, and [superscript 1]H, [superscript 13]C, DEPT-135, and HSQC NMR spectroscopy. Students are asked to revisit concepts such as the two- and three-dimensional representations of their target molecules and reaction mechanisms throughout both experiments. From these experiments, students gain an appreciation for the multidisciplinary nature of chemistry.

AB  - Introduction: Our goal was to compare behavioral- and information-based interventions aimed at increasing prescription of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by interdisciplinary teams during pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). Methods: Six hospital PR programs were randomly assigned to a "behavioral- or information-based intervention." Both interventions provided evidence supporting IMT and its prescription details. However, the behavioral-based intervention focused on barriers and challenges to IMT prescription informed by a nationwide survey and the theory of planned behavior (TPB). It included hands-on practice and content, in part, was driven by learners' questions. In contrast, the information-based intervention delivered information in a typical didactic education session followed by a demonstration and question period. It was supplemented with evidence-based research articles. The primary outcome was the change in prescription rate of IMT for COPD patients by determining the difference during the 6 months preceding compared to the 6 months during the interventions. Results: Sixty-one health professionals and 488 COPD outpatients within 6 PR programs participated. No COPD patients were prescribed IMT at any of the sites during the 6-month preintervention phase. The behavioral-based intervention resulted in an IMT prescription rate of 10.2% to people with COPD, whereas the information-based intervention resulted in no IMT prescriptions. Discussion: A behavioral-based intervention that is based on TPB and addresses challenges identified by health professionals is more effective than a traditional lecture approach to increase health professionals' prescription of IMT for patients with COPD.

AB  - Introduction: The pilot study reported here determined the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary group rehabilitation program, Visually Impaired Elderly Persons Participating (VIPP), on psychosocial functioning. Methods: The single-group pretest-posttest pilot study included 29 persons with visual impairments (aged 55 and older) who were referred to a low-vision rehabilitation center. The VIPP intervention (20 weekly meetings) consisted of four components (practical training; education, social interaction, counseling, and training in problem-solving skills; individual and group goal setting; and a home-based exercise program). Psychosocial adaptation to vision loss, helplessness, self-efficacy, mental health, and fear of falling were used as indicators of psychosocial functioning and were assessed at the baseline, halfway, immediately after completion of the intervention, and at the six-month follow-up. Results: Directly after the intervention, the participants' adaptation to vision loss (ES = 0.57), self-efficacy (ES = 0.50), and mental health (ES = 0.39) improved compared to the baseline. Moreover, helplessness and a generic and vision-specific fear of falling decreased (ES = 0.26, ES = 0.20, and ES = 0.24, respectively). The six-month follow-up measure indicated improved adaptation to vision loss (ES = 0.54), a lesser feeling of helplessness (ES = 0.53), better mental health (ES = 0.22), and a lesser vision-specific fear of falling (ES = 0.27). In contrast, a decrease in self-efficacy (ES = 0.14) and an increase in the generic fear of falling (ES = 0.18) were found. Discussion: The tentative conclusion of this small-scale pilot study is that the VIPP program benefits psychosocial functioning in both the short and long term. Implications for practitioners: The study showed that low-vision rehabilitation centers could implement multidisciplinary group rehabilitation programs, such as VIPP, to improve the psychosocial functioning of elderly people who are visually impaired.

AB  - Combining the interdisciplinary studies (primarily humanities) literature with the content analysis of 129 successful National Science Foundation proposals written predominantly by science and engineering faculty members, the authors identify five categories of learning outcomes for interdisciplinary graduate education: disciplinary grounding, integration, teamwork, communication, and critical awareness. They identify important parallels between humanities-based descriptions of interdisciplinary integration and implicit graduate learning outcomes hinted at by engineering and science faculty who more frequently work in teams. Applying the lens of interdisciplinary studies (humanities) to science and engineering provides important depth and focus to engineering and science interdisciplinary learning outcomes, particularly in detailing integration processes.

AB  - Interdisciplinary curriculum development is challenging in the sense that materials from more than one discipline have to be integrated in a seamless manner. A faculty member has to develop expertise in multiple disciplines in order to teach an interdisciplinary course, or the course has to be team-taught. Both approaches are difficult to implement. There are administrative issues, such as proportional posting of expenditures across departmental budgets for the courses taught collaboratively, or courses with students from multiple departments. This paper describes the development and teaching of a sequence of bioinformatics related interdisciplinary courses for incorporation into undergraduate biology curricula. Three courses were developed with collaboration between the Departments of Biology and Computer Science at Tuskegee University. Each course contains contents from different subjects, traditionally considered to be virtually independent of each other. The courses have contents from biology, computer science, statistics, mathematics and biochemistry. The first two courses, Introduction to Bioscience Computing and Biological Algorithms & Data Structures, cover the computing and computer science fundamentals necessary for the informed use of bioinformatics tools. The third is an introductory course in bioinformatics. The focus was on teaching the effective use of bioinformatics tools, as compared to development of bioinformatics tools which is more relevant at the graduate level. Administrative issues encountered are also discussed. This work was supported by a NSF HBCU-UP grant.

AB  - An interdisciplinary and engaging practical is detailed which offers great versatility in the study of a qualitative and quantitative metabolism of azo-dyes by "Staphylococcus aureus". This practical has broad scope for adaptation in the number and depth of variables to allow a focused practical experiment or small research project. Azo-dyes are an important group of dyes characterised by the presence of an azo-bond within the molecule. Many bacteria are able to produce azoreductases--enzymes which cleave the azo-bond of such dyes, decolourising them. This visual representation of metabolism offers a simple and inexpensive method to study bacterial metabolism and the variables which may affect this. The practical experiment combines basic microbiological and biochemical techniques whereby broth cultures are incubated with an azo-dye, and dye degradation is photometrically monitored. Microbiological methods may also be employed to monitor the resulting microbial growth. Example results are shown from student data to highlight the effects of differing broth media and how metabolism and growth may change over a 24-hour incubation period. The performance, analysis and interpretation of the findings may prove beneficial to test a variety of skills and aptitudes within both secondary and tertiary biological education.

AB  - Schools need leaders who are prepared to address the complex challenges of the current educational landscape. Questions remain, however, as to the best way to support the development of leaders across disciplines. As graduate educators training new principals, school psychologists and school counselors, a strength afforded is the opportunity to explore the value of shared leadership at the pre- service level. This paper presents a piloted model of interdisciplinary training of graduate students in education to be leaders and change agents committed to culturally responsive positive outcomes in addressing challenging student behavior. The roles and functions of each specific discipline were explored, frames of viewing discipline unpacked and skill development in communicating around emotionally challenging topics provided.

AB  - Music is recognized as an effective mode of teaching young children but is rarely used in university-level science courses. This article reviews the somewhat limited evidence on whether and how content-rich music might affect college students' understanding of science and offers practical suggestions for incorporating music into courses. Aside from aiding memorization, songs may potentially improve learning by helping students feel relaxed and welcome in stressful settings, engaging students through multiple modes (verbal vs. nonverbal) and modalities (auditory vs. visual vs. kinesthetic) simultaneously, challenging students to integrate and "own" the material through the medium of song lyrics, and increasing students' time on task outside of class through enjoyable listening or songwriting assignments. Students may produce content-rich songs of good quality if given sufficient assistance and encouragement by instructors and peers. The challenges ahead include 1) defining the circumstances in which music is most likely to promote learning and 2) developing rubrics for evaluating the quality of songs. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - This article examines empirically and systematically whether a string quartet (SQ) ensemble is perceived as a self-managed team (SMT). SMTs, which were initially employed in the industrial world, are groups of employees that have a total responsibility for a defined project. The hypothesis that the SQ would exhibit more typical SMT characteristics than other music ensembles was established in one experiment and reconfirmed in a second experiment. The assessment of the SMT characteristics in these experiments was based on an adaptation of the Self-Managing Work Team Effectiveness questionnaire that had been originally devised for working groups in the business context, and was proven in the present study to be appropriate for music ensembles as well. Possible ways to implement these interdisciplinary findings are suggested. (Contains 2 notes, 4 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - This article takes restorative justice as an example of an initiative that crosses disciplinary boundaries, and that has been usefully applied within educational contexts. Grounded in criminology, restorative justice also has roots in psychology, education, sociology, peace studies, philosophy and law. The article draws on an ESRC funded seminar series which investigated interdisciplinary perspectives on restorative justice and their applicability to education. The series found that the ways in which restorative justice is conceptualised and applied varies according to disciplinary norms and assumptions. It is this creative tension that the current article explores.

AB  - This article addressed the need for authentic interdisciplinary instruction. Authentic interdisciplinary instruction is defined as a learning activity that simultaneously improves student performance related to grade-level standards in two or more disciplines (e.g., science and physical education). The process described for creating authentic interdisciplinary lessons included: (1) get a list of grade level standards from all disciplines; (2) compare the list of standards to the physical education standards at the same grade level; (3) look for related standards (commonalities) from two or more disciplines; and (4) create interdisciplinary lessons that address these standards. Interdisciplinary instruction can help teachers provide students with an enjoyable, rich, and motivational learning environment (Leppo & Davis, 2005).

AB  - As educators, the authors believe in guiding students towards the life skills, knowledge, and expertise they need to succeed in life and in the workforce of the 21st century. With that in mind, they have created a project in which students drive their own learning through creativity and collaborative work to develop an efficient product. Through the project, students are exposed to new technology applications, and they become more proficient communicators and advanced problems solvers. The project is an interdisciplinary unit in which students from health and technology education classes apply a variety of skills to create and program a student-designed robot. In the course of assembling and operating a simple robot, students practice critical thinking, creativity, problem solving, use of Web 2.0, and more. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Interdisciplinary approaches are often seen as necessary for attacking the most critical challenges facing the world today, and doctoral students and their training programs are recognized as central to increasing interdisciplinary research capacity. However, the traditional culture and organization of higher education are ill-equipped to facilitate interdisciplinary work. This study employs a lens of socialization to study the process through which students learn the norms, values, and culture of both traditional disciplines and integrated knowledge production. It concludes that many of the processes of socialization are similar, but that special attention should be paid to overcoming organizational barriers to interdisciplinarity related to policies, space, engagement with future employers, and open discussion of the politics of interdisciplinarity.

AB  - Multidisciplinary programs have begun to complement traditional models of graduate and professional education. The development of these programs has begun to reflect the change in graduate student advisement. Multidisciplinary programs necessitate the need for quality advisement approaches. This study assessed faculty satisfaction and commitment to advising graduate students in the Multidisciplinary Studies Individualized (MDSI) program at a metropolitan college in New York State. The intent was to examine faculty level of satisfaction, level of commitment and identify barriers to advising MDSI students. This quantitative study employed a paired samples t-test to compare faculty advising groups. The findings revealed MDSI graduate faculty experience lower levels of satisfaction and commitment compared to single disciplinary graduate faculty. Quotes obtained from faculty advising groups revealed academic advising and MDSI program structure as key barriers to advising MDSI students. Recommendations offer strategies for enhancing advising practices to benefit MDSI graduate faculty, students and the college.

AB  - The contemporary fields of interdisciplinary studies and the policy sciences have evolved over similar intellectual paths and timelines, beginning in the early 20th century. Both have their roots in professional efforts--within and outside the academy--to address numerous, growing, and complex problems that face humanity. The policy sciences' approach to integration via interdisciplinarity serves the civic and public processes of community and decision making that address these problems, while at the same time respecting the individual human being. This goal explicitly seeks dignity for all individuals in healthy environments. The policy sciences offer a framework and an intellectual toolbox with a fundamental set of operations to achieve integration via interdisciplinarity in the interests of problem solving. This framework guides interdisciplinarity in practical, teachable, and learnable terms, the history of which mirrors the evolution of interdisciplinary studies. A review of the policy sciences in the context of interdisciplinary studies emphasizes their shared heritage and raises important questions about how isolated communities of scholars and practitioners with a convergent evolution might collaborate to promote greater achievement of their common goals.

AB  - As interdisciplinary courses are developed, instructors and researchers have to grapple with questions of how students should make connections across disciplines. We explore the issue of interdisciplinary reconciliation (IDR): how students reconcile seemingly contradictory ideas from different disciplines. While IDR has elements in common with other frameworks for the reconciliation of ideas across contexts, it differs in that each disciplinary idea is considered canonically correct within its own discipline. The setting for the research is an introductory physics course for biology majors that seeks to build greater interdisciplinary coherence and therefore includes biologically relevant topics such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and chemical bond energy. In our case-study data, students grapple with the apparent contradiction between the energy released when the phosphate bond in ATP is broken and the idea that an energy input is required to break a bond. We see students justifying context-dependent modeling choices, showing nuance in articulating how system choices may be related to disciplinary problems of interest. This represents a desired end point of IDR, in which students can build coherent connections between concepts from different disciplines while understanding each concept in its own disciplinary context. Our case study also illustrates elements of the instructional environment that play roles in the process of IDR.

AB  - Recently, interdisciplinary instruction has come back to the educational scene, specifically supported through the Common Core State Standards. As teacher educators and former middle-level teachers, the authors see this as a positive move to enhance learning for adolescents. This qualitative study sought to answer: How do secondary preservice and in-service teachers respond to interdisciplinary instruction? Findings provide key insights into how interdisciplinary instruction, when implemented successfully within a content area literacy course, empowers preservice and in-service teachers, and brings about a more professional environment. That is, data shows designing interdisciplinary instruction provided the teachers space to take up an identity as teaching professional--acting as specialist, acting as agent, and acting as regulator. Based on the authors' analysis, the authors believe interdisciplinary instruction has the potential to elevate the professional status for teachers, and teacher educators can lead and guide secondary preservice and in-service teachers toward new understandings and paradigms surrounding interdisciplinary methods as we seek to evolve and improve secondary-level curriculum.

AB  - In this article, we present details of a one-week interdisciplinary science camp for high school students in Denmark, "Criminal Camp". We describe the use of forensic science and simulated crimes as a common foundation for teaching the theory and practice of concepts in chemistry, physics, and medicine or biology. The main goal of the science camp program was to introduce the participants to the nature of science and what scientists do as the students experience easily understandable real-world scenarios. Results from a survey indicate that Criminal Camp had a positive effect on the participants' attitudes toward science in general and the applications within forensic science in particular. From the free-response answers given in the survey, it was furthermore inferred that the participants enjoyed working with science in an interdisciplinary context, and that they gained both concrete knowledge of the subjects taught and scientific literacy in general.

AB  - Cross-disciplinary collaboration is being promoted in academic and professional circles as an important strategy for developing new avenues of scholarly inquiry and for generating knowledge that is immediately applicable to the resolution of real-world problems. This move toward cross-disciplinary work has translated into calls for enhanced interdisciplinarity in doctoral education, although there are several barriers to the successful implementation of cross-disciplinary work, especially during PhD studies. This article presents a personal narrative analysis of the authors' experiences in a doctoral-level transdisciplinary learning environment to illustrate the antecedents of successful cross-disciplinary engagement and the supports required to sustain this type of work.

AB  - Background: Physical Education (PE) programmes are expanding to include alternative activities yet what is missing is a conceptual model that facilitates how the learning process may be understood and assessed beyond the dominant sport-technique paradigm. Purpose: The purpose of this article was to feature the emergence of a Function-to-Flow (F2F) interdisciplinary curriculum support tool which facilitates the assessment of an alternative activity beyond baseline levels of participation. Participants and setting: Participants of this study include a sample of N = 153 students from grades one, five, seven, eight, and nine located within seven different schools in Ottawa (Canada), who booked the JungleSport™ climbing programme of their own accord. Within each school, a particular class was selected under the guidance of the school principal and in consultation with the Health and PE teacher. The Head Instructor of the JungleSport™ programme also participated in the study. During the second year of this study, three classes from three different intermediate schools, including two grade 7 classes (n = 19 and n = 26) and a grade 8 class (n = 23), piloted curriculum support tools that are featured in this article. Data collection: The main source of information upon which this article is based is the small group interviews with student participants that were conducted at the conclusion of the three- to five-day JungleSport™ programme. Secondary sources of information include journal entries from prepared booklets, student, teacher, and head instructor interviews, as well as observed interdisciplinary activities. Data analysis: The main question that guided this three-year study was: "What is it like to become physically educated in a way that invites an expanded movement consciousness, from the rudiments of movement function to the somatics of flow?" To explore this question, several student-friendly sub-questions were developed. Responses to these questions were compiled into a summative chart, the interdisciplinary F2F curriculum support tool, which depicts how a student may climb at different levels of proficiency. Findings: Assessing movement in relation to the "F2F model" has the potential to facilitate an appreciation and understanding of the many ways a student may become physically educated. This article features how students were able to articulate understandings of muscular "function", desired "form", kinaesthetic "feeling", as well as existential possibilities for experiencing "flow". It is postulated that a similar curriculum support tool could be designed for other activities, however alternative, as well as mainstream sport. Simply analysing movement experiences in terms of muscular "function", "form", "feeling", and "flow" as exemplified in this study has the potential to broaden narrowed conceptions of learning in the PE context. Thus the "physical education-as-sport- technique" paradigm which largely attends to isolated form has the potential to become the "function-form-feeling-flow" paradigm. Thus, in closely observing students climbing, as described in the first year of this project and co-reflecting on the percepts and concepts that emerge in relation to the F2F-inspired curriculum support tool as featured in this article, assessment and interdisciplinary understanding in PE has the potential to reach new heights.

AB  - Purpose: Delivery of sustainability-related curriculum to undergraduate students can be problematic due to the traditional "siloing" of curriculum by faculties along disciplinary lines. In addition, while there is often a ready availability of courses focused on sustainability issues in the later years of students' programs, few early entry-level courses focused on sustainability, broad enough to apply to all disciplines, are available to students in the first year of their program. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, we describe the development, and preliminary implementation, of an entry-level, interdisciplinary sustainability course. To do so, the authors describe the development of a university-wide initiative designed to bridge units on campus working and teaching in sustainability areas, and to promote and support sustainability curriculum development. Findings: The authors describe the conceptual framework for organising course content and delivery. The authors conclude with an informal assessment of the successes and challenges, and offer learning activities, student assessments and course administration recommendations for consideration when developing courses with similar learning goals. Originality/value: The positive and negative experiences gained through developing and offering a course of this nature, in a large research-focused university, offers knew insights into potential barriers for implementing first-year cross-cutting sustainability curriculum.

AB  - The primary objective of this study was to determine how experience in learning to teach scientific inquiry using a practical approach affected teacher's attitudes, evaluations of use of inquiry and their actual design of inquiry based instruction. The methodology included the use an approach incorporating inquiry methodology combined with a technology-infused and engineering rich approach called "Intelligent Robotics" to help teachers learn and use a new approach to teaching scientific inquiry. The findings showed that these teachers progressively moved from more teacher-centered thinking about teaching to student-centered thinking and actions incorporating scientific inquiry. They also worked together in designing an interdisciplinary inquiry curriculum, providing an effective alternative to traditional rigid standards based curriculum and teacher directed instruction.

AB  - It has become increasingly apparent that no single method for teaching anatomy is able to provide supremacy over another. In an effort to consolidate and enhance learning, a modernized anatomy curriculum was devised by attempting to take advantage of and maximize the benefits from different teaching methods. Both the more traditional approaches to anatomy teaching, as well as modern, innovative educational programs were embraced in a multimodal system implemented over a decade. In this effort, traditional teaching with lectures and dissection was supplemented with models, imaging, computer-assisted learning, problem-based learning through clinical cases, surface anatomy, clinical correlation lectures, peer teaching and team-based learning. Here, we review current thinking in medical education and present our transition from a passive, didactic, highly detailed anatomy course of the past, to a more interactive, as well as functionally and clinically relevant anatomy curriculum over the course of a decade.

AB  - Learning Management Systems are instructional platforms that offer opportunities to address the development of core competencies across disciplines. The emergence of instructional models which place greater emphasis on core skill development in science education help to build interdisciplinary communities through curricular connectivity and complementary contextual learning applications. Herein we report on an interconnected core concept and skills approach combining the blended structured use of the Learning Management System (LMS) with a core curricular context for biology and chemistry content. This hybrid was applied to the entry chemistry course for science majors. The threefold interconnected biology-chemistry core concept umbrella areas are Chemical Identity/Matter Classification, the Mole Concept, and Energy. A web-facilitated pedagogy was utilized for the complementary entry-level biological science course. The results provide preliminary evidence of the potential of this instructional approach as a means to both build interdisciplinary community in STEM education and innovate instruction for improved learning outcomes.

AB  - This perspective piece addresses specifically future lines of inquiry and practice that advance the goals of the agenda through an interdisciplinary approach to leadership studies. Here, the authors explain in-depth the contexts of an interdisciplinary approach to the agenda and address specific challenges therein. In order to provide clarity to this approach, considerations are made with respect to the language, contextual reference points, and tensions regarding measurement of learning. The authors provide impetus for inclusion of particular, salient priorities from the agenda, and address opportunities for practice and future research. Suggestions reveal unique opportunities within an interdisciplinary perspective such as the integration of diverse content and perspectives as well as collaboration across disciplines.

AB  - We piloted a semester-long, interdisciplinary, introductory science course using recently developed optogenetic technique as a main context. In neuroscience application, this technique introduces the gene of light-sensitive membrane protein into a targeted class of neurons, whose activity then can be modulated with a laser of specific wavelength. Such genetically modified and optically controllable neurons can be used to study the details of neural circuitries. This thoroughly interdisciplinary experimental technique provides an engaging modern context for studying and connecting various fundamental concepts and topics, such as genetics, biochemistry, laser, and nerve signaling. Students have learned how challenging scientific questions can be answered through the cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques from multiple disciplines, improving their scientific literacy broadly.

The article reports on part of an eighteen months action research study in an Australian public high school within the author's two Year 8 Mathematics classes. The article provides student samples from within these classes as it contributes evidence and analyses that may help to inform teachers from across subject areas to recognise and implement literacy practices, not as an isolated classroom activity, but across their disciplines. By taking a more "social" approach to designing projects for Middle-Years Mathematics, this study supports concepts of literacy as a social, cognitive and cultural practice.

AB  - This paper focuses on three main subjects: (1) monitoring quality of life (QoL) in old age; (2) international and interdisciplinary collaboration for QoL research; and (3) computer-based technology and infrastructure assisting (1) and (2). This type of computer-supported cooperative work in the social sciences has been termed eHumanities or eSocial Science. Although QoL issues matter for all ages, given the size of population aging and the demographic outlook of developed countries, QoL in old age is one of the most pressing issues to study (Walker and Mollenkopf in Quality of life in old age: international and multi-disciplinary perspectives, Springer, The Netherlands, 2007). Despite the recognized need for good measurement methods in QoL (e.g., Stiglitz et al. in The measurement of economic performance and social progress revisited. progress revisited. OFCE working documents, Observatoire Francais des Conjonctures Economiques (OFCE), Paris, 2009), effective mechanisms allowing cross-country comparisons are still rare. In the context of QoL or human well-being research and measurement, one of the most influential concepts is the capability approach (CA). Yet, the operationalization of the CA has long been one of the serious challenges faced by capabilities and quality of life researchers. As regards to this issue, we argue that modern technology has the potential to provide ample tools for enhancing the measurement of human well-being, and facilitating large-scale collaborative research on the QoL. This paper demonstrates a methodology, procedures, and tools that we have developed, based on the new technologies designed and developed for both governmental and intergovernmental (OECD) sponsored assessments and that are ready to be used for QoL analysis. We propose a viable alternative for facilitating international and interdisciplinary research collaboration to develop a methodology and a dashboard of indicators to monitor the progress of human well-being over the years and to formalize its multidimensional measure for international comparisons

AB  - Nanotoxicity is an area of intense research, stimulated by increased use of nanoparticles in commercially available products. Herein, using nanotoxicity as a platform, we describe an experiment that emphasizes interdisciplinary science in a collaborative work setting while expanding the traditional realm of chemistry and chemistry research. Students synthesize two noble metal nanoparticle suspensions (Au and Ag) and expose brine shrimp to these nanoparticles, assessing the brine shrimp viability after 24 h exposure. By examining two different nanoparticles at several concentrations, with appropriate control conditions, students can work together to collect and analyze all the toxicity results necessary to draw conclusions about the toxicity of Au and Ag nanoparticles. This experiment provides introductory chemistry students hands-on experience with a cutting-edge area of science while showcasing the real-world application of chemistry to an important modern scientific problem, nanoparticle toxicity.

AB  - The national conversation around undergraduate science instruction is calling for increased interdisciplinarity. As these calls increase, there is a need to consider the learning objectives of interdisciplinary science courses and how to design curricula to support those objectives. We present a framework that can help support interdisciplinary design research. We developed this framework in an introductory physics for life sciences majors (IPLS) course for which we designed a series of interdisciplinary tasks that bridge physics and biology. We illustrate how this framework can be used to describe the variation in the nature and degree of interdisciplinary interaction in tasks, to aid in redesigning tasks to better align with interdisciplinary learning objectives, and finally, to articulate design conjectures that posit how different characteristics of these tasks might support or impede interdisciplinary learning objectives. This framework will be useful for both curriculum designers and education researchers seeking to understand, in more concrete terms, what interdisciplinary learning means and how integrated science curricula can be designed to support interdisciplinary learning objectives.

AB  - This study examines the inputs (processes and strategies) and outputs (perceptions, skill development, classroom transfer, disciplinary integration, social networking, and community development) of a yearlong, interdisciplinary teacher learning and development experience. Eleven secondary math and science teachers partnered with an interdisciplinary team of university engineering mentors in a yearlong engineering education and project implementation program. It consisted of a 6-week on-site resident professional development and collaboration experience, with an ongoing support and follow-up including digital systems. Mixed-method, multisource data indicate that teachers engaged with motivations combining personal, intrinsic interest and classroom integration goals. They formed and sustained an active community of learning and practice that supported their success, on-site and through classroom integration, thereby promoting innovations. Teachers reported positive perceptions throughout the program and demonstrated significant, productive trajectories of change-over-time. Teachers learned and transferred task-specific engineering and scientific skills, as well as more general inquiry-based pedagogical strategies to their secondary classrooms.

AB  - Evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-devo) is a vibrant area of contemporary life science that should be (and is) increasingly incorporated into teaching curricula. Although the inclusion of this content is important for biological pedagogy at multiple levels of instruction, there are also philosophical lessons that can be drawn from the scientific practices found in Evo-devo. One feature of particular significance is the interdisciplinary nature of Evo-devo investigations and their resulting explanations. Instead of a single disciplinary approach being the most explanatory or fundamental, different methodologies from biological disciplines must be synthesized to generate empirically adequate explanations. Thus, Evo-devo points toward a non-reductionist epistemology in biology. I review three areas where these synthetic efforts become manifest as a result of Evo-devo's practices (form versus function reasoning styles; problem-structured investigations; idealizations related to studying model organisms), and then sketch some possible applications to teaching biology. These philosophical considerations provide resources for life science educators to address (and challenge) key aspects of the "National Science Education Standards" and "Benchmarks for Scientific Literacy."

AB  - Modeling inter-disciplinary teaching and learning practices within a critical pedagogical framework has produced powerful learning outcomes for graduates of the Primary/Middle Bachelor of Education degree at the University of South Australia. This paper explores the notion of how best to prepare beginning teachers to work with students in their middle years of schooling in Studies of Society and Environment. Of particular focus are teacher education courses that model interdisciplinary ways of working. The inquiry found that interdisciplinary course work was replicated and built upon by beginning teachers and where schools encouraged the notion of interdisciplinarity beginning teachers flourished as designers of curriculum. The authors argue that Studies of Society and Environment is currently well placed to be incorporated into interdisciplinary curriculum frameworks and assist in meeting the goals of middle schooling philosophy.

AB  - Last year, the author and his students received word that their beloved professor of queer and American ethnic studies was going on terminal leave. He and his students were suddenly thrown into the position of making the case for queer studies to the broader campus community. In this article, the author shares how their professor's departure--and of the need to engage in campus-wide dialogue about the importance and legitimacy of interdisciplinarity and local studies--testified to the stark reality that these fields continue to struggle for a place in academy. He also discusses that interdisciplinary and intersectional scholarship has to do with challenging foundational norms of sexuality and gender, as well as of race, class, and liberal political economy.

AB  - In the 1960s and 1970s, activists who focused on the academy as a key site for fostering social change began by querying the assumptions of the traditional disciplines and transforming their curricula, putting into place women's and ethnic studies programs that changed both the subject and methods of scholarship. The pattern of scholars and activists joining forces to open fields of research and teaching continued in subsequent decades, and recent additions, including critical race studies, queer studies, cultural studies, and postcolonial studies, take as their epistemological foundation the inherently political nature of all knowledge production. "Interdisciplinarity and Social Justice" seizes this opportune moment in the history of interdisciplinary fields to review their effects on our intellectual and political landscape, to evaluate their ability to deliver promised social benefits, and to consider their futures. The essays collected in this volume examine how effectively interdisciplinary fields have achieved their goals of intellectual and social change, and consider the challenges they now face inside and outside the academy. This book includes (1) Interdisciplinarity and Social Justice: An Introduction (Joe Parker and Ranu Samantrai) and contains three parts. Part I, Critiques of Disciplinarity, contains the following: (2) Metaphors of Globalization (Lisa Lowe); (3) Crossing the Immigration and Race Border: A Critical Race Theory Approach to Immigration Studies (Mary Romero); (4) Whiteness in a Red Room: Telling Stories and Legal Discourse in the Tribal Courtroom (Raquel Montoya-Lewis); and (5) An Emergent Extra-Disciplinarity: Worlding Arabs, Activist Representation, and the Example of Ahdaf Soueif (Mrinalini Chakravorty). Part II, Critiques of Interdisciplinary Fields, includes the following: (6) Cultural Studies: Justice, Values, and Social Class (Patrick Brantlinger); (7) The Other Inters: Augmenting Academic Disciplinarity to Make Things (Happen) (Alexandra Juhasz); (8) The Ethico-politics of Dedisciplinary Practices (Joe Parker); and (9) The Limits of Interdisciplinarity: The Case of Chicano Studies (Michael Soldatenko). Part III, Interdisciplinary Claims to Social Justice, contains the following: (10) Whiteness Studies and the Paradox of Particularity (Robyn Wiegman); (11) Interdisciplinarity: A Consideration from African American Studies (Lindon Barrett); (12) Imagined Immunities: Border Rhetorics and the Ethos of Sans Frontierisme (D. Robert DeChaine); (13) Toward Collaborative Coalitions: From Internationalism to Interdisciplinarity (Leila Neti); (14) Interdisciplinary Investigations and Cross-Sector Interventions (Ellen Messer-Davidow); and (15) Accounting for Interdisciplinarity (Miranda Joseph). An afterword, "Justice Without Truth?", by Ranu Samantrai and an index are included.

AB  - This article reports on an interdisciplinary collaboration in the context of service-learning. Faculty members from the disciplines of family studies, anthropology, and media production worked collaboratively to develop and implement service-learning projects involving their classes and Sharp-Leadenhall, one of the oldest historically African-American communities in Baltimore City, Maryland. The authors argue that collaborative, interdisciplinary service-learning can respond to complex, real-world problems more fully than can be achieved through single-course, single-discipline service-learning. Additionally, this approach to service-learning provides faculty an opportunity to model interdisciplinary inquiry for students.

AB  - A critical review of research to date suggests a need to explore the development of graduate student research capacity from the standpoint of graduate students. Six members of an interdisciplinary graduate student colloquium at the Centre for Youth and Society (Victoria, Canada) offer their perspective. Our research involved four phases, each illustrating the processes that refined our understanding of the components that contributed to the development of our graduate student research capacity. First, we engaged in several round-table discussions and created a conceptual map depicting components that were meaningful in developing our research capacity. Second, we examined previous work on graduate student research capacity development and compared this data to the conceptual map. Third, we conducted a thematic analysis of secondary data of graduated students with similar interdisciplinary training and involvement in the Centre. Finally, the data analysis was used to refine the conceptual map that may benefit educators and future graduate students. From the standpoint of students themselves, we discuss those components perceived as best contributing to the development of graduate student research capacity and highlight the importance of an interdisciplinary context and writing process.

AB  - This article is concerned with the place and status of outdoor learning within formal schooling. In light of recent British outdoor educational trends, it considers the general educational significance of outdoor learning in the context of the recent Scottish "Curriculum for Excellence". The article begins with an overview of some key educational concerns, and--drawing on the philosophies of Aristotle and Dewey--some discussion of the educational significance of interdisciplinary teaching and learning. The empirical component of the article focuses on visits to schools and outdoor education centres to explore teachers' understandings of, beliefs about and values concerning outdoor learning. The article relates these views to the philosophies of Aristotle and Dewey and to outdoor learning understood as an essentially interdisciplinary moral enterprise. It concludes by exploring some possible practical and curricular implications of teachers' views in light of the "Curriculum for Excellence".

AB  - This article explores the role of the Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC) in facilitating and encouraging a collaborative community of junior and senior scholars on issues of technology and humanistic learning. As a result of its emphasis on collaboration and discussion, HASTAC encourages a form of collective intelligence that can serve as a model for future iterations of online communities formed to address problems and highlight advances in teaching and technology. Written from the perspective of a graduate student who also is a HASTAC scholar, the article discusses the positive impact HASTAC can have in terms of opportunities for professional advancement for junior scholars, as well as encouraging collaboration across disciplinary boundaries on issues relating to teaching methodologies, the humanities, and technology.

AB  - It is now widely acknowledged that water management discipline is transforming, from being a public health and flood prevention challenge of the nineteenth century to a multi-dimensional challenge of water security for the twenty-first century. In order to train water engineers to be capable of working with this holistic multi-dimensional approach, a new paradigm in engineering education is required. Adjustments already made to undergraduate coursework are not enough; this new paradigm requires modifications to the PhD in engineering, with greater emphasis on interdisciplinary case study research. Such a change can deliver PhD graduates with both sufficient social and technical knowledge, who can then go on to become the hybrid lecturers crucially needed for training future water engineers.

AB  - The field of nanotechnology has outgrown the discovery phase into the application and even commercial production phases. Consequently, the need for a workforce capable of supporting this growth is more than ever. However, because of the different challenges associated with nanotechnology education, specific courses are required to be developed and implemented in engineering schools to help produce this much needed workforce. This article describes the details of developing and implementing a course entitled Fundamentals of Nanotechnology as part of an umbrella plan for nanotechnology education and awareness at multiple levels. The course is designed to overcome most of the challenges facing nanotechnology education. As an example, one of the major challenges related to teaching this topic is the lack of equipment and facility, due to high cost, among other factors. Computer based activities are proposed and implemented to overcome this challenge. The course aims at providing a multidisciplinary pool of science and engineering students with the elements needed to continue and expand into the nanotechnology field, regardless of their discipline or focus. This course was developed and first implemented during the spring semester of 2010. Results from this offering were assessed to help close the quality loop and improve the next offering, the sequel project-based course, as well as the umbrella plan.

AB  - This qualitative multisite case study examined how three high schools within one large urban district supported ninth-grade students' needs through interdisciplinary teaming. Data collected during the 2006-2007 school year included observations, interviews, and archival evidence of 67 participants. Findings suggest teacher communication as a result of teaming may provide the teacher support and individualized student attention necessary to foster a family-like ninth-grade environment that meets student and teacher needs. School personnel reported more benefits of teaming for teachers and students than students did. Issues with implementation limited how well teaming was able to meet student needs.

AB  - Technology design in the field of human-computer interaction has developed a continuum of participatory research methods, closely mirroring methodological approaches and epistemological discussions in other fields. This paper positions such approaches as examples of inclusive research (to varying degrees) within education, and illustrates the complexity of navigating and involving different user groups in the context of multi-disciplinary research projects. We illustrate this complexity with examples from our recent work, involving children on the autism spectrum and their teachers. Both groups were involved in learner-centred design processes to develop technologies to support social conversation and collaboration. We conceptualize this complexity as a triple-decker "sandwich" representing Theory, Technologies and Thoughts and argue that all three layers need to be appropriately aligned for a good quality "product" or outcome. However, the challenge lies in navigating and negotiating all three layers at the same time, including the views and experiences of the learners. We question the extent to which it may be possible to combine co-operative, empowering approaches to participatory design with an outcome-focused agenda that seeks to develop a robust learning technology for use in real classrooms.

AB  - As the value of multi-disciplinary working in the business and research worlds is becoming more recognised, the number of inter-disciplinary postgraduate environmental and health sciences courses is also increasing. Equally, the popularity of problem-based learning (PBL) is expected to grow and influence instructional approaches in many disciplines. However, very limited research has been conducted to explore the perception of students of PBL in inter- or multi-disciplinary environments; particularly wide-ranging multi-disciplinary courses which cross the natural-social science barrier. The findings from this case study evidence the difficulties and benefits students derive from group PBL, many of which stem from working in multi-disciplinary and multi-skilled groups on a part-time basis. Acknowledging, accepting and overcoming conflicts based upon prior experience that influences epistemological and ontological beliefs may be key to the development of effective PBL in inter-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary programmes. Recommendations for good pedagogic practice to maximise learning in postgraduate environmental and science education are made.

AB  - The advanced interdisciplinary research laboratory (AIRLab) represents a novel, effective, and motivational course designed from the interdisciplinary research interests of chemistry, physics, biology, and education development faculty members as an alternative to the independent thesis project experience. Student teams are assembled to work toward the completion of an interdisciplinary research project. Each team is composed of at least one student from a differing area of specialization (e.g., biology, biotechnology, chemistry, and physics), and projects are based on current trends in research. The inaugural project was the development of a portable DNA sequencer for in-field species identification; a project at the interface between physical and life sciences and that holds the potential for real-world application and positive social change. This work describes the details underlying the design and implementation of the AIRLab course, and includes an account of the method of student team assembly, the selection of a suitable research challenge, the specialized training provided in Agile project management, the methods used to achieve cohesive team dynamics, the learning outcomes from this experience, future directions that will be pursued for course improvement, and how our undergraduate degree-level expectations were met at an advanced level.

AB  - This article describes factors that influence the success of collaborations involving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and Education faculty at research-focused universities who work toward postsecondary STEM education improvement. We provide insight into how interdisciplinary faculty may successfully collaborate given their different disciplinary backgrounds. We explore the importance of education research brokers, individuals credited with helping STEM faculty understand, respond to, and recognize the importance of education research and theory. In addition, we discuss the advantages of appointments of brokers within STEM versus Education Departments. We identify key characteristics that help build and sustain interdisciplinary collaboration and establish the critical roles of brokers at institutions that strive to improve education.

AB  - This study examines if interdisciplinary teaching can be said to facilitate the learning and use of fractions by Swedish 12-year-old pupils. Home and Consumer Studies is well suited to interdisciplinary teaching, and young people can therefore find it interesting to study maths since the setting is relevant to them. Building on variation theory and a learning study, we examined pupils' (n=18) ability to double fractions greater than ½ when using a recipe. The general results show that what is to be learned benefits if it is presented in different ways, that teachers should not take pupils' knowledge for granted, and mathematically that it is not necessary to divide something to be able to double it. We argue that the study shows that genuine problems based on pupils' interest and life world can enhance motivation and, in turn, learning.

AB  - A Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) summer Bridge Program was developed for high school students. The program was designed to encourage students to consider choosing an engineering major in college and to explore STEM as a future career. This was accomplished through a 10-week program involving multidisciplinary research activities. The participants in the program included 33 high school students. Among former participants in position to make a choice in terms of attending college, 100% had chosen to continue on in college, and 86% had chosen to major in a STEM area. The results indicated that that the program had enhanced their confidence in STEM and motivated them in choosing careers in STEM areas. Overall, the participants were very positive about the program and expressed appreciation for the opportunity. (Contains 3 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - The broad utility of the concept of transition in many disciplines provides career educators and career advisory personnel with expanded opportunities to explore fresh solutions to problems they meet in the course of their work. Further practical solutions become available by continuing to seek applications of the concept. Career transition focuses on contingencies and particular events in individual or organisational circumstances but career change also invokes the generic idea of transition. This article inspects two widely used career transition models: those of Bridges and Schlossberg. It then positions these models by identifying wide cross-disciplinary use of the transition concept, including in social science. Drawing on this richness the idea of transition may be simply used as the context of career discussion or, as suggested here, it may be more consciously and actively mined to respond to career development opportunities.

AB  - This article provides an overview of the activities included in a 3-year, multidisciplinary, intergenerational service-learning project conducted as part of a Foundation for Long-Term Care Service Learning: Linking Three Generations grant. Courses from four departments (gerontology, psychology, occupational therapy, and health promotion and physical education) and one interdisciplinary clinical intervention for stroke patients (speech pathology, occupational therapy, and therapeutic recreation) were involved. Service-learning activities were embedded in course curriculums and varied from semester-long activities in group settings to activities involving one-on-one contact for several hours. In total, eight faculty and 225 students worked with 148 elders and 12 different community organizations to plan and implement activities for 357 older adults. Students and elders reported a high degree of satisfaction with the intergenerational activities and indicated that they learned from them and found them of value personally. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - This paper examines the possibilities and challenges presented by an interdisciplinary approach to the study of disruptive behaviour. It is argued that whilst such an approach is to be welcomed, work needs to be done in order to ensure that educational research joins the discussion as an equal partner. The paper begins with a demonstration of how big the gap is between different approaches through a consideration of studies in educational sociology that take a "soft" qualitative approach to research, and in neuropsychology, a "hard science". The degree of divergence between these two approaches is then highlighted through a discussion of the "medicalisation" of disruptive behaviour. The suggestion that educational research may be treated as a "poor relation", with a focus on the underlying epistemological issues, is then examined.

AB  - Objective: Addressing sexual health concerns in medical practice has been an emerging concept for the past two decades. However, there have been very few educational opportunities in medical training that would prepare future physicians for such a responsibility. Since assessing and treating sexual problems requires knowledge that encompasses many disciplines and requires skills typically not within the purview of medical training, the authors propose a multidisciplinary model that includes collaboration with sex therapists. Methods: The authors review the extant literature on sexual health education in medical training. Results: The authors describe an existing and evolving model at the University of Michigan which is based on several collaborative initiatives between the medical school, the psychiatry residency program, and several medical departments. Conclusion: The authors propose a collaborative training model that would facilitate future physicians' comfort with the subject and the acquisition of skills necessary to provide optimal care for patients who present with sexual health concerns.

AB  - This article is intended to identify research opportunities for gender scholars in all disciplines. The authors explain why a truly interdisciplinary approach is necessary to study gender and offer their current thinking about how to pursue this goal. They first provide a description of gender as it plays out at the individual, interpersonal, and societal levels. They then give examples, drawing from wage disparities and from rates of sexual maturation, to illustrate the value of treating gender as comprised of inherently linked processes operating at multiple levels of analysis. They argue that gender inherently is a multi-level phenomenon, but that social psychologists from both disciplines tend to limit themselves to certain levels of this analysis in their theoretical and empirical investigations. Finally, they provide some initial thoughts on how to study the interconnectivity across individual, interpersonal, and societal processes.

AB  - Many postgraduate interdisciplinary research (IDR) candidates in the applied disciplines work across two or more traditional areas of study. Such candidates often spend considerable time on knowledge-building activities outside their home (or undergraduate) disciplines; IDR candidates venture into new fields and are exposed to the cultures and values of different disciplines. In this study, IDR candidates, from different applied disciplines, were selected as case studies. The study was delimited to a range of interdisciplinary permutations across the "hard" and "soft" applied disciplines (e.g., engineering management, health informatics). The focus of this article is postgraduate students' experiences in doing an IDR study for a Master's thesis. In the article we explore the challenges faced by candidates, with a view to minimising these, given the contribution that IDR can make to a developing society. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Research-intensive universities enjoy--or suffer--a paradoxical reputation: They are thought to be dedicated to both cutting-edge research and to the preservation of the canon. They are seen as broad and diverse communities of scholars with a vibrant collective intellectual life, yet also as silos of disciplinary entrenchment. Most significantly, they are thought of as places where the complex problems of the society are studied intensely but from which solutions are rarely forthcoming. And those contradictions do indeed exist inside most research universities. They typically have formal infrastructures to promote collaboration and innovation, as well as external sources of research funding to encourage interdisciplinary efforts that have the potential for major breakthroughs. However, the incentive structures that are in place for individual faculty members are firmly grounded in the assessment of their reputations within and their impact on established fields of study, as reflected chiefly through publication in disciplinary journals. There is no consensus regarding the most fair or effective means of evaluating faculty work that does not fall within a traditional scholarly paradigm. Interdisciplinary scholarship also is hard to do. The boundaries of a problem and the appropriate tools for investigating it are undetermined. Collaborators from different disciplines may lack a common conceptual framework or a common vocabulary for grappling with a problem of shared interest. Indeed, the larger and more diverse an interdisciplinary group is, the less likely they are to come together or endure as a cohesive and productive entity. Even if these gaps are bridged, a successful outcome to an intrinsically challenging, real-life problem is far from certain. In light of the number and diversity of factors that hinder successful interdisciplinary collaboration, it is remarkable when they succeed. But the UVA Bay Game--an ongoing collaboration at the University of Virginia among faculty members from nine schools--has bucked the odds. In this article, the authors examine the history and evolution of this project as an emerging success story to highlight the components that have been instrumental to its durability and productivity, in the hope that it can provide a model for similar efforts elsewhere.

AB  - Neuroaesthetics is a burgeoning new interdisciplinary research space in which cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy intersect in order to better inform our understanding of aesthetic experience. The purpose of this study is to analyze high-profile work in neuroaesthetics in the light of recent research into interdisciplinary epistemology, asking "Do current attempts to use neuroscience to explore art meet rigorous interdisciplinary quality criteria?" I suggest that current approaches in neuroaesthetics frequently fail in a number of ways: they fail to meet disciplinary standards in either aesthetics or neuroscience, they fail to blend disciplines in a generative way, and they add little new that could not be investigated more fruitfully at other levels of analysis. In response to these potential pitfalls, I recommend that future researchers embrace a form of "problem-focused epistemological pluralism" in their neuroaesthetic endeavors. I end with a consideration of the educational implications of these issues. (Contains 3 notes.)

AB  - In response to a growing movement within higher education to provide interdisciplinary educational programs, this study describes the creation of an interdisciplinary graduate certificate program in healthcare policy and management. Building on prior research, we surveyed healthcare executives to examine their perceptions about the need for such a program and the importance of core subject areas. Drawing on our findings as well as the literature on "interactional expertise" and "wicked problems," we provide a detailed method for launching an interdisciplinary program. Our process may be useful in guiding other institutions interested in setting up new interdisciplinary programs of their own.

AB  - The concept of vacuum forming has been around since the 19th century, despite not being fully utilized in industry until the 1950s. In the past, industrial arts classes have used vacuum-forming projects to concentrate solely on the manufacturing process and the final product. However, vacuum forming is not just an old industrial arts activity; it can be used to teach various aspects of design and technology, promote interdisciplinary learning, and create a buzz about the programs involved. This article describes an activity that shows how to keep projects that students love and adapt them to use in the design process, meet the "Standards for Technological Literacy: Content for the Study of Technology" (STL) (ITEA/ITEEA, 2000/2002/2007) content standards, teach STL benchmark topics, and involve other content areas in the classroom.

AB  - STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education in the United States faces a host of problems including low recruitment and retention in STEM disciplines, under-representation of multiple segments of the US population, and a host of other issues. These problems are well recognized and a variety of solutions are being implemented by interested parties at multiple points along the STEM education pipeline. Incorporating research into STEM classes is an effective way of enhancing student success in STEM education at the undergraduate level. This paper describes the development and implementation of a research-based laboratory module for community college General Biology I lab students that addresses potential relationships between water pollution and cancer while simultaneously implementing established High Impact Practices. This work is part of a larger effort to recruit and retain the next generation of Earth and Environmental Systems engineering students at the undergraduate level. Our inherently interdisciplinary model, which integrates multiple pedagogical elements, can be adapted for implementation in a wide variety of undergraduate STEM courses. This laboratory module allows students to benefit from authentic research, while gaining skills in gathering scientific data, making connections with global and personal issues, and illustrating relevant discipline concepts.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity is widely practised and theorised. However, relatively few studies have reflected on university-wide attempts to foster the concept. This article examines interdisciplinary teaching and learning at Griffith University, Australia. It reflects on the foundations of interdisciplinarity at the university and situates them within the broader context of innovations in worldwide practice; it draws from the literature on interdisciplinarity to traverse the broad understandings of the term; it discusses the Griffith University innovations implemented in support of the concept; and, it reports on the likely outcomes of current methods designed to improve interdisciplinary practice. Whilst challenging barriers to interdisciplinarity continue to exist, compounded by varied conceptions of what interdisciplinarity entails, positive learning and research outcomes have been accomplished at the university from its interdisciplinary foundations, which also provide a platform to go forward.

AB  - The objective of this study is to assess the effects of the unique 1-year health-wellness program of exercise and health education for obese youth on body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure. The CEMHaVi program included 74 obese children. Participants, 19 girls and 18 boys, and controls, 17 girls and 20 boys, were assigned to treatment. The treatment participants were compared with a group who chose not to participate. Treatment consisted of a unique program of physical activity that emphasized playing games. Activity sessions were offered once per week, 2 h each session, for 12 months. Physical activity was complemented with health education. Controls received only the normal care of a physician in pediatrics. Physical and physiological measures were assessed before and after intervention. Findings of the study showed a significant difference in BMI between treatment and control participants (P less than 0.05). BMI decreased in the treatment group and increased in controls. There were no significant differences in blood pressure. In conclusion, results of the study suggest that a unique program of exercise and health education had beneficial effects on BMI in obese youth after 1 year. The feasibility of a beneficial lifestyle intervention program is encouraging.

AB  - Purpose: This article assesses a participatory action and innovation research experience, in which project researchers, farmers and staff members of a local water users association (WUA) came together to: (a) jointly test and adapt a social mobilization and institutional strengthening approach according to the local context, and by doing so, to (b) develop a locally embedded approach to the institutional strengthening of WUAs in Uzbekistan. Design/methodology/approach: The process of interaction and innovation development was one of joint experimentation, which over time and to avoid a disproportionate dependency on external social mobilizers increasingly adopted aspects of a laissez-faire approach, eventually relying fully on members of the local community. Findings: The findings show that the cooperation style is highly influenced by institutional and structural causes and effects in the specific context of rural Uzbekistan. Participatory approaches to the institutional strengthening of WUAs in Uzbekistan should consequently allow for a high degree of flexibility to adjust key activities and their timeframe. Practical implications: The research findings are relevant to the lowland irrigated areas of post-Soviet Central Asia where the strengthening of WUAs is still lacking, resulting in limited participation of water users and insufficient operation and maintenance of the slowly eroding infrastructure. Originality/value: The transdisciplinary innovation and action research experience pays special attention to the change in the style of cooperation, its institutional and structural causes and effects with regard to the "localizing" of the innovation, namely a social mobilization and institutional development (SMID) approach for strengthening water users associations (WUAs) in Uzbekistan.

AB  - Schools are increasingly integrating multidisciplinary education into their programmes. The Minister of Education, Culture and Science has introduced a new, integrated science subject in secondary education in the Netherlands, called Nature, Life and Technology (NLT). This research note describes the design of a generic model for a professional development programme to prepare teachers with and assist them during the implementation of a multidisciplinary science module. Three sources were used for this design: subject features including school practices, the curriculum design phases, and professional development characteristics, in combination with three factors influencing the quality of the professional development: context, process and content. These sources and factors have been translated into a generic model. Three experts evaluated this generic model: a teacher trainer who was also involved in the development of NLT modules; a biology and NLT teacher who was also involved in a regional NLT information centre; and a chemistry and NLT teacher. Overall, the experts were positive. They judged 12 out of 13 aspects of the model as sufficient or better. They were, however, critical about the issue of whether the model offers sufficient possibilities for participants to familiarise themselves with new subject content knowledge.

AB  - Color terms are one of the constituents of Chomskey's substantive universals, and they exist in all languages. Colors usually bear cultural implications as well, since they are adopted to express intentions metaphorically. Colors may then become symbols that represent certain objects, emotions, facts, etc. of their environment. This culture-oriented facet of color terms can create complexity in language learning process and also in the practice of translation. As languages share some basic concepts, and express them through different expressions and symbols, the interest of this study was to answer the following question: are there any shared concepts between English and Persian that are represented (symbolized) by different colors? By collecting a number of expressions which held color terms, the complexity of this territory of intercultural communication was demonstrated along with its impacts on second/foreign language learning and translation practice. Slight differences at the linguistic surface level can occasionally cause difficulties especially when the deep structure is the same in both languages and cultures. More specifically and for the purpose of this study, when the same concept is represented through different colors, this is likely to cause difficulties. Failing to communicate via appropriate surface structures is probable to lead to cultural shocks in the listener (in case of language communication) or reader ( in case of translation), and impedance in the interlingual communication flow.

AB  - This article explicates the intragroup social dynamics and work of a nursing and education research team as a community of research practice interested in organizational cultures and occupational subcultures. Dynamics were characterized by processes of socialization through reeducation and group social identity formation that enabled members to cross discipline-bordered traditions and produce interdisciplinary mixed methods combinations. Combinations were achieved at the paradigm level through the generation of a shared viewing position and theoretical model. At methods and technique levels, such achievements were accomplished through methodological capitalization and prioritization and the development of a quantitative culture assessment tool that can be used in combination with complementary qualitative observation and interview protocols. Recommendations for other teams are provided.

AB  - We use an experimental course collaboration that occurred in the winter of 2012 as a case study for an approach to interdisciplinary collaboration between Theatre and Humanities courses, and we argue that the theatre methodology of "devising" can serve as a particularly rich locus for collaboration between Theatre students and other Humanities students because it allows students to cooperate in generating a creative product that draws on two different areas of expertise. In this case, English students operated as critically informed advisors for Theatre students who devised original performances using a canonical text as source material. This experimental collaboration produced many of the positive results that have been discussed in previous studies concerning interdisciplinary pedagogy, including thoughtful consideration of the nature of each discipline, transferring of tools and methodologies between disciplines, increased student enthusiasm, and faculty development. However, it did not require extensive resources or curricular restructuring and thus might operate as a useful model for instructors with reservations about or limited resources for attempting interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - This primarily online Master's degree program focused on advancing K-8 teachers' interdisciplinary mathematical and science content knowledge while integrating appropriate digital technologies as learning and teaching tools. The mixed-method, interpretive study examined in-service teachers' technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) within the context of interdisciplinary content knowledge, pedagogical strategies for teaching interdisciplinary topics, and technological knowledge when applied to teaching and learning interdisciplinary content. The results documented ways specific coursework in the graduate program impacted the teachers' overarching conceptions of teaching interdisciplinary topics, their knowledge of students' understanding and thinking, their instructional strategies, and their knowledge of curriculum and curriculum materials for learning in interdisciplinary contexts with the integration of appropriate technologies.

We will examine some of the mistakes we made, and misconceptions we had, in conducting the workshops and describe how we adapted in successive years to improve the curriculum materials developed during the workshops. In particular, we will discuss how we encouraged faculty to focus on clarifying student learning goals and developing effective assessment. (Contains 1 footnote.)

AB  - Helping students understand "chemical energy" is notoriously difficult. Many hold inconsistent ideas about what energy is, how and why it changes during the course of a chemical reaction, and how these changes are related to bond energies and reaction dynamics. There are (at least) three major sources for this problem: 1) the way biologists talk about chemical energy (which is also the way we talk about energy in everyday life); 2) the macroscopic approach to energy concepts that is common in physics and physical sciences; and 3) the failure of chemistry courses to explicitly link molecular with macroscopic energy ideas. From a constructivist perspective, it is unlikely that students can, without a coherent understanding of such a central concept, attain a robust and accurate understanding of new concepts. However, changes are on the horizon, guided by the increasing understanding that difficult concepts require coherent, well-designed learning progressions and the new National Research Council Framework for K-12 Science Education. We provide supporting evidence for our assertions and suggestions for an interdisciplinary learning progression designed to better approach the concept of bond energies, a first step in an understanding chemical energy and behavior of reaction systems that is central to biological systems.

AB  - Here we present a multidisciplinary educational unit intended for general, advanced placement, or international baccalaureate-level high school science, focused on the three-dimensional structure of proteins and their connection to function and disease. The lessons are designed within the framework of the Next Generation Science Standards to make learning more relevant to daily life, and to help high school students engage in and understand advanced topics beyond the typical high school chemistry or biology curriculum. The unit involves lectures, videos, a hands-on activity, a research paper, a laboratory experiment, and a culminating project. Students are introduced to protein crystallography, the protein data bank, and the computer program PyMOL (free download for educational use) to visualize protein structure in three dimensions. Clear improvements in student comprehension of protein structure and function have been documented after implementation of the unit.

AB  - This paper describes 2 "strategic partnering" and "interdisciplinary collaboration" case studies between a Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) and an academic unit at a mid-sized metropolitan research university in the American Midwest. These faculty development partnerships were developed to meet the unique needs of faculty members who share a discipline area, present current information on specific teaching topics in order to deepen pedagogical knowledge and skills, provide opportunities for faculty to form a collegial group, and advance unit-specific goals relative to faculty development. The work is grounded in literature about the characteristics of a supportive teaching culture, characteristics of effective interdisciplinary collaborations, challenges of preparing faculty to conduct scholarly teaching, and in literature about the role of faculty development in advancing institutional change.

AB  - Increased attention to the need for constructively aligned teaching and learning in interdisciplinary higher education in engineering is observed. By contrast, little research has been conducted on the implementation of the outcome-based pedagogical approach to interdisciplinary higher education in engineering. Therefore, the present design-based research was undertaken to develop, implement, and evaluate a constructively aligned learning environment in the interdisciplinary field of food quality management. The practical aims were to reduce the perception held by the students of choppiness and to prevent them floundering in the disciplines; the theoretical aim was to accumulate theory on learning environment aspects that would help students to learn interdisciplinary thinking. The design-focused evaluation among 26 students showed that the practical aims were met, and concerning the theoretical aim, eight learning environment aspects were identified such as learning within an interdisciplinary framework. Further research should validate these aspects to continue with tackling teacher challenges on teaching interdisciplinary thinking.

AB  - Pupils' perception of any science subject significantly influences their achievement. Identification of perception of some subject is essential part of educational research. This study is focused on finding out differences in the four dimensions of geography perception (1. Geography as a school subject; 2. Geography and environment; 3 Importance of geography; 4. Relevance of geography lessons to pupils life) between gender and grade level of lower secondary school pupils. The research tool was questionnaire with 27 Likert type items; the data were obtained from 540 lower secondary pupils from Czech Republic. The data were analyzed by the method of descriptive (mean score, standard deviation) and inductive (analysis of variance) statistics. The gender had got significant influence in the first dimension and grade level in the fourth dimension. Results are discussed in the conclusion part and there is information about the possibility of future research.

AB  - Unique integrative learning approaches represent a fundamental opportunity for undergraduate students and faculty alike to combine interdisciplinary methods with applied spatial research. Geography and geoscience-related disciplines are particularly well-suited to adapt multiple methods within a holistic and reflective mentored research paradigm. The case study presented is successful geography-geology collaboration at a regional comprehensive university. Faculty participation allowed them to broaden the scope of their research and expand cooperative relationships within the academy, while students benefited from a wider context for disciplinary training, improved community engagement, and professional development opportunities.

AB  - This study examined the effect of an interdisciplinary program of reading and service learning on the cognitive and affective development of university students in Hong Kong. As Nussbaum (1997) stated, literature plays a vital role in educating citizens of the world through its narrative imagination and its power of promoting understanding and empathy toward the life of others. Halstead and Pike (2006) also emphasized that art can foster reflection upon action and bring about change in behavior as a result of perspective change. In this study, 24 freshmen read literary works under the theme of children's welfare and explored issues related to the welfare of children worldwide. Their reflections on these materials were expressed in writing and in a presentation. In the following semester, the students participated in voluntary services within and outside Hong Kong. All students completed a questionnaire on their humanistic concerns and sense of global citizenship at the beginning and the end of the project. Results showed that students were conscious of their changes after joining the program and stated their growth in values and knowledge. The pre-post-"t"-test analysis suggested that students had made significant improvement in the following areas: (1) their attitude toward serving others, especially in their personal and social values; (2) their engagement in reading literary and nonfiction works which reflect social and moral issues of the world; (3) their attention to world affairs; (4) their concern for the underprivileged; and (5) awareness of their potential in helping the poor.

AB  - In response to the incessant calls for interdisciplinary scholarship, universities adopt initiatives and encourage faculty to collaborate across discipline lines. Yet, the literature shows that it is difficult to institutionalise such work as faculty members are heavily influenced by their discipline-bound training. When faculty do participate, they wonder how their work will be regarded. Thus, in this paper, we set out to investigate the experience of STEM faculty who conduct work in the area of K-20 education. We were particularly interested in exploring how these faculty, whom we refer to as boundary crossers, position themselves as scholars and their work as scholarship to their discipline-based peers. Our analysis shows that boundary crossers assume great personal responsibility as their university failed to make firm structural or policy-based reforms in support of this particular initiative. Personal responsibility manifests in three distinct ways: working overtime, unpacking one's work, and framing one's work as a public good. We argue that these responses are grounded in a larger sociocultural framework, and that they reinforce the marginal position of these scholars. (Contains 4 notes and 1 table.)

AB  - Introduction: There are numerous examples of care gaps that could be reduced through enhanced knowledge exchange and practice collaboration between medical specialist physicians. In this paper, we report preliminary results on using speed-dating sessions (SDSs) to stimulate the development of continuing interdisciplinary education (CIDE) activities. Methods: In 2007, a 35-minute SDS was carried out during a 2-hour faculty development workshop to provide continuing medical education (CME) directors of Quebec's 35 medical specialist associations with a formal opportunity to quickly share clinical issues and goals. A post-workshop survey was used to assess participants' satisfaction and whether they had met new colleagues, learned about interdisciplinary issues, and discovered opportunities for collaboration. CME accreditation files were audited to assess the occurrence of CIDE activities in the year prior and the 2 years that followed the workshop. CME directors were called to assess whether the development of these activities was directly attributable to their participation in the SDS. Results: CME directors of 26 specialist physician associations attended the faculty development workshop. The vast majority of survey respondents (n = 18/20) were satisfied with the SDS and believed that this method was a stimulating and efficient way to meet new colleagues, quickly share clinical issues and goals, learn about unexpected but important interdisciplinary issues, and identify opportunities for CIDE collaboration. Sixty percent (12/20) reported having identified at least 1 opportunity for collaboration that was worth pursuing in the near future, and 19% of attending CME directors (5/26) developed a CIDE activity within 2 years, as compared with none in the previous year and for the 9 nonparticipating associations. Discussion: Results suggest that SDSs enhanced networking, knowledge exchange, and collaboration in continuing education among CME providers who participated in a faculty development activity on CIDE.

AB  - The opportunity for individualized instruction in the college studio allows the studio teacher to be a strong influence on the development of music students. The private studio can be an arena for standards implementation, bringing all aspects of a comprehensive music education to fruition. The college studio teacher is often the only teacher who has individual, one-on-one experience with students throughout their undergraduate careers, and the convictions and teaching style of this studio professor could influence a novice music educator. College music studios, therefore, offer a look at the extent to which and how students are given opportunities to make these connections and to develop thinking about the importance of a comprehensive approach to their own musical development. If the goal of studio teaching is to develop musicianship and to foster lifelong pursuit of musical knowledge and understanding, then instructors might benefit from a standards-based teaching philosophy. Such a philosophy has the potential to revolutionize how future students view a complete music education. In this article, the author examines options for integrating each of the National Standards for Music Education into the private lesson studio. (Contains 33 notes.)

AB  - More than ever before, leaders within the field of education are looking to research on basic processes to inform and improve educational practices. Success requires building a reciprocal relationship between the field of education and research on learning and development, similar to what exists between biology and medicine. Key to this effort is the development of an explicit conversation between researchers, practitioners, and policy makers, where the generation of basic processes research deals directly with the problems of practice. The goal of this special section of "Mind, Brain, and Education" is to provide a platform on which practical insight can be gained from new empirical research on hormones and behavior in development. The special section will extend across several issues to examine the hormones important for maintaining the body's critical regulatory processes, including energy balance, sleep/wake cycles, and growth. We have solicited manuscripts describing original research and we have asked an expert in each subfield to comment on the educational relevance of the findings and to vision the future and potential of basic processes research in this area to inform education.

AB  - It has been suggested that the field of Mind, Brain, and Education (MBE) requires a stable infrastructure for translating research into practice. Hinton and Fischer (2008) point to the academic medical center as a model for similar translational work and suggest a similar approach for linking scientists to research schools. We propose expanding their model to include a formal role for clinicians. Including clinicians who work with children with learning problems brings an important perspective to the translational work. For example, the integration of the concept of "differential diagnosis," a core precept in clinical medicine, would bring needed diagnostic specificity to the field of MBE. We describe a virtual infrastructure for collaboration, or "collaboratory," consisting of research scientists, educators, and clinicians, linked to an academic institution. We anticipate that MBE graduates can play a critical role in the collaboratory model. With additional training, they can become "neuroeducators" capable of moving comfortably among the disciplines, building linkages, fostering communication, and facilitating collaboration.

AB  - The authors sought to better approximate the practice of "real" science in our classrooms by having students study a newly built storm-water remediation wetland on campus. The wetland was meant to gather and clean storm water running off of student parking lots--thus students had ownership in the problem and potential solution. Participating faculty members in the biology, chemistry, geography, and geology departments created learning modules to introduce students to industry-standard techniques, scientific research skills, and the structure and functioning of wetlands. Most modules had opportunities for student-driven inquiry; for instance, students identified what aspects of the wetland were most important and poorly known and designed projects to fill those data gaps. Students, faculty, and a keynote speaker convened yearly at a Wetland Forum to exchange data and experiences. The project was assessed with pre/post-testing of student perceptions and learning outcomes. (Contains 2 figures and 5 tables.)

AB  - This paper outlines a project to develop and track "design thinking" skills within groups of students in late primary and early secondary years of schooling in order to strengthen their creative skills and innovative mindsets. The outcome of the research will be the development of a model for the broad-based implementation of design thinking in schools which will foster students' creative skills, critical for 21st century living and their capacity to make a strong contribution to innovation in their future workplaces. Students will develop competence in using the steps--"understand, observe, visualise, evaluate, refine and implement"--in relation to examining contemporary issues concerned with living in rural and remote areas and will subsequently design illustrative multimedia presentations or computer games. Design thinking as a framework to solve problems and/or as a pedagogical framework has emerged from the processes that designers have used over the last twenty years to create unique and innovative products. A convincing literature base has continued to grow across almost every discipline area, yet "design thinking" is only just starting to influence school-based education.

AB  - We describe how a team approach that we developed as a mentoring strategy can be used to recruit, advance, and guide students to be more interested in the interdisciplinary field of mathematical biology, and lead to success in undergraduate research in this field. Students are introduced to research in their first semester via lab rotations. Their participation in the research of four faculty members--two from biology and two from mathematics--gives them a first-hand overview of research in quantitative biology and also some initial experience in research itself. However, one of the primary goals of the lab rotation experience is that of developing teams of students and faculty that combine mathematics and statistics with biology and the life sciences, teams that subsequently mentor undergraduate research in genuine interdisciplinary environments. Thus, the team concept serves not only as a means of establishing interdisciplinary research, but also as a means of incorporating new students into existing research efforts that will then track those students into meaningful research of their own. We report how the team concept is used to support undergraduate research in mathematical biology and what types of team-building strategies have worked for us. (Contains 3 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - Youth organizing combines elements of community organizing, with its emphasis on ordinary people working collectively to advance shared interests, and positive youth development, with its emphasis on asset-based approaches to working with young people. It is expanding from an innovative, but marginal approach to youth and community development into a more widely recognized model for practice among nonprofit organizations and foundations. Along the way, it has garnered attention from researchers interested in civic engagement, social movements, and resiliency. A growing body of published work evidences the increasing interest of researchers, who have applied an assortment of theoretical perspectives to their observations of youth organizing processes. Through an appraisal of the current state of this still-emerging area of practice and research, including case examples, the authors identify common elements of the practice of youth organizing--relationship development, popular education, social action, and participatory research and evaluation--and conclude with a discussion of promising future directions for research and practice.

AB  - Objective: Professional siloing within medical institutions has been identified as a problem in medical education, including resident training. The authors discuss how trainees from different disciplines can collaborate to address this problem. Method: A group of trainees from psychiatry, developmental medicine, neurology, and education came together to develop a community of practice (CoP) to promote interdisciplinary collaboration. Results: A key outcome was the development of a seminar including speakers and attendees (N = 20 to 35) from psychiatry, developmental medicine, neurology, and education. The CoP, developed in 2008, continues to grow and develop through their seminar, which fosters institution-wide interdisciplinary collaboration. Conclusion: In an attempt to break down interdisciplinary silos, a CoP and interdisciplinary seminar were created. Trainee organizers benefited from an educational context that embodied adult-learning theory and promoted lifelong learning. The unique seminar that was created continues to promote a community sense of learning and practice. Outcome measures are currently being used to objectively measure these efforts.

AB  - This is an interdisciplinary lesson designed for middle school students studying landforms and geological processes. Students create a two-dimensional topographic map from a three-dimensional landform that they create using clay. Students then use other groups' topographic maps to re-create landforms. Following this, students explore some basic ideas about how landforms take shape and how they can change over time. As students work through three distinct learning-cycle phases of concept exploration, introduction, and application, they use art, language arts, and mathematical skills to strengthen or form new science and social studies concepts.

AB  - The field of education has become comfortable in its use of the construct urban to describe particular schools in particular metropolitan places. This article argues that the construct has come to signify not just place but also to denote particular meanings of "urban" populations. It analyzes how literary and social-scientific practices converged to anchor this construct paradigmatically in the registers of educational practitioners and researchers. Drawing from cultural geography, the article then demonstrates why the framework of the urban, and its other implicit pole the suburban, is no longer satisfactory for conceptualizing empirical questions about metropolitan schools. Lastly, the author identifies and discusses exemplars within the field of educational research that help us to remap our theoretical and empirical work.

AB  - There was a doughnut thief loose and the students were determined to put their science skills to use to track down the culprit. They would use forensic science to eliminate suspects and identify the thief who stole the doughnuts. School staff take on the role of the likely suspects. It was their goal to develop an interdisciplinary unit that engaged students as critical thinkers, communicators, and investigators. It was successful in this regard. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - This study concerns the design and development of online instruction and specifically targets interaction and communication between online learners. Facilitating appropriate and meaningful interactions in designing instruction is a major goal for anyone developing a course, especially an online class. The data for this study came from the online courses offered at one of the major Rocky Mountain University. The research subjects and courses were taken from the College of Education, College of Business, College of Arts and Sciences and College of Health Sciences. The findings of this study suggest that the interactivity in an online class depends on the discipline it belongs to and hence, future research must focus on explaining the overall interactions within a discipline.

AB  - This paper describes the development of a taught Master's course in biomedical diagnostics using a novel multi-disciplinary approach. This course, the first of its kind in Ireland, covers the science and technology underlying the development of medical diagnostic devices that detect early markers of diseases such as cancer. The ethical impact of these devices on society, the importance of scientific communication, relevant aspects of business entrepreneurial studies and the commercialisation of medical devices are also covered. The course consists of a mixture of theory, intensive laboratory practicals and independent research. The challenges faced in setting up and running the course are described, as well as some of the novel aspects and may provide valuable insight to those involved in the development of high-level Master's courses.

AB  - Bioinformatics is a relatively new interdisciplinary field that integrates computer science, mathematics, biology, and information technology to manage, analyze, and understand biological, biochemical and biophysical information. We present our experience in teaching an interdisciplinary course, Introduction to Bioinformatics, which was developed and taught by an interdisciplinary team of computer science and biology faculty. To integrate the "Ethics, Computing, and Genomics" component into the course curriculum, collaboration with an English faculty member was established. The course was designed as an upper-level elective for computer information systems and computer science majors and was open as a science elective for all science majors and for chemical engineering majors. We discuss the course curriculum, and a way to integrate the Python programming language in the UNIX environment will be presented. The integration of bioinformatics algorithms into the course curriculum will be emphasized.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to begin to explore how collective and sociomaterial theories of learning might be applied within interdisciplinary and interprofessional contexts--in particular the team-based collaboration that is playing an ever larger role in both fields. It ?? articulates several key features of interdisciplinary and interprofessional activities and then speculates on how they might be productively reframed through the lenses of the following theoretical perspectives: communities of practice, cultural historical activity theory, complexity science and actor-network theory. The article is not intended to be comprehensive; its aim is to begin the process of developing deeper, more theoretically sophisticated understandings of the collective learning and knowing that emerge--often across deep paradigmatic divides--through interprofessional and interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - Though overlooked or at best implicit in "A Crucible Moment," interdisciplinary studies has much to contribute to civic learning for democratic engagement. The article organizes those contributions into the report's categories of knowledge, values, and skills. It concludes with an example of how techniques used in interdisciplinary studies to create common ground can contribute to fruitful democratic discourse on even the thorniest of societal issues, namely abortion.

AB  - This paper explores the potential of collaborative interdisciplinary teaching as a mechanism for advancing feminist pedagogies. The authors, individually and collectively, engage in feminist academic work (e.g., scholarship and teaching) that challenges traditional academic expectations in their disciplines and at their institution. The authors do this in spite of their understanding that power relations within the academy and in traditional academic disciplines tend to marginalize methodologies that promote emancipatory and progressive ideas. Furthermore, they embrace academic feminism, particularly in the classroom, as having interdisciplinary potential in its ability to draw from multiple fields of thought simultaneously to help students develop critical approaches that ultimately contribute to equity and equality, within and beyond the academy. The focus of this article is to contribute to the discussion of the promises and drawbacks of interdisciplinary feminist pedagogies and collaborative teaching by providing a case study of feminist interdisciplinarity that is truly integrative, as conceived and implemented in a team-taught Gender Perspectives course delivered by the four authors in 2009 and 2012.

AB  - Interdisciplinary field study courses at 2-year colleges can provide an opportunity to enhance student learning. The authors present here an 11-day interdisciplinary field-study course designed for nonscience majors at a 2-year college. Using a theoretical learning framework that emphasizes cognitive and metacognitive gains, the field study curriculum is designed to incorporate both geology and biology topics illustrating the cross-discipline nature of science education. The course allows students to travel to classic geologic locales that provide a means of science immersion in a more active learning and inquiry based atmosphere. Students are encouraged to ask questions about nature, formulate hypotheses for answering those questions, and evaluate conclusions. Additionally the course provides an opportunity for students to refine observation and inquiry skills beyond a set of laboratory exercises and classroom lectures. An end-of-course survey was used to capture students' perceived value of the course.

AB  - There has been no shortage in calls for interdisciplinary enquiry. Yet it is often difficult to know exactly what is intended by this in the fullest sense. What is interdisciplinary enquiry in its totality? If we do not know precisely what it is, how do we bring this kind of enterprise to fruition? The study of education, while being already interdisciplinary in some sense, is far from ideal. Whereas the sociology of education and educational psychology that are somehow "scientific" in character have retained widespread appeal, the history and philosophy of education, which are not necessarily scientific, have lost much of their appeal. This indicates that something has been left out of the development and expansion of the study of education. What has been left out, this paper asserts, is a broader reconsideration of the normative character of our knowing something in particular and of our lives in general. This paper draws on the combined conceptions of "the space of reasons" and "second nature" to fully acknowledge the need for an interdisciplinary perspective on the study of education and on the role of education itself in a broader context of human living. To develop an appreciation of these notions suggests that philosophical thinking should be open to, rather than proffered in intrinsic opposition to, empirical or "scientific" investigations. The happy consequence of such a position is that this would open up a far more inclusive terrain on which educational issues can be addressed. (Contains 17 notes.)

AB  - The underlying rationale to support interdisciplinary collaboration in geriatrics and gerontology is based on the complexity of elderly care. The most important characteristic about interdisciplinary health care teams for older people in Latin America is their subjective-basis framework. In other regions, teams are organized according to a theoretical knowledge basis with well-justified priorities, functions, and long-term goals, in Latin America teams are arranged according to subjective interests on solving their problems. Three distinct approaches of interdisciplinary collaboration in gerontology are proposed. The first approach is grounded in the scientific rationalism of European origin. Denominated "logical-rational approach," its core is to identify the significance of knowledge. The second approach is grounded in pragmatism and is more associated with a North American tradition. The core of this approach consists in enhancing the skills and competences of each participant; denominated "logical-instrumental approach." The third approach denominated "logical-subjective approach" has a Latin America origin. Its core consists in taking into account the internal and emotional dimensions of the team. These conceptual frameworks based in geographical contexts will permit establishing the differences and shared characteristics of interdisciplinary collaboration in geriatrics and gerontology to look for operational answers to solve the "complex problems" of older adults.

AB  - The interdisciplinary project under discussion is suitable to be addressed to students of either primary or secondary education and it interweaves the art of painting with fairy tales. The aims of the project are: the deeper understanding of the complexity of human nature and the sensitization of students regarding gender roles and stereotypes. On the occasion of a visit at the Museum of Modern Greek Art of Rhodes and with the painting of D. Mytaras, named "Woman in the Mirror" as a pretext, we started a discussion which resulted in a focused project, through which students who participated in it, improved self-perception, promoted their communication competence, realized the existence of gender stereotypes, negotiated the dominant viewpoints and even adopted critical stances that challenged gender inequality. The mirror was the starting point from which the project was deployed. Woman in the mirror usually stands for female vainglory, coquetry and self- assumption. After exploring the symbolic charge of the mirror through a variety of artistic representations and fairy-tale narratives, both traditional and postmodern, where the woman in the mirror was the pivotal theme, the students expressed themselves uninhibitedly and voluntarily and in the end they produced visual and textual creations. Freed from the constraints of conventional teaching and of the performance anxiety, intrigued and engaged by both the process and the subject matter, the students responded positively during every phase, proving through their final works that they had reached a satisfactory level of self-consciousness and of understanding the factitious nature of gender roles, having adopted a more mature and objective--compared to their initial one--attitude towards gender stereotypes.

AB  - Several interventions aimed at increasing positive attitudes towards older adults among health-care professionals have been introduced. These interventions tend to focus on a small subset of clinical employees, ignoring other clinical and nonclinical hospital staff. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a short aging simulation workshop toward increasing positive attitudes towards older adults among a multidisciplinary group of workshop participants using a pre/post quasiexperimental design. Four hundred seventy six new employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs completed the Kogan's Attitudes Toward Old People Scale (KOP) immediately before and after participating in a short aging simulation workshop. Significant pre- to-posttest increases in KOP scores were identified for nurses, physicians, psychologists, other clinical employees, and nonclinical employees, but not among medical support assistants, nurse assistants, and social workers. There existed no significant differences between each group's pretest scores; however, staff of higher educational achievement had significantly higher posttest scores as compared to persons of lower educational status. This short aging simulation workshop was successful in increasing positive attitudes towards older adults among staff who had higher educational achievement.

AB  - In addition to developing deep knowledge of a single discipline, engineers must also be able to collaborate across disciplinary boundaries and develop interdisciplinary expertise to successfully address the complex challenges of the contemporary workplace. While numerous descriptions of interdisciplinary courses and projects appear in the literature, educators still lack rigorous research about learning barriers, outcomes, and concrete interventions to support this interdisciplinary development. This paper addresses that gap by pairing a review of the literature with a case study of students in a sustainable engineering program to identify the key challenges to success in interdisciplinary contexts. The findings suggest that students (1) lack the ability to connect interdisciplinary subjects to their own more narrowly defined fields of expertise, and (2) fail to identify and value the contributions of multiple fields to complex problems. This paper concludes with possible teaching interventions to address these barriers. (Contains 6 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - Does gifted education affect societal inequality, and does societal inequality suppress and/or distort the development of high ability? Drawing from several academic disciplines and current political discourse, a differentiated use of terms used to describe the highly able is explored in this article. A social evolutionary framework is proposed as an explanation for such differentiation, which also sheds light on the questions of inequality, suppression, and distortion in relation to high ability. It is suggested that this differentiated use is prompted and defined by societal function rather than by current theories of high ability. The result of employing a social evolutionary perspective is that high ability as giftedness becomes largely dysfunctional and unwanted, whereas high ability as talent becomes more utilitarian and much in demand. The article concludes with a brief discussion about the possible future of gifted education in this light.

AB  - Insurance is an interesting interdisciplinary topic that can offer generative meaning and relevance for students. By adapting real life examples and authentic simulations, mathematical concepts can be applied to insurance-related social studies issues and content. This article explores ways to teach insurance and related mathematical concepts to middle school students using an interdisciplinary approach and it demonstrates various concomitant benefits in teaching mathematics with the concept of insurance by connecting it to important democratic citizenship dispositions such as civic participation, critical thinking, interpersonal skills, and knowledge of political activity. The ultimate goal of this interdisciplinary approach is to develop students' ability to make informed and reasoned decisions as current and future consumer-citizens.

AB  - The article provides the basis for a model of inquiry-based science education in which K-12 teachers' and pupils' engage in authentic science experiences as participants of a scientific research project, which we refer to as Multiple Outcome Interdisciplinary Research and Learning (MOIRL). We provide the basis for the model for inquiry based science education (IBSE) by first describing how the model came about through our 10 years of research on how people learn to do science in research groups. We then turn to the literature on the relationship among scientific inquiry, inquiry learning and MOIRL. As our case studies of MOIRL projects show, by being participants along with scientists and their graduate/undergraduate students in authentic scientific research, school pupils learn how to do science and gain a better understanding of scientific concepts. Productive disciplinary engagement can be fostered with learning environments that are problematic in the sense that they encourage students to ask and seek answers to intellectual questions. By incorporating as many stakeholders and outcomes as possible, the likelihood increases of pupils' learning of science concepts and processes. In addition, the incorporation of multiple stakeholders and outcomes provides pupils with a view of the many authentic ways that science and scientific inquiry is connected to the world outside of school, which increases the likelihood that they study more science and aspire to scientific careers. Finally, the MOIRL projects provide teachers with the opportunity to engage in scientific research, which can better prepare them to teach science as inquiry and through the use of inquiry methods.

AB  - This qualitative case study analyzed how one interdisciplinary team within a large middle school fostered a responsive adolescent-centered community for eighth-grade team students. Data were collected during the spring semester of the 2009 school year via observations, individual interviews, and focus group interviews with nine participants, including four eighth-grade students, four eighth-grade team teachers, and one middle school principal. Findings indicate developmentally responsive school organizational structures (i.e., interdisciplinary teaming, flexible scheduling, homeroom, and common planning time) and team teacher characteristics and practices helped to promote an adolescent-centered community that met eighth-grade students' needs for care and fun, in addition to other basic and developmental needs. Meeting eighth-grade students' needs for care and fun emerged as the major theme in the promotion of an adolescent-centered, developmentally responsive community within one interdisciplinary team at the middle level.

AB  - The authors provide a case study of how a group of faculty members was able to initiate transformation in student learning and institutional structures at a small university in the Midwestern U.S. through the introduction of collaborative feminist organizing and pedagogy. It details faculty-led initiatives that set the stage for innovative teaching and learning, and it describes the authors' experience in the face of resistance when introducing a global women's human rights course into the university's new core curriculum. Because of its diverse, interdisciplinary and transnational content, this course challenged deeply ingrained disciplinary and pedagogical borders of both traditional area studies and the field of history. The authors argue that progress toward diverse curricula can be made when colleagues work collaboratively and apply innovative pedagogical models to the classroom. Although specific to one university, these challenges to and strategies for transformation have broader application to all faculty seeking to diversify curricula and institutions.

AB  - Since the early 1990s, Portland State University has furthered its commitment to civic engagement education by adopting an integrated approach to its general education curriculum. As an outgrowth to this initiative, the minor in Civic Leadership was developed in 2004-05. This interdisciplinary minor was designed with the intent to further integrate and sustain institutional engagement with the Portland Metropolitan community and beyond. This article discusses the history, structure, and roles of academic and community partners associated with the Civic Leadership minor, and elaborates the philosophical foundation of the interdisciplinary curriculum that aims to build student capacity for the common good.

AB  - This paper examines how a team of teachers in a Norwegian upper secondary school responds to, negotiates, and evaluates students' writing in and across different disciplines. The purpose is to identify discourse strategies and professional development as the teachers discuss students' texts, and to explore how the teachers develop a shared understanding of how writing relates to students' learning. The findings show how the teachers' discourse reflects an emerging understanding of how writing is both a subject-specific and interdisciplinary skill conducive to learning, but also how institutional traditions and discipline-specific concerns together allow for and constrain teachers' learning.

AB  - We describe a non-statistics, data-based activity developed by the author for an interdisciplinary course on mathematics and politics that uses actual ballot data from the City of San Francisco, California. The assignment is appropriate for a general education audience and develops students' ability to work with data, improves their understanding of functions and algorithms, and requires them to make (and support) choices grounded in logic and mathematics. We also provide a "Mathematica" notebook that makes it easy to take data from San Francisco to create such an assignment. Supplementary materials are available for this article.

AB  - This article discusses the "lessons learned" from an attempt to establish an interdisciplinary education research group. The growth, development and dissolution of the group are treated as an instrumental case study. Current literature on interdisciplinary collaboration is synthesized in order to provide a frame for analysis. Data was collected over several years and included three rounds of written participant reflections and documentation of group activities and meetings. Five major themes arose from the research, covering issues such as disciplinary diversity, common ground, interpersonal relationships, career pressures, and the need for concrete problems and tangible progress. Based on these themes, a number of "lessons learned" are discussed which will likely be of great interest to those considering similar interdisciplinary initiatives.

A practice model describing the implementation of the approach is then presented, based on the experiences of staff members in a home visiting program for infants that has been in existence for over 30 years. The benefits and challenges experienced by therapists and managers of the program are considered, along with the unique aspects of the program and implications for program management. The managerial and team resources required to successfully implement a transdisciplinary model are high, but the potential payoffs for children, families, and therapists' development of expertise are considerable.

AB  - Purpose: Deficient group processes such as conformity pressure can lead to inadequate group decisions with negative social, economic, or environmental consequences. The study aims to investigate how a group technique (called INFO) improves students' handling of conformity pressure and their collective judgments in the context of a transdisciplinary case study (TCS) for sustainability learning. Design/methodology/approach: The improvement of normative functioning and output (INFO) group technique was tested in a field experiment embedded in a TCS. The INFO technique involves individual and group assessments of task difficulty. The experiment compares the performance of student groups assigned to control and experimental conditions in estimation tasks related to environmental planning and rail traffic. Findings: The INFO interventions significantly improved the accuracy of group estimates compared to the control conditions. Applying the group technique could promote student's learning and facilitate the search for sustainable solutions in a TCS. Practical implications: Results indicate that individually and collectively analyzing and discussing difficulties of a task as suggested by the INFO group technique can help students improve collective judgments on real world issues. Originality/value: Group techniques are a prominent type of TCS methods as group processes are crucial for sustainability learning. First, this study applies the INFO group technique in a TCS in order to evaluate and further develop the technique. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Embryonic development offers a unique perspective on the function of many biological processes because of embryos' heightened sensitivity to environmental factors. This hands-on lesson investigates the effects of elevated vitamin A on the morphogenesis of chicken embryos. The active form of vitamin A (retinoic acid) is applied to shell-less (ex ovo) cultured chick embryos, which are highly accessible and intrinsically spawn inquiry. The student activities mirror the scientific research process, including review of scientific literature, hypothesis formation, experimental design, interpretation of data, and re-evaluation of the initial hypothesis. This exercise supports instruction on developmental biology, biophysics, animal research, and experimental design and is motivated by a clinically relevant health issue.

AB  - Objective: In this article, we estimate the effect of a multidisciplinary collaboration program on the length of sickness absence. The intention with the program was to avoid long-term sickness absence by providing an early and holistic evaluation of the sick-listed individuals' conditions. The target group was individuals who were at risk of becoming long-term sick. The eligibility criteria were mainly based on register information that we have access to. Methods: Using this register information, we estimate different Cox regression models and apply a nonparametric matching estimator. We have also conducted a small randomized experiment. Results: The result from the randomized experiment is not statistically significant, but the point estimate provides the same result as was found in the observational study: The program prolongs rather than shortens the sickness absence spell. That is, the average sickness absence spell is prolonged by about 3 months. Conclusions: Our main explanation for this discouraging result is that the team focuses too much on rehabilitation rather than encouraging the sick-listed individual to return to work.

AB  - This paper examines issues relating to the design/redesign of the pedagogy of interdisciplinary undergraduate subjects. Examples include: (a) law subjects for students in Business Management or Building and Surveying; (b) "English Communication for Business" for students in English; and (c) "Information technology in Business" for students in Business. Interdisciplinary subjects often frustrate teachers because of their marginal status within the programme, low student interest and difficulty of creating a balance between the subject's double facets (e.g. the balance between the business and language facets in the above-mentioned Subject b). It has long been advocated that interdisciplinary subjects naturally invite an interdisciplinary pedagogical approach. Nevertheless, the puzzle often remains as to how to reconcile the different disciplinary facets within the subject without confusing students, each having its distinctive tradition of content organisation and teaching/assessment approaches. In the paper, the concepts of interdisciplinary and disciplinary culture and their pedagogical implications are explored, which support an interdisciplinary approach to teaching interdisciplinary subjects. Following that, literature relevant to approaches to pedagogical and curriculum design of interdisciplinary subjects is reviewed. Theories about outcome-based approaches and constructive alignment for designing curriculum and pedagogical design for undergraduate courses are then discussed and their implications for implementing the interdisciplinary approach are examined.

AB  - The paper discusses the children's novel "Gaffer Samson's Luck (1984)," by Jill Paton Walsh, from three different perspectives; those of a cultural geographer, a literary scholar and an English teacher. It is part of a larger research project on children's perception of their place-related identities through reading and writing. The novel is used as a case study to develop a multidisciplinary approach, drawing upon theories of literature and reading, and a conceptualisation of space in cultural geography. Employing ideas from different disciplines, the paper offers an original interpretation of the text as well as innovative analytical tools for future research and for classroom application.

AB  - This case study, written for use in a multidisciplinary course, exposes students to concepts in business law, economics, and statistics. The case is based upon a hypothetical scenario involving a young woman who, having spent a relaxing day at the beach, heads for home. On the drive home, a flip-flop she is wearing becomes lodged under the gas pedal. In attempting to dislodge the flip-flop, the car she is driving drifts into the lane of oncoming traffic, running head-on into another vehicle. The injured driver of the other vehicle files a lawsuit against the young woman and the manufacturer of the flip-flops. The business law portion of the case raises questions regarding negligence and strict products liability. The economics aspect of the case involves the calculation of lost earnings and present value, and the statistics portion of the case requires regression analysis of automobile accident data. Instructors can easily modify the case for use as an in-class or take-home assignment in an introductory business law course by eliminating the economics and statistics issues. In Part II of this article, the hypothetical scenario is presented for consideration. Part III provides a set of questions to prompt and direct discussion. An overview of applicable law is provided in Part IV for use in analyzing the relevant tort claims and defenses. Teaching notes in Part V outline pedagogical objectives and suggestions for use of the case and includes a detailed analysis of the potential claims and counterarguments or defenses.

AB  - The goal of this study was to integrate previous research conducted on student participation in the college classroom. Numerous studies have been completed on engaging students in classroom discussions, but no study has synthesized this information in the form of an extensive literature review. Here, previous research is pulled together to gain a comprehensive overview of the benefits of participation, logistical issues in participation, student confidence and personality traits in participation, the instructor's influence on and suggestions for increasing participation, the role of sex in participation, and participation in web-based courses. Specifically, academic journal articles that were published over the past 51 years (1958-2009) with student in-class participation as a major variable were included. Details of the selection process, a thorough review of the literature, implications for the classroom, and directions for future research are provided. (Contains 2 notes.)

AB  - This case study examined the development and evaluation of an interdisciplinary first-year learning community designed to stimulate scientific reasoning and critical thinking. Designed to serve the needs of scholarship students majoring in mathematics and natural sciences, the six-credit learning community course was writing-intensive and emphasized general scientific reasoning and critical thinking skills. Success of the course was measured using a pre-test/post-test design that assessed students' paranormal beliefs. Outcomes of the study indicated students' paranormal beliefs were significantly lower at the end of the semester than at the beginning, which was used as a surrogate measure of scientific reasoning that was directly relevant to course content. Supplementary analyses demonstrated that their (a) paranormal beliefs were significantly lower than other students and (b) students self-identified the importance of the scientific reasoning skills learned in the course without being prompted on their teacher course evaluations. The results of this study can inform the design of interdisciplinary, scientific reasoning courses.

Understanding power relations in an interdisciplinary way makes connections -- by highlighting intersubjectivity -- between external social structures and subjective experiences in a biographical study of how non-traditional learner identities may be transformed through higher education in England and the Republic of Ireland.

AB  - First results of the project "Mathematical Creativity of Children at Risk" (MaKreKi) will be presented. The project is conducted in the interdisciplinary research center "Individual Development and Adaptive Education of Children at Risk" (IDeA [http://www.idea-frankfurt.eu; accessed 7 June 2013]). Combining a socio-constructivist approach of mathematics education with a psychoanalytic theory of attachment, two foci of analysis are examined: the interactional reconstruction of working processes of creative children while they are confronted with mathematical problems in a cooperative learning situation and a psychoanalytically oriented reconstruction of the psychodynamic background of a mathematically creative child in its family. In this article, one case study is presented. Theoretical considerations that combine the psychoanalytic findings with the results of the socio-constructivist analyses are presented. This combination offers an innovative and unique perspective on the mathematical creativity of young children in preschool, kindergarten and primary school age.

AB  - Professionals in the environmental domain require cognitive interdisciplinary skills to be able to develop sustainable solutions to environmental problems. We demonstrate that education in environmental systems analysis allows for the development of these skills. We identify three components of cognitive interdisciplinary skills: (1) the ability to understand environmental issues in a holistic way, taking into account the interplay of social and biophysical dynamics; (2) the ability to connect both the analysis of environmental problems and the devising of solutions with relevant disciplinary knowledge and methodologies; and (3) the ability to reflect on the role of scientific research in solving societal problems. Environmental systems analysis provides tools, methods, and models to assist in framing complex environmental issues in a holistic way and facilitates the integration of disciplines. Systems analysis also supports reflection by making students aware that a system always represents a simplified model and a particular perspective. Through the analysis of a collection of bachelor of science students' "reflection papers", we identify two major challenges in teaching these cognitive skills: (1) to train students to not just follow a systematic approach but acquire a systemic view and (2) to train students to be reflexive about systems analysis and the role of science. We recommend that training in cognitive skills starts early in a study program.

AB  - In order to determine how emotions and cognition are experienced during collaborative group work online students' descriptions of their learning experience were interpreted using a qualitative approach. A common feature of these accounts was reference to difficulties and problems. Four main themes were identified from this data set. Two of the themes, "Constraints on autonomy" and "Reflections about collaboration", encapsulate the experience of engaging in group work. The other two themes "Virtual others" and "Communicating online". The "impact on progress and achievement" provide some insight into what is unique about the socio-emotional experience of collaborating online and how it can influence motivation and learning. The findings were considered from two perspectives of the role of emotion in learning: the socio-cognitive model of self-regulated learning and the community of inquiry framework (COI). An interdisciplinary approach was adopted by taking into account recent research in social cognitive neuroscience. Some practical recommendations about the deployment of technologies for group work online and for empowering students' understanding of the value of collaborative learning are made. The value of verbal immediacy practices as a way of counteracting the disembodied nature of the relational experience of others online is discussed. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - This meta-analysis summarized youth, academic, and workplace research on the potential antecedents (demographics, human capital, and relationship attributes), correlates (interaction frequency, relationship length, performance, motivation, and social capital), and consequences (attitudinal, behavioral, career-related, and health-related outcomes) of protege perceptions of instrumental support, psychosocial support, and relationship quality to the mentor or to the relationship. A total of 173 meta-analytic correlations were computed based on data from 173 samples and a combined N of 40,737. Among antecedents, positive protege perceptions were most strongly associated with greater similarity in attitudes, values, beliefs, and personality with their mentors ([rho] ranged from 0.38 to 0.59). Among correlates, protege perceptions of greater instrumental support ([rho] = 0.35) and relationship quality ([rho] = 0.54) were most strongly associated with social capital while protege perceptions of greater psychosocial support were most strongly associated with interaction frequency ([rho] = 0.25). Among consequences, protege perceptions of greater instrumental support ([rho] = 0.36) and relationship quality ([rho] = 0.38) were most strongly associated with situational satisfaction while protege perceptions of psychosocial support were most highly associated with sense of affiliation ([rho] = 0.41). Comparisons between academic and workplace mentoring generally revealed differences in magnitude, rather than direction, of the obtained effects. The results should be interpreted in light of the methodological limitations (primarily cross-sectional designs and single-source data) and, in some instances, a small number of primary studies.

AB  - Most studies to date have examined negative effects of exposure to community violence, in line with the deficit-based perspective. However, given that most youth exposed to community violence demonstrate positive adaptation or resilience over time, we suggest a shift in perspective, practices, and policies across systems toward identifying and building individual, family, and community assets and strengths that may more effectively support youth who have been exposed to community violence and related risks into competent, caring, and thriving adults. In this article, we review how resilience has been conceptualized and operationalized within the context of community violence, highlight gaps in literature, and offer directions for future public health research and practice. We illustrate this review with practice-based examples from public health work in the San Francisco Bay Area. Future multidisciplinary longitudinal studies that identify protective processes and successful trajectories and rigorous evaluations of strength-based policies, programs, and protective processes are needed.

AB  - This paper sets up a scenario about Rebecca, a jobseeker, who is a fictitious composite, a "typical" candidate who wants a position at a college/university. A job description is provided. She interviews for the advertised position, and while doing so, she also interviews the university, school/department, and working environment to see if there is a match with her goals. She goes about her own interviewing using observational, interactive, and analytic approaches, which are described. Rebecca had to clarify her goals in terms of interdisciplinarity, collegiality, and the kind of community that she ideally wants. She found shortfalls between what was advertised and the actual program and also the setting in which she ideally would like to work. This is problematic for her, but she is pragmatic and knows she needs a job. The scenario ends with Rebecca exploring her options. This paper will be of interest to anyone seeking an environmental job in academia.

AB  - There has been almost no investigation of reports produced by interdisciplinary teams. Feedback was obtained from 30 teachers regarding a typical (but fictional) report written by the Children's Assessment Team at Flinders Medical Centre. Quantitative and thematic analysis revealed that the same features that contribute to the effectiveness of a psychological report were relevant to inter-disciplinary reports. Readability, explanation of technical terms, use of behavioural examples and an initial summary paragraph were cited as useful report components. While teachers appreciated the clarity and detail of the report, they requested more detailed, concrete recommendations for interventions within a classroom setting.

AB  - This paper describes the structure and the underlying rationale of a new course dedicated to capability maturity model integration (CMMI)-directed design of wireless sensor networks (WSNs)-based biomedical applications that stresses: 1) engineering-, medico-engineering-, and informatics-related issues; 2) design for general- and special-purpose systems; and 3) the creation of synergistic effects that enable formation of entrepreneurial multidisciplinary teams able to organize and implement the development of these health-related pervasive computing applications. Formal education so far still focuses on treating only strictly separated and specialized topic areas. However, as the need for cooperation and mutual learning between students oriented toward different fields grows, the need for a multidisciplinary educational approach becomes more and more important. For a technical education to be complete, it is no longer enough to train scientists and engineers solely in technical areas. In development and implementation of technology-driven applications, multidisciplinary issues should be properly addressed in the academic sense. The interdisciplinary understanding and synergy achieved are tested through examinations and workshops. The transdisciplinary knowledge improvement is also statistically evaluated, using a system of metrics developed experimentally. (Contains 9 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - Teaching BSW and MSW students beginning interviewing and relationship-building skills is essential in order to prepare them for practice with clients. In social work methods courses, role plays are commonly-used instructional strategies for helping foundation-level students acquire these initial practice skills. Despite the popularity of this teaching method, the social work literature contains limited studies on the use of role play. In this study, 2 role-play methods are compared, a traditional one in which social work students act out the role of client and social worker and a nontraditional one where the only difference was that theater students role-played the client. Findings revealed that social work students perceived the nontraditional role play as providing a more realistic experience that more closely approximates actual work with clients. Many unanticipated benefits for both sets of students surfaced as a result of this research. Implications for ways to improve this pedagogical tool are discussed along with suggestions for further evaluating role-play methods. (Contains 3 figures and 2 tables.)

AB  - The goal of this study was to develop an instrument for assessing grade 10 and 11 student's levels of scientific literacy in the areas of problem solving and decision making. In concentrating on determining the scientific literacy of gymnasium level students, it was taken as a first; previous international studies like PISA have focused on ninth grade students. The study used four interdisciplinary situations in a personal, social and global context, taken from everyday life, and answers were expected at higher levels of scientific thinking. In addition, student's opinions were sought about their interest related to the kind of instruments used, with the intention of considering their opinions if later modifying the instrument. The sample (N = 62) was composed of 10 and 11 grade students in two schools. Results indicated that it is possible to develop an instrument for dividing students' responses between levels of scientific literacy, although most students responded at the functional level with very few at the multidimensional level and this despite the fact that the questions were developed to assess higher levels of scientific literacy. In the students' opinion, the more interesting situations were those in a personal and social context. Students justified this by answering that their capability to solve problems and make decisions by utilizing science knowledge and skills was best in such situations. In reality, they still operated at a functional level as indicated by their responses. (Contains 6 tables.)

AB  - Purpose: The conceptual model and implementation strategies for a university-private housing collaboration in a multilevel housing campus for older adults are described. The faculty and private developers viewed senior housing as an opportunity for people to downsize their space in order to "upsize" their lives within a community rich with resources to support their developmental needs. Methods: A wellness program that includes assessments developed and performed by a multidisciplinary team provides the basis for the development of resources and interventions aimed at "upsizing" residents' lives. Semi-annual assessments and feedback sessions provide the residents with opportunities to set and revise goals and to work with members of the team to identify resource needs. Results: After the first year, the wellness assessment scheduling and protocol were streamlined and recruitment barriers were addressed. The addition of a system for providing feedback to residents about their assessment results enhanced the meaning and value of the process. Implications: The Palisades team hopes to assist in promoting similar projects designed to positively impact wellness in older adults.

AB  - This article describes the development, implementation, and results of an extensive assessment of students and student learning outcomes in an interdisciplinary, integrative learning community. This assessment project took a comprehensive view of student learning by examining specific data and direct and indirect measures of academic growth for each learner, from high school GPAs and perceptions about academic preparation upon matriculation, to the development of critical and creative thinking skills while participating in the first-year learning community, to student engagement levels in their senior year.Where applicable, data were compared to data for students who did not participate in the learning community. The results of this panoramic assessment project indicate that interdisciplinary learning and learning community practices are effective in promoting academic improvement, retention, development of general education skills, and high levels of student engagement and can provide first-year students with an academic edge that follows them through their undergraduate careers. The article further discusses the value of using this type of 360-degree assessment to inform curricular decisions as well as to create institutional support for interdisciplinary, student-centered learning.

AB  - The process of teaching and learning at the undergraduate level is challenged by an increasing amount of content. Now it's not enough to convey knowledge; it's also necessary to seek alternative ways to motivate and capture the interest of students both during class and outside of class. Currently, social networks are popular among students and are used to establish and maintain contacts. Facebook, one of the most popularly accessed social networks, has ~500 million registered users and consequently has the potential to become an ally in the teaching and learning process. If properly used, Facebook allows the formation of groups with common interests, enables the exchange of information, and stimulates the search for knowledge. Considering this context in Brazil, where the number of connections grew from 8.8 to 35 million between 2010 and 2011, attracting ~1 trillion monthly visits, we asked ourselves: why not partner the physiology teaching with the use of Facebook, to try to increase students' interest in physiology, using an interdisciplinary approach? Consequently, we created a group on Facebook, which served as a support tool for teaching physiology at the health area undergraduate courses of the Federal University of Pampa (Unipampa) in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

AB  - In 2004, the University of Kansas (KU) launched an interdisciplinary Graduate Writing Program as part of a larger initiative to reduce time to degree rates and increase degree completion rates. Serving both domestic and international students, this program employs a rhetorical genre-based approach in a series of courses organized around the genres of graduate school and beyond. In these Graduate Studies courses, students become ethnographers of the research and writing practices of their disciplines while writing their own texts and developing their professional identities. In addition, the Graduate Writing Program fields a Summer Writing Institute and offers workshops for students. The program supports departments and faculty members through consultations and workshops on such topics as how to mentor graduate writing. This profile--part program description, part theoretical construct--outlines the history and structure of the program as well as the academic and cultural challenges that graduate students and their mentors face. It argues that rhetorical genre studies is ideally suited for teaching graduate writing and supporting students as they create their professional identities.

AB  - Background: Under the challenge of many post-modern theories and critics on art and art history, the boundaries and definition of art has becoming more diverse. Conventional art appreciation no longer covers all the debates and issues arising from the complex meaning of art in the modern world. Art education today must widen students' vision of art appreciation. Focus of discussion: The experience central to art appreciation relates one to a broad spectrum of interdisciplinary exposure. This paper aims to elucidate the close relationship between art and other disciplines including aesthetics, anthropology, history, social studies, and even science. It demonstrates how such integrated perspective can be conveyed to the students of different levels. Art appreciation, in many ways, is the study of human behaviours and experience, both past and present. Cross-disciplinary knowledge and comparative studies of various art help understand the meaning of art both in its microscopic and macroscopic levels. Arguments: Conventional art education focuses on the intrinsic values of art, having well defined objects to study for their artistic qualities and theoretical bases. Today, the world of art has lost much of its autonomy. The paper argues that we can take art as a way of seeing and therefore will be better understood by relating art to its social, historical and cultural context. An interdisciplinary approach to art appreciation will widen students' perspective of and sensitivity to the meaning of art, and could be attained by students of different levels. Conclusion: The interdisciplinary vision of art appreciation accords with the vision of Liberal Studies. It enhances students' analytical and critical thinking, broadens their world of ideas, and hones their judgement of cultural products and related issues. (Contains 16 footnotes.)

AB  - In the present article, we will reflect on some didactic challenges and possibilities that emerge when teaching in interdisciplinary settings, and we will use and discuss the journey as a metaphor for learning. We argue that teaching in interdisciplinary studies rests on movements between different understandings, and that it gives ample opportunities for beneficial learning processes. This does not only apply to interdisciplinary studies. The metaphor of taking a journey can be used to illustrate the learning process and the dimension of personal change associated with moving between different understandings and discourses of knowledge. Some of the questions we will raise are: In what ways can differing disciplinary backgrounds be of help or create a hindrance? What are the specific didactic challenges one faces? What happens to one's understanding of one's own subject after having been confronted with something new and different?

The artwork involves communities and educational institutions across the country, healthcare professionals, engineers, urban planners, and expert environmental and biological scientists. It is a national collaborative effort to acquire Congressional support for resolving the lead polluted soil problem within the city of New Orleans and raise national and global awareness of this continued oversight in many cities throughout the world. The Fundred Dollar Bill Project is an excellent example of social justice, giving children a political voice in the form of a donated Fundred drawing, an expression of their concern and empathy for lead-poisoned children.

AB  - Like many other teachers, the author always looks for a way to enliven a lesson--a new twist, a different perspective, a novel resource. The slogan of the NCSS convention held in Atlanta, Georgia, in 2009 was, "Dreams and Deeds: The Civic Mission of Schools," and this article provides "how to" ideas, easy, high-interest opportunities to make that happen in one's classroom. The author presents census resources that will help teachers turn classroom dreams into deeds, inform their students about the census and how it affects their community, and help them teach the curriculum.

AB  - This article addresses the perceived gap between the humanities and social sciences, and the sciences in kinesiology faculties and departments as interdisciplinary pressures mount in an increasingly complex world. I use an historical lens to highlight past difficulties in working across the two solitudes and describe Stephen Jay Gould's efforts to mend the gap. Likening the humanities to the cunning fox and science to the persistent hedgehog, he argued that with care the two seeming opposites can be unified. I discuss how kinesiologists might follow his advice in developing more fertile collaborative interdisciplinary approaches in research, teaching, and professional training and provide some suggestions for mechanisms that might enhance the benefits of working together to bridge the divide. I conclude that we had better seek productive ways--in mutual respect and frequent conversations--to stick together in our broad and useful diversity. (Contains 13 notes.)

AB  - The higher education regulation process in Europe, known as the Bologna Process, has involved many changes, mainly in relation to methodology and assessment. The paper given below relates to implementing the new EU study plans into the Teacher Training College of Vitoria-Gasteiz; it is the first interdisciplinary paper written involving teaching staff and related to the Teaching Profession module, the first contained in the structure of the new plans. The coordination of teaching staff is one of the main lines of work in the Bologna Process, which is also essential to develop the right skills and maximise the role of students as an active learning component. The use of active, interdisciplinary methodologies has opened up a new dimension in universities, requiring the elimination of the once componential, individual structure, making us look for new areas of exchange that make it possible for students' training to be developed jointly.

Course development was informed by stakeholder theory. Videotaped interviews with 46 stakeholder representatives were integrated into the course, providing students with an "insider" perspective on the challenges and rewards of assuming a responsible approach to advertising and promotion. Student learning was evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively. Findings suggest that students engaged in critically reflective thought about the complexities inherent in responsible decision making related to advertising and promotion, including the potential effects of such decisions on varied stakeholders.

AB  - The aim of the present paper is to provide an overview of the so-called "Spanglish" phenomenon and its linguistic repertoires (code-switching utterances). We propose that it is necessary to link all different forms of analysis in order to verify hypotheses regarding the relationship among social, linguistic, and cognitive processes behind "Spanglish". We argue that "Spanglish" consists of mixed utterances that result from the contact between two languages: Spanish and English. The characteristics of the contact situation separate "Spanglish" from pidgins and creoles. Zentella (1997) claims that those characteristics do not fit into a second language acquisition setting either, since the code-switching of Spanish-English bilinguals is different from the transfer-laden speech of second-language learners. However, there is debate regarding "Spanglish" being either a popular/colloquial Spanish variety within the United States (Otheguy 2009) or part of a more anthropological linguistic entity that corresponds to social formation (Zentella 2008). After years of research (Myers-Scotton 2002; Poplack 1980), the questions concerning the identification of grammatical constraints governing code-switching remain unanswered. Methodologies are changing toward a more comprehensive multilayered approach aimed at a better understanding of how "Spanglish" functions. Interdisciplinary approaches are highlighted in the paper when identifying future venues of research. (Contains 7 notes.)

AB  - This study reports the outcomes of undergraduate students completing a pilot Interdisciplinary Intensive Course Abroad (IICA) with a service learning component. The IICA model is comprised of a three-part sequence of study that includes a seven-week course on campus, followed by three weeks of study abroad, and a summative seven-week course back on campus. The additional summative component gives students the opportunity to bring together their newly acquired knowledge and skills, and to reflect on how to integrate these experiences in their future. The sequence integrates discipline-specific content studies with foreign language classes, and grounds them with a study abroad experience. A mixed-method design was used to measure students' development of language skills, understanding of multicultural education concepts, and intercultural skills. Primary data sources were pre/post-assessments, student field notes and reflections, and a post-course survey. Results indicated that students gained confidence in their Spanish skills and were likely to enroll in further Spanish courses, their ability to define multicultural education concepts increased, and service learning, homestays abroad, and their time in an indigenous reservation contributed to development of intercultural skills.

AB  - The booming digital-content industry has resulted in an increasing number of e-learning Internet websites that provide online learning services. Recommendations for learning sites are used by diverse learners to identify the most appropriate learning resources. However, research into recommendations about learning has concentrated primarily on suggestions for teaching materials to be used in a particular learning program, and studies have focused on improving the techniques underlying these recommendations without addressing the possibilities for interdisciplinary learning or changes in learner preferences. This study implemented and evaluated a system that recommends interdisciplinary pedagogical resources while recognizing changes in the foci of educational efforts and interests. This system was designed to satisfy individualized learning demands by recommending the most suitable content within an interactive context. Evaluations of learners' attitudes and intentions after using the proposed system revealed widespread acceptance. Data analysis demonstrated that system stability and interface satisfaction were the key factors in learners' attitudes. Indeed, interface satisfaction was the strongest predictor of recommendation accuracy and content satisfaction. (Contains 4 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - Following collaboration between two chemistry lecturers and an academic developer an attempt was made to enhance the learning of students within a chemistry module through the adaptation of the delivery of content material. This paper reports a piece of practitioner led research which considered how effective the approach developed was upon the level of student understanding and the process through which this occurred. The module delivery was altered from an emphasis on the transmission of knowledge through a traditional lecture format, to rotating small group problem based sessions and the use of concept maps. Student feedback and higher grades achieved appear to demonstrate it was effective.

AB  - This paper aims to explore democratic values in higher education pedagogies, as related to an Early Childhood Studies (ECS) degree course in an English university. It seeks to find out what constitutes a multi-disciplinary course from both student and tutor perspectives. It is contextualised by the concepts of participation embedded in the idea of multi-professional team work, in order to establish how these ideas could contribute a strong ethical focus to the concept of multidisciplinary study. The study was designed within the paradigm of participatory action research and findings suggest that, although students make links between different disciplinary discourses, tutors feel that their professional identity and knowledge can be constrained by the course structure. The paper suggests that more work needs to be done on the validation of early childhood courses to allow opportunities for multi-professional working to be modelled.

AB  - Early identification and treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children younger than age 3 years is becoming an increasingly common area of concern and study. Research suggests that systematic, early intervention can significantly improve outcomes and reduce the cost of caring for children with ASD through the lifespan. Therefore, it is imperative that evidence-based practices (EBPs) for this young age group are translated effectively into community settings. One method of promoting EBPs and developing capacity for implementation is active collaboration between researchers and community stakeholders. This requires a precise understanding of the perspectives of stakeholders regarding the benefits and barriers of specific practices and early intervention in general. In the current study, we gathered feedback from families and a multidisciplinary group of community providers regarding early intervention values for infants/toddlers at risk for ASD and their families through focus groups. The opinions and values of the community sample were examined using mixed qualitative and quantitative methods to facilitate efforts to build long-term capacity for implementing efficacious ASD intervention for children younger than 3 years. Results indicated that, the values of community providers and parents were highly similar and were aligned with EBP strategies. Recommendations for translating EBPs for this population into community settings are discussed.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine undergraduate students' satisfaction levels through learning with peers. Specifically, students from two departments were brought into a collective group activity to understand whether they experienced different levels of satisfaction by working with peers from a different department. Data gathered from a sample of 47 Science Education (SE) and 72 Computer Education and Instructional Technology (CEIT) students during the fall 2011 semester. Students overall were highly satisfied. Students of the two departments did not significantly differ from each other in terms of satisfaction. That means they equally enjoyed the activity. There were six themes that were identified that cause satisfaction in this interprofessional work: Performing responsibilities, socialization, cohesion, work habits, learning in general, and professional development. The most prominent theme was cohesion, and it emerged out of mostly positive but also negative student opinions. The least prominent was professional development and it was mainly expressed as a positive theme. It is argued that students do not articulate the scope of the study as much as they can. It is also argued that the nature of the assigned task let them consider the social aspects more than the other aspects.
