AB  - Environmental education promotes the use of higher-order thinking skills, encourages informal experiences in school as well as outdoors and brings together children and adults in order to make a contribution to the environment. Its holistic nature, that encompasses various subject matters, learning environments and teaching methods and encourages cognitive, affective and behavioural outcomes, requires the implementation of an appropriate assessment framework. In this study the author introduced a complex assessment method that encompasses pre, in- and after-course assessments and incorporates instruments that assess knowledge, reasoning, decision-making and the active involvement of 27 senior pre-service science and technology teachers who participated in an environmental education course. Findings indicate that the multiple assessment modes employed expressed a wide range of learning in the course. The team investigation project was found to be most suitable for developing environmental awareness, as well as inquiry skills. Self and peer assessment enhanced critical thinking and continuous discussion. The students acknowledged the complex assessment method as a possible model for an assessment framework which corresponds to the unique nature of learning in environmental education. The assessment framework introduced included aspects of environmental knowledge as well as awareness, skills, attitudes, values and practical involvement and addressed most of the courses basic ideas and components.

AB  - The National Standards for Arts Education encourages teachers to help students make connections between music and other disciplines. Many state curriculum guides likewise encourage educators to integrate curricula and find common ground between different subjects. Music--particularly vocal music--offers ample opportunities to find relationships with historical events, diverse cultures, and the humanities in general. It may not be so easy, however, to find relationships among music, mathematics, and science. Teachers sometimes boast that "music teaches math" in counting rhythms or learning the fractional nature of note values. While partially true, this connection between music and mathematics is superficial when compared to the real scientific and mathematical basis for music--musical acoustics.

AB  - Issues of older adults are often ill-structured and complex, requiring the application of insights from different disciplines to be adequately addressed. Gerontology has often used a multidisciplinary rather than an integrated interdisciplinary approach. Interdisciplinary and problem-based learning (PBL) provide pedagogical tools which teach gerontology students skills for understanding and resolving gerontological issues. The paper presents the concepts of interdisciplinarity and problem-based learning, the types of interdisciplinarity (interdisciplinarity at micro and macro levels of analysis, interdisciplinarity with different attributes of the same unit of analysis), learning outcomes of interdisciplinarity and problem-based learning, the incorporation of interdisciplinary problem-based learning in academic programs, steps of interdisciplinary problem-based study of a gerontological issue, and directions for the future study of this approach.

AB  - This article derives from the experience of teaching an asynchronous web-based course, Communicating with Older Persons with Alzheimer's Disease, taught by a multidisciplinary team of three faculty. The students also were multidisciplinary with diverse cultural and educational backgrounds and varied professional experience with older adults. Our aim in this paper is to demonstrate how the course was improved by the diversity of the faculty and students. We consider the students' diverse educational backgrounds, professional experience, personal experiences, and finally, cultural backgrounds. The class discussions and interactions were strengthened by the exchange of knowledge and varied perspectives applied to the course materials as each student applied his or her own educational background and professional and personal experiences to the various topics and readings discussed throughout the course. We demonstrate how the diversity in terms of each of these characteristics enhanced the class discussions by providing examples from the students' actual course postings.

AB  - The field of gifted education is very complex, covering broad and deep conceptual terrain. Insights about giftedness and talent are available from diverse academic disciplines and at multiple levels of analysis. These levels are captured in an interpretive framework that moves from the macrolevels of broad sociopolitical, cultural, and economic contexts through the levels of the immediate classroom context and psychology of the individual to the microlevels of organic structure, microbiology and the subatomic realm. From each level examples of insights of possible relevance to gifted education are provided as illustrations of the potential an interdisciplinary and interlevel search has for expanding the conceptual foundations of the field.

AB  - A continuing debate in the field of education asks whether music should be taught as a separate discipline, having value in and of itself, or in conjunction with other subjects, valued only to the extent that it complements the learning of other material. Many contend that music is a frill and that its inclusion in a high school curriculum can be justified only to the degree that it enhances learning in general and raises standardized test scores in more "highly valued" areas (math, English, science, and social studies). When the economic situation of a locally regulated school district creates hardships, music and art programs are usually the first to be cut. This article discusses how music and social studies have many natural connections that teachers can use to enhance learning in both subjects. Included is a list of online lesson plans and 15 notes.

AB  - This article demonstrates that interdisciplinary alliances on environmental education projects can effectively address the gap between complex environmental problems in the real world and disciplinary curricula in a university. We describe an alliance between an advanced communication course and a general science course wherein we addressed interconnections of energy efficiency, economics, and global climate change with respect to their impact on individuals, local businesses, and society. This project established that an interdisciplinary environmental project focused on local solutions to global problems is both a valuable learning tool for students and an effective method of accelerating the application of appropriate technologies.

AB  - The interest to improve the quality of teaching in higher education has led to the involvement of a group of faculty members at the University of Granada Faculty of Education in an Action-Research (A-R) experience titled "Towards a model of collaborative lecture throughout the analysis of their educational tasks." This has been an interdisciplinary experience because faculties from the Curriculum & Instruction, Body Expression and Music Education Departments have been involved on this project. In this paper our interest is concentrated on the students' participation in class. We consider participation an essential ingredient for teaching which determines the communication between faculties and students and lead the teaching-learning process in a collaborative way. As in the A-R project, at the end we raise proposals to improve our teaching. (Contains 1 footnote.)

AB  - This article features the workshop titled Exploring New Environments, developed by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's DESTINY Traveling Science Learning Program. Exploring New Environments is a teacher professional development model based on the idea that teachers are also learners who thrive when given the means and encouragement to explore fresh intellectual worlds. Teachers can creatively use what they learn to increase their students' interest in and understanding of science. The author also features DESTINY, a pre-college program that promotes equity of access to high-quality science education for all students. Science teachers are DESTINY's primary focus. The program sought to involve teachers of other disciplines in the process of science education. It initiated its interdisciplinary approach with Frankenstein's Fingerprints, a module that deals with genetics, scientific discovery and ethics, and students' critical-thinking skills. Workshops such as Exploring New Environments have the potential to garner nonscience collaborators for science teachers and also can encourage and prepare nonscience teachers to independently reinforce scientific content in their classrooms.

AB  - What happens when an old farmstead, native tall-grass prairie, and middle school students are mixed together? Would one guess learning? That is exactly what is happening in Fergus Falls, Minnesota, where students from a rural middle school have joined with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to restore native tallgrass prairie. In the process, the lines between traditional subject areas are blurring as the local environment becomes the context for integrating science, math, and writing. Growing out of a dream of developing a school located on the prairie where children learn about the natural environment, this partnership is proving that integrated science makes sense. Today, 100 students attend school daily at the Prairie Wetlands Learning Center (PWLC), a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service site. These students, known as the Prairie Science Class, are discovering that using their local environment helps learning come alive and brings new meaning to their study of basic subject areas.

AB  - Successful inclusion of very young children with disabilities in natural environments requires professionals to have specialized skills including: collaboration with the child's parents and caregivers and other professionals, ecologically valid assessment of the child within the context of his or her natural environment, and the design of an individualized program within the routines of the child's inclusive settings. To provide preservice preparation for graduate students focused on full inclusion of young children with disabilities, a collaborative interdisciplinary program was developed. Components of the program included (a) interdisciplinary course work, (b) competency-based seminars, and (c) and an interdisciplinary practicum providing opportunities for students to implement inclusion focused knowledge and skills.

AB  - This study explores "integration", the gathering of multiple disciplines of study into a curricular whole, and "interdisciplinarity", the inclusion of multiple disciplines, in the agricultural college at a land-grant university. We also evaluate the importance that employers place on student abilities to integrate information across disciplines. Interdisciplinary education is important because it provides undergraduates with a balanced educational experience and prepares them to face increasingly more complex and global issues. Survey questionnaires were administered to undergraduate students and faculty advisors in the college of Agricultural sciences and Natural resources at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and to potential employers in agriculture-related fields. Results indicated that employers placed broad knowledge and the ability to integrate information above technical skills. In turn, students chose employment potential as a prime motivator for selection of their majors and minors. Advisors reported that they frequently used interdisciplinary methods in courses, but did not believe the same happened in courses taught by other faculty. Further, the surveys revealed that students perceived the influence of advisors in their choice of majors and minors as minimal. We conclude that interdisciplinary education should receive higher priority in the undergraduate curriculum in agriculture because it is important in student preparation for a more diversified workplace. Such a focus for undergraduates would help to develop the qualities of broad knowledge and integration ability sought by today's employers. (Contains 9 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - The use of racial variables in genetic studies has become a matter of intense public debate, with implications for research design and translation into practice. Using research on smoking as a springboard, the authors examine the history of racial categories, current research practices, and arguments for and against using race variables in genetic analyses. The authors argue that the sociopolitical constructs appropriate for monitoring health disparities are not appropriate for use in genetic studies investigating the etiology of complex diseases. More powerful methods for addressing population structure exist, and race variables are unacceptable as gross proxies for numerous social/environmental factors that disproportionately affect minority populations. The authors conclude with recommendations for genetic researchers and policymakers, aimed at facilitating better science and producing new knowledge useful for reducing health disparities.

AB  - Thirty years ago, leaders in psychiatry expressed hope for more interdisciplinary collaboration with family therapy. Since then marriage and family therapy (MFT) has entered the mainstream of clinical practice in psychiatry and psychology. It is mandated for training in psychiatry and psychology. We propose a model for collaboration, training, and treatment in interdisciplinary mental health settings that strives to integrate empirical bodies of knowledge in MFT, psychiatry, and psychology and to provide a usable and testable clinical approach to treatment. It can be taught to trainees with various or limited training in MFT. This model delineates nine critical domains that guide treatment. Flexibility is central to this model, focusing on techniques and clinical methods based on empirically supported treatments, when available, and best-practice standards.

AB  - As the current trend in healthcare education moves towards interdisciplinary curriculum, the University of New England has initiated an integrated interdisciplinary health and healing approach to training future practitioners. As part of the process, a committee of representatives from seven healthcare disciplines has endeavored to provide on-campus faculty development for community-based faculty. The seminars explore universal themes in healthcare education as well as promote the concept of integrated interdisciplinary collaboration. Over a two-year span, the committee has developed into a standing committee in the governance structure of the University, has organized biannual seminars and surveyed the participants. The authors discuss a model for seminar development, group process, types of seminars offered, results of a participant's survey, and the need for administrative support to sustain a long-term relationship with clinical faculty.

AB  - A significant challenge in the field of early childhood special education is providing qualified personnel to serve young children with special needs and their families. Though many personnel development programs acknowledge the need for interdisciplinary preparation of diverse students who are culturally competent, faculty and trainees continue to search for strategies to address these recommended practices. The purpose of this article is to share practical ideas and specific features that can help personnel development programs prepare students in an interdisciplinary, multicultural context. Specific strategies presented were identified and successfully implemented through a special program at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, the "Diverse Urban Interdisciplinary Teams (DUIT)" project. The primary components of the model were: (1) a seminar that included activities for interdisciplinary teaming and a family mentoring experience; and (2) an interdisciplinary course with a fieldwork placement. The activities and content for each component were developed by faculty from early childhood special education, communication sciences and disorders, occupational therapy, and a parent of a child with a disability.

AB  - This article describes a successful project that demonstrates the effective practice of two important trends in art education today: (1) creating space for art education that is informed by scholarship on community-based pedagogy and environmental design; and (2) collaborating to achieve more comprehensive learning outcomes. The project was a 6-month collaboration between students in the Architecture Department and the Arts and Administration Program at the University of Oregon. I believe that this collaboration experiment, while rather small in scope, can serve as a model for more complex interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary projects. (Contains 2 endnotes.)

AB  - U.S. high school graduates for whom the home language is not English run the risk of inadequate preparation for the rigors of higher education. Whether this poor preparation is the result of disruptions caused by the transition to a new country/language/culture, or of a watered-down high school curriculum that reacts to language error but does not always help the student develop a rich academic literacy, there is a need for courses and assignments that acknowledge the strengths of multilingual writers and that build fluency and academic literacy in ways that allow students to make meaningful connections with the college curriculum. This article describes a pilot ethnographic research course, life history project designed in collaboration with a professor in Family Social Science and two ESL basic writing instructors.

AB  - In a report entitled "Reshaping the Graduate Education of Scientists and Engineers" (National Academy of Sciences, 1995), the Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy proposed a modified PhD training model that retains an emphasis on intensive research experiences, while incorporating additional experiences to prepare graduates for an increasingly diverse job market. The National Science Foundation (NSF) subsequently instituted the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program to foster interdisciplinary training of doctoral students. Faculty in kinesiology graduate programs are often well positioned to contribute to such interdisciplinary training programs. We highlight an example of such a program, specifically the NSF IGERT program on Musculoskeletal and Neural Adaptations in Form and Function at Arizona State University. Both benefits and challenges of IGERT participation are considered. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - Emotional intelligence and emotion work are two research areas traditionally presented as distinct. This article reviews their definitions, examines their intersections, and illustrates the advantage of approaching emotion research from an interdisciplinary framework. Conclusions address the following: (a) An employee's emotional intelligence or cognitive abilities cannot be assessed or developed without an understanding of the context or emotion work rules; (b) an employee's emotional intelligence provides the foundational ability to perceive the display rules within a given job context or situation; (c) emotion work cannot be performed well without possessing a foundation of emotional intelligence. Those responsible for employee development must help the employee develop cognitive abilities and knowledge about contextual emotional expression rules. Implications for human resource development address ways professionals can utilize this interdisciplinary perspective in research and practice and the importance of developing both cognitive abilities and contextual knowledge about emotions to help employees develop emotional intelligence and perform emotion work.

AB  - Objective: This study explored challenges and barriers that need to be addressed in a preprofessional educational setting to provide opportunities for boundary spanning that leads to family-centred interdisciplinary service provision. Design: The design employed in this study was participatory action research, an inductive approach. Setting: The study took place during a semester-long, one-credit elective graduate seminar course. Method: The study included five faculty members and eight graduate students from the fields of audiology, speech-language pathology, and rehabilitation counselling. Data gathering techniques used included observation, dialogue, and reflection. Results: Three themes were identified as important in providing an environment conducive to collaboration between professionals and families, namely: (1) the need for acceptance of differing perspectives; (2) empowerment and its contribution to the process of inquiry; and (3) self-awareness in the learning process and the resultant increase in awareness of others. Conclusion: While all participants confirmed the importance of trust, empowerment, low risk, and clear definition of process goals, both faculty and students found it extremely difficult to break out of their familiar routines. Given how difficult it was to surface and test assumptions in this context, these findings provided insight into the challenges interdisciplinary teams will face when they try to work with families as equals in the treatment decision-making process.

AB  - This article summarizes the design, implementation, and current status of an undergraduate interdisciplinary leadership studies minor at Morehouse College. The college's primary mission is to "develop men with disciplined minds who will lead lives of leadership, service, and self-realization," as well as provide students with an understanding of the African American heritage and cultural experience. The leadership studies minor was designed as a place within the academic curriculum of the college program for students to learn about and reflect upon the study, practice, and interdisciplinary nature of leadership, its theoretical and historical foundations, and explore critical ethical leadership challenges that impact civil society with special emphasis on issues as they relate to African Americans, their heritage, and their cultural experience. Program results to date and the future of the minor in the college's academic curriculum are also discussed.

AB  - Two educators recount critical dilemmas in the development of a secondary level interdisciplinary teaching team, discussing three phases in the development of the team: consolidated, laissez-faire, and shared power. Lessons learned include: it is difficult, if not impossible, to separate issues of interpersonal relations from substantive team issues; teachers must clarify their models of teaching and learning; and the evolution of effective teacher teams is time demanding.
