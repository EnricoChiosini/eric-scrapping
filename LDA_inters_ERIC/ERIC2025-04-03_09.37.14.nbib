AB  - The increasing importance of computer assisted language learning (CALL) in second language (L2) classes has added a new dimension to L2 research, and it has challenged scholars to find valid research methods and theoretical frameworks that can be applied in the analysis of the linguistic and social aspects of the interaction among students and instructors in CALL. Even though researchers have proposed frameworks based on theories of discourse analysis for the investigation of student-computer interaction (Chapelle, 1990), instructors have been mostly disregarded. In order to fully understand the impact of CALL on L2 learning, it is important to investigate teachers' interpretive and theoretical frameworks, and the institutional and pedagogical factors that might contribute to promote or hinder their implementation of CALL. This article proposes a multidisciplinary research framework -- integrating three theories from cultural psychology, linguistics, and sociology -- that allows researchers to address these issues. In addition, Markee's (1997) model for analysis of curricular innovation is incorporated as a component to determine if the use of CALL in L2 classes truly constitutes a curricular innovation and the role that instructors may play in this outcome. A concrete example of an existing study based on the framework is also presented.

AB  - This research employs a multi-disciplinary approach by developing a model that draws upon psychometric, cultural, and reflexive modernization perspectives of risk perception. Using data from a 1999 national telephone survey, we tested our model on three food risks ? pesticides, Salmonella, and fat. Results showed that perceptions of risks do vary by the nature of the risk investigated. Consistent with the psychomatic perspective, the level of knowledge and control varied by risk, but these differences did not correspond with levels of concern. Worldview variables were correlated with perceptions of pesticides, indicating the relevance of cultural approaches. High levels of concern associated with each food risk, and the robustness of the relationship between trust and the perception of food risks, raise the possibility that trust acts as a coping mechanism, which is consistent wit the reflexive modernization approach. Knowledge and trust were significantly related to all three risks.

AB  - The requirements engineering course is a core component of the curriculum for the Master's in Software Engineering programme, at Monmouth University (MU). It covers the process, methods and tools specific to this area, together with the corresponding software quality issues. The need to produce software engineers with strong teamwork and communication skills, capable of working in multidisciplinary teams, has been stressed repeatedly by industry world-wide. This paper reports on the multidisciplinary and active/collaborative approaches used in teaching requirements engineering at MU. To reinforce the concepts learned, students actively participate in their learning as they play different roles for eliciting requirements, or share their particular expertise with their teams when performing object-oriented analysis. The multidisciplinary experiment brought together software engineering and business management students. They collaborated to produce a software requirements specification for managerial processes involved in hiring and performance evaluation of employees within a firm. A description of the synchronization of the lectures with project deliverables in the two courses, different types of communication needed by students, positive interdependence of the teams across disciplines, and how they contributed to the success of the project will be discussed among other multidisciplinary issues encountered during this experiment.

AB  - As the evidence of the benefits of multidisciplinary education accumulates many schools and instructors are finding ways of hybridizing courses to include substantial components of what are otherwise distinct sciences. Often, such course development is done with an eye toward industry, which requires a workforce capable of synthesizing varied fields of information. The biotech industry is on the forefront of this movement, and its requirements are pushing universities to educate students to be fluent in multiple sciences (Dahms 2001). In particular, the author states that a bridge is urgently needed between the biomedical/biotechnology and the mechanical engineering disciplines (Schrof 1999) to facilitate the development of improved medical devices and safer surgical procedures and for the characterization of biotissues and biotransport processes. In this article, a course integrating the fields of engineering and biology was developed to teach students to solve real-world problems that included aspects from both disciplines. Computer simulations were also developed and carried out, and findings were presented in a formal report format. Thus, the author states that such courses encourage interdepartmental cooperation between students and provide a broad view of the multidisciplinary nature of scientific exploration.

AB  - Context: Health care disparities are well documented for people living in rural areas and for people who are members of ethnic minorities. Purpose: Our goal was to determine whether providers report greater difficulty in providing care for rural than urban residents and for ethnic minorities than patients/clients in general in 4 practice areas of ethical relevance: attaining treatment adherence, assuring confidentiality, establishing therapeutic alliance, and engaging in informed consent processes. Methods: We received survey responses from 1,558 multidisciplinary medical and behavioral providers across rural and non-rural areas of New Mexico and Alaska in 2004 to assess a wide range of issues in providing health care. Findings: Providers reported some difficulties in fulfilling various ethical practices for all types of patients, but not more difficulty when caring for minority compared to nonminority patients/clients. However, they do report more frequent additional problems related to the practice issues of treatment adherence, therapeutic alliance, informed consent, and confidentiality with minority patients than others. Difficulties and more frequent additional problems are greater for providers in rural than in non-rural areas. Results generalize across both Alaska and New Mexico with few differences. Conclusions: We obtained evidence for disparity in care for patients/clients who were minority group members, and clear evidence of disparity for people residing in rural compared to non-rural areas of 2 states with large rural areas.

AB  - In this article, I propose that at the juncture of disciplines, the mind is involved in at least 3 cognitive activities: overcoming internal monologism or monodisciplinarity, attaining provisional integration, and questioning the integration as necessarily partial. This claim is supported by interview data I collected primarily from faculty involved in the development and teaching of interdisciplinary courses in programs including the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics, Swarthmore College's Interpretation Theory, and the NEXA Program at San Francisco State University. I suggest that interdisciplinary thinking is fundamentally similar to dialogical exchanges occurring in language and in collaborative activities in which epistemological positions are bartered. Bakhtin's (1981) theory of dialogic understanding and subsequent linguistic theories of conceptual metaphor and blending serve as a constructive theoretical framework for the understanding of interdisciplinary cognition. Viewing disciplines broadly as languages, epistemologies, and collaborative practices helps uncover some underlying cognitive mechanisms that deserve further investigation.

The Paula and Anthony Rich Center for the Study and Treatment of Autism at Youngstown State University was established to improve the lives of individuals with autism by providing education, research, and support to professionals and families. A professor of FCS, who serves as Academic Coordinator for The Rich Center, facilitates, through a mini-grant fund, faculty involvement with The Rich Center. Collaboration has occurred among disciplines, academic departments, community agencies, faculty, and students. Examples of this interdisciplinary approach are presented.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the transdisciplinary case study (TCS) as a learning framework based on what we call functional socio-cultural constructivism and project-based learning (PBL). In doing so, the paper attempts to illustrate the applicability of TCS to learn competencies and skills necessary to research problems of sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach: TCS is considered a learning framework based on the principle of self-regulated learning; i.e. students must actively deal with the requirements as well as plan and execute their project work within their own worldviews and goals. TCS methods are essential as we tackle complex real-world problems. Findings: The paper discusses challenges and obstacles of such an approach and present lessons learned since 1994, on both the viewpoints of students and of teachers. It conclude that case study learning is a demanding task, especially in a transdisciplinary context where more challenges emerge than in PBL, since goals of teachers, case agents, and students have to be balanced. Practical implications: TCS or courses like it are important for universities at the present time. Under present budget restrictions and a wide-ranging mistrust of society toward universities, there is a necessity for a new contract between society and research: students should learn to take over responsibility in societal contexts and be able to communicate beyond the "ivory tower." Originality/value: The learning goals of TCS differ from the goals of most university courses. They are more comprehensive and include complex problem solving, societal context, and group processes. The ambitious goal is that students become enabled to tackle complex, real-world problems. (Contains 5 figures, 1 table, and 2 notes.)

AB  - Providing effective food safety education to young consumers is a national health priority to combat the nearly 76 million cases of foodborne illness in the United States annually. With the tremendous pressures on teachers for accountability in core subject areas, the focus of classrooms is on covering concepts that are tested on state performance examinations. As a result, topics such as food safety are rarely addressed in middle school classrooms. Middle school is an ideal time to teach food safety because adolescents are in the process of setting lifelong behaviors; therefore, they are more likely to synthesize new food safety knowledge in a way that will lead to the development of lifelong behaviors. The purpose of this study was to scientifically validate an educational resource that provides a method for classroom teachers to involve young consumers in food safety education while meeting state content area curriculum standards. An interdisciplinary curriculum targeted at middle school students and correlated directly to state content standards was designed to include highly effective instructional strategies that teach food safety concepts through all core subject classes (science, math, social studies, and language arts). The curriculum was pilot tested in 5 schools using a pretest, posttest, and follow-up test assessment model. The results showed that the curriculum was highly effective at raising student knowledge (21% gain) and improving students' food handling behaviors (8.47% gain) from pretests to posttests. In addition, 6 wk after implementation, students retained 86% of their total knowledge gain as measured by a follow-up assessment.

AB  - The authors have developed and field-tested high school-level curricular materials that guide students to use biology, mathematics, and physics to understand plankton and how these tiny organisms move in a world where their intuition does not apply. The authors chose plankton as the focus of their materials primarily because the challenges faced by plankton are novel problems to most students, forcing adoption of new perspectives and making the study of plankton exciting. Additional reasons that they chose plankton to focus on include their ecological importance, their availability to most teachers and students, the ease with which they can be collected and observed, and the current focus of some scientific researchers on their movement and behavior. These curricular materials include a series of inquiry-based,  hands-on exercises designed to be accessible to students with a range of backgrounds. Many of these materials could be adapted for use by middle-school, and/or college-level students. In this article, the authors describe sample lessons, summarize what worked well, and flag obstacles they encountered while integrating mathematics and physics into the biology classroom.

AB  - Interdisciplinary health care training is advocated by numerous government and philanthropic organizations. Educators in the health professions are increasingly offering training in interdisciplinary health care in a variety of contexts, including ambulatory settings. This paper describes a three-year program to teach skills in interdisciplinary care to learners from internal medicine, social work, pharmacy, and nursing in a geriatrics clinic at a major academic institution in the United States. Framed in a critical review of existing evidence for the effectiveness of interdisciplinary training and health care and expert recommendations, specific recommendations are made to educators interested in interdisciplinary training in ambulatory settings.

AB  - It has become widely accepted that the computer is an indispensable tool in the study of science and technology. Thus, in recent years curricular programs such as Industrial Technology and associated scientific disciplines have been adopting and adapting the computer as a tool in new and innovative ways to support teaching, learning, and research. Industrial Technology is a management-oriented technical curriculum built upon studies from a variety of disciplines related to manufacturing technology. Included are a sound knowledge and understanding of material and production processes; principles of distribution; and concepts of industrial management and human relations. The importance of readily available technology and supporting software, which has flexibility in design and usage, has become an integral component of technology curriculums. The flexibility of these computer systems and their peripherals provides opportunities for interdisciplinary studies that extend well beyond the traditional technology curriculum into broader areas of science and mathematics. The facilities and curriculum described in this article support the ongoing collaborative work of students and faculty from the disciplines of computer science, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and industrial technology.

AB  - This study describes the application of temperament styles to school-based mental health practice in an alternative school and illustrates how a multidisciplinary team consisting of a special education teacher, health educator, and social worker used temperament to maximize effective interactions with a student who had been placed in the school for violating the school district's code of conduct. This study demonstrates that by deconstructing complicated interactions in school, school social workers working in an interdisciplinary collaboration can promote a more productive and positive educational experience for students and families and improve the learning process.

AB  - This article describes a successful interdisciplinary collaboration among chemistry, humanities and English faculty members, who utilized poetry and artistic illustration to help students learn, appreciate, and enjoy chemistry. Students taking general chemistry classes were introduced to poetry writing and museum-type poster preparation during one class period. They were then encouraged to use their imagination and creativity to brainstorm and write chemistry poems or humors on the concepts and principles covered in the chemistry classes and artistically illustrate their original work on posters. The project, 2-3 months in length, was perceived by students as effective at helping them learn chemistry and express their understanding in a fun, personal, and creative way. The instructors found students listened to the directives because many posters were witty, clever, and eye-catching. They showed fresh use of language and revealed a good understanding of chemistry. The top posters were created by a mix of A-, B-, and C-level students. The fine art work, coupled with poetry, helped chemistry come alive on campus, providing an aesthetic presentation of materials that engaged the general viewer. (Contains 3 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - Professionals in the field of low vision are increasingly concerned about the paucity of optometry students who are expressing any interest in low vision as a clinical subspecialty. Concurrent with this apparent disinterest is an increased demand for these services as the baby boomer population becomes more predisposed to age-related vision loss. The authors of the present study conducted a qualitative survey to investigate ways to attract more young professionals into the field of low vision. The results of their survey revealed areas of concern including advertising, financial incentives, equipment and facility costs, relevance for practice, gaining experience, ageism stereotypes, role models, and start-up opportunities, and yielded several suggestions that training institutions around the globe could consider and implement to redress the situation.

AB  - Despite the general trend to embrace interdisciplinarity in post-secondary education, we remain remarkably unclear concerning what we mean by interdisciplinarity and how it is achieved. Reporting on research conducted in a team-taught interdisciplinary course, I propose a new way of conceptualizing interdisciplinary connections, grounded in Bakhtinian theories of language and cognition. I offer a three-part schema for identifying the discursive disciplinary resources individuals use to make interdisciplinary connections and identify some broad characteristics of writing assignments that appear to invite students to make connections among disciplines. Finally, I argue that reflection on certain types of interdisciplinary connections can be an extremely powerful resource for interdisciplinary as well as disciplinary thinking and learning. Assignments from the Interdisc II Sequence are appended. (Contains 1 note and 5 tables.)

AB  - Describes reconstruction, at the department level, of an Australian university policy away from norm-referenced assessment to criterion-referenced assessment. Action research methods were conducted including individual and focus group interviews, participant journals, and successive drafts of criteria and standards. Analysis suggested that the use of action learning appeared to assist participants to begin to own a "top-down" policy. (DB)

AB  - A review of child welfare research literature reveals that although multidisciplinary teams are increasingly used to investigate and intervene in child abuse and neglect cases, the field does not know enough about their structural variations, implementation processes, or effectiveness. Moreover, although articles advocating multidisciplinary teams enumerate their apparent strengths, they lack attention to the teams' possible weaknesses. The article discusses implications for future evaluation studies.

AB  - This paper explores appropriate disciplinary content for generalist sustainability degrees, based on two recent surveys. A questionnaire was used to extract from a multidisciplinary, largely academic audience--all of whom share an interest in sustainability--their views as to the disciplinary knowledge that a university-based sustainability education should include. This was undertaken because the current focus in sustainability education literature on generic skills and pedagogical method provides little insight to assist curriculum developers with disciplinary content. While the sample was limited, respondents came from a diverse group of disciplines and thus supply a broad perspective to curriculum design. Recommended teaching methods were also captured, for both undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as the academic backgrounds of the participants for the purposes of investigating bias. The findings were compared with curricula from existing Australian coursework programs and showed that a slight rebalancing towards the human sphere is necessary.

AB  - The United States Military Academy (USMA) provides cadets with the intellectual foundation that they will need to succeed as military officers. The abilities to shape the physical world and to lead others in doing so are important competences of an Army officer. Therefore, the study of engineering and technology is fundamental to the education of cadets at West Point and embodies an important goal of the Military Academy's academic program. The overarching goal of the USMA's academic program is for graduates to anticipate and respond effectively to the uncertainties of a changing technological, social, political, and economic world. The Engineering and Technology Goal Team, a multidisciplinary group of faculty, maintains principal ownership of the design and assessment of this goal. The team's work is supported and reviewed by faculty through the Assessment Steering Committee, the Curriculum Committee, and the dean. To measure cadets' achievement of the engineering and technology goal effectively, this team has articulated the standards of performance that the academy expects cadets to achieve. The assessment data suggests that USMA cadets and graduates generally achieve the standard set by the Engineering and Technology Goal Team.

AB  - This article provides educators at all levels with a theoretical rationale for place-conscious education; it also discusses pedagogical pathways, and institutional challenges, to place-consciousness. Drawing on insights from phenomenology, critical geography, bioregionalism, ecofeminism, and other place-conscious traditions, the author gathers diverse perspectives on "place" to demonstrate the profoundly pedagogical nature of human experience with places. Five "dimensions of place" are described that can shape the development of a socio-ecological, place-conscious education: (a) the perceptual, (b) the sociological, (c) the ideological, (d) the political, and (e) the ecological. After discussing these, the author reframes several place-conscious educational traditions. The article concludes with an analysis of the possibilities for place-conscious education in an era that defines institutional accountability by standards and testing. (Contains 27 notes.)

AB  - In this article, the author shares his experience in incorporating writing into a science curriculum and how to incorporate effective techniques in teaching vocabulary, proper word usage, and reading comprehension skills, all common in a typical English curriculum. As a young teacher, she thought interdisciplinary units had to be extensive, complicated, cotaught units that needed more time and energy to actually implement than the average mortal teacher possessed. However, through the help of an English teacher, she began to learn that interdisciplinary studies did not have to arise from labored sessions of searching for perfect matches between subjects, nor did they require extended, cotaught units. While there may be value in those approaches as well, there is also much to be gained by simple interactions, insertions, and combinations; and by the development of a common language and set of expectations.

AB  - This paper sets forth an interdisciplinary interpretation of social capital that will permit the concept to be used with precision in scholarly and scientific work. If the interpretation is accepted, the social capital concept cannot be regarded as a social theory, nor as a statement of normative goals. The interdisciplinary concept proposed here is applied to rural studies. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Since the ratification of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, both publicly traded companies and their respective financial statement auditors have struggled to comply with the requirements of the legislation. Utilizing three individual Delphi studies, separately, I surveyed partners, managers, and staff associates in the United States from each of the "Big 4" international accounting firms to ascertain from each respective group what knowledge domains and technical skills are most important in the practice of Sarbanes-Oxley-related information assurance compliance. Analysis of the data collected provided the basis for the development and subsequent implementation of a new interdisciplinary business curriculum in information assurance.

AB  - The debate about whether to include all kinds of students in the general education classrooms is a current topic in the European and Scandinavian educational policy. This paper comes to grips with this topic by focusing on the process through which professionals define educational possibilities and risks for one group of children considered as special needs children. The study is based on the transcripts of four Finnish interdisciplinary team meetings in which professionals and parents negotiate for the school choices of preschool-aged children with cochlear implants. Analysis of the data is based on the principles of qualitative discourse analytical methods of conversation. Results show that despite the presence of an inclusive ideal in the meetings, the realisation of the ideal cannot be fulfilled when an appeal is made to limitations in resources in general education or when referring to the lack of skills, fundamental differences or vulnerable personalities of particular children.

AB  - Standardized assessment in school systems has been the center of debate for decades. Although the voices of opponents of standardized tests have dominated the public forum, only a handful of scholars and practitioners have argued in defense of standardized tests. This article provides a critical synthesis of the controversial issues on state-mandated assessment of student achievement in the era of school accountability reform. By presenting an in-depth and balanced synthesis of published documents to date, this article critically reviews the 4 interlocking cornerstones of the reform's conceptual framework: assessment-driven reform, standards-based assessment, assessment-centered accountability, and high-stakes consequences. For each controversy, this article first presents the pro arguments that advocate the reform movement, followed by the con arguments that challenge the very core of the reform. The article then summarizes the debates by developing a critical synthesis of the available multidisciplinary evidence, including educational, psychometric, sociocultural, and neurocognitive research. The article concludes by proposing an action research agenda for stakeholders of different arenas and outlining future directions for standardized assessment in schools.

AB  - This article contains critical reflections of a multidisciplinary research group studying the human and technological dynamics around some newly offered electronic services in a specific rural area of Finland. For their research, the group adopted ethnography. On facing the challenges of doing ethnographic research in a multidisciplinary setting, the group evolved its own breed of research practice based on multiple forms of triangulation. This implied the use of multiple data sources, methods, theories, and researchers, in different combinations. One of the outcomes of the work is a model for collaborative research. It highlights, among others, the importance of creating a climate for collaboration within the research group and following a process of individual and collaborative writing to achieve the potential benefits of such research. The article also identifies a set of remaining challenges relevant to collaborative research. (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.)

The project provided a means of teaching the importance of geographical perspectives to nongeography students in an interdisciplinary learning environment. In a literature search that assessed nationwide trends, students identified a mixed outcome for Florida's urban areas. Through the research process, students learned the value of spatial concepts from geography in relation to other social science perspectives. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - Before 1950, history of science did not exist as an independent academic branch, but was instead pursued by practitioners across various humanities and scientific disciplines. After professionalization, traces of its prehistory as a cross-disciplinary area of interest bound to an interdisciplinary, educational philosophy have remained. This essay outlines the development of history of science as an interdisciplinary academic field, and argues that it constitutes an obvious choice for inclusion in an interdisciplinary academic program,  provided faculty and administrators learn how best to manage its advantages and pitfalls.

AB  - This study compared two configurations of sixth-grade students and core teachers to measure the students' perceived levels of social bonding with their peers, their school, and their teachers. One configuration featured a team of four teachers, each specializing in a core subject area and teaching this subject to all 100 students on the team. The other configuration featured a team of two teachers, both delivering multiple core curricula to 50 students. The researcher used three measures of social bonding to compare the two configurations--approximately 250 sixth graders in the 100-student/four-teacher configuration and approximately 250 sixth graders in the 50-student/two-teacher configuration. A sample of ten teaching teams was matched on size, SES, and percentage of minority students. A matched-paired set of t-tests was conducted for each measure of social bonding to determine the effect of interdisciplinary team organization. A comparison of the combined scores of the five schools of the 50-student/two-teacher configuration with the combined scores of the five schools of the 100-student/four-teacher configuration revealed that students' scores were significantly higher on all three measures of social bonding for students of the 50-student/two-teacher interdisciplinary teaching team configuration.

AB  - The research reported investigated the efficacy of intervention, developed by a speech-language therapist and implemented by a teacher, for the language and phonological awareness (PA) abilities of pre-school, socially disadvantaged children. One study established that children from low socio-economic (SES) backgrounds had poorer skills on both measures compared to children of average SES. Half of the low SES group received language and PA intervention programmes and their progress was compared to untreated SES matched controls. Both programmes were highly effective with post-intervention performance not only exceeding that of SES controls but also equalling the performance of controls of average SES.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss how long term risk prevention and civil protection may enter in university programs for environmental engineers and urban and regional planners. Design/methodology/approach: First the distinction between long term risk prevention and emergency preparedness is made, showing that while the first has entered in university programs the second is still considered too practical. The opposite is sustained by the author, providing as an argument the demand coming from the same civil protection officials who are aware of the capabilities that are required to face large emergencies. They want to learn how to make recourse to the large knowledge acquired in risk studies and to experiences and models so as to forecast the events potential development. Findings: The paper describes how this expertise has been enacted in special programs designed for EU and Italian professionals in the field of civil protection. The development of an external emergency plan for a hazardous installation in the vicinity of Bergamo (Italy) has been also described as a good example of training and knowledge acquirement in the field. Practical implications: The examples provided above show the importance of matching practical experience gained on the ground with theoretical approaches, enhancing the capabilities to recognise links among various systems as well as value different types of knowledge in a transdisciplinary fashion. Originality/value: The inevitable link between risk related issues and transdisciplinary approaches is discussed, indicating how a relatively new field of study may enter the academic arena, opening to new types of expertise and new forms of teaching.

AB  - In an interdisciplinary collaboration between the Computer & Information Technology (CIT) and Nursing (NSG) Departments at the Middletown and Hamilton regional campuses of Miami University (of Ohio), student team members created a Web-based application to create Electronic Nursing Notes. Students from the two departments worked together to design and develop the application, which will be used by the Nursing Department to teach their students. The NSG students were the customers and provided samples of a paper-based system currently used by the hospital where the nurses worked. From those samples, and with much interaction with the NSG students, the CIT students created the Electronic Nursing Notes application. In this article, we describe the project and present reactions from both the student team members and also the faculty team members. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and implementation of community-based, service-learning field projects by 30 health professional faculty fellows of Project MAINSTREAM, a faculty development program on substance abuse. The fellows worked together for two years in 10 Interdisciplinary Faculty Learning Groups (IFLGs), which consisted of three academics of different disciplines. The ten projects are viewed within the context of service-learning and are based on a balance between the provision of services to the community and furthering the learning objectives of Project MAINSTREAM.

AB  - This paper describes the use of undergraduate materials multidisciplinary research projects as a means of addressing the growing industrial demand for graduates experienced in working in multidisciplinary teams. It includes a detailed description of a project in which a multidisciplinary team of chemical engineering and civil engineering students analyzed the influence of epoxy selection and fireproofing on polymeric fiber-wrapped concrete members exposed to various heating cycles. Student activities included: identifying potential safety hazards, developing a detailed literature review, formulating a budget, planning and scheduling a year-long project, casting and wrapping concrete cylinders, designing the experimental plan, failure testing each cylinder, performing data analysis and developing conclusions regarding the processing variables. By combining their unique knowledge and abilities, the multidisciplinary team was able to resolve a technical problem that neither group could have solved independently.

AB  - This paper encourages the investigation of real world problems by students and faculty and links recommended student competencies with project based learning. In addition to the traditional course objectives, project-based learning (PBL) uses real world problems for classroom instruction and fieldwork to connect students, instructors, and industry mentors from several disciplines with the recommended professional competencies required of students entering a profession or career. The purpose and focus of this paper is to inform and enlighten, to instruct and educate, and to evoke industry and community interest by combining educational service value with an educational enterprising activity. The paper demonstrates how project-based learning objectives in the classroom integrate with industry recommended professional competencies in solving real world problems. Utilizing the extraordinary intellectual capital of students and faculty in a learning environment on college campuses allows projects to be arranged and managed in a manner that may also provide funding and grant opportunities. Project-based learning linked to recommended professional competencies is a contributing educational force that addresses the needs in communities, student life, and career choices.
