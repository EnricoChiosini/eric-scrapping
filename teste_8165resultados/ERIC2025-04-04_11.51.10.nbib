AB  - The authors examined the impact of 2 subsequent, longitudinal interdisciplinary interventions for 58 Hispanic English language learners (ELLs): (a) Grade 5 science with English language/reading embedded (i.e., science intervention) and (b) K-3 English language/reading with science embedded (i.e., language/reading intervention). Results revealed that (a) in the science intervention treatment ELLs outperformed their counterparts in English-reading fluency, knowledge of word meaning, and science and reading achievement; (b) in the language/reading intervention treatment ELLs continued to develop faster than their peers in English oracy, reading fluency, and comprehension; (c) ELLs benefited more from the science intervention if they received the prior language/reading intervention. We conclude that for ELLs, the integration of science and English language/reading should primarily focus on reading in elementary grades and science in Grade 5.

AB  - We are hereby presenting a didactic concept for an advanced lab course that focuses on the design of donor materials for organic solar cells. Its research-related and competence-based approach qualifies the students to independently and creatively apply computational methods and to profoundly and critically discuss the results obtained. The high degree of multidisciplinarity and the diversity of both the field of materials modeling and the students are considered within a modularized structure that allows the students to advance according to their individual abilities and interests. On the basis of our experience, through a hands-on format, it is possible to effectively capture the students' intrinsic interest in this research field and prepare them for their future work in academia and industry.

AB  - The goal of this study was to define the construct and establish the validity of disciplinary literacy, which has recently gained attention from the implementation of the Common Core State Standards (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices & Council of Chief State School Officers in Common Core State Standards for English language arts & literacy in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects [PDF]. Authors, Washington, DC, 2010). After defining disciplinary literacy in the four core disciplines of English language arts, science, history and social studies, and mathematics, scales were developed and administered to a snowball sample of professionals nationwide, with 857 respondents. The data showed evidence of disciplinary literacy as a multidimensional construct with three related factors: source literacy, analytic literacy, and expressive literacy. Based on EFA and CFA results, we can conclude that there are at least three types of literacy in operation among the four core disciplines. The three factors of literacy varied significantly by the four core disciplines of English/language arts (ELA), science, history and social studies, and mathematics, supporting the notion that each discipline uses literacy uniquely. This is the first study of its kind to attempt to define, quantify, and validate the construct of disciplinary literacy.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify disciplinary core ideas that should be included in secondary school agriscience programs using a panel of experts in agricultural education, and to create a matrix of disciplinary core ideas, Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources career pathways performance indicators, and the Next Generation Science Standards performance expectations. A panel of 117 experts identified a total of 162 disciplinary core ideas of STEM concepts inherent in the Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (AFNR) career pathways. The structure for agricultural education curriculum development suggested by this research (Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Disciplinary Core Ideas) is supported by recent National Research Council (2012) publications. It is prudent that the agricultural education profession utilizes structures that have been proven effective, both empirically and in practice, by other related STEM disciplines. Furthermore, utilizing a structure like other STEM disciplines will aid in cross-curricular collaborations at the local, state and national levels. If agriculture educators desire to show how agriculture is a science, as an example, then the agriculture STEM matrix should reflect the framework of AFNR agriculture and science education. The matrix should serve as the foundation for addressing curricular and teacher professional development needs.

AB  - A Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) is a framework for organizing and integrating academic, social, and emotional supports within a school. Full implementation of MTSS establishes a continuum of readily-available supports matched to student needs. Federal education statute and state-education agencies (SEAs) have prioritized the scale-up of MTSS as a means of improving student performance and the quality of the school learning environment. Our prior research into SEA MTSS scale-up projects identified critical incidents, that helped or hindered the success of these projects in 27 states. The purpose of this paper is to reexamine our findings using the active implementation framework to identify the linkages between the an implementation framework developed based on implementation science and critical incidents in the scale-up of MTSS. We provide recommendations to educational leaders and researchers. In addition, we provide commentary on the utility the active implementation framework as it applies to state scale-up and consider areas for future research.

AB  - Despite its imperfections, academic peer review has been accepted as a satisfactory process by which assessment panels comprised of different disciplinary representatives arrive at agreement through a system of shared rules and language that respects disciplinary plurality. Artistic researchers, whose output is required to meet both scholarly research criteria and the aesthetic standards expected by their peers in the art world, express concern that university peer review processes disadvantage their disciplines due to differences between artistic research and more science-informed research expectations. As research created with the artistic "white cube" in mind intersects with this "black box" of scholarly peer review, do the shared protocols adopted by peer-review panels extend to research expressed not in scholarly text but in artistic artefact? Are there features inherent in artistic research that impinge upon equitable consideration within these settings? This paper draws upon face-to-face interviews with visual and performing artists in three Australian universities to explore how these researchers experience university peer review. It contributes a distinctive disciplinary perspective to understanding university assessment and evaluation processes for the benefit of both academic staff and postgraduate students.

AB  - As science teacher educators attempt to prepare teachers to underscore the aims of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013) alongside the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (NGAC and CCSSO, 2010), they must pay close attention to the intersection of these two content areas. To address this challenge, the authors (a science educator and mathematics educator) created an experience for preservice teachers (PSTs) to learn and apply core concepts and processes of mathematics and science within our methods courses. Specifically, this was a concerted effort to support PSTs' data analysis and interpretation skills within the context of scientific inquiry. In the unit described, codeveloped and implemented in a mathematics and science methods course, elementary PSTs are provided with clear scaffolds to apply their developing knowledge of data analysis and interpretation to a scientific inquiry. This integrated unit showcases one way teacher preparation programs can support PSTs' understanding of how to analyze and interpret data and their ability to teach it in their future classrooms. As we make concerted efforts to address the new national standards, teacher educators must model strategic interdisciplinary planning and curriculum to make authentic connections across subject areas.

AB  - Most undergraduate chemistry courses and a few high school honors courses, which focus on physical chemistry and quantum mechanics, are highly mathematically-oriented. At the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, we developed a new module for high school students, titled "Chemistry--From 'the Hole' to 'the Whole': From the Nanoscale to Microelectronics." The module is based on a qualitative approach to teaching quantum chemistry, emphasizing interdisciplinary real-life applications and integration of visualization. While aimed at honors high school chemistry students, the module was also partially implemented and assessed in an undergraduate chemistry course. The research objective was to investigate the effect of the module on the visual and textual understanding of quantum mechanical concepts among 122 honors and 65 volunteer undergraduate chemistry students. The research tools included students' pre- and post-questionnaires. High school honors and undergraduate students, who were exposed to the module, significantly improved their textual and visual understanding of quantum mechanical concepts and their ability to move across illustrations and explanations. Honors and undergraduate students minimized the gap that had existed between them in terms of integrating micro and quantum levels into their post-questionnaire answers. Our findings augment the current set of the four chemistry understanding levels--macro, micro, symbol and process--by adding the quantum mechanical level as a fifth level of chemistry understanding. The study contributes to teaching physical chemistry by providing a tool for learning, assessment, and research of chemistry understanding via both visual and textual modes.

AB  - An introductory, multidisciplinary lecture-laboratory course linked with a summer research experience has been established to provide undergraduate biology and chemistry majors with the skills needed to be successful in the research laboratory. This three-credit hour course was focused on laboratory skills and was designed to reinforce and develop the students' laboratory techniques and problem-solving skills, as well as to give encouragement to participate in a summer research project. This skills course consisted of a lecture section with team-based laboratory rotations of five-weeks each. Most students in the rotations had the opportunity to work in both biology and chemistry laboratories. The skills course culminated in several students being chosen to continue research in the summer with a research stipend while under the direction of one of the faculty mentors. The summer research projects were all collaborative efforts between chemists and biologists. Data are provided from voluntary entrance and exit student surveys to determine students' overall skill levels and interests before and after completion of the skills course. This course was valuable in encouraging students to become involved in and committed to research, for teaching them laboratory techniques, and for helping them evolve into independent researchers.

AB  - Forensic science education has evolved as an interdisciplinary science that includes medicine, chemistry, biology, and criminal justice. Therefore, multiple paths can lead to a career in forensic science. A formal education usually requires the student to attend a college or university to obtain a bachelor's or master's degree. In many cases, professionals working in the field of forensic science have a bachelor's degree in a natural science and learn hands-on, in an operational laboratory, the skills necessary to perform the required tasks applied in a forensics laboratory. To advance their knowledge or obtain a master's degree, students would traditionally have to put their career on hold to attend a college or university. Because forensic scientists are in high demand in the United States and around the world, the International Forensic Science Distance Education program at the University of Florida takes a novel approach to provide the theoretical knowledge necessary for a master's degree, enabling students to stay on the job and in touch with the practical application of their discipline. This article introduces the program and its application to college distance education programs in the natural sciences. (Contains 2 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - This qualitative case study looks closely at an elementary teacher who participated in professional development experiences that helped her develop a hybrid practice of using inquiry-based science to teach both science content and English language development (ELD) to her students, many of whom are English language learners (ELLs). This case study examines the teacher's reflections on her teaching and her students' learning as she engaged her students in science learning and supported their developing language skills. It explicates the professional learning experiences that supported the development of this hybrid practice. Closely examining the pedagogical practice and reflections of a teacher who is developing an inquiry-based approach to both science learning and language development can provide insights into how teachers come to integrate their professional development experiences with their classroom expertise in order to create a hybrid inquiry-based science ELD practice. This qualitative case study contributes to the emerging scholarship on the development of teacher practice of inquiry-based science instruction as a vehicle for both science instruction and ELD for ELLs. This study demonstrates how an effective teaching practice that supports both the science and language learning of students can develop from ongoing professional learning experiences that are grounded in current perspectives about language development and that immerse teachers in an inquiry-based approach to learning and instruction. Additionally, this case study also underscores the important role that professional learning opportunities can play in supporting teachers in developing a deeper understanding of the affordances that inquiry-based science can provide for language development.

Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. Our International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. Our goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2015 received 528 submissions, from 63 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form as Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. It was accepted for presentation in the conference, 176 submissions (33% acceptance rate). The conference also includes a keynote presentation from an internationally distinguished researcher, Professor Dr. Martin Braund, Adjunct Professor at Cape Peninsula University of Technology in Cape Town, South Africa and Honorary Fellow in the Department of Education at the University of York, UK, to whom we express our most gratitude. This volume is composed by the proceedings of the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2015), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (W.I.A.R.S.) and had the help of our respected media partners that we reference in the dedicated page. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. To develop the conference program we have chosen four main broad-ranging categories, which also cover different interest areas: (1) In TEACHERS AND STUDENTS: Teachers and Staff training and education; Educational quality and standards; Curriculum and Pedagogy; Vocational education and Counseling; Ubiquitous and lifelong learning; Training programs and professional guidance; Teaching and learning relationship; Student affairs (learning, experiences and diversity); Extra-curricular activities; Assessment and measurements in Education. (2) In PROJECTS AND TRENDS: Pedagogic innovations; Challenges and transformations in Education; Technology in teaching and learning; Distance Education and eLearning; Global and sustainable developments for Education; New learning and teaching models; Multicultural and (inter)cultural communications; Inclusive and Special Education; Rural and indigenous Education; Educational projects. (3) In TEACHING AND LEARNING: Educational foundations; Research and development methodologies; Early childhood and Primary Education; Secondary Education; Higher Education; Science and technology Education; Literacy, languages and Linguistics (TESL/TEFL); Health Education; Religious Education; Sports Education. (4) In ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES: Educational policy and leadership; Human Resources development; Educational environment; Business, Administration, and Management in Education; Economics in Education; Institutional accreditations and rankings; International Education and Exchange programs; Equity, social justice and social change; Ethics and values; Organizational learning and change.

AB  - We built a low-cost and hand-held device to image and analyze microfluidic droplets mainly for educational/teaching purposes in laboratory settings of universities. The device was assembled based on a Raspberry Pi with a camera attached on the back and an LCD screen on the top. We evaluated the performance of this device to capture images and videos to visualize high-throughput droplet generation in a microfluidic device. The qualities of imaging resolution and speed were sufficient for us to perform subsequent droplet analysis quantitatively through automatic image possessing. Droplet characteristics including droplet size, volume, and dispersity, as well as droplet intensity, have been measured, showing the potential of this device to analyze droplet-based assays. Most importantly, in addition to learning the knowledge and principles from classroom lectures, students can thus gain practice of using an advanced, state-of-the-art technology in a laboratory course. It will also open up opportunities to train students with skills of interdisciplinary thinking and learning.

AB  - The reception of "Ex corde ecclesiae" has been uneven across the disciplines, with scant interest in distinctly Catholic pedagogies outside of the humanities. This essay argues that Catholic universities can distinguish themselves by how they present science and technology in their curriculum by drawing from the interdisciplinary field of "science, technology & society," or STS. We argue that discussions about Catholic identity, science, and human values can and should extend into the curriculum while simultaneously safeguarding academic freedom, and that this can readily be done in professional schools, such as law and engineering. We outline the contributions that STS as a field could offer Catholic higher education. We discuss how teaching science and technologies as social forces can provide the intellectual and reflective space necessary for critical reflection on their moral dimensions, in society and in the emerging professional lives of students. We argue that STS can help Catholic universities express the Catholic tradition of linking knowledge and wisdom, and thus has the potential to advance the distinctly Catholic character of universities. To substantiate our claims, we present three examples of STS in Catholic higher education curriculum: undergraduate core curriculum, law school instruction, and frugal innovation in engineering education.

AB  - In this article, we explore the implementation of a time-based intervention in a garden-based science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics curriculum with a 3rd-grade science class that flipped the overdetermined functions of time and overdependence on predetermined learning outcomes to cultivate a disposition of sensitivity to the environment. We concentrate on a single class session in which we bracketed brief moments of focus on the perception of sounds and smells to foster ecological attunement, prioritizing students' embodied and local knowledge. By analyzing the resulting observations and discussions, we describe how the timed exercises activated intervals of possibility for ecological connection, registered through expressions of curiosity and wonder, where a spectrum of imaginative potential emerged. In the findings, we also discuss unexpected tensions that emerged between the educators' desire to manage classroom behavior and generate identifiable data while also intending to embrace ambiguity in a playful and imaginative atmosphere.

AB  - Information literacy is an essential skill for biologists; however, most biology curricula do not intentionally integrate information literacy into classroom and laboratory exercises. There is evidence that developing information literacy skills in undergraduates improves their research skills, writing, and GPAs. Our objective was to integrate information literacy skills into a first semester introductory biology laboratory with a multi-week, inquiry-based module that leverages primary literature. Here we describe the module, which challenges students to develop and test a hypothesis related to parental care behaviour in birds. Students form hypotheses based on literature searching done during librarian-led information literacy sessions, produce an annotated bibliography, collect and analyse video data of barn swallows feeding their offspring, and present their findings. Analysis of students' annotated bibliographies indicates that 83% of the referenced papers were appropriate for developing their specific hypotheses. The key elements of a successful information literacy training plan include faculty-librarian collaboration, multiple classroom or laboratory sessions that introduce or utilize information literacy, and relevance of the information literacy training to an assignment. By introducing information literacy early in biology curricula, departments can develop tiered information literacy plans that incorporate opportunities for students to use and refine these skills throughout their studies.

AB  - Since 1995, soil-ecological field courses across climatic zones in West Siberia have been organized by scientists from Russia and Germany to meet growing demands for better land use practices. They are focused on virgin landscapes and soils undisturbed by anthropogenic influences to facilitate the learning processes by excluding concealing changes and artifacts. The visited landscapes range from taiga near Tomsk and tundra in Altai mountains to desert conditions near the Mongolian border. This article describes the main features of the field courses, the organization, and changes in the content over years. This includes a short description of the field course route, teaching approaches, the dynamics in the number of participants, evaluation results, and others. To explain the successes of the field courses, we suggest that the specific organization methods and collaboration approaches, the motivation of participants by several factors, and the applied interdisciplinary teaching approach should be considered. We hope our experience will facilitate similar teaching in other regions of the world and support a future sustainable use of local human and natural resources.

AB  - Augmented Reality (AR) technology and games can enhance motivation for learning. When combined with mobile devices, AR technology can promote authentic learning in outdoor environments, such as urban parks. These spaces can be used for Science Education, particularly, for environmental education and nature conservation. The EduPARK project combines these elements and follows a design-based research approach to develop an interactive mobile AR game to be explored by students, teachers and the general public, as visitors, in a specific urban park, integrating four interdisciplinary educational guides. The app development involved four cycles of user testing and evaluation for progressive refinement, according to the users' feedback in each cycle. The focus of this paper is to analyze the users' perceptions in the two last cycles of the app refinement, regarding its learning value and usability. The users were students of different school levels (24 of Basic Education; and 46 of Higher Education). Data collection involved a focus group interview, a questionnaire and the app's usage data. Content analysis, descriptive statistics, and System Usability Scale (SUS) computing were conducted. Results revealed that the EduPARK app promotes learning, enjoyment and is easy to use. It achieved an excellent usability, according to younger students (85.8 of average SUS) and a good usability according to older students (70.9). From the last refinement cycle, the app's final version has emerged, which is freely available to the public in the Google Store. In the future, more evaluation experiences are needed to better understand the benefits of this mobile AR game for learning in urban parks. [For the complete proceedings, see ED590271.]

AB  - Latent classes of effective and non-effective Algebra I teachers were established using measurements of teacher promoted engagement, teacher promoted understanding, and classroom management from the Measures of Effective Teaching Project (MET Project) database. Historically, robust measures of effective teaching exist in the literature; however, there are no sets of factors or attributes that define an effective teacher. Instead, current teacher accountability practices have weighed heavily on observations, student surveys, and standardized test scores in value added models as indicators of teacher effectiveness. This study focused on Algebra I teachers due to the importance of establishing student success in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Results support the use of latent class analysis using teacher characteristics to identify effective and non-effective teachers.

AB  - The Distributed Drug Discovery (D3) program trains students in three drug discovery disciplines (synthesis, computational analysis, and biological screening) while addressing the important challenge of discovering drug leads for neglected diseases. This article focuses on implementation of the synthesis component in the second-semester undergraduate organic laboratory. The educational program was started at IUPUI in 2003 and has been carried out over 23 semesters with 65 lab sections by >1200 students. Since the chemistry component is most advanced, it serves as a model for the computational and biological modules in development. Synthetic procedures are based on well-documented, reproducible solid-phase combinatorial chemistry. They are carried out in a 2 × 3 combinatorial grid (Bill-Board) to create a control molecule and five new products (50 µmol scale, ~10-20 mg product, typically high LC/MS purity). The first of these synthetic procedures (D3 Lab 1) utilizes a protected and activated derivative of glycine that is converted in a five-step synthetic sequence (alkylation, hydrolysis, neutralization, acylation, and cleavage from the resin) to N-acylated unnatural amino acids containing two variable diversity elements: a new "a"-side chain and an "N"-acyl group. Based on these combinatorial procedures, large virtual libraries/catalogs of student-accessible molecules can be created and computationally analyzed. Selected molecules are then synthesized and screened by D3 students. Active classroom learning experiences and recorded lectures or demonstrations are used to teach fundamental knowledge and skills in synthesis while enabling students to pursue, with no predetermined outcome, multidisciplinary, distributed, research-based experiments toward drug-lead discovery.

AB  - There is extensive evidence showing that the climate system is warming and human behavior is linked to the change. Despite increasing attempts to integrate climate change into school curricula, teachers have challenges in preparing and implementing climate change lessons. The study aims to look at (a) the kinds of wondering questions middle school students construct after they are engaged in a climate change activity called 'It's a Gassy World' and (b) what teachers highlight in their reflections on these questions to improve their teaching. In this multi-case explorative study, the data comes from student artifacts, teachers' written reflections, and semi-structured conversational interviews with teachers. A constant-comparative analysis of students' wondering questions (N = 165) showed that the nature of the questions varies. These were grouped under three different categories: direct observation, interdisciplinary connections, and future projections questions. We then analyzed five teachers' written reflections and interviews from a cultural historical activity theoretical perspective. This analysis revealed that teachers paid particular attention to certain tools (physical and conceptual), norms (epistemic and teaching), emotions, and division of labor routines in classrooms. We discuss how students' wondering questions help teachers notice essential features of climate change learning such as spatiotemporal thinking.

AB  - Wisdom, long a topic of interest to moral philosophers, is increasingly the focus of social science research. Philosophers have historically been concerned to develop a rationally defensible account of the nature of wisdom and its role in the moral life, often inspired in various ways by virtue theoretical accounts of practical wisdom ("phronesis"). Wisdom scientists seek to, among other things, define wisdom and its components so that we can measure them. Are the measures used by wisdom scientists actually measuring what philosophers have in mind when they discuss practical wisdom? I argue that they are not. Contemporary measures of wisdom and its components may pick out some necessary prerequisites of practical wisdom, but they do not measure a philosophically plausible practical wisdom or its components. After explaining the argument and defending it against objections, I consider its implications. Should wisdom scientists ignore the philosophical conception of practical wisdom in favor of other conceptions, revise their methods to try to measure it, or continue the interdisciplinary study of practical wisdom without expecting to measure it? I make a preliminary argument for the third option.

AB  - Statistics need data and data need context. Contexts from across the curriculum can be the most powerful in creating interest, reward, and enthusiasm for both teachers and students. The activity described here is based in STEM, employing aspects of each field to create and solve a hypothetical problem of escaping from an erupting volcano (Science) by planning (Engineering), collecting (Technology), and analysing (Mathematics, Technology) data. The software "TinkerPlots" allows the exploration of emergent ideas associated with trend in bivariate numerical data, covariation, and extrapolation in Year 5.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to propose an analytical framework of disciplinary learning outcomes that will facilitate our understanding of the nature of disciplines and their relationships. Application of the draft analytical framework, Anderson and Krathwohl's "Taxonomy of Educational Objectives" to engineering learning outcome reference points revealed the necessity for revision, by replacing the "meta-cognitive knowledge" type with what was labeled in this study as "societal/civic engagement." This new knowledge type refers to the responsibilities and contributions of engineers to society and to the wider interdisciplinary context of engineering, and reflects the contemporary attention to societal and interdisciplinary contributions of disciplines. The revised analytical framework of disciplinary learning outcomes captured well the characteristics of engineering, a highly structured discipline with specified sets of knowledge graduates are expected to understand, but also a discipline that has traditionally focused on the application of scientific knowledge to solve problems in the real world. The established engineering competences of "basic and engineering sciences," "engineering analysis," "engineering design," "engineering practice," and "engineering generic skills" revealed to occupy particular fields on the taxonomy table, illustrating the structure of engineering learning outcomes. The future direction of this study includes the application of the revised analytical framework to other disciplinary learning outcome reference points. By analyzing and comparing the characteristics of disciplinary learning outcomes based on a common analytical framework, we are able to capture disciplinary structures in a systematic way, and thus develop profiles of disciplines, which will provide the foundation for constructing a theory of disciplinary relationships in contemporary society. A bibliography is included.

AB  - This paper examined the nuances of the background process of design and development and follow up classroom implementation of computer-based models for high school chemistry. More specifically, the study examined the knowledge contributions of an interdisciplinary team of experts; points of tensions, negotiations and non-negotiable aspects of model design; and the evolutionary trajectory of technological artefacts as they are readied for classroom implementation. A Discourse-in-use methodological approach examined planning sessions involved in the design and development of models and a case study of classroom implementation in two high school chemistry classrooms were conducted. The data included transcripts of planning sessions, classroom observations and teacher and student interviews. Design and development sessions reflected five major themes: (i) the nature of models: function, goals and limitations of models (ii) the role of students, background knowledge, and goals for student learning (ii) pedagogical decisions of the modeling process (iv) models and assessment and (v) the role of implementation. In comparison to the educator group, the scientist/programmer knowledge contributions dominated the form that technologies eventually assumed. Surely, implementation exposed teacher and student challenges with sub micro NetLogo representations; this finding reinforced the tensions and non-negotiable aspects of design that were involved in ensuring accurate representations. Models were configured to accommodate what was scientifically and technically reproducible within the constraints of context. However, these visual representations were not always commensurable with chemistry expectations at the high school level. These findings have implications for pedagogical decisions aligned with implementation, content understanding and assessment; and the sustainability of computer-based models in precollege science classrooms.

AB  - Kay and LeSage (2009) conducted a literature review of research on use of student response systems in university courses (typically Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics courses) and categorized benefits into classroom environment, learning, and assessment. The objectives of the proposed session are to discuss how using Google Forms will benefit those three above categories. Examples of Google Forms used to gather data, receive in-the-moment feedback to students and instructors, engage students' learning, and assess their learning will be shared throughout the paper. Limitations of Google Forms will also be discussed. This session can be beneficial to all K-College educators.

AB  - We explore whether the use of assistive technology allows teachers and children to negotiate shared understandings for learning science and language. We understand our afterschool sessions as critical encounters. Artifacts used in the encounters enabled transcending of the tensions and became drivers for learning. In the studied 13 encounters, science conceptual development was privileged over other learning, such as language or multimodality. Those encounters including children who were positioned as less able to learn in the school deemed the highest number of artifacts. We suggest that the promotion of meaningful learning experiences for children with a variety of educational needs, particularly those deemed as less able, calls for the use of technological tools allowing for multimodal negotiation of shared understandings.

AB  - In Australia, for more than two decades, a "social science" integrated framework was the favored approach for delivering subjects such as history and geography. However, such interdisciplinary approaches have continued to attract criticism from various parts of the academic and public spheres, and since 2009, a return to teaching the disciplines has been heralded as the "new" way forward. Using discourse analysis techniques associated with Foucauldian archeology, the purpose of this article is to examine the Australian Curriculum: Geography document to ascertain the discourses necessary for pre-service teachers to enact effective teaching of geography in a primary setting. Then, based on pre-service teachers' online survey responses, the article investigates whether such future teachers have the knowledge and skills to interpret, deliver, and enact the new geography curriculum in primary classrooms. Finally, as teacher educators, our interest lies in preparing pre-service teachers effectively for the classroom, so that the findings are used to inform the content of a teacher education course for pre-service primary teachers.

AB  - Four graduate students from four distinct Canadian institutions engaged in collaborative autoethnography to explore their dual roles as participant-researchers investigating the lived experience of graduate students studying engineering education research (EER) in Canada. Findings, oriented through the identity-trajectory framework, indicate that we questioned the legitimacy of the field, and thus our identities. This struggle for legitimacy is discussed in terms of community of practice, drawn from a situative perspective, as well as through boundary crossing, and socialization and cultural theories. We position EER as interdisciplinary and demonstrate how this space should be leveraged to encourage the advancement of transformative knowledge. We suggest the intentional construction of EER communities of practice at individual Canadian institutions is essential for explicitly attending to the identity development of EER graduate students and supporting the advancement of this interdisciplinary and emergent field.

AB  - The Australian Science and Mathematics School (ASMS) is a purpose-built innovative senior secondary school situated on the grounds of Flinders University, South Australia. The school was established to address declining enrollments in senior secondary mathematics and science, students' negative attitudes, a shortage of qualified science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teachers, and a curriculum that lacked relevance to contemporary life. Such research evidence called for transformation in STEM education and acknowledged that teachers' professional learning was central to achieving transformation. A key professional learning strategy employed by the school to transform STEM education was the engagement of teachers and academics as professional partners in developing interdisciplinary curriculum. The value and challenges of the professional partnership are explored in this article, noting the importance of valuing rather than dismissing dissonance between the groups.

AB  - In line with the latest positions of Gottlob Frege, this article puts forward the hypothesis that the cognitive bases of mathematics are geometric in nature. Starting from the geometry axioms of the "Elements" of Euclid, we introduce a geometric theory of proportions along the lines of the one introduced by Grassmann in "Ausdehnungslehre" in 1844. Assuming as axioms, the cognitive contents of the theorems of Pappus and Desargues, through their configurations, in an Euclidean plane a natural field structure can be identified that reveals the purely geometric nature of complex numbers. Reasoning based on figures is becoming a growing interdisciplinary field in logic, philosophy and cognitive sciences, and is also of considerable interest in the field of education, moreover, recently, it has been emphasized that the mutual assistance that geometry and complex numbers give is poorly pointed out in teaching and that a unitary vision of geometrical aspects and calculation can be clarifying.

AB  - Many important voices--including The National Council for Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), the Dana Center's Launch Years initiative, and others--advocate for expanding the traditional course offerings in high school mathematics and statistics to include courses such as the Introduction to Data Science (IDS). To date, the research on the IDS course has primarily focused on pedagogy, professional learning for teachers, and the curriculum. This mixed-methods case study expands our understanding by analyzing the perspective of IDS students at a California public high school. Self-determination theory provides a useful frame for interpreting how these students experience the IDS course. The theory focuses on conditions for students to engage in meaningful learning: competence (self-efficacy), autonomy (agency), and relatedness (a sense of belonging). The findings from this case study suggest the IDS students feel confident, empowered, and part of a vibrant community, unlike previous mathematics and statistics courses they may have completed; and use specific language to describe their joy in problem-solving and the accessibility of the course. These findings have implications for the development and refinement of any high school data science course, including IDS.

AB  - Obesity is a critical global public health issue. It leads to numerous health conditions that limit the quality and length of life, placing a huge burden on healthcare systems around the world. Scholars believe that the fight against obesity can be won only through multidisciplinary efforts. However, the literature on people's understanding of obesity is limited, perhaps because this topic does not attract the attention of educators at the appropriate level. Although existing studies show that people lack understanding about the mechanisms of obesity, most of the arguments in these papers suffer from a lack of theoretical background and methodological problems. Therefore, we conceived the present study based on a sound theory (conceptual change) in order to understand school students' conceptual patterns regarding weight gain, which is an important component of obesity knowledge. A written questionnaire probing the mechanism of weight gain was distributed to 151 secondary school students in the Turkish part of Cyprus. Content analysis was applied to students' compositions. The results showed that students have six major conceptual patterns about weight gain. They also hold a range of misconceptions and misunderstandings, and sometimes have no conceptions. At the end of the paper, we discuss possible curricular and teaching implications based on the patterns and incorrect knowledge structures.

AB  - Students' strongly positive STEM interest and identity predict their future study and career choices in a STEM field. STEM education studies addressing multiple disciplines together are insufficient, as they have produced mixed findings and inadequate direction for advancing integrated STEM education. Self-determination theory (SDT) provides an understanding of motivational processes that influence the development of STEM interest and identity. This study investigated the effectiveness of a set of proposed teacher needs-supportive strategies on student STEM interest and identity development during a proposed 12-week SDT-based STEM program. Three hundred forty-two ninth grade students were randomly assigned to SDT and non-SDT groups during the program. The results support the application of SDT in integrated STEM learning and explain how supporting student needs affects their STEM interest and identity, which is crucial in interdisciplinary learning and the development of adolescent interest and identity in K-12. Moreover, the results contribute to SDT by adding a new dimension--integrated STEM interest and identity--and presenting more evidence on how the teacher's needs-supportive strategies foster this dimension. These results have practical implications for advancing integrated STEM education in addition to new opportunities for using fewer resources to effectively foster student interest and identity in compulsory education.

AB  - The research deals with the experience of interdisciplinary investigation and aims at utilizing the data of contemporary career science and the theory of professionalism to enhance the quality of legal education. The authors, who are Professors of the School of Law, Far-Eastern Federal University, propose to introduce the term "career reserve" into the parlance of science and offer their interpretation of this term in relation to the professional activity of a lawyer. At present, acquiring education is the first stage in the career ladder. To help the students go up the ladder, the modern law school has to educate the students in proper planning of their career and assist them in forming a basic career reserve during their education stage.

AB  - Teaching robotics courses online is challenging due to the complexity of the interdisciplinary topics involved. One of the most challenging topics is 3D coordinate transformations. Students often struggle to grasp the concept of 3D coordinate transformations and their relevance to real-world robotic applications. This paper applies the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning methodology to address this challenge and shares the self-evaluation assignments given to students to gradually enhance their ability to solve a real-world robotic navigation problem -- a crucial skill required in almost all robotic applications. Each assignment includes an informative description that explains the purpose of the task and its connection to the next assignment. Manageable MATLAB resources are provided in each assignment, allowing students to study fundamental Matlab scripts and use MATLAB Grader for self-evaluation before submission. The instructor provides feedback on incorrect answers through MATLAB Grader. The assignments focus on problem-solving and can be automatically graded, building upon prior work done by the instructor. The paper will also detail strategies for motivating students to engage with these challenging assignments and how the instructor assists distracted students in catching up with any missing assignments.

AB  - Learning through designing digital games has recently emerged as a potential approach for school learners to boost their literacy development and learning in and across disciplines. However, existing knowledge on this relatively new approach is still fragmented, and little is known about its implementation features, associated learning opportunities, and possible challenges experienced by students. As such, the present review seeks to synthesize relevant research in terms of the three aspects stated above to better understand the concept of student game design as a literacy practice. A total of 30 peer-reviewed research articles published between 2010-2020 are included in this research synthesis. Findings reveal that there is considerable variation in how the literacy learning approach of student game design is currently implemented, with respect to the school learners involved and game-making tools adopted. Despite its diverse nature, the feasibility of literacy learning by game-making is confirmed across the reviewed studies, with the disciplinary literacy in computer science and 21st century literacy being most prominent. This review has also brought to light the potential of introducing students to content-based game design to foster interdisciplinary learning. In order to provide a balanced portrait, this review further identifies major challenges of learning with the game-making approach from students' perspectives.

AB  - Given the growing evidence of limited attention to science, disciplinary literacy, and oral language in elementary classrooms serving low-income children, this study focused on designing and testing an integrated science and disciplinary language and literacy curriculum aligned with NGSS and CCSS ELA standards for kindergarten. We used design-based implementation research (DBIR) to create curriculum materials to support children's science talk and conducted a quasi-experimental study to examine children's (N = 147) oral language outcomes. Kindergartners receiving the curriculum outperformed children in business-as-usual kindergarten classrooms in their ability to make claims, give evidence-based supports, knowledge of receptive science vocabulary, and use of vocabulary in a science context. Findings indicate that with appropriate scaffolding and support, kindergartners can engage in sophisticated science talk and that integrated curriculum materials can impact young children's science learning and science discourse.

AB  - Despite growing awareness of the importance of incorporating integrated science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) learning into K-12 education, formal classroom implementation still faces obstacles. Teachers lack the knowledge and skills, especially design-thinking competence, required to design an interdisciplinary STEM curriculum. The goal of this study was to investigate different scaffolding modes that may influence the design-thinking competence development of STEM teachers. Twenty-four preservice teachers participated in this study, which was carried out in an online STEM preservice teacher training environment. The participants were assigned to six groups of two cohorts. Each group designed a STEM learning module. To support their online design meetings, the three groups from the static scaffolding cohort (SSC) received pre-defined guiding questions, while the other three groups from the adaptive scaffolding cohort (ASC) received contingent scaffolding from a human tutor. The Log data on the participants' conversations in the design meetings were collected and analysed using the epistemic network analysis (ENA) approach. The results revealed that the SSC and ASC had divergent design-thinking development trajectories and established distinct design-thinking patterns. Conversation analysis of the two cohorts confirmed the findings of the ENA analysis and provided evidence that the two scaffolding modes can help address challenges to collaborative STEM learning design and cultivate design-thinking competence from different perspectives.

AB  - The nature of problem solving has been a difficult one to pin down, with much of the focus placed on hypothetical cognitive structures based on technological metaphors that change as quickly as the currently popular technologies after which they are modeled. While behavior analysts have made use of several effective instructional methodologies to produce reliable and impressive convergent learning outcomes, mainstream education has increasingly shifted toward divergent learning outcomes. Educators desire instructional models that are free flowing, spontaneous, and creative, producing students capable of solving problems in a wide array of domains. The analysis provided by a science of human behavior, combined with the aforementioned effective instructional strategies, reveals problem solving to be an area ripe for behavior analytic dissemination and interdisciplinary coordination. Behavior analysis offers a distinctly selectionist account of problem solving that focuses on the interaction between the learner and the environment. This paper serves three functions. First, the authors present a detailed and comprehensive account of human problem solving from a behavior analytic perspective, with a special focus on the role of verbal behavior. Second, research that supports this conceptualization is thoroughly detailed. Lastly, the authors describe effective problem solving curricula and instructional methods derived from a behavior analytic framework to assist educators as to how to create optimal learning environments to promote and nurture cultures of successful problem solving.

AB  - Reform efforts in the teaching of undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have included introducing faculty to specific teaching strategies and engaging them in collaborative initiatives. This study examined the experiences of STEM faculty learning interactive teaching strategies while also learning and applying self-study methodology in a year-long faculty self-study learning community. We used self-study methodology as an innovative design to support STEM faculty's research about their teaching. Drawing on multiple sources of data, the researchers found that although participants reported that learning self-study methodology was unique and complex, they embraced the problematic and sophisticated nature of self-study to examine their teaching while recognizing the close link between teaching and research. As they reflected on their professional identities as teachers, they gained a better understanding of their role in their students' learning. Supporting faculty's small changes in teaching can lead to larger changes over time. Self-study methodology can reinforce the change process. The self-study learning community design may be useful as a catalyst for developing an advanced teaching trajectory for STEM faculty and useful for faculty from various disciplines. Implications for impacting individual and institutional capacity in higher education are discussed.

AB  - Research on learning science in informal settings and the formal (sometimes experimental) study of learning in classrooms or psychological laboratories tend to be separate domains, even drawing on different theories and methods. These differences make it difficult to compare knowing and learning observed in one paradigm/context with those observed in the other. Even more interestingly, the scientists studying science learning rarely consider their own learning in relation to the phenomena they study. A dialectical, reflexive approach to learning, however, would theorize the movement of an educational science (its learning and development) as a special and general case--subject matter and method--of the phenomenon of learning (in/of) science. In the dialectical approach to the study of science learning, therefore, "subject matter, method, and theory fall together". This allows for a perspective in which not only disparate fields of study--school science learning and learning in everyday life--are integrated but also where the progress in the science of science learning coincides with its topic. Following the articulation of a contradictory situation on comparing learning in different settings, I describe the dialectical approach. As a way of providing a concrete example, I then trace the historical movement of my own research group as it simultaneously and alternately studied science learning in formal and informal settings. I conclude by recommending cultural-historical, dialectical approaches to learning and interaction analysis as a context for fruitful interdisciplinary research on science learning within and across different settings.

AB  - This article proposes an indirect method to evaluate the corrosion rate of iron nail in simulated seawater. The official procedure is based on the direct measurement of the specimen's weight loss over time; however, a highly precise scale is required and such equipment may not be easily available. On the other hand, mobile phones equipped with good built-in cameras have become an essential part of everyday lives of students and educators. With the built-in cameras, students followed the formation of the colored complex from the reaction between released iron ions and 1,10-phenanthroline. The images were then decomposed into the RGB channels that were converted into absorbance. Another point worth mentioning is that rather than providing students with a step-by-step procedure, the instructor used a problem-based approach that enabled students to develop the experimental procedure themselves. This project-driven interdisciplinary experiment engaged students into thinking and producing the experiment. Finally, bringing cell phones into science teaching was very helpful as it made learning more inviting and meaningful.

AB  - Two experiments assessed how reading aloud versus reading silently would benefit recognition and recall performance of content-specific vocabulary (i.e., the production effect). Participants studied 30 terms from an American history curriculum by reading half of the vocabulary aloud, while the remaining words were read silently. After a brief distractor task, they completed a recognition memory test (Experiment 1) or a recall memory test (Experiment 2). Both experiments revealed a benefit for reading aloud. Recognition performance showed a 22% performance advantage, while recall performance showed a smaller advantage for the words read aloud (8% benefit). The vast majority of participants in both experiments showed a memory advantage for those words that were studied aloud versus those read silently (88% of participants in Experiment 1 and 67% of individuals in Experiment 2). Implications for educational settings are considered. Attempts to improve student performance have been manifested in various forms; however, recent developments in cognitive psychology have a great deal to offer educators and students regarding instruction and learning. Studies suggest that educators and cognitive psychologists ought to approach educational research as an interdisciplinary endeavor. Through this collaborative relationship, those who teach could improve their understanding of the science of learning, while researchers extend theoretical research to practical, classroom applications for the benefit of students and teachers.

AB  - The maker movement advocates hands-on making with emerging technologies because of its value for promoting innovative and personally meaningful transdisciplinary learning. Educational research has focused on settings that primarily serve youth from dominant groups, yet we know surprisingly little about making among minoritized youth and the kinds of resources that support their making. This study sought to better understand the extent to which maker practices are present in the lives of minoritized youth and the network of resources that support their engagement. In this study, we analyzed survey responses of 52 youth from an urban, under-resourced community in Chicago and conducted an inductive thematic analysis of 20 interviews through a model of connected learning. Findings showed these youth participated in a diverse range of interest-driven, low-tech maker activities in their own homes more often than in school, after school programs, or through online resources and communities (i.e., YouTube, Internet, social media). Many youths displayed different levels of participation with intergenerational support, as parents and extended family members supported youth in their hands-on making. This work opens up pathways for fostering connected learning opportunities within minoritized communities by building on existing learning experiences within home settings and supportive relationships.

AB  - The article studies a way of enhancing student cognition by using interdisciplinary project-based learning (IPBL) in a higher education institution. IPBL is a creative pedagogic approach allowing students of one area of specialisation to develop projects for students with different academic profiles. The application of this approach in the Ural State University of Economics resulted in a computer-assisted learning system (CALS) designed by IT students. The CALS was used in an analytical chemistry course with students majoring in Commodities Management and Expertise ("expert" students). To test how effective the technology was, the control and experimental groups were formed. In the control group, learning was done with traditional methods. In the experimental group, it was reinforced by IPBL. A statistical analysis of the results, with an application of Pearson ?[superscript 2] test, showed that the cognitive levels in both IT and "expert" experimental groups improved as compared with the control groups. The findings demonstrated that IPBL can significantly enhance learning. It can be implemented in any institution of higher or secondary education that promotes learning, including the CALS development and its use for solving problems in different subject areas.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe the components of a sustainability transdisciplinary education model (STEM), a contemporary approach linking art, science, and community, that were developed to provide university and K-12 students, and society at large shared learning opportunities. The goals and application of the STEM curriculum will be discussed. Design/methodology/approach: The STEM integrates the sciences, arts and aesthetics, and the university with the greater New Britain community, and beyond. Academic areas included geography, environmental science, communication, art history, aesthetics, and teacher education. The transdisciplinary methodology was integrated in a learner-centered design. To achieve a cycle of community engagement regarding sustainability, university students were placed within the greater New Britain community. This included interaction with K-12 urban public schools, the New Britain Museum of American Art (NBMAA), numerous nongovernmental organizations, state and federal governmental elected officials, and the general public. Findings: As a result of the mutual learning implicit in the STEM, all participants expanded each other's understandings of sustainability. Students were learning from instructors, instructors were learning from students, students were learning from students, instructors were learning from instructors, and all were learning and sharing knowledge with the greater community. As a result, all participants gained a deeper and broader understanding about human-environment relationships and how humans impact natural resources. Practical implications: Because the assignments given to the university students were authentic performance tasks embedded in sustainability issues, students developed a broader disposition for thinking and learning and therefore become metacognitive. The STEM emphasized aesthetic education, integrating science and the arts. As a result, the participants developed their ability to connect academic domains of knowledge and creatively address sustainability challenges. Originality/value: The convergence of science, art, and aesthetics enabled the participants to develop a deeper spiritual awareness and understanding of eco-justice for the promotion of a sustainable society. The STEM utilized cultural resources of the university and New Britain community (i.e. institutional members of the NBMAA and The Central Connecticut State University). Students were introduced to the concept of mutual learning with all the communities and organizations involved. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)

AB  - An academic career at a community college is in a number of ways quite different from a career at a four-year university. From the emphasis on teaching and pedagogy to the absence of the "publish or perish" imperative (at least in most parts of the country), community college professors often navigate an array of challenges different from those navigated by university professors. Indeed, this is certainly the case with political scientists at community colleges. In this article, I address two important issues that are common in academic life at the two-year institution: (1) the role of contingency faculty and the transition from that to full-time/tenured status and (2) the importance of teaching across the subfields in political science at the two-year level.

AB  - Although it is not possible to predict the future, at least some ideas can be developed through planning. Geography focuses on current social, environmental and spatial problems; however, it should, at the same time, teach us to plan its future handling. At school, this is a responsible role for the subject geography. This article compares how nineteen different English and German (North Rhine-Westphalian) geography textbooks deal with planning through various tasks. These tasks are identified with a definition, based on a multidisciplinary literature review, and are examined by qualitative content analysis. It appears that planning skills for shaping the future are dealt with differently in both countries, with respect to branches of geography, topic of concern, planning method, time frame and perspectivity.

AB  - Discussions held in the chemical education community have generated a variety of reports and recommendations for reforming the chemistry curriculum. The recommendations refer to teaching chemistry in the context of real-world issues. This has been suggested as a way to enhance students' motivation. It is suggested that real-world problems emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of chemistry and the relevance of chemistry to the students' lives. An attempt was made to incorporate these recommendations into the teaching of chemistry by teaching analytical chemistry together with environmental chemistry. A unit incorporating analytical chemistry in an environmental context was developed, in which the students learn concepts of a specific environmental issue. The unit "I Have Chemistry with the Environment", consisting of two modules, was developed on the topics of drinking-water quality, and the greenhouse effect. The research questions focus on the change in the attitudes and perceptions of the students toward chemistry and environmental issues, after learning the environmental unit. The results indicate that the students underwent a significant change in their awareness of environmental issues. All the students mentioned that the unit influenced their everyday-life perceptions of environmental issues and that their awareness of environmental issues increased. Another important finding was that more students found that learning the "I Have Chemistry with the Environment" unit encouraged them to learn chemistry. They indicated that they especially appreciated the feeling that they could discover things by themselves. Clearly, the students found that learning the unit was relevant to chemistry learning as well as to their personal lives. Researchers believe that such a program may promote education for sustainable development. (Contains 4 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - The excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation, natural or artificial, is a public health concern. For this reason, it is important that, from an early age, children and teenagers gain awareness of this problem. By not being visible to the human eye, ultraviolet radiation is an abstract concept and difficult to understand, although its short-term effects may be visible. In this project, we proposed the use of the Arduino platform to measure and verify the effect of various sunblocks, making it possible to materialize the concept of UV radiation. Thus, it was the aim of this project to study the influence of the Arduino platform use, associated with an ultraviolet radiation sensor, in the understanding of this type of radiation and in the awareness to the artificial sources of UV radiation used in the daily life of many people. This project was carried out with a group of students from the ninth grade, from a school in Porto, Portugal. The methodology used allowed the students to develop interdisciplinary skills, namely in the areas of natural sciences, programming, and mathematics, providing them with useful lifelong tools.

AB  - Between 2014 and 2017, an interdisciplinary group of researchers examined whether a high school health class that incorporated mindfulness techniques lowered students' stress and improved their wellbeing. We received a grant from the Institute of Educational Sciences from the United States Department of Education to (1) train high school health teachers to implement the mindfulness-based curriculum and (2) study how the program impacted students. We examined changes in cognitive, social, emotional, and physical wellbeing indicators from before the course to after the course, using a quasi-experimental (intervention and control group with pre and post tests), mixed-methods (concurrent triangulation) design. Data consisted of student responses to psychometric surveys and interviews with a subsample of students. When we compared qualitative findings with quantitative outcomes, we discovered instances of different results through each method. This allowed us to provide explanations and context for certain outcomes. For example, the recent loss of a grandparent explained why one student scored high in social isolation. At other times, the two methods found two different "outcomes stories" from the same student. For example, a student reported in the interview that he was struggling with social interactions, but the psychometric indicators had him in the top quintile of social wellbeing indicators as compared to his peers. This case study discusses methodological approaches to mixed-method educational psychology research, the challenges of making sense of data from different sources, and the usefulness and limitations of mixed-methodologies for psychological outcome evaluations of student wellbeing interventions. We also discuss the process of working as a large group of researchers. This case is useful for students in psychology and education, and it is equally useful for early career researchers.

AB  - Dissection of bodies provided by donors continues to be utilized as a critical part of medical education. It also represents a rite of passage that socializes students to prepare them for the stress that comes with working in a clinical environment as a medical professional. Just as proper guidance in acquiring technical skills is critical in anatomy education, there is an important need for proper emotional guidance throughout the human dissection process. A pilot curriculum was developed by an interdisciplinary faculty team to emotionally prepare students for their first visit to the anatomy laboratory. Students were first-year foundation premedical students who had expressed an interest in visiting the laboratory. Pre- and post-visit surveys were conducted to explore students' emotional responses to a first visit to the anatomy laboratory and their utilization of coping strategies. The survey findings show an overwhelming favorable feeling in anticipation of the human gross anatomy laboratory visit. About 20% of the students experienced anxiety at the anticipation of the laboratory visit, but only 5.3% experienced anxiety during the visit. The decrease in the number of students experiencing anxiety may be attributed to the interventions introduced before and during the visit. Talking with a close friend was the main coping strategy utilized by 63% of students experiencing fear or anxiety during and after the laboratory visit. The findings from this program evaluation provide a better understanding of student emotional preparedness and utilization of coping strategies, which may help prepare and guide future students for the dissection experience.

AB  - Present paper aims to give an insight in the field of Mechatronics, specifically its standard of education in India. We have investigated this field right from its origin. We have analyzed how it expanded as a proper discipline of engineering and in which direction the development in this field is going now and, at the same time, its status of education in India and where we are in addressing the industry's need both in terms of quality and quantity of students. We have also assessed why Mechatronics is an essential branch considering its multi-disciplinary nature. The point is that it holds blatant importance for time to come. Life's most complicated problems cannot be addressed by the knowledge of only one engineering science. In today's world we need professionals who are "good jack(s) of all trades and master(s) of one" changing the old saying. For implementing this edited saying students will need to address real-world problems, so laboratory-based learning should be even more emphasized in this branch. Consequently, we have also looked on the laboratory works that are included in these courses, considering what aspects should be covered in them. Skillsets required by students such as implementation of hardware, coding, system modeling have been also discussed. Future prospects in this discipline have also been explored. The epilogue consists in recommendations to educational institutions based on our findings.

AB  - Teachers' knowledge of reading comprehension processes is under-researched relative to teachers' knowledge of word identification and phonological awareness. In this study, sixty-two pre- and inservice upper-elementary and middle school English language arts, science, and social studies teachers completed in-depth interview protocols eliciting multiple aspects of knowledge about reading comprehension processes. Using qualitative analyses, we found that teachers in the sample demonstrated knowledge in four consistent areas: strategizing, grappling to achieve coherence, leveraging and producing knowledge, and participating socially. We propose these concepts as a starting point for characterizing teachers' knowledge of how comprehension processes work when they are well developed. We discuss implications of these findings for future research and practice in literacy teacher education.

AB  - As members of a nationally accredited research project (I?+?D+i) InterMED (ref.: FF2011-25500) being carried out in the field of Intercultural Mediation, we are aware of the mediator's delicate role in communicative interactions between health professionals and foreign population. Sales has pointed out the dangers of stereotyping minorities and thus has warned Western citizens "to assume that they are unaware of people's reality coming from other cultures, that prejudices are built due to lack of knowledge and the fear that ignorance entails." For all these reasons, we aim at informing learners enrolled in" English for Physical Therapy" at the University of Alcalá about the importance that nowadays immigration has in public health settings and the role that mediators play in these contexts. This objective can be attained with the help of class blogs, a web 2.0 tool available at the Blackboard online platform, whose teaching and learning uses are currently being researched by the teaching innovation group FILWIT ("Filologías, Wikis y Traducción"; Philology, Wikis and Translation) in the framework of the ALCES ("Aprendizaje de Lenguas y Cultura en Entornos Sociales"; Learning Languages and Culture in Social Networks) project. The interdisciplinary spirit guiding the present teaching experience strives to show that students can learn a foreign language at the same time as they come into contact with multiculturalism in public health services.

AB  - Science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) advocates commonly emphasize an interdisciplinary, authentic, project-based, and technology-based approach to learning, though the strength of prior research varies. This study examines the association between a range of classroom activities and academic performance gains in math and science. Using longitudinal data from North Carolina middle school students, estimates of the effect of classroom practice are generated. Indicators for listening and taking notes and using computers, calculators, or other machines in math class were most positively correlated with student gains in math achievement. Similarly, indicators for completing a science experiment or project and listening to the teacher explain something about science showed positive correlations with gains on the eighth-grade science exam. These relationships held when limiting the analysis to underrepresented racial minorities.

AB  - In this special issue, the authors purport to interrogate and further their understanding of the commonly cited term, "design," specifically "learner-generated designs." This issue brings together scholars from multiple disciplines, including learning sciences, literacy studies, science education, digital media, and pedagogy, to examine the notion of "learner-generated designs" in both formal and informal learning environments. Multidisciplinary perspectives provide ways of understanding how learners take hold of their culture of learning, shaping it to be more participatory, communicative, collaborative, and digital. The authors argue that "learner-generated designs" provide opportunities for learners to bring in their objects or ideas of significance to engage in pedagogic discourse with their peers and teachers or mentors. "Learner-generated designs" focus the discourse on the learners' ways of being, doing, and knowing; identity; and embodied experiences of artifacts in different domains of their lives. This commentary will draw on the authors' research to elucidate the notion of "learner-generated designs."

AB  - In this article, co-written by a self-identified White female professor and a self-identified Black male doctoral student, the authors address the pressing need to train and retain a teacher workforce willing and able to foster equity for students from nondominant racial, ethnic, and linguistic backgrounds. They make three arguments. First, the impact of educator work is deeply entwined with student and teacher identities as well as the cultural knowledges, histories, and experiences that students and teachers bring to classrooms. Second, professional knowledge must be interdisciplinary, drawing on a number of social science and humanities disciplines to inform practice and ongoing inquiry in practice. Third, the critical shortage of research on the interaction between individual and collective educator identities and teacher learning must be addressed. The authors conclude with a call to regroup the preparation of all educators, including special educators, to become more explicit and present in discourse about ability, race, gender, sexuality, and other identity markers. Both discourse and curricula need to represent and educate our nation's students about the rich tapestry of diversity that manifests in multiple forms of knowledge, social, political, and intellectual capital. The teacher workforce needs to be prepared and supported to do this work.

AB  - Shifts in the ways that science is being undertaken and marshaled toward social change argue for a new kind of professional competence. Taking the view that the science of social work is centrally about the relationship of research to social impact, the authors extend Fong's focus on transdisciplinary and translational approaches to science, illustrating ways that national and international priorities are exerting enormous influence in structures for and expectations of science relevant to social work. The authors also emphasize the growing centrality of transformational research, focusing in particular on the interdependence of education and impact. The intent is to stimulate reflectiveness regarding social work's preparedness to support and indeed amplify a robust culture of high impact science, including more confident, clearly articulated roles and skills in this contemporary scientific landscape.

AB  - Colleges are engaging students in collaborative design courses on diverse projects. More of the courses could be focusing on cross-disciplinary entrepreneurship projects including computer science and information systems students with other disciplinary students. The authors of this paper describe a course that is focusing on collaborative design and cross-disciplinary entrepreneurship on innovation projects by students as members of self-directed teams. The course is involving the students on crowdfunding projects of product prototyping, from which they are learning a marketable repertoire of skills. The findings of this paper will be beneficial to educators in colleges of computer science and information systems considering enriching pedagogical practices to be contemporary with the demands of industry.

AB  - The powerful and complex mandates arising from reports such as "The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health" and "Health Professionals for a New Century: Transforming Education to Strengthen Health Systems in an Interdependent World" challenge colleges and universities to reconsider how they deliver nursing education. Future healthcare professionals require greater focus on interdisciplinary, team-based, interprofessional, community-based, and international experiences. For Jesuit colleges and universities, these demands are added to--though also complement--our longstanding and deep commitment to ensure Catholic mission and identity are embodied in teaching, learning, and service in nursing programs. This article describes how these mandates are inspiring innovations in our nursing programs, and guiding our integrative health sciences initiatives for all students. Emphasis is on reducing global health inequities, improving healthcare literacy for all students, and encouraging interdisciplinary collaborative research. Several challenges are identified for successful implementation and sustainability.

AB  - Physical World is a one-semester course designed for elementary education majors, that integrates earth science, astronomy, and physics. The course is part of a four-course set that explores science concepts, processes, and skills, along with the nature of scientific practice, that are included in state and national standards for elementary school science. Geoscience concepts, such as water and seismic waves, are used to illustrate general principles of physics, such as wave transmission, refraction, reflection, and interference. Laboratories are drawn from both introductory physics and earth science courses and have been redesigned to have a strong inquiry component. Pre-assessments were used to evaluate students' prior knowledge of key ideas. The use of pyramid tests measurably enhanced student performance. A major theme of the course is how science is represented (and misrepresented) in the media. Pedagogical challenges encountered in the course are due to various factors, two main ones being lack of previous experience with the natural world among a largely urban student body and the diversity of material that the course covers.

AB  - Graduate students face a fundamental change in identity when transitioning from undergraduate writers to graduate writers. In their new role as graduate writers and researchers, they must move from consuming knowledge to producing knowledge through their writing. Often, they must learn new genres of writing, new disciplinary conventions, and new rhetorical models. For non-native English speakers, these tasks are even more complex because of the advanced language skills required and the cultural differences in rhetorical models. This article explains teaching strategies for an interdisciplinary, graduate-level scientific writing course for non-native English speakers. For TESOL instructors who are accustomed to general undergraduate writing, this article will offer suggestions for scientific writing at the graduate level. For composition instructors who do not specialize in TESOL, this article provides ways of adapting graduate-level scientific writing conventions to an audience of international students.

AB  - Fabrication of molecular devices will meet the demands of the miniaturization of traditional electronic devices. Although microfabrication based on the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process can fabricate high-quality single-molecule devices, the cost is high, leading to a challenge to provide a hands-on experiment in the teaching practice of charge transport through single-molecule devices. Here, we demonstrate the low cost and simple procedures associated with a mechanically controllable break junction (MCBJ) technique to fabricate single-molecule devices. On the basis of the MCBJ technique, the conductance of gold-gold atomic contacts and single-molecule junctions can be readily characterized. The teaching practice helps students understand charge transport at the single-molecule level, that is, the quantum tunneling mechanisms. Moreover, the MCBJ technique study provides students the opportunity to develop interdisciplinary thinking, which is vital for understanding, designing, and developing single-molecule electronics.

AB  - Like science, poetry often involves a high level of abstraction in language and ideas, requiring specific critical-thinking skills and promoting interaction. Casteel and Isom (1994) acknowledge, "The literacy processes are the means by which science content is learned because content information is rooted in written and oral language" (p. 540). Infusing poetry into the science curriculum can serve to jump-start or introduce a topic, present examples of terminology or concepts, provide closure that is concept-rich, or extend a science topic further. This article describes an interdisciplinary lesson using poetry and science that highlights the parallels of the disciplines while developing literacy.

AB  - The enrichment of plant foods with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is currently an interesting issue in the field of nutraceuticals and can be used as an experiment for upper-division undergraduate students. Here, an interdisciplinary hands-on experiment to produce GABA-enriched mung bean sprouts using common household reagents is described. Based on the GABA biosynthesis pathways, two key factors, being the availability of l-glutamic acid and the acidification of the germination environment, were chosen for the study of the effects on the enhancement of GABA levels. The activities not only led students to a deeper understanding of biochemistry contents, but also gave the students the opportunity to work with experimental design, analytical chemistry, and statistical data analysis. Furthermore, since mung bean sprouts are familiar foods and the reagents used for germination are easily obtainable and generally recognized as safe, the optimal protocol investigated in the lab could be further applied to the production of bean sprouts with enhanced nutritional values in everyday life, promoting the transfer of knowledge learned in school to practical environments such as home and community.

AB  - This paper situates a critical review of studies that we have conducted within the broader research literature to analyze the affordances of integrating modeling within disciplinarily-integrated games from computational thinking and science as practice perspectives. Across the studies, the analyses pursue two themes: (a) the role of agent-based modeling as a synergistic local practice around which we can integrate computational thinking and scientific modeling within digital games and (b) the role of collaboration in leveraging those synergies. We then present a design of a disciplinarily-integrated game that integrates these themes to demonstrate one such possible instantiation of the themes. Finally, we discuss the implications for design and praxis with a particular focus on learning in classrooms across the curriculum. Specifically, we first explore the implications in terms of connecting to teachers' views of practice by framing computational modeling and computational thinking as mathematization. We then explore the implications of shifting from a focus on single players to communities of practice in terms of computational participation as science as practice. We close by exploring the pragmatic and pedagogical affordances of shifting from stand-alone single-topic games to flexible agent-based environments in terms of student development across the curriculum.

AB  - We describe how a team approach that we developed as a mentoring strategy can be used to recruit, advance, and guide students to be more interested in the interdisciplinary field of mathematical biology, and lead to success in undergraduate research in this field. Students are introduced to research in their first semester via lab rotations. Their participation in the research of four faculty members--two from biology and two from mathematics--gives them a first-hand overview of research in quantitative biology and also some initial experience in research itself. However, one of the primary goals of the lab rotation experience is that of developing teams of students and faculty that combine mathematics and statistics with biology and the life sciences, teams that subsequently mentor undergraduate research in genuine interdisciplinary environments. Thus, the team concept serves not only as a means of establishing interdisciplinary research, but also as a means of incorporating new students into existing research efforts that will then track those students into meaningful research of their own. We report how the team concept is used to support undergraduate research in mathematical biology and what types of team-building strategies have worked for us. (Contains 3 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - The present transformation of the university system is conceptualized in terms of such terminologies as "Mode-2 knowledge production" and the "entrepreneurial university." What is remarkable about these analyses is how closely they link the generally accepted requirement of more socially relevant knowledge to the commercialization of university research. This paper critically examines the Mode-1/Mode-2 distinction through a combination of philosophical and empirical analysis. It argues that, from the perspective of actual scientific practice, this Mode-1/Mode-2 distinction and the related transition thesis do not stand closer scrutiny. Theoretical "Mode-1" science shares "Mode-2" features in being also problem-oriented, interventive and transdisciplinary. On the other hand, the empirical case on language technology demonstrates that even in "Mode-2"-like research, undertaken in the "context of application," scientists make a distinction between more difficult scientific problems and those that are considered more applied or commercial. Moreover, the case shows that the need to make such distinctions may even become more acute due to the compromises imposed by the commercialization of research.

AB  - A comprehensive undergraduate experience encompasses a broad survey of the humanities, arts, social sciences, and multicultural and global education, as well as mathematics, science, and technology. These disciplines are essential components of a liberal arts education that prepares students with the skills and knowledge to navigate an increasingly complex and dynamic future, regardless of disciplinary major. In recent decades, decreasing enrollments and shrinking budgets have begun to threaten the very existence of many of these programs. In response, some leaders are electing to eliminate liberal arts majors in favor of supporting career and workforce preparation programs, while others are piloting innovative curricular redesign across disciplines that coherently integrates liberal arts programs with professional and career pathways. This study utilized the policy Delphi method to engage a panel of education experts in an iterative conversation around how to manage decreasing enrollments in liberal arts courses and programs. The goal was to generate a robust set of policy options designed to enable higher education leaders to optimally respond to the myriad internal and external threats to the liberal arts disciplines. The recommendation to innovate liberal arts programs and courses could take years to operationalize, but with good strategic planning and faculty engagement, it may be the key to saving liberal arts education.

AB  - Currently, STEAM (science, technology, engineering, math, and art) education is on the rise. Asmore schools are adopting a STEAM model, professional development is needed. Non-arts teachers need to learn how to infuse the arts into STEM subjects and vice versa. Teachers need to understand that STEAM education must use culturally relevant teaching (CRT) in order to help close the achievement gap for underrepresented students. In 2016, a team of college faculty members collaborated to create an innovative multimodal approach to teaching STEAM as a professional development that would be offered at a conference targeting educators from across the country. The professional development approach had five segments: (1) storytelling examples, (2) infusion of the arts into STEM, (3) technology, (4) CRT and storytelling, and (5) participant worktime and showcase. It was designed in a way that unpacked the process by introducing techniques, procedures, methods, and pedagogies using the arts; exploring STEM subjects in a creative way; and considering how CRT practices could be applied. The workshop: (1) Provided educators several models to help students construct academic knowledge through artmaking and storytelling; (2) Gave students the voice or the cultural competence to approach standards in ways that make the information relevant; and (3) Used artmaking as a means for students to develop a sociopolitical consciousness and evoke change.

AB  - This article explores Vanessa Anthony-Stevens and Sammy Matsaw's paper "The Productive Uncertainty of Indigenous and Decolonizing Methodologies in the Preparation of Interdisciplinary STEM Researchers". That paper reports on a small qualitative study on how STEM students in the field of natural resources management react to the inclusion of Indigenous ways of knowing in their interdisciplinary research methodologies course. The authors are engaging contested intersections of knowledge that are notoriously difficult to negotiate. I argue that the inclusion of Indigenous 'ways of knowing' into the water resource management curriculum is based on Morgan's (in: McKinley, Smith (eds) Handbook of indigenous education, Springer, Singapore, pp 111-128, 2019. 10.1007/978-981-10-3899-0) idea of the 'guest paradigm'. At the same time, and in contrast, I also argue that the inclusion of Indigenous knowledge in the curriculum cannot just occur in the classroom but needs to be considered at an institutional and individual level as well. The project should be seen as a small step within a wider Indigenous agenda of decolonizing the Eurocentric curriculum.

AB  - Collaborative problem solving is an essential component of any 21st century science career. Scientists are hired, retained, and promoted for solving problems in dynamic and interdisciplinary teams. They discuss issues, explain and justify their opinions, debate, elaborate, and reflect on their collective knowledge. At the same time, both educational researchers and practitioners note a dissonance between the demands of real-world scientific problem solving and the current educational capacity to prepare effective problem solvers. This article addresses this issue by describing the DEEPER framework for scaffolding collaborative problem solving that was designed to address the student outcomes outlined by the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (2011). The DEEPER scaffolding framework was empirically tested in a large-enrollment undergraduate Entomology course, and although no effects were observed on domain knowledge acquisition or transfer of problem solving, DEEPER served as a useful model for developing the process skills required for 21st century collaborative problem solving.

AB  - This paper offers a synthesis about the wide range of psychological variables which influence how a person adapts when they are in a new or unfamiliar cultural context. This study takes as its starting points the educational value of the intercultural experience and the need to study this experience from interdisciplinary and plural focuses that enrich the light shed by different sciences and knowledge in their comprehension, description and explanation. The objectives of this study are as follows: 1) to describe and explain some of the important psychological variables which are influential in the exposure to new or unfamiliar cultural contexts from the perspective of current transcultural psychology; 2) to focus on intercultural competence as a current relevant dimension in the educational process of each person, and specifically in how international university students who are temporary residents of another country manage cultural transition; and 3) to situate intercultural competence in the process of the construction of cultural identities, promoting relationships with higher levels of equality and solidarity between different actors, peoples and cultures. The study of intercultural competence will be applied to the educational process which affects 10% of international university students, with contributions from transcultural psychology. Transcultural psychology offers today psychological tools and a perspective that are indispensable to understand, describe and explain better intercultural competence in the 21st century.

AB  - Social studies education in Turkey is a multidisciplinary field. One of these disciplines is religion. Social studies education can benefit from religion in terms of nurturing effective citizenship. The purpose of this study is to identify and compare the values intersecting the primary religious sources of Islam and the content of social studies education. Document analysis was employed as the method of comparison. The documents represented the verses of the Qur'an and the words of prophet Muhammad. The analysis focused on the values of respect for rights and freedoms, benevolence, justice, honesty, and respect for differences, among a few others. The results of the analysis demonstrate that true Islam espouses all these values and instructs all Muslims to live according to these values. Additionally, learning about Islam from its authentic religious texts dispels misconception of that religion and enhances citizenship education.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to provide information on the main tendencies across the transformation of the official holidays calendar in Ukraine over the last decades and to demonstrate its influence on school celebrations. Also discussed here is the role of these factors in the parallel but sometimes contradictory processes of the students' civic identity formation. Design/Methodology/Approach: The article is based on documentary analysis, an interdisciplinary literature review and an examination of current practices with regard to national holidays in Ukraine. Patriotic rituals are analyzed through examples and evidence of school celebrations of the main calendar dates, including audiovisual materials in different school settings. The authors' observations have been corroborated with evidence from Ukrainian students and teachers as seen in the results of the questionnaire. These reflect their perception and experience of school celebrations. Findings: The results demonstrate that the transformation of the official holidays calendar in Ukraine has had an impact on school commemoration practices. This in turn has become a factor in the formation of students' civic identity. School patriotic rituals reflect a contradiction between the discourses of citizenship, patriotism and national upbringing in an emergent democracy in the continuing context of military conflict.

AB  - Contribution: Although engineering hackathon events are common, this is one of the first reports of such an event used for the purpose of teaching engineering students about public health concepts. Results from this study suggest that hackathons are an effective format for teaching topics that are not core to the engineering discipline in a short period of time. Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the essential role that computer scientists and engineers have in controlling disease outbreaks. However, engineering programs generally do not provide training on public health issues. Thus, there is a critical need to develop innovative and engaging ways to educate engineering students about public health without interfering with required discipline-specific content. Intended Outcomes: Hackathons, short-term events, held outside of the classroom, can provide an engaging and effective method for increasing the interest and knowledge of engineering students in disease outbreaks. In this article, the effectiveness of a hack day in increasing the interest and knowledge of engineering students in disease outbreaks is assessed. Application Design: One-hundred-six undergraduate students, 30 of whom were engineering majors, participated in a multidisciplinary disease focused hackathon. Student learning and engagement during the hackathon was assessed for the 30 engineering students that participated through pre- and post-event surveys. Findings: The results indicated that the hackathon increased both content knowledge and engagement of engineering students in public health issues. Additionally, students gained an increased understanding of public health professions and how they can contribute to disease tracking, prevention, and treatment. Therefore, hackathons are an effective and efficient tool for teaching engineering students about topics outside of their discipline.

AB  - Efforts to promote the use of student-centered learning environments in STEM education have been tempered by a lack of professional development strategies that help faculty overcome common barriers to reform. This study investigated the impact that adopting a suite of student-centered teaching materials had on the teaching practices and beliefs of eight geoscience faculty at a variety of US institutions. Each instructor adopted 18 class lessons that were developed as part of the InTeGrate (Interdisciplinary Teaching about the Earth for a Sustainable Future) project into a semester-long course. The Teaching Practices Inventory (TPI) and Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP) were used to collect data on teaching practices whereas instructor beliefs were captured with the Teacher Beliefs Interview (TBI). Data were collected over three semesters, a control semester using traditional materials, a pilot semester using the new materials, and a final treatment semester. While the TPI survey showed no self-reported changes in the practices, RTOP observations recorded the incorporation of more student-centered teaching practices. TBI results confirm that most of the instructors also made at least moderate shifts toward more student-centered beliefs about teaching and learning. These findings demonstrate that the adoption of well-crafted, student-centered instructional materials can have a positive impact on both the teaching practices and beliefs of college faculty.

AB  - Kinesiology emerged from its preventative medicine and education roots to establish itself as a recognized field of inquiry with numerous sub-disciplines. This article presents four trends in modern science that will likely influence the future of kinesiology sciences. Will recent increases in greater scientific specialization be overcome by the need for greater integration and collaborative research? Will recent increases in emphasis on "greater impacts" from funded research continue? Will new kinds of review and journals replace traditional emphases on prestigious, peer-reviewed journals? Will advancements in technology increase complexity and integration of kinesiology sciences? With attention to the dangers and opportunities in these four trends, kinesiology faculty are well positioned to increase the visibility and funding of kinesiology sciences.

AB  - Can questions sent to Open-Educational-Resource (OER) websites such as Ask-An-Expert serve as indicators for students' interest in science? This issue was examined using an online questionnaire which included an equal number of questions about the topics "space" and "nutrition" randomly selected from three different sources: a 5th-grade science textbook, the "Ask-An-Expert" website, and questions collected from other students in the same age group. A sample of 113 5th-graders from two elementary schools were asked to rate their interest level in finding out the answer to these questions without knowledge of their source. Significant differences in students' interest level were found between questions: textbook questions were ranked lowest for both subjects, and questions from the open-resource were ranked high. This finding suggests that questions sent to an open-resource could be used as an indicator of students' interest in science. In addition, the high correlation of interests expressed by students from the two schools may point to a potential generalization of the findings. This study contributes by highlighting OER as a new and promising indicator of student interest, which may help bring "student voices" into main-stream science teaching to increase student interest in science.

AB  - Inspired by "BIO2010" and leveraging institutional and external funding, Truman State University built an undergraduate program in mathematical biology with high-quality, faculty-mentored interdisciplinary research experiences at its core. These experiences taught faculty and students to bridge the epistemological gap between the mathematical and life sciences. Together they created the infrastructure that currently supports several interdisciplinary courses, an innovative minor degree, and long-term interdepartmental research collaborations. This article describes how the program was built with support from the National Science Foundation's Interdisciplinary Training for Undergraduates in Biology and Mathematics program, and it shares lessons learned that will help other undergraduate institutions build their own program.

AB  - Since the inception of the Every Student Succeeds Act [ESSA] of 2016, the US has brought focus to the role that research and evidence should play into the decision-making process of stakeholders [ESSA, 2015]. As members of the field turn to research and the knowledge base at large to shape practice, there is incentive to explore the knowledge base to pinpoint influential publications retrospectively. To that end, the focus of this study was to generate a summary of the key characteristics of the top-cited publications that pertain to different categories (e.g., cross-disciplinary, learners and learning, diversity and differences, teachers, teaching and teacher education, and physical education curriculum) relating to physical education (PE). Specifically, the focus was to create lists of the top 20 cited publications on different PE research categories. A systematic search on the Web of Science [WoS] was enacted using keywords related to PE. The research team independently reviewed the results and screened the top 20 lists. Extracted data provided points for further examination of the sum of citations, type of study, journal, authorship, and country of publication. As of September 15th, 2021, the top 20 lists have been cited 25,617 times. These publications have been disseminated across 48 different journals. On average, each publication had 3.6 authors, the USA and England as the leaders in terms of country of publication. In creating these top 20 lists of the top-cited publications involving PE, the research team hopes to provide members of the PE field with an easy to consume reading list of top-cited research and a concise summary of the publication characteristics.

AB  - Prior research from the field of science communication shows that, upon reading journalistic articles about novel scientific findings, readers who recognize the tentative nature of the findings rate the journalistic article that reports these findings as less credible. Apparently, readers' appraisal is influenced by misconceptions about the relationship of text credibility and the tentativeness of research findings. In four experimental studies (N = 301; N = 481; N = 68; N = 69) to test how this negative association might be overcome, we used different settings (online, laboratory), various samples (American, German), and different scientific topics (Deep Brain Stimulation, hypnotherapy, oceanic plastic pollution). We provided participants either with a refutation text that confronted the misjudgment of scientific tentativeness or with a control text. Refutation texts supported people in overcoming these misconceptions and even affected their behavior. Our results contribute to closing the gap between science communication and education, and carry important implications for practical implementation and further research.

AB  - Chemistry students in Israel have two options for studying chemistry: basic or honors (advanced placement). For instruction in high school honors chemistry courses, we developed a module focusing on abstract topics in quantum mechanics: Chemistry--From the Nanoscale to Microelectronics. The module adopts a visual-conceptual approach, which replaces mathematical derivations and includes interdisciplinary, real-life applications. The module has also been used as enrichment material for an undergraduate mathematically oriented quantum chemistry course. We assessed the comprehension of quantum mechanical concepts and the thinking skills of high school honors students and undergraduate chemistry students who studied this module. These skills included visual and textual chemical understanding, graphing, and far transfer of learning. Participants included over 100 high school honors students in high and intermediate levels, and over 60 undergraduate students, with students separated into groups of those exposed to the module and those who received mathematics enrichment instead. The questionnaires revealed that both high school honors students and undergraduate students improved their scores. High-level academic students outperformed their undergraduate peers, and undergraduate students who had been exposed to the module outperformed undergraduates who had studied the topic with mathematical enrichment. The research contributes to the field of teaching quantum mechanics and thinking skills, suggesting that high school honors students and undergraduate students could benefit from studying quantum mechanics using a visual-conceptual approach along with real-life applications. This contribution is part of a special issue on teaching introductory chemistry in the context of the advanced placement (AP) chemistry course redesign.

AB  - The historical development of food education in secondary schools in New South Wales Australia is a compelling yet under-researched area of interest. This review starts by exploring how food curricula have evolved since the 1700s to the present day juxtaposed on socio-economic and political factors. This review is interested in the role secondary food education may play in "supplying" people into professional studies towards a career as a food technologist. Accordingly this review compares contemporary secondary food curriculum with related curricula in the higher education sector and establishes a marked dissonance between the two. The implications of this are then put forward. The drive to empower students to be enterprising and innovative twenty first century problem solvers in relation to food design through the interdisciplinary nature of food science is discussed, despite the uncertainty as to what degree Food Technology in schools is currently promoting these life-long and life-wide abilities in students. The authors suggest the lack of a theoretical underpinning may be holding the subject back from becoming a robust discipline. For this reason this review puts forward a conceptual framework for the study of food. The following review is relevant to secondary and higher education food education stakeholders (teachers, academics, curriculum developers, professional food industry) and higher education providers nationally and internationally, as the way in which food education is presented in secondary schooling is not contained to the Australian context alone.

AB  - The question of where to locate teaching about the relationships between science and religion has produced a long-running debate. Currently, science and religious education (RE) are statutory subjects in England and are taught in secondary schools by different teachers. This paper reports on an interview study in which 16 teachers gave their perceptions of their roles and responsibilities when teaching topics that bridge science and religion and the extent to which they collaborated with teachers in the other subject areas. We found that in this sample, teachers reported very little collaboration between the curriculum areas. Although the science curriculum makes no mention of religion, all the science teachers said that their approaches to such topics were affected by their recognition that some pupils held religious beliefs. All the RE teachers reported struggling to ensure students know of a range of views about how science and religion relate. The paper concludes with a discussion about implications for curriculum design and teacher training.

AB  - With its distinct characteristics, the research article (hereafter RA) abstract has been a major area of interest within the field of metadiscourse. Investigating authorial presence displayed in RA abstracts can play an important role in illuminating the nature of the interaction among the writer, the text, and the reader. This study aimed to shed light on the disciplinary variation on how much, and for what purposes, authorial presence is shown in RA abstracts through the use of the first-person plural pronoun "we" as an engagement marker (the inclusive form) and a self-mention device (the exclusive form) using a corpus of RA abstracts in the fields of Bioengineering and Software Engineering (hard sciences), and Psychology and Sociology (soft sciences). The inclusive "we" was found to be very rare, therefore, the majority of the analysis focused on the exclusive "we." The results indicated a considerable variation across the sampled disciplines and a general tendency to use self-mention when explaining purposes, procedures, and results, but not when introducing and concluding, or elaborating arguments. The findings of this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of the disciplinary variation in the use and communicative functions of "we," which could enhance academic writing practices.

AB  - We define and describe the academic studio model for interdisciplinary, undergraduate, project-oriented education. This model brings faculty, students, and community partners together to investigate an openended academic question, and their collaboration yields an original product that represents their inquiry. The academic studio integrates agile software development practice, project-oriented pedagogy, and sociocultural cognition theories. Scrum provides the framework in which self-organizing, cross-functional teams define their methodology, and Scrum practices facilitate assessment of student learning outcomes. This model emerged from design-based research across six studio instances, each of which investigated the relationship of fun, games, and learning through the development of educational video games. Formal and informal analysis of these instances gives rise to several themes, including the importance of a formalized process to encourage learning and productivity, the critical role of an expert faculty mentor, the need to combine academic and industrial practice to manage the inherent challenges of collaborative software development, and the unique characteristics of learning outcomes arising from this model. We conclude that the academic studio model is beneficial to student learning and faculty development, and we encourage the adoption, adaptation, and evaluation of the model.

AB  - Humanistic medicine, as an interdisciplinary science, synthesizes knowledge concerning medical philosophy, medical ethics, medical law, medical history, medical sociology, medical logic, and doctor-patient communication. On Mainland China, increasing attention is being paid to humanistic medicine, as evidenced by doctoral education programs being carried out at Shandong University, Dalian Medical University, and Nanjing Medical University. Constructing the discipline of humanistic medicine involves team building, academic research, academic activities, academic journals, and personnel cultivation. The development of humanistic medicine on the Chinese mainland is characterized by systematic planning, standard teaching arrangements, intensified clinical practice, and a new mode of cultivating advanced talent.

AB  - This research is an empowerment of the potential of vocational school teachers in the form of scientific writing to function as a vehicle for communication and dissemination of works and ideas for teachers or others. The problems are: (1) the making of scientific papers of any type is partly, vocational teachers do not understand much and are unable to write good scientific works, are still done traditionally, whereas writing web-based scientific papers/research is urgently needed in the revolutionary era and society now and in the future. (2). Until now, "SMK" (Vocational High Schools) have not strengthened the ability to respond to the needs of the world of work, business, industry with innovation and digital-based interdisciplinary curriculum, education in "SMK" should be as a reference for innovation, and most responsive to the development of knowledge and technology according to the needs of industry and civil society. is the ability to change midset action in writing scientific papers, which are designed through implementation, and empowering the potential of vocational school teachers in the methods of editing, inquiry, compiling the results of scientific papers and others relevant to the development of the era of the industrial revolution and the Society. Research methods include holding workshops. training scenarios using in class systems on the job training and presentation of results on the job, at the end of the workshop, motivating and creativity, a web-based scientific/research writing contest was held using the science and technology media built through vocational teachers. The results of the study include: (1) The realization of birth of human resources (teachers) in vocational schools, especially in Bandung in writing web-based scientific research and digitizing in Management of Multicultural Education with Strengthening Education and National Identity in an integrated manner in line with the development of the Industrial Revolutionary Era and society.

AB  - As society increasingly relies on digital technologies in many different aspects, those who lack relevant access and skills are lagging increasingly behind. Among the underserved groups disproportionately affected by the digital divide are women who are transitioning from incarceration and seeking to reenter the workforce outside the carceral system (women-in-transition). Women-in-transition rarely have been exposed to sound technology education, as they have generally been isolated from the digital environment while in incarceration. Furthermore, while women have become the fastest-growing segment of the incarcerated population in the United States in recent decades, prison education and reentry programs are still not well adjusted for them. Most programs are mainly designed for the dominant male population. Consequently, women-in-transition face significant post-incarceration challenges in accessing and using relevant digital technologies and thus have added difficulties in entering or reentering the workforce. Against this backdrop, our multi-disciplinary research team has conducted empirical research as part of technology education offered to women-in-transition in the Midwest. In this article, we report results from our interviews with 75 women-in-transition in the Midwest that were conducted to develop a tailored technology education program for the women. More than half of the participants in our study are women of color and face precarious housing and financial situations. Then, we discuss principles that we adopted in developing our education program for the marginalized women and participants' feedback on the program. Our team launched in-person sessions with women-in-reentry at public libraries in February 2020 and had to move the sessions online in March due to COVID-19. Our research-informed educational program is designed primarily to support the women in enhancing their knowledge and comfort with technology and nurturing computational thinking. Our study shows that low self-efficacy and mental health challenges, as well as lack of resources for technology access and use, are some of the major issues that need to be addressed in supporting technology learning among women-in-transition. This research offers scholarly and practical implications for computing education for women-in-transition and other marginalized populations.

AB  - Various science education researchers believe that science tuition should include some discussion about how science has developed over time. Therefore, deliberations about the nature of science should be integrated in the science curriculum. Many researchers argue that teaching the history of science is a good way to place the nature of science in science classes. This paper contributes to this debate and argues the importance of having young students study the birth of modern science. Such study could allow students to understand that some of the issues about the nature of science arose in the seventeenth century with the birth of modern science. To achieve this purpose, it is important to discuss the different factors that immersed the birth of modern science. To accomplish this goal, the novel "The Name of the Rose" by Umberto Eco may be used. Beyond introducing issues surrounding the nature of science, this strategy could help overcome the separation between the arts and humanities in education.

AB  - Despite statistical evidence that a majority of faculty, students, and WPAs are impacted by trauma, the field has yet to establish a trauma-informed approach to writing program administration. As a result, WPAs are left to operate without evidence-based, field-specific, best practices as we remain mindful of our own trauma reflexes and careful with the trauma responses of our constituents. In an effort to help move the field forward, this article incorporates concepts of compassion fatigue and vicarious trauma while unpacking data of the types of trauma impacting students, faculty, and WPAs. Moreover, this article proposes steps to take in order to (1) add our voices to the interdisciplinary field of trauma studies and (2) establish intersectional trauma-informed WPA leadership practices specific to higher educational settings.

AB  - Teaching STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and math) in elementary school could be even more promising than teaching STEM. This is due to its ability to cross multiple subject areas and its appeal to multiple types of learners. Intentional integration of the arts in science and engineering lessons has the potential to more deeply engage all learners. Ultimately, STEAM teaching is about the student rather than the subject areas--students may see themselves not just as future scientists or engineers but also as designers or creators. In this integrated STEAM lesson, fourth-grade students design roller coasters. The lesson builds on existing roller coaster lessons by emphasizing the arts throughout the design process, as students use their imaginations and engineering skills to create their own designs.

AB  - Three years after Japan integrated "programming" into all elementary school subjects, questions remain on how policy is being put into practice in arts education. This article examines the current state of "programming" - activities addressing a local version of computational thinking - in music, with a focus on Japan's pending challenges. First, an analysis of 23 activity reports sheds light on the main features of implementation efforts conducted by elementary school teachers from all over the country. Notably, compliance with official guidelines seems to have been prioritized over subject-specific contents, and, in some cases, the mere use of digital technologies in the classroom appears to be more relevant than programming and music-making goals. Following that, two key stakeholders - Japanese professionals engaged in planning and implementing "programming" in music in elementary schools - provide insights on its present state and future prospects through an open questionnaire. Their often-contrasting answers include perspectives on learning goals, teachers' skills and assessment, as well as their expectations and concerns. A number of unresolved issues and tensions persist regarding how subject contents and "programming" should be balanced. Given this situation, final remarks address how music-centered, postdigital views of "programming" may inform future initiatives in the intersection of computing science and music education.

AB  - The new field of Mind, Brain, and Education (MBE)--sometimes called educational neuroscience--is posited as a mediator between neuroscience and education. Several foundational concerns, however, can be raised about this emerging field. The differences between neuroscience and education are many, including differences in their histories, philosophies, and epistemologies. Historically, science and education have demonstrated separate, but interwoven, influences on society; philosophically, the values by which they operate are often in opposition; and epistemologically, the fields have relied on different conceptualizations of knowledge. Discussion about these differences has been largely absent in attempts to promote MBE. Two steps are proposed to respond to this omission. First, encouraging discussion about disciplinary differences and assumptions may enable better understanding between disciplines and facilitate the establishment of a more collaborative research community. Second, a "transdisciplinary" framework that focuses on salient issues of interest across disciplines should be considered. Transdisciplinarity aims for the creation of an inclusive research environment that transcends traditional disciplinary approaches to complex problems. This article initiates an exploration of disciplinary differences and proposes commitment to transdisciplinarity as a guiding principle that may increase the viability of MBE as a mediating field between neuroscience and education.

AB  - The use of collaborative problem solving within mathematics education is imperative in this day and age of integrative science. The formation of interdisciplinary teams of mathematicians and scientists to investigate crucial problems is on the rise, as greater insight can be gained from an interdisciplinary perspective. Mathematical modelling, in particular, is increasingly recognised as a fundamental tool in understanding scientific phenomena, with models utilising mathematical disciplines ranging from statistics to differential equations. Geometry is an effective tool in biomechanical modelling, and one that has been used to develop a series of lessons regarding the functional importance of mathematics in nature. In this article, the authors present a lesson in which geometry is used to model the suction feeding mechanism of the Goliath Grouper, and the consequences of geometric variability for organismal performance are explored.

AB  - Children are the foundation of the United States, and supporting them is a key component of building a successful future. However, millions of children face health inequities that compromise their development, well-being, and long-term outcomes, despite substantial scientific evidence about how those adversities contribute to poor health. Advancements in neurobiological and socio-behavioral science show that critical biological systems develop in the prenatal through early childhood periods, and neurobiological development is extremely responsive to environmental influences during these stages. Consequently, social, economic, cultural, and environmental factors significantly affect a child's health ecosystem and ability to thrive throughout adulthood. "Vibrant and Healthy Kids: Aligning Science, Practice, and Policy to Advance Health Equity" builds upon and updates research from "Communities in Action: Pathways to Health Equity" (2017) and "From Neurons to Neighborhoods: The Science of Early Childhood Development" (2000). This report provides a brief overview of stressors that affect childhood development and health, a framework for applying current brain and development science to the real world, a roadmap for implementing tailored interventions, and recommendations about improving systems to better align with our understanding of the significant impact of health equity.

AB  - Music is recognized as an effective mode of teaching young children but is rarely used in university-level science courses. This article reviews the somewhat limited evidence on whether and how content-rich music might affect college students' understanding of science and offers practical suggestions for incorporating music into courses. Aside from aiding memorization, songs may potentially improve learning by helping students feel relaxed and welcome in stressful settings, engaging students through multiple modes (verbal vs. nonverbal) and modalities (auditory vs. visual vs. kinesthetic) simultaneously, challenging students to integrate and "own" the material through the medium of song lyrics, and increasing students' time on task outside of class through enjoyable listening or songwriting assignments. Students may produce content-rich songs of good quality if given sufficient assistance and encouragement by instructors and peers. The challenges ahead include 1) defining the circumstances in which music is most likely to promote learning and 2) developing rubrics for evaluating the quality of songs. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - This article describes how researchers take a multidisciplinary approach to investigating how middle grades students learn science vocabulary. The authors investigated teaching strategies for increasing retention of science 
vocabulary with seventh graders and stumbled upon an interesting finding that was not even a target for their study, yet it offered some possible explanations for why students mix up some words. Following this offshoot of evidence led them out of their fields of education and psychology in and down a path to linguistic studies of morphological awareness and to 
possible explanations of their unexpected results. In this article, they present a review of the literature on prefixes and memory confusions due to similarity among terms to provide some context for their findings. They analyze word morphology and cite studies on morphological instruction, noting that the use of morphological instruction to improve retention of vocabulary words is inconclusive, especially with prefix study.

AB  - This paper invites readers to reconsider the role of Art in the learning of social sciences in higher education based on the ability of the arts to promote understanding among students about their world of life. The new pathways opened up by multimodality offer access to vast repositories of images such as Flickr (Davies, 2007; Castañeda, 2009), and museums that exhibit high quality reproductions of their art collections (Google Art Project). Furthermore, students can express themselves by combining their own images with text (multiliteracies--The New London Group, 1996; Leander, K & Boldt, G., 2012). Multimodal literacy represents a powerful tool to observe and record of all kinds of interesting events for social science students that can be shared and debated on social media. Moreover, following John Dewey (1980) about aesthetic experience, the new form of literacy, as result of combining imagens and texts, represents an excellent way to trigger sensible and aesthetic feelings .

AB  - In traditional preservice teacher education programs, education courses are "add-ons" to science content courses. As a result, future teachers are taught the importance of authentic inquiry and constructivism, but they may never learn science in the way they are expected to teach it. University of California San Diego's California Teach program bridges this divide through genuine sharing of expertise between the faculty of Physical Sciences and the faculty of Education Studies in a new undergraduate program that was developed, approved, and implemented within one year. Lessons learned from the collaborative efforts to design the program have relevance to those at other institutions seeking to bridge the divide between the science and education departments or to develop other interdisciplinary academic programs. The California Teach formula for success includes five key ingredients: (a) mutual benefits, (b) recognition of distinct sets of expertise, (c) agreement on core principles, (d) willingness to negotiate, and (e) strong leadership. In concert with administrative buy-in and advocacy, science education faculty catalyzed collaboration by changing attitudes locally and across departments.

AB  - This study examines the effects of a design thinking intervention on first-year students' teamwork skills from a multi-actor perspective. A design thinking course was evaluated throughout a semester. Six-hundred-and-forty university students participated, guided by twenty-six facilitators. The students received in-class training and worked in multi-disciplinary teams to develop a solution for a real-life problem. In this quasi-experimental study, data were collected twice: in the middle (t1), and at the end (t2) of the course. Each time, students were rated by their teammates, themselves, and the course facilitator, using a rubric to map teamwork skills. The results show a significant improvement in teamwork skills, as consistently observed in the three ratings. The results also show a significant effect of sex on the improvement over time. Female students showed more considerable progress than male students. This study addresses researchers' demands regarding the lack of robust evidence to assess the impact of design thinking in higher education settings. Furthermore, building on the data from a large sample size and an intervention designed in a replicable way, this study contributes to the available empirical evidence that helps one to adopt and implement design thinking in universities to develop essential skills, such as teamwork.

AB  - Through integration of geology, biology, chemistry, and the history of science, the historic Krakatoa eruption offers a unique portal for student inquiry in the classroom. Students are inherently fascinated by natural disasters, and modern comparisons to the Krakatoa cataclysm are as close as the day's news. This article uses the historic Krakatoa cataclysm to teach modern science. It offers background on the Krakatoa eruption and describes the authors' inquiry unit on Krakatoa in detail. This study of Krakatoa offers an opportunity to correct common student misconceptions about volcanoes. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - This article describes how integrating children's literature in mathematics classrooms has proven to provide a common context that is suitable for problem solving and modeling that advances mathematical thinking and reasoning. The engaging task inspired by children's literature allowed this teacher to infuse science, engineering, technology, and mathematics to understand the needs of chickens and construct a viable prototype of a coop. The task allowed students to comprehend the needs of chickens through the modeling of area, given the specific recommendations for housing chickens. With a class producing several prototypes, the teacher coined this the "Poultry Egg-States" for housing chickens.

AB  - Water analysis is an excellent interdisciplinary topic for project-based learning. An undergraduate course was designed to engage the senior undergraduate chemistry students in a real-life experience. In this course, students developed methodologies based on published American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) methods for the measurement of fluoride, phenols, and metals in real water samples. The procedures were utilized to analyze target analytes in real water samples from various sources, such as seawater, sewage water, swimming pool water, tap water, and drinking water in the eastern province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). These areas are profoundly affected by urbanization. The students analyzed the samples by employing a portable total dissolved solids (TDS) meter, a pH/ion-selective electrode (ISE) benchtop meter, an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and a gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The ASTM methods allowed the students to gather research-level data and study regional environmental issues. The students prepared and presented their results at the departmental conference. Through the water analysis project, students acquired field and laboratory research skills, performed a quantitative analysis of data sets, developed collaborative interactions, as well as utilized their writing and communication skills. The exposure of students to these research tools provided them with experience in dealing with the limitations of trace level analysis in real samples. The outcome of this study provided the students with an overview of how their theoretical knowledge was connected to the country's limited water sources and pollution problems.

AB  - Technological innovations have led to an increase in demand for information technology (IT) skills in contemporary library and information agencies. This in turn has created an increased need for pedagogical skills on the part of library and information science (LIS) professionals for them to empower users with knowledge and skills to navigate a complex digital information terrain. Hence LIS professionals with both technology and pedagogical skills have become increasingly critical in a digitized information environment. In the context of this confluence of knowledge and skills requirements for the LIS professional, this article draws early findings from a global phenomenological probe into curriculum design and development directed at the blended or hybrid LIS professional located in a pluralist information environment and requiring cross-disciplinary competencies spanning LIS, IT, teaching and learning, and perhaps even other cognate areas. It explores, in this context, challenges, ideas, and thinking in LIS education from preliminary empirical findings from parts of Africa, Asia, and South America (representing the Global South) and from parts of Europe and North America (representing the Global North), with a view to stimulating debate and discourse on the repositioning of the LIS discipline toward staking an intellectual claim on the broadening of its disciplinary space resulting from a natural evolution of the LIS discipline in response to a technology-driven information environment. Shank and Bell's concepts of "disruptive innovations" and the blending of traditional librarian skills with information technology and pedagogical skills, together with Corrall's "content, conduit, and context" approach to educating for a pluralist digital information environment, are used to frame this reflection.

AB  - Set against the backdrop of a STEM-based (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) activity in a teacher education science methods class, the author examines the need for ethics education to be partnered with STEM education. To make the case, the origin of the STEM initiative, undertaken and strongly supported by both US government and corporate sources, is briefly recounted. The STSE initiative (science, technology, society and environment) is posited as a counterpoint to STEM. Also considered are: (a) an historical perspective of science and technology as these impact difficult individual and social decision making; (b) STEM knowledge generation considered through the lens of Habermas' threefold knowledge typology; and (c) the experiences of the teacher candidates working through the STEM activity when an ethical challenge is posed. The author demonstrates the need for a moral component for science education and makes the case for a partnership between STEM and ethics education. Further, such a partnership has been shown to increase student enjoyment and motivation for their science studies. Three possible ethical frameworks are examined for their theoretical and practical utility in a science classroom.

AB  - Low-dimensional materials especially graphene-based are of high interest to a broad community. One of the most fundamental aspects in the biomedical field is material characterization, which helps understand their property and tune for application. Though the existing teaching curricula are well standardized to include basic principles and instrumentation, the laboratory components are yet to be streamlined. Using an example of standard graphene oxide (GO) and one of its functionalized forms, Amine-GO (AGO), a set of laboratory experiments are presented in this article. The first part of the description includes the synthesis and preparation of GO and AGO with details of individual steps and reaction conditions. The laboratory exercises then provide sample preparation and characterization using spectroscopic techniques like UV--vis, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemical analysis using cyclic voltammetry. The materials for sample preparation can be arranged with minimal cost, while the high-end instruments are primarily available in institutional shared facilities. Such laboratory design is highly essential to develop skills for sample preparation, measurement, writing skills, comparing the results with literature sources, and making an inference. The experiments are relevant for interdisciplinary students in biomedical, chemical, energy, and materials fields. It reflects requisite techniques ideal for developing hands-on skills and motivating students to tune advanced materials and find innovative solutions.

The resultant presentation was intended to engage students in discussing historical and contemporary biology education, as well as some of the intricacies of seed biology. Comparisons between the usefulness and scope of various seed identification resources, both online and in print, were made.

AB  - Using data to understand learning and improve education has great promise. However, the promise will not be achieved simply by AI and Machine Learning researchers developing innovative models that more accurately predict labeled data. As AI advances, modeling techniques and the models they produce are getting increasingly complex, often involving tens of thousands of parameters or more. Though strides towards interpretation of complex models are being made in core machine learning communities, it remains true in these cases of "black box" modeling that research teams may have little possibility to peer inside to try understand how, why, or even whether such models will work when applied beyond the data on which they were built. Rather than relying on AI expertise alone, we suggest that "learning engineering teams" bring interdisciplinary expertise to bear to develop "explanatory learner models" that provide interpretable and actionable insights in addition to accurate prediction. We describe examples that illustrate use of different kinds of data (eg, click stream and discourse data) in different course content (eg, math and writing) and toward different goals (eg, improving student models and generating actionable feedback). We recommend learning engineering teams, shared infrastructure and funder incentives toward better explanatory learner model development that advances learning science, produces better pedagogical practices and demonstrably improves student learning

AB  - In order to maximize student development in an interdisciplinary context, we implemented and evaluated a business-biology team teaching approach. The class project involved teams of environmental science and business students analyzing an industry stakeholder interested in participating in the development of a community composting network. We compared the results of this team-taught section with a more traditionally-taught business section with a sustainability emphasis, with the objectives of identifying student learning gains and reflecting, as faculty, upon the experience. In the affective domain, there was initial discomfort with the interdisciplinary team teaching method on the part of both faculty and students. In the cognitive domain, both team-taught and traditional sections perceived significant gains in understanding both business and natural systems, although the treatment group alone made significant (P < 0.10) gains in linking interdisciplinary thinking and an understanding of both business and natural systems to future success. These findings suggest that the affective and cognitive transformations experienced in team-taught settings are important for teaching expanded worldviews and diverse perspectives.

AB  - The integration of science and agriculture has been discussed since the inception of agricultural education. However, the standards-based focus in public secondary education and changing climate of agriculture has brought science integration back to the forefront. Though research has indicated that the integration of science into agricultural education is effective in improving student achievement in science, there are still challenges. The instrumental case study sought to understand how Mr. Lee effectively integrated science into a traditional program while maintaining the benefits and purpose of agricultural education. Six issues, deduced from literature related to the integration of science in agricultural education, were identified. Six themes emerged that elucidate the process of successful science integration. First, agricultural educators' science content knowledge must be strengthened. Second, the pedagogy of scientific inquiry lacked components necessary for a rigorous curriculum. Third, agricultural educators who desire to integrate science should dig into their curriculum for existing science content. Fourth, collaboration among agriculture and science teachers can be fostered through involvement in the science department, and fifth the agricultural educator plays a fundamental role in curriculum planning to increase secondary science achievement. Finally, actual integration occurred in a more segmented way than proposed by Robert's and Ball's (2009) content and context dual-model.

AB  - Energy is considered both a core idea and a crosscutting concept in science education. A thorough understanding of the energy concept is thought to help students learn about other (related) concepts within and across science subjects, thereby fostering scientific literacy. This study investigates students' progression in understanding the energy concept in biological contexts at the transition from primary to lower secondary school by employing a quantitative, cross-sectional study in grades 3-6 (N?=?540) using complex multiple-choice items. Based on a model developed in a previous study, energy concepts were assessed along four aspects of energy: (1) forms and sources of energy, (2) transfer and transformation, (3) degradation and dissipation, and (4) energy conservation. Two parallel test forms (A and B) indicated energy concept scores to increase significantly by a factor of 2.3 (A)/1.7 (B) from grade 3 to grade 6. Students were observed to progress in their understanding of all four aspects of the concept and scored highest on items for energy forms. The lowest scores and the smallest gain across grades were found for energy conservation. Based on our results, we argue that despite numerous learning opportunities, students lack a more integrated understanding of energy at this stage, underlining the requirement of a more explicit approach to teaching energy to young learners. Likewise, more interdisciplinary links for energy learning between relevant contexts in each science discipline may enable older students to more efficiently use energy as a tool and crosscutting concept with which to analyze complex content.

AB  - In this study, to examine the change in individuals' critical thinking skills, a new unit was developed in which STEM was integrated. The outcomes of this 7th-grade unit were selected from related disciplines. During the learning process of the developed Force and Energy unit, it was aimed that individuals could make judgments by gaining critical thinking skills and evaluate events in a multidimensional way. In this study, which lasted for five weeks, the developed unit was used to conduct lessons with the experimental group (N=25) while the control group (N=25) was traditionally taught. The Critical Thinking Scales developed by Demir (2006a) were used in the research process. Before the implementation, no significant difference was found between the experimental and control groups regarding critical thinking skills, but after the implementation, a significant difference was observed in favour of the experimental group. When the scores obtained from the sub-scales (interpretation and explanation) were compared, a significant difference was found in favour of the experimental group. When the changes in the experimental and control groups were examined, there was no significant change in the control group students, but a significant change was found in favour of the experimental group. These changes occurred in the evaluation, Interpretation, and explanation sub-scales of the critical thinking scale. Based on these data, it can be said that the critical thinking skills of individuals who receive STEM education improve. Accordingly, making use of different disciplines simultaneously while designing a product in STEM education is an important factor in the development of individuals' critical thinking skills. Thus, teachers should carry out this process effectively.

AB  - Few systematic efforts have been reported to develop higher degree by research student skills for writing publishable articles in science and technology fields. There is a need to address this lack in the light of the current importance of publication to science research students and the high supervisor workload entailed in repeated draft correction, especially when students use English as an additional language. An interdisciplinary teaching approach to address this need has recently been developed featuring analysis frameworks from applied linguistics (AL) research, with successful outcomes in short, stand-alone workshops facilitated by an applied linguist teaching alone or in teams with scientists. Its use by a scientist alone has not previously been investigated, although scientists are well placed to address this development need. We investigate the suitability and effectiveness of this approach for use by a scientist to embed training, in the context of the first two years of operation of a school-level writing group programme, and identify features of the approach that align with participants' perceptions of benefit. Student response to the programme has been strongly positive, with increased confidence to write for publication and complete their degrees, and high activity towards publishing papers on their degree research. The presenter reports maintenance of his own publication output in spite of the time spent on this training, as a result of increased writing efficiency. Features of the approach that map to perceived benefit include its basis in AL frameworks for analysis of student-provided example papers; incorporation of relevant aspects of English usage and grammar in the frameworks; and inclusion of response to reviewer comments as an integral part of article writing.

AB  - Modern drug discovery programs require the contribution of researchers in a number of specialist areas. One of these areas is structural biology. Using X-ray crystallography, the molecular basis of how a drug binds to its biological target and exerts its mode of action can be defined. For example, a drug that binds into the active site of an enzyme can inhibit its important biological function and stop the enzyme from working. By understanding this molecular interaction in fine detail, researchers can begin to design new compounds with a view to developing drugs with improved properties, such as better activity and safety. One example of how X-ray crystallography is employed in drug discovery is highlighted in a research project currently underway at the University of Adelaide. A multidisciplinary team of researchers has identified a new class of antibiotics to combat infections caused by pathogenic bacteria, such as "Staphylococcus aureus," the agent responsible for golden staph. Many of the medicines commonly used to treat these infections have become ineffective due to the development of drug resistance. This article describes how the research team is focused on a completely new molecular target in the bacterial cell, Biotin protein ligase (BPL). BPL is an essential metabolic enzyme so inhibitors of this protein should also be effective at preventing the growth of the bacteria. Currently, none of the antibiotics in clinical use exert their activity through this enzyme, so BPL inhibitors represent a completely new class of antibiotic. The article discusses the drug discovery process and the role that structural biology played in that process. It concludes with suggested classroom activities and a list of online resources.

AB  - After the rediscovery of Mendel's laws of heredity in 1900, the biologists who began studying heredity, variation, and evolution using the new Mendelian methodology--performing controlled hybrid crosses and statistically analyzing progeny to note the factorial basis of characters--made great progress. By 1910, the validity of Mendelism was widely recognized and the field William Bateson christened "genetics" was complemented by the chromosome theory of heredity of T. H. Morgan and his group in the United States. Historians, however, have largely overlooked an important factor in the early establishment of Mendelism and genetics: the large number of women who contributed to the various research groups. This article examines the social, economic, and disciplinary context behind this new wave of women's participation in science and describes the work of women Mendelians and geneticists employed at three leading experimental research institutes, 1900-1940. It argues that the key to more women working in science was the access to higher education and the receptivity of emerging interdisciplinary fields such as genetics to utilize the expertise of women workers, which not only advanced the discipline but also provided new opportunities for women's employment in science.

AB  - Despite the ubiquity and critical importance of science and technology in international affairs, their role receives insufficient attention in traditional international relations curricula. There is little literature on how the relations between science, technology, economics, politics, law and culture should be taught in an international context. Since it is impossible even for scientists to master all the branches of natural science and engineering that affect public policy, the learning goals of students whose primary training is in the social sciences should be to get some grounding in the natural sciences or engineering, to master basic policy skills, to understand the basic concepts that link science and technology to their broader context, and to gain a respect for the scientific and technological dimensions of the broader issues they are addressing. They also need to cultivate a fearless determination to master what they need to know in order to address policy issues, an open-minded but skeptical attitude towards the views of dueling experts, regardless of whether they agree with their politics, and (for American students) a world-view that goes beyond a strictly U.S. perspective on international events. The Georgetown University program in Science, Technology and International Affairs (STIA) is a unique, multi-disciplinary undergraduate liberal arts program that embodies this approach and could be an example that other institutions of higher learning might adapt to their own requirements.

AB  - This article discusses key issues in the integration of an intersectionality lens in the developmental sciences and introduces a peer-reviewed thematic journal issue on this topic. We begin by briefly situating the importance of an intersectionality lens within the changing demographics and sociopolitical history in the United States, and within developmental science as a field. We provide a brief overview of recommendations on responsible use of intersectionality in developmental science. We then introduce contributions contained within this volume, and how each contributor grappled with the following question: "How can an intersectionality perspective inform the developmental phenomena of interest and particular developmental theories you draw upon in your area of research?" We end by noting that these contributions offer a collection of manuscripts that aim to increase dialogue among developmental scientists on ways to productively integrate an intersectionality lens in developmental science.

AB  - The project-based learning approach is a learning model that encourages the active participation of gifted students, supports high-level cognitive activities, requires a wide range of tools and resources, consider academic and social skills together and emphasizes the use of technology. technology. This study is based on the learning experiences of gifted children designed with project-based approach. The study employed a holistic single-case embedded design, one of the qualitative research designs. The study group of the research consists of four gifted students in a Science and Art Center in the South Marmara Region. Criterion sampling, one of the purposeful sampling types, was used to determine the study group. Learning experiences of the gifted children through project-based learning approach were determined via reflective journals. The data in the reflective journals written by gifted students were given with direct quotations within the framework of the main theme and sub-themes, and inferences and interpretations were made. It was found out that gifted children have an advanced level reflective writing ability. It was also observed that participants grounded their projects with real-life problems and made inter-disciplinary connections in their reflections. Besides, bearing the character traits of gifted children, the participants effectively used higher-level thinking skills ad cognitive strategies.

AB  - In today's global economy, the origin of the food we eat is becoming more and more difficult to identify. Verifying the authenticity of products to protect supply chains is a complicated problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach. Chemical authentication of foodstuffs often includes a mass spectrometer detector; however, they are costly and require advanced operating skills. As an alternative, simple and robust post-column derivatization processes undertaken with HPLC may potentially provide chemical signatures of samples based upon the antioxidant profiles of the coffee samples. In this experiment, students employed a HPLC-PCD-VIS hyphenated separation protocol to produce a high-resolution chromatogram with minimal sample preparation, and the analysis was tuned to antioxidants in the coffee. Students encountered common analytical instruments and the commercially relevant CUPRAC assay. Using chromatographically derived data, students constructed MS Excel spreadsheets to normalize data and apply information theory to make statements about the similarity between coffee samples. Students were introduced to analytical protocols and chemometric techniques typical of 21st-century solutions to complex problems while utilizing common analytical instruments and reagents. Students were able to gain real-world laboratory skills, including running HPLC columns for sample analysis, method hyphenation, and signal retrieval. Students then utilized software to plot data for interpretation and to simplify data via preprocessing and chemometric operations to solve real-world problems.

AB  - The supervision and production of a PhD thesis often presents a potentially interesting tension between PhDs as conforming to disciplinary epistemologies and PhDs as breaking epistemological boundaries. No academic discipline has been left untouched by decolonial thinking in the South African university space since the eruption of radicalized student protest movements in 2015. The Rhodes Must Fall student protest movement, which quickly morphed into Fees Must Fall, precipitated a new urgency to decolonize the university curriculum in post-apartheid South Africa. A new interdisciplinary conversation in the humanities and social sciences began to emerge which challenged established orthodoxies in favour of de-Westernizing, decolonizing and re-mooring epistemological and pedagogic practices away from Eurocentrism. Whether and how that theoretical ferment filtered into postgraduate students' theses, however, remains to be established. This article deploys a decolonial theoretical framework to explore the tension between epistemic conformity and boundary transgressing in journalism studies by analysing reference lists of PhD theses submitted at three South African Universities three years after the protest movement Rhodes Must Fall. With specific focus on media and journalism studies as a discipline, this article argues that the PhD process represents a site for potential epistemic disobedience and disciplinary border-jumping, and for challenging the canonical insularity of Western theory in journalism studies. The findings appear to disconfirm the thesis that decolonial rhetoric has had a material influence so far on the media studies curriculum, as reflected in reference lists of cited works in their dissertations.

AB  - The concerted, strategic efforts of government leaders can create rapid accelerations in knowledge and the application of that knowledge for the public good. Government service can represent part or all of one's career. Working at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) early in my career helped me develop a macro-level understanding of how the NIH operates, what forces propel change, how priorities are set, and how programs are developed. While leading a large division at the National Cancer Institute later in my career, after many years in a research institution and academia, we created new models for collaboration, including transdisciplinary centers, the first NIH unit focused on dissemination (now implementation science), and tools that enabled citizens, scientists, and others to access and use effective interventions, new data sets, and ways to aggregate data to show local cancer profiles. In this article, I provide my own career as an example of the opportunities afforded by federal service--for both individuals in government service and the public good.

AB  - Limonite is the field term for a mixed assemblage of ferric oxyhydroxides, often containing nonferric silicate impurities. It is abundant on Earth's surface, possesses variable iron content, and is easily recognized by distinctive yellow and ochre hues. Limonite is a unique centerpiece for undergraduate chemistry laboratories because each sample represents a true unknown to faculty and students alike, and because limonite does not digest readily with common methods. Senior students were guided through a primary literature review to assess and establish an appropriate digestion method. Students then constructed the procedure for determining the iron content in limonite using atomic absorption spectroscopy. A final report, produced in the style of this "Journal," completed the start-to-finish process used by scientists, helping students learn how novel problems are solved in the laboratory. General chemistry students were provided with limonite extracts and used UV-vis spectroscopy to determine their iron contents, gaining proficiency in wet-lab, data collection, and analysis skills. Lab reports included an interdisciplinary discussion/interpretation of results from chemistry and geologic perspectives. The method used by students for digestion and iron extraction was validated using goethite and iron(III) oxide as standards (<3% error). The two spectrometric methods provided comparable results for the iron content in limonite. Despite challenging all students, these experiments were rated favorably in written evaluations, and students self-rated their learning gains as very high. Limonite experiments promote curiosity, discussion, and departure from laboratory exercises with predetermined results. Students become vested in analyzing a geologically important material that is inherently complex and heterogeneous.

AB  - Interdisciplinary undergraduate research experiences often require students to work in teams with other students and researchers from different disciplines, creating a need for development of new skills in interdisciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we describe our unique efforts to mentor participants in developing these skills during our team-based research experience for undergraduates program. This effort was initiated in response to a perceived need to provide professional development in collaboration for our participants, who come from diverse backgrounds that span a range of disciplines, institutions, and cultures. We describe here the intervention used, which is a modified version of one successfully implemented in a classroom setting. Furthermore, we present our formative and summative program evaluation data regarding participants' perceptions about what helps or hinders team science. The most-repeated themes in student evaluations, in order from most mentions to least, were: communication, goal setting, shared mental model, timing/scheduling, cooperation, non-participation, attitudes, and mentor guidance/support. Together these themes account for 82% of the student responses. Lastly, we present our observations of the positive effects of this intervention on our program. Our findings may be useful to those mentoring undergraduates in both team research and classroom group learning.

AB  - Chemical safety, a practice of protecting humans and the environment in which they work and live from the deleterious effects of chemical substances, was investigated in this study in Nigerian secondary schools. Using a mixed-method survey, we investigated the awareness level and implementation of the best practices of chemical safety by 1246 senior secondary school chemistry students. Students in rural schools were found to have a lower level of awareness of chemical safety compared to the students in urban schools. Statistically significant differences were found in all except one of the awareness measures--washing hands before practicals and after leaving the chemistry lab. Urban students were more in breach of chemical safety practices than students in rural schools. Most of the observed differences were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Interview (qualitative) data from 20 students show four emerging themes to explain the findings, including a low level of chemistry laboratory resourcing, poor chemical safety training of the teachers, inadequacies in safety tools, charts, and kits, and weak enforcement of safety regulations. Based on the data from the study, recommendations were made for bolstering the awareness level of students in chemical safety and their chemical safety practices. These include the incorporation of chemical safety in the core curriculum, requiring quality assurance entities to enforce resourcing of basic safety equipment to schools, government-directed workshops on the need for chemical safety, and requiring teachers to provide chemical hazards information to students.

AB  - One of the greatest challenges facing social science and marketing programs in the start of the 21st century is how to "globalize" our curriculums, so that our tech-savvy, but often internationally and cross-culturally inexperienced students have, understand, and are prepared to embrace the diverse opportunities that will be an increasing part of their futures. This article presents the work of two professors from Marketing and Political Science disciplines, who developed a cross-disciplinary course addressing lessons of macro and micro political economy and marketing strategies, in an in-classroom setting, with an optional international experience.

AB  - Dabrowski recognized that the creative process is important in the personality development of the gifted and talented. Given the intrinsically creative nature of learning in an arts-infused context, we hypothesize that interdisciplinary approaches to curriculum address the unique needs of the gifted. First, we will summarize Dabrowski's theory of positive disintegration, providing a theoretical context to discuss an ongoing research project that engages gifted students in arts-based learning. We then briefly describe the implications of positive disintegration in the middle school context, and how art education can support this process. Finally, we describe how two arts-integrated projects addressed the process of positive disintegration. In 2013, University of Calgary students in ART 307, "Applied concepts in art with children ages 6-12," worked with gifted middle school students on an integrated art-social studies-science project called "When Fisher went to Skyland." In this project, one class of Grade 6 students explored Iroquois culture and sky science through printmaking. In 2014, four classes of Grade 5 students worked with ART 307 students to enhance their understanding of electricity and magnetism through explorations using theatre games, creative movement and animation. We suggest that engaging gifted middle school students in the arts can be a means to facilitate alternative learning methodologies in all subject areas, and provide necessary support in personality development.

AB  - A two-year targeted intervention designed to improve students' oral communication skills in an organic chemistry laboratory course is described. The study compares the oral communication skills of groups who received interventions versus those who did not. The collaborative effort involving chemistry and English faculty and an instruction librarian assessed student performance on several measures of oral communication competency. Participants blindly placed themselves in either treatment or control groups. Both groups received identical basic instruction on poster layout and design. The treatment group received additional instruction on multiple aspects of oral communication and presentation skills. A comparison of the outcomes of the two groups found that those receiving the additional targeted interventions performed better on measures such as the ability to describe clearly the research project and fluency with scientific terminology.

AB  - In light of profound socio-economic and technological changes, the research from New Literacies has raised fundamental questions on the nature of literacy in the way we read, write, and communicate. Yet, in science education, research in literacy has been largely restricted to the domain of print-oriented academic language. This paper aims to set the issues of literacy in science education in a broader context by responding to several challenges raised in New Literacies research: (a) the attention to youths' diverse cultural and media practices, (b) the sociocultural practices of specific discourse communities, and (c) the increasing multimodal semiotic landscape. The paper presents a model that synthesizes various research areas in New Literacies for the development of new pedagogy and classroom practices in the nexus of literacy and science education. The proposed model provides a convergence of diverse theoretical perspectives from research in various disciplines, and presents an opportunity for cross-disciplinary research in both science and literacy education.

AB  - Shared vision is an important process for change projects, serving to amplify success, increase participation, and erode the divide between project leaders and constituents. Yet there are few empirical examinations of the process of building shared vision within academic departments. Using focus groups and participant observation, this study examines shared vision development within 13 large-scale change projects in engineering and computer science higher education. We find that teams of faculty, staff, administrators, and students built shared vision with stakeholders through co-orientation, formational communication, and recognition of stakeholder autonomy. Our results delineate practices for developing shared vision for academic change projects and demonstrate the benefits of inclusive stakeholder empowerment.

AB  - This paper presents instructive interdisciplinary applications of constrained mechanics calculus in economics on a level appropriate for undergraduate physics education. The aim of the paper is (i) to meet the demand for illustrative examples suitable for presenting the background of the highly expanding research field of econophysics even at the undergraduate level and (ii) to enable the students to gain a deeper understanding of the principles and methods routinely used in mechanics by looking at the well-known methodology from the different perspective of economics. Two constrained dynamic economic problems are presented using the economic terminology in an intuitive way. First, the Phillips model of the business cycle is presented as a system of forced oscillations and the general problem of two interacting economies is solved by the nonholonomic dynamics approach. Second, the Cass-Koopmans-Ramsey model of economical growth is solved as a variational problem with a velocity-dependent constraint using the vakonomic approach. The specifics of the solution interpretation in economics compared to mechanics is discussed in detail, a discussion of the nonholonomic and vakonomic approaches to constrained problems in mechanics and economics is provided and an economic interpretation of the Lagrange multipliers (possibly surprising for the students of physics) is carefully explained. This paper can be used by the undergraduate students of physics interested in interdisciplinary physics applications to gain an understanding of the current scientific approach to economics based on a physical background, or by university teachers as an attractive supplement to classical mechanics lessons.

AB  - Interprofessional education (IPE) occurs when students are provided the opportunity to learn with and from others of related professions to improve the potential for future collaboration. The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of students about working with professionals from different disciplines before and after their engagement in an interprofessional learning activity and determine any changes in their willingness to work in interprofessional teams. Doctor of Pharmacy students from the University of Manitoba and Master's speech-language pathology students from McMaster University participated in an online inter-university and inter-provincial education module. Students were invited to complete the Interprofessional Socialization and Valuing Scale (ISVS-9B) and three open-ended questions to capture attitudes toward interprofessional teams before and after the IPE event. A mixed-method approach was used to assess changes in attitudes, values, and comfort with collaborating. A total of 20 students completed the pre-survey and 19 completed the post-survey; significant changes in total ISVS-9B scores were observed. Four questions of the ISVS-9B also showed significant positive changes after the IPE event. Qualitative themes were identified from responses to the open-ended questions: collaboration optimizes patient care, collaboration is fostered by clear communication, learning from peers increases knowledge and appreciation of professional roles, and IPE fosters the potential for future collaborations. This study suggests that a virtual IPE event tailored to pharmacy and speech-language pathology trainees may be effective in fostering future interdisciplinary collaboration through increasing knowledge and appreciation of other professional roles with a primary goal of optimizing patient care.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explain how to use the scientific method as the framework to introduce mathematical model. Two interdisciplinary activities, targeted for students in grade 6 or grade 7, are explained to show the application of the scientific method while building a mathematical model to investigate the relationship between the circumferences and the diameter of circular objects. In the first activity, a research question is pursued as it relates to the stated hypothesis. In the second activity, the same research question is retained; however, the use of exploration helps to build the hypothesis. The activities serve as examples to show how middle school math teachers may use scientific inquiry to motive students' understanding of mathematical models as well as engage in science beyond the science classroom. Students will be able to identify, describe, analyze, interpret, validate, and report relationships between variables.

AB  - This collaborative self-study article explores experiences teaching a cross-curricular undergraduate course that aimed to integrate social studies and science. The course differs from other compulsory components of the teacher candidates' program of study in that it concentrates on disciplinary structure, as opposed to methods, and it treats two subjects--social studies and science--as opposed to one. For teacher educators charged with instructing curriculum methods courses, particularly elementary social studies and science classes, as well as for administrators planning creative responses to challenges posed by congested teacher education programs, the following study offers reflections on the benefits and pitfalls of cross-curricular courses. Furthermore, it comments on the relative merits of investigating social studies and science as disciplines to be explored rather than as sets of skills or content to be mastered.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of so-called cognitive-enhancing drugs is well documented in American higher education. There has been little historical analysis, however, specifically exploring the role of postsecondary institutions in this evolving drug narrative. This paper traces substance use and research trends in American higher education over the past half-century, divided into three eras defined by their disparate approaches to drug policy and public health. Contextualised by historic events, shifting policies and epidemiological data, this multidisciplinary analysis contends that functional, academically oriented drug use is likely to continue rising on US campuses, while recreational drug use will evolve and persist. As history provides a useful lens for understanding the involvement of academe in the first era of drug concern in America, ongoing innovations in medical and social science may be instructive to help ensure that institutions respond judiciously in the present era of new drug synthesis and drug policy recession.

AB  - Background and purpose: The purpose of this study was to record and measure the level of involvement and appreciation that prospective teachers in art and science education programmes demonstrated during a four-session integrated activity. Art and science education prospective teachers from a Rocky Mountain region university in the US worked in partnership to produce a science-related art piece using a silk batik painting technique. This project incorporated the use of two hands-on activities (a sampler and a final piece). In addition, pre- and post-activity surveys helped researchers investigate whether an integrated activity led to changes in attitudes towards collaborative instruction among students from art and science education. A practical implication of these results could guide students' teaching assignments and professional careers. Sample: This project involved the participation of 34 prospective teachers enrolled in secondary art and science education pedagogical content courses at a public university in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. Design and method: Prospective teachers in art and science education programmes worked together in a four-session integrated activity for three consecutive years. Participants were tasked with the design of art pieces addressing a core concept from the secondary school science curriculum using the batik painting technique. This project included two hands-on activities (a sampler and a final piece). In addition, they responded to pre- and post-activity surveys. Results: Overall, the data show significant variation at pre- and post-survey, indicating that students had more knowledge after the study than before regarding the integration of art and science in the secondary school curriculum. The mean of interdisciplinary teaching ratings increased on all four target survey items according to the 10-point rating scale. Based on the results, the integrated art and science instructional approach significantly influenced prospective teachers' attitudes about collaborative practices. Conclusion: In general, students' responses on survey items addressing content skills and previous experience of art or geological/biological images in the classroom were affected by their major area. Our experience suggests that an integrated learning experience is an effective way to improve prospective teachers' self-ratings of knowledge and ability to develop and engage students from secondary school classrooms with interdisciplinary connections.

AB  - This study explored the effect of arts integration into science during an instructional unit on force and motion and one addressing natural weather disasters. Seventy-eight elementary students in four classrooms (grade 5, grade 4, and two at grade 3) participated in the study. This study assessed content retention, student-made products (rollercoasters and hurricane shelters), and student attitudes. All students in each classroom experienced the two units of instruction, one unit in the experimental condition of arts integration and one unit in the control condition without arts integration. Both conditions involved students in constructing models of given materials. Each unit consisted of three weeks of instruction with the last week being a final project scored for science content and creativity. This final rollercoaster model or hurricane shelter model supported engineering standard 3-5-ETS1-2. Grade 4 and grade 5 classes showed significant posttest gains and distal posttest gains regarding content scores in favor of the experimental condition with a large effect size. The mean overall product scores favored the experimental condition with a very large effect size. The results indicated that arts integration produced greater creativity, collaboration, and more positive overall perceptions of learning.

AB  - One STEAM (STEM + Arts) strategy is to supplement traditional STEM instruction with music. Using music could provide the dual benefits of (1) making STEM content more accessible and (2) enhancing students' engagement in the learning process. Here we explore the extent to which music-oriented high school students achieve these two benefits when they participate in 'Songwriting To Learn', a possible variation on the Writing To Learn (WTL) model of instruction. We analysed 81 artist statements, collected over 12 years at an annual science fair, in which students described their music compositions and the compositions' connections to science. Rather than simply reporting scientific facts in song lyrics, these students used an impressive variety of musical elements (Genre, Instruments, Lyrics, and Structure [i.e. chords, dynamics, melody, rhythm]) as metaphors or symbols for science-related elements (Scientific Topic, Conveying Information, Affect, Personal Story, Scientific Story). Many students demonstrated a sophisticated attention to musical details and nuances, consistent with their frequent self-identification as musicians and/or music fans. Moreover, in composing and performing songs, these students fulfilled some of the key criteria by which scientific identities are developed, including the forging of personal connections to science. By writing songs about science, students may use their practice-linked identities in the domain of music to express their growing understanding in the domain of science.

AB  - Project-based learning (PjBL) is argued to foster a more democratic approach to education, particularly through increasing students' autonomy over their learning. This article presents the findings of research into students' views relating to autonomy over topic choice and group constitution during a series of trial interdisciplinary PjBL activities with first-year geography, earth and environmental sciences (GEES) undergraduates in a UK university. Semi-structured interviews with participating students and tutors, in addition to audio-recordings of staff-student discussion during student-led presentation sessions, formed the data set analysed for this article. Findings suggest that while some degree of autonomy was welcomed, participants largely favoured prescription regarding research question and group membership. This has implications for the implementation of PjBL and its potential to foster democratization within the GEES disciplines.

AB  - Background: Limited research has addressed the effects of health literacy interventions in elementary schools. However, school-aged children's health literacy is critical because children make decisions about their health every day. The purpose of the pilot project was to explore the feasibility of integrated health literacy lesson plans for second graders. Methods: A pretest-posttest evaluation was conducted with second grade students following implementation of health literacy lessons that were integrated into core curriculum (language arts, science, and social studies). Results: Health educators, a hospital/health care system, and a school district developed a partnership. A research team of teachers, administrators, health literacy experts and health care organizations designed and implemented health literacy lesson plans. A developmentally appropriate measure of health literacy was adapted from the Newest Vital Sign. Data showed that students' health literacy scores significantly increased after implementation of 4 lesson plans. Conclusions: This was an exploratory, pilot project that provided a useful starting point for discussing how to integrate health literacy into elementary school curriculum. An interdisciplinary team developed integrated health literacy materials that acknowledged the needs of teachers, the resources available, and the developmental stages of children. This intervention serves as a model for future health literacy initiatives in schools.

AB  - In September 2000, the newly-formed Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR) held its first international conference, entitled "the State of the Interdiscipline", highlighting a new locus of research, and a "focus on the Internet as a distinct interdisciplinary field for research" (http://aoir.org/ conferences/past/ir-1-2000/). Internet research was gradually established as a discipline, whose focus and/or locus is the internet (Rall, 2007). Within a decade, the internet became part of everyday life, and barriers between the "virtual" and the "real" were slowly eroded, leading to a seamless experience for most young people in Western societies of the 21st century. At the same time, the internet as a locus of research found its way in many traditional disciplines; however, internet research throws a different light on methodologies, and research strategies are not always easily transferred (Markham & Baym, 2009). The articles presented in this edited book illustrate the broad diversity of internet-based studies in an Irish context, as well as the interdisciplinarity which distinguishes much of its outputs. From digital humanities in the strictest sense--through the creation and use of digital objects and resources to a close examination of digital texts, from ethical issues to societal issues--through the lenses of gender or nationality, from empirical research to practitioners reports, the chapters are a snapshot of internet research in Ireland. The contributors come from many third-level institutions on the island--universities as well as institutes of technology, east and west, north and south--, thus illustrating a geographical space linked to digital spaces. It is the editors' hope that this open access publication will enable students, researchers and practitioners to gain a broader understanding of these areas of research in Ireland, and will foster communication and cooperation among internet researchers.

AB  - The article is devoted to the analysis of the modern state of ethics of science. The question is raised regarding the possibility and problems of the interference of ethics in scientific rationality. From a philosophical position, preliminary answers are given to the following questions: How is it possible to incorporate ethics into the scientific mind? Who is responsible for the destructive impact of scientific discoveries and technical inventions: a scientist or a consumer of technology? How to organize and establish ethical control over experimental science? What ethics can fruitfully interact with technological rationality? The necessity of the essential transformations of modern ethics of science is stated in connection with the global changes in the "social-natural" correlation, the effects of scientific discoveries and technologies on human nature. The solution to these problems in the philosophy of science of the past few decades is reviewed. The opposition of "interference - non-interference" ethical criteria in the goalsetting of scientific activity is analyzed. In addition to the well-known concepts of Kuhn, Lakatos, Feyerabend, the attention of the authors of the article dwells on the modern ideas of Hans Jonas, who argues that the responsibility of a man of science today becomes truly universal. Jonas justifies the need for a new ethic by the fact that humanity stands on the verge of death, being unable to control its own power over nature and its own nature. The ethics of science of Jonas is revealed in the categories of being and nothingness, of responsibility and fear, it implies first of all responsibility for the existence of humanity and the fear of its non-existence. A preliminary recommendation is given on the consolidation of the scientific community, commercial structures, and political forces, on the basis of which it is possible to form effective, modern, and existing ethical requirements for the responsibility of a scientist and science as such.

AB  - This is a sciencepoetical essay combining neurodidactics as an interdisciplinary research field representing an interface between neuroscience, didactics, and educational sciences with the potentials "in" and "with" recent post-constructivist and/or post-humanism, compostist, and multiparadigmatic theories of embodiment and matter becomings. It is an attempt to think new about the nature-culture divide and learning. The idea and notion of the rhizome, and thus the idea of the rhizome-embrained body of a child, is followed through. I write along a neutral and panpsychist monist philosophy of mind un/conscious-attention-discovery sensation-thinking-learning continuum, hopefully contributing to research on conceptual change in children and ultimately the Neuron. I write. I thus Pessoa word and I try to Cixous forethink in and with words. They are (my) stimulating electric currents.

AB  - Ethnomathematics, STEAM Education, and the Globalized Approach are articulated to analyze mathematical connections in daily practices. For this, the networking strategies were considered (understand the theoretical approaches; contrast-compare; coordinate-combine; synthesize-local integration). In the coordination and comparison, the complementarities between the approaches were evidenced and based on these, an empirical phenomenon was analyzed on the connections in daily practices carried out by five artisans who worked in the elaboration of kites, cabinets, masks, and drawers, agriculture, and masonry. From the integration strategy, three results were identified: (i) intra-disciplinary connections, which make it possible to present mathematics as an integrated whole, rather than as a set of isolated knowledge; (ii) interdisciplinary connections, between knowledge from different disciplines that feed into each other; and (iii) connections between the mathematics practiced by cultural groups with institutionalised mathematics that are, at the same time, globalized because they relate mathematics to the socio-cultural context.

AB  - Synchronous e-voting systems (commonly known as "clickers") have become increasingly popular as they can be used to enhance interactivity in lectures. Asynchronous electronic surveys (AESs), unlike these voting system, usually serve as a method of gathering feedback before or after teaching sessions. This paper describes and evaluates a project involving the use of AES with an integrated follow-up lecture in an undergraduate science module. The study shows that the AES enhanced the students' learning experience by (1) prompting them to review previously taught material and (2) providing an engaging context for teaching in the follow-up lecture. As AES can act as an effective link between module components, they can be used as a pedagogical device for improving the coherence of a curriculum. AES is, therefore, a valuable e-learning platform, especially given the growing emphasis on interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary modules in recent years.

AB  - Our paper describes a solution we found to a still existing need to develop mathematical modeling courses for undergraduate biology majors. Some challenges of such courses are: (i) relatively limited exposure of biology students to higher-level mathematical and computational concepts; (ii) availability of texts that can give a flavor of how contemporary biological problems are approached with quantitative methods; (iii) expectations to cover specific mathematical (or biological) content rather than teach a problem-solving approach. We solved these challenges by designing a course where several modules were developed, each beginning with a presentation from a campus expert in a biological area of research and concluding with a seminar-style student-led paper presentation of an article that addresses the biological problem using mathematical and computational tools. The aim of the course was to expose students to the vast possibilities and potential in quantitative biology, and to give them a vocabulary to collaborate with mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists.

AB  - This research study analyzes the effect the implementation of language-driven CLIL has on senior learners from Manuel J. Calle High School in Cuenca, Ecuador in relation to the development of written production in terms of Syntax, Content, Communicative Achievement, Organization, and Language compared to a non-language-driven CLIL classroom. There were 40 participants in the experimental group, and 38 participants in the control group. Learners from the experimental group received a condensed 35-hour intervention using CLIL. This study features an exploratory, mixed-method, and quasi-experimental research design. To collect qualitative data, an open-ended questionnaire was administered to explore the subjects learners preferred to study in a language-driven CLIL classroom. To collect quantitative data, a Pre and Post-Test based on the writing section of Cambridge Objective Primary English Test was administered. The data was analyzed through the Independent T-Test and Paired-T-Test to determine if there was a statistically significant difference present between the language-driven CLIL classroom and the non-language-driven CLIL classroom. The data was calculated through the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). A survey was administered to collect data on learners' perceptions about CLIL and then analyzed statistically. Results indicated that learners preferred to study History, Biology, and Spanish Language and Literature. Results also demonstrated that the experimental group also demonstrated improvement in all the examined parameters when compared to the control group. However, when results from both groups are compared, there is only a statistical improvement in Organization and Syntax.

AB  - The number of students majoring in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) is declining due in part to a lack of student interest (Fairweather 2008; NRC 2012; PCAST 2010). One reason may be the difference between how science is done in school and how it is done in the field (Osborne, Simon, and Collins 2003). An interdisciplinary approach that incorporates engineering design with the practical applications of science, however, may help spark student interest in STEM subjects. This article describes an engineering design challenge in which students design and build an electrochemical (voltaic) cell with a motor and fan to help them observe the cell's energy production.

AB  - Worldwide, innovation in education is highly perceived as an effectual approach to promote awareness for sustainability. International organizations interested in education, research and training support projects seeking modernization of Higher Education (HE) and put much emphasis on developing new curricula, teaching methods or materials to respond to current needs. Building ties and promoting cooperation between institutions around the world through Universities and academic arenas are central in innovative educational approaches. This paper reflects on one of such projects; the Center for Natural Resources and Development (CNRD) which aims at supporting achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7. Eleven University faculties in Brazil, Chile, Egypt, Germany, Indonesia, Jordan, Mexico, Mozambique, Nepal, and Vietnam form part of the CNRD, covering natural, engineering, and social sciences disciplines. To develop solutions for one of the most pressing problems of today; creating sustainable cities, students, teachers and researchers work together in a trans-disciplinary approach. The paper principally deals with the question of how international research and education networks can narrow the distance between countries and promote awareness of sustainability. It discusses approaches in joint education, using modern media and e-learning activities and their contribution to raise awareness of sustainability among young researchers.

AB  - We investigated pre-service elementary teachers' engagement in science and English language arts (ELA) instruction integrated in the context of a children's book. Teachers developed models and conducted a compare-and-contrast analysis after exposure to different accounts of the butterfly life cycle: a popular children's book, "The Very Hungry Caterpillar," and a scientific account from "National Geographic" called "Butterfly: A Life." The mixed-methods research was guided by the following question: What are the affordances and limitations of children's literature toward engendering an understanding of the butterfly life cycle for pre-service elementary teachers? Content analysis indicated that pre-service elementary teachers' abilities to compare and contrast the two accounts were not exceptional, as they failed to discriminate between ideas offered in the accounts and missed details of the key aspect of the butterfly life-cycle phenomenon: metamorphosis. However, the quality of participants' butterfly life-cycle models significantly increased after exposure to the scientific account. We suggest the potential for an additional ELA standard, asking and answering such questions as who, what, where, when, why, and how to demonstrate understanding of key details in a text, as a means for enhancing compare-and-contrast skills following these activities.

AB  - The relevance of the researched problem is caused by the increasing interest in using potential of transdisciplinary approaches, and mathematical methods, which include the game theory in analysis of public and economic processes. The aim of the article is studying a possibility of implementation of the transdisciplinary approaches in economic researches. The leading approach is institutional and evolutionary, which allows to reveal such tendencies of relationship development and interrelations of individuals that remain hidden and implicit. It also allows to receive new and quite unexpected important results, significant for practice. In the article the hypothesis is proved. According to it, innovations, its generation and autopoiesis itself are structural units. In the innovative environment it assumes various forms. The materials of the article can be useful for development of the theory of the system analysis, and also when developing macroeconomic forecasts of social and economic development.

AB  - Purpose: This article explores the impacts of action learning on graduates' abilities to use interdisciplinary knowledge to solve problems, practice teamwork on the job and become change agents through study in two MSc programmes at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (UMB). Design/methodology/approach: Electronic questionnaires were sent to students who had graduated from the Agroecology and Management of Natural Resources and Sustainable Agriculture (MNRSA) MSc programmes between 2000 and 2007. Findings: Both study programmes encouraged students to become change agents promoting sustainable practices through application of knowledge and methods from natural and social sciences. Agroecology graduates applied a greater range of creative research methods, and improved their capacity for holistic and systems thinking more than MNRSA graduates, while the latter were more skilled in building consensus. Graduates from both programmes increased their abilities to create a positive team environment, bring people together to express their views and take multiple views into consideration when making decisions. Practical implications: This survey documents how action learning develops students' skills and knowledge to handle complex social and environmental challenges and become change agents. Originality/value: In the context of increasing challenges in agroecology and natural resource management the findings on how to translate knowledge into action are important for teaching/learning institutions dealing with education for sustainable development.

AB  - Engineers today need both engineering knowledge and social science knowledge to solve complex problems. However, most people have a traditional view of engineering as a field dominated by math and science foci, with little social consequence. This study examined and compared perceptions about engineering from Freshmen taking three different First Year introductory courses. Researchers used data from students' responses in the Draw-an-Engineer-Test, an engineering problem analysis assessment, and interviews. The Treatment Group were students in an introductory engineering course in which they received instruction using an integrative learning module entitled, the "Water Module", based on interdisciplinary learning theory. Control Group 1 were students in a "Traditional Engineering" course, and Control Group 2 were students taking a "Non-Engineering" course. Results indicate that students in the Treatment Group developed a better understanding of engineering and its social impact on society versus the two Control Groups. We suggest that integrative and interdisciplinary learning modules are effective for broadening students' perspectives on engineering and its role in society.

AB  - Interdisciplinary teaching and interpretation of technology for various applications provides a challenging and engaging environment for students to enhance their creativity, critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This paper presents results of a joint effort between faculty in the Department of Information Sciences and Technology and the Department of Music to develop projects at various levels of the curriculum that utilizes a themed learning approach to enhance learned concepts. Students utilize technology as a means to convey their creativity, artistic design, and appreciation of the Arts. Since the creation of digital musical scores, animations and software applications share a similar development process, active-learning exercises using a variety of technologies, provide students with an opportunity to enhance learned concepts in both disciplines. While experiencing the project development process, students are learning object-oriented terminology, animation frameworks, computer programming, distributed computing concepts, and principles of music theory.

AB  - This research involves a multi-year study examining the perspectives and classroom practices of 21 middle school mathematics and science teachers, in the southeastern United States, participating in professional development (PD) exploring science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics (STEAM) literacies. This study sought to understand teachers' perceptions and practices before and after a PD in which STEAM integration was explored through project-based learning involving the political, social, economical, environmental and historical context of a local river. Participants used digital media as a means of communicating and collaborating with peers and mentors, collecting and analyzing data, and creating and sharing projects. Results suggest teachers increased their understanding of STEAM to teach content and perceived the STEAM PD as an effective initial step to change practice, citing the importance of collaboration and technology integrated directly into the learning process. Implications from this study offer other teacher educators valuable considerations towards developing successful STEAM PD to effect successful STEAM teaching.

AB  - The authors of this article suggest a thesis about the purpose of teaching a foreign language--it is student's communicative activities, i.e. learning a foreign language in practice. The teacher's task is to encourage activities of every student and to create situations to develop their creative activities in a learning process. New information technologies streamline and diversify the learning process and, at the same time, open up good prospects to expand the educational framework and undoubtedly bring an incredible motivational drive and promote the principles of individualization of learning. At the current stage of development, the educational system tends to gradually shift towards learner-centered cooperation where a learner plays an active role. Non-standard technologies, encouragement of teacher's creative pursuit and professional advancement, and implementation of innovations proved to be useful in the learning and educational process.

AB  - This study examines teachers' initial conceptions of an integrated STEM-PBL approach and their perceptions of what facilitates or hinders implementation in their schools. This study took place within the first year of a three-year STEM Professional Development (PD) program for middle school math, science and English language arts teachers. The two primary PD components were a week-long, summer institute and a school-year cross-curricular unit planning that included a lesson-study component. Qualitative methods were used to analyze teacher responses from PD evaluations, teacher reflections, interviews and program artifacts. The study provides insight into the feasibility of an integrated STEM-PBL model. The study concludes with implications for practice and a discussion of how future interdisciplinary professional development can be conceptualized.

AB  - Evidence-based instructional practices (ebips) have been associated with positive student outcomes; however, institutions struggle to catalyze widespread adoption of these practices in general education science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) courses. Further, linking ebips with integrated learning assessment is rarely discussed in the literature, even though principles of continuous course design for quality higher education assume the connection of learning outcomes, teaching practices, and assessment. This qualitative action research study documents faculty attempting to utilize ebips and authentic assessment when they were provided support and accountability over multiple semesters. It documents participants' current practices and encourage shifts in both teaching and assessment practices targeting greater student success in stem general education courses. Narrative data drawn from interviews and written reflection describe the impact of structured faculty observation and cross-disciplinary conversation on participants' pedagogical and assessment choices. The faculty participants' voices vividly illustrate our findings: incentives, reflection, mentorship, and collaboration over multiple semesters support changing pedagogical practices and integrating outcomes assessment. While stem-based, the study findings are applicable across the general education curriculum.

AB  - Loyola University Chicago's Teaching, Learning, and Leading With Schools and Communities (TLLSC) program is an ambitious break from traditional university-based teacher preparation models. This clinically based initial teacher preparation program, fully embedded in local schools and community organizations, takes an ecological perspective on the development of sophisticated, reflective, and resilient elementary STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) educators who are able to prepare and inspire students and act as agents of change in their schools. This article describes how TLLSC leverages time for STEM across elementary teacher candidates' entire program through an emphasis on practitioner inquiry and integrated (inter- and transdisciplinary) teaching and learning. TLLSC's innovative approach is designed to foster STEM habits of mind, integrate scientific practices, and support candidates' ongoing self-examination of personal and social applications of STEM for themselves and their future students.

AB  - The study aimed to investigate the effects of visual art supported inquiry based science education on 5th grade students' scientific process skills (SPS). In the research, one group pretest-posttest experimental design is used. The study was carried out with the help of 20 5th grade students. For the purpose of the research, an education including inquiry based activities (IBA) and visual art based activities (VABA) was designed and applied. The education applied during this study contains 7 IBAs, 5 VABAs. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected during this implementation. While the quantitative data was gathered by SPS Test, the qualitative data was gathered by unstructured observations. For analyzing the data gathered by SPS Test, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was used. For analyzing the unstructured observation data, content analysis was used. Based on the data gathered from the study, it can be said that visual art supported inquiry based science education contributes to improve students' observation, inference, determining variables and designing experiment skills, while it contributes limitedly to improve comparison-classification, prediction, estimation, measuring, collecting knowledge and data, data processing and forming a model and interpreting data skills. It does not, however, contribute to improve recognizing and using experiment materials and instruments, recording data and presentation skills.

AB  - The paper proposes a new interdisciplinary approach to helping low attaining learners in basic mathematics. It reports on the research-informed design and user testing of an adaptive digital game based on constructionist tasks with intrinsic feedback. The approach uses findings from the neuroscience of dyscalculia, cognitive science research on conceptual understanding in mathematics, and mathematical education research to inform the detailed pedagogic design. It is interdisciplinary in the sense that it synthesises the results from multiple disciplines in the design principles. It then exploits the new capabilities of digital technologies to develop the design for testing with learners, and capturing appropriate data. The initial pilot has shown that the game supports learners age 5-7 years for independent learning of the kind that low attaining learners will need in order to keep pace with mainstream learners. The experimental work will evaluate this and similar games for learners of all ages who have low numeracy. In general, the approach is to (i) focus on a problem at the intersection of robust evidence in both education and neursocience; and (ii) use this data to design and test a digital intervention that fully exploits the adaptive and interactive features of learning technology.

AB  - Reforms made to France's education system structures during the 1960s resulted in a repositioning of academic subjects within study plans. This article looks at three relatively similar subjects (physical sciences, natural sciences and physical education) and throws light on the arguments put forward to defend the purpose of each of them in the educational process. The arguments provided intended not only to establish each subject's legitimacy from mainly economic, social and political points of view, where the aim was to form the future leaders of a modern society, but also from the academic perspective. Indeed, each subject had to position itself within a changed "hierarchy", giving rise to new interdisciplinary issues which contributed to the transformation of French schools.

AB  - Texts presenting novel statistics can shift learners attitudes and conceptions about controversial science topics. However, not a lot is known about the mechanisms underlying this conceptual change. The purpose of this study was to investigate two potential mechanisms that underlie learning from novel statistics: numerical estimation skills and epistemic cognition. This research investigated two treatments--a numerical estimation and epistemic cognition intervention--that were expected to enhance people's ability to make sense of key numbers about climate change. Results indicated that undergraduate students (N = 516) who were given instruction on numerical estimation strategies before shown novel climate change statistics had fewer misconceptions when compared with people who did not. Findings provide emerging evidence that supporting mathematical reasoning skills can enhance conceptual change in science. [For the complete proceedings, see ED629884.]

AB  - The recent review of the Veterinary Science degree program of the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka, emphasised student-centred learning. Towards this end, courses were introduced throughout the program to integrate concurrent discipline-based material, which were delivered via problem-based learning (PBL) methodology. As PBL was novel to the veterinary education in Sri Lanka, students' perceptions of such learning were evaluated via a questionnaire survey (Likert-scale and open questions) across all four academic-year groups in the program. Most (89.2%, CI: 87.3-91.5) students considered that PBL had been an effective method of learning. Potential to improve critical thinking had the highest score (96.5%, CI: 92.5-98.7). There were significant differences between year groups; which may reflect differences in content or facilitators' experience. Overall, PBL was well-received by students as a learning method per se and as a vehicle for horizontal and vertical integration.

AB  - Climate literacy is an essential component of a strategy to comprehend and confront the grand challenge of global climate change. However, scientific complexity, societal implications, and political associations make climate change a difficult but important topic to teach. In this paper we report on the results of a survey of undergraduate faculty members on their teaching practices with respect to climate science and the outcomes of a series of undergraduate faculty workshops focused on climate change topics and intended to support faculty members in teaching these topics. Survey results show that undergraduate faculty members place a high priority on teaching climate science because of its relevance to the students with respect to their community, lives, and potential careers. In addition, the survey indicates that climate concepts are taught in a spectrum of undergraduate classes, ranging from geoscience classes to those in the social sciences that address societal impacts and solutions to the problems created by climate change. Results from the survey and workshops indicate there are multiple successful strategies for teaching climate topics, including focusing on solutions, using local contexts, teaching with scientific data, embracing that controversy is an integral part of teaching about climate change, and employing effective communication strategies that can help address controversy and misconceptions. We suggest that undergraduate faculty members need ongoing support in their efforts to effectively teach climate change topics. The Climate Literacy and Energy Awareness Network and On the Cutting Edge projects strive to provide that support through workshops and Web portals that provide access to a variety of educational materials.

AB  - New science standards and reform recommendations spanning grades K--16 focus on a limited set of key scientific concepts from each discipline that all students should know. They also emphasize the integration of these concepts with science practices so that students learn not only the "what" of science but also the "how" and "why." In line with this approach, we present an exercise that models the integration of fundamental evolutionary concepts with science practices. Students use Avida-ED digital evolution software to test claims from a study on mutated butterflies in the vicinity of the compromised Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant complex subsequent to the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011. This exercise is appropriate for use in both high school and undergraduate biology classrooms.

AB  - Expectancy-value theory of motivation (EVT) suggests that student values influence their likelihood of putting in the effort required to learn, and these values can be shaped by student characteristics, such as their experiences, sociodemographics, and disciplinary norms. To understand the extent to which these characteristics relate to students' values, we surveyed 1162 graduating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students across four universities using the previously developed and validated Survey of Teaching Beliefs and Practices for Undergraduates (STEP-U). The STEP-U survey included Likert questions to capture students' values of 27 cross-disciplinary skills and the frequency with which they experienced 27 instructional methods thought to develop particular skills. Exploratory factor analyses (EFA) showed an understandable factor structure for both students' perceived value of cross-disciplinary skills and frequency of classroom experiences. Using multiple regression, we identified differences in values that were associated with classroom experiences, STEM discipline, participation in undergraduate research, and student sociodemographics. Findings were generalizable across institutions and disciplines. The theoretical framework (EVT), the broad data collection (four institutions with multiple disciplines), and the type of data analyses (e.g., EFA) used provide theoretical, methodological, and practical contributions and suggest additional directions for future research.

AB  - As the presence of engineering content and practices increases in science education, the distinction between the two fields of science and technology education becomes even more vague than previously theorized. Furthermore, the addition of engineering to the title of the profession raises the question of the true aim of technology education. As a result, the technology and engineering education community must effectively communicate its role in an evolving STEM education landscape. During this time of change, it is important that we understand how the technology education profession has transitioned in the past while we figure out how to balance traditions and contemporary needs. The authors present three pathways that appear most salient in moving forward: (1) adhering to the fundamental goals of technology education, (2) collaborating with science education to potentially become a core discipline, or (3) revitalizing the field through a shift to engineering education. A final recommendation is made to energize the field by centering on becoming a true provider of K-12 engineering education.

AB  - STEM education has become a global priority as governments realise that there are important economic benefits if students engage in this interdisciplinary curriculum area. Less prominence has been given to the community benefits that STEM education can bring and even less attention has been given to the potential for children's learning of STEM to increase adults' understanding of environmental issues. Purpose: This study examined how an interdisciplinary STEM education unit of work was implemented in a primary school to educate children's families and the school community about a little known but significant issue: the plight of honey bees. Sample: The paper reports on two primary school teachers and their classes who were engaging in a STEM unit of work. The children were aged nine and ten years old and the school was in a metropolitan location. The unit of work being taught focussed on creating an education game to highlight the importance of honey bees. Design and methods: Using a case study design multiple sources of data were collected including video, semi structured interviews, and work samples over the course of eight lessons. The data analysis involved an iterative model of video analysis integrated with analysis of student games and community interviews. Results: The multiple sources of data suggested that the extended learning module was able to support the development of student understanding of the plight of honey bees and that children were able to transform their learning into board games that enabled the children to inform and inspire the local community. Conclusion: These findings offer insights into how children can transform their learning into a resource and then can use this resource to educate a school community about a complex and significant environmental issue.

AB  - Transmedia design, which involves extending a narrative from one medium to another, offers a context for potentially rich, interdisciplinary learning. We explored these opportunities by creating a week-long workshop to guide 7th-grade student teams in designing games based on comic books about viruses. This design case describes the framework and rationale behind our design choices. It illustrates our experiences by drawing on field note observations and audio recordings, student-generated design artifacts, student and facilitator interviews, and planning documentation from across two iterations of the workshop. We reflect on our experiences in attempting to balance (1) the dual focus of the workshop on science learning and game design through our choices of comic and game genres; and (2) the ability for students to be both autonomous and to receive necessary guidance through our enforcement of design constraints and interdependent team roles. We also reflect on the contextual factors that mediated our work, including students' existing interests and peer relations, their teachers' involvement, and our own team's shifting expertise as membership changed from one iteration to the next. Among other things, our experiences highlight the importance of designing to allow for change, particularly as learning through collaborative transmedia game design can occur in unanticipated ways. Finally, we reflect on plans for future iterations of this workshop.

AB  - All learning, particularly higher learning, is premised on the notion that there is such a thing as truth and that it is eminently worth pursuing. All serious inquiries into the various branches of human knowledge have the discovery and dissemination of truth as their end goals. The humanities are no exception. In the last several decades, however, the disciplines collectively known as the humanities--philosophy, history, literature, and art--have not conducted themselves with the same seriousness as the hard sciences. Truth-seeking and the desire to put knowledge to good use are not mutually opposed goals. But they should not be treated interchangeably. Universities can and should train students to be skilled professionals. Empiricism, specialization, and technological progress have their place in the university. They are means, however, and not ends to higher education's ultimate purpose: human flourishing. Students must be grounded in wisdom that offers a unifying vision of the "kind" of professionals they should aspire to be. In short, universities need to restore the cultivation of wisdom to its central place and put modern tools in the service of ancient wisdom.

AB  - The boundary work approach has been established as one of the main ways to study controversies in science. However, it has been proposed that it does not meet the power dynamics of the scientific field sufficiently. This article concentrates on the intertwining of boundary work and power. It combines the boundary work approach developed by Thomas Gieryn and the analysis of power in the work of Pierre Bourdieu. Based on a literature review and an analysis of a controversy over therapeutic touch, it finds four forms of boundary work: intradisciplinary, interdisciplinary, between science and society, and between science and other knowledge systems. The article shows how the different forms of boundary work reveal multiple power struggles, hierarchisations and tensions. The controversy appeared in Finnish nursing science when the Finnish Association of Sceptics gave its annual Humbug Award to a book on therapeutic touch. The book was based on a master's thesis at the University of Tampere department of nursing science. The nursing scholars in the department reacted abruptly and banned certain books, which astonished the students, and a lively public debate followed. In the debate, nursing science was both defended and challenged. The framework of the study shows that the boundary work approach can be used to study different aspects of power. The article proposes that the framework could be used in other controversies as well to study the layers of power in boundary work.

AB  - Many middle school students perform below grade-level standards in reading (National Center for Education Statistics, Washington, 2019), and recent observation studies demonstrate middle school teachers' limited use of reading comprehension practices within content area instruction (e.g., science and social studies; as reported by Greenleaf (in: Hinchman (ed) Adolescent literacies: A handbook of practice-based research, Guilford Press, 2017)). In this experimental pilot study, we aimed to boost middle schoolers' reading comprehension outcomes by providing schoolwide professional development (PD) on integrating reading comprehension practices within content instruction for English language arts, social studies, and science teachers. Six schools were matched into pairs and randomized to the schoolwide PD or a business-as-usual (BAU) condition. Content area teachers in schools assigned to the PD condition received distributed PD resources to support implementation, and coaching in one reading comprehension practice in the fall (i.e., get the gist) and one in the spring (i.e., asking and answering questions). Contrary to traditional PD, this PD was implemented across three content areas, was narrow in scope but long in duration (one practice per semester), focused on practices that could feasibly be integrated into content area instruction, and included ongoing coaching in content area teams. Students in schools assigned to the PD condition significantly outperformed those in the BaU condition on a measure of main idea generation (ES = 0.29) but not on measures of asking and answering questions (ES = 0.11) and general reading comprehension (ES = - 0.09). Findings suggest promise for implementing schoolwide approaches embedded within content area instruction to improve reading comprehension performance for middle school students.

AB  - This article argues that poetry is an act of meditation, improvisation and exploration, and urgency is what guides the writer into (and through) the poetic journey. In the light of this, this article illustrates the features of a workshop that was designed to guide social and human scientists in the delicate process of turning raw data into poems. One of the chief objectives of the decolonial project is to bridge the gap between Westernised academia ("The Ivory Tower") and communities where research is conducted, and this article aims to show how poetic inquiry is a fitting research methodology that can serve this purpose. Through a description of the workshop process and specific poems that emerged from it, it suggests that poetic inquiry is an innovative and effective research methodology for social and human scientists engaged in the transformation of conventional knowledge production.

AB  - Based on the multidisciplinary field of multimodality, this paper offers a theoretical perspective on the construct of a curricular concept which is commonly used in a school curriculum and applies it to an analysis of a typical curricular text and classroom instruction that exposit the physics concept of work-energy. Theorizing a concept as a network of meaning relationships across multiple modes of representation situated in human activity, this approach examines how we can recognize the meaning constructed through the semantic relationships of language and its contextualization with pictorial, graphical, and numerical resources. The value of this approach to curriculum and instruction in formal educational settings is also presented.

AB  - School accountability has funnelled educational practices into a path where teaching practices are heavily centred in Language Arts instruction. Focusing learning almost exclusively in the aforesaid area develops a one-dimensional process that could hold back certain students from a well-balanced education. This article presents a model of interdisciplinary teaching, building cognitive bridges between subject areas, implemented during the 2006-2007 school year with 29 English Language Learners (ELL) 4th grade students from an elementary school located in Southern California. The goal was to increase students' language proficiency and their academic performance by creating multidimensional practices that emphasised the idea that a subject area (i.e., Mathematics) is an open body of knowledge fed by other disciplines (i.e., Science, Social Studies). The outcomes of this project suggest that students exposed to interdisciplinary methodologies not only build language as a multidimensional tool but they also increase their academic performance.

AB  - Some of the most important scientific studies are associated with either incredibly large dimensions (e.g., the universe) or extremely small proportions (e.g., the cell). While a teacher's curriculum may often switch from mega-expanses to minutia, they should question how easily students comprehend the change in sizes. This article addresses the crosscutting concept of scale, focusing on microscopic science. Microorganisms and pollen, either modern or fossilized, offer students a glimpse into a hidden "micro world." Pollens and microfossils are abundant, readily providing opportunities for student-led inquiry to address concepts in botany, ecology, fossilization, evolution, and environmental change. The article discusses how the study of microfossils and pollen can be used to focus upon concepts in biology, geology, chemistry, mathematics, economics, art, history, and more. The authors assert that MicroWorld inquiry units such as the one described herein can incorporate reconstruction of ancient environments, solve "mysteries" of crime scenes, and address current issues such as climate change. Perhaps most importantly, microfossils and pollen can address the crosscutting concept of scale from the microscopic viewpoint.

AB  - Teaching introductory statistics to postgraduate students from multidisciplinary background and with diverse mathematics ability is a huge challenge that many statistics lecturers do not deny. The large ability range can make it very difficult for lecturers to fine tune the right level for effective course delivery. Even though an introductory statistics course has been seen as a necessary component for many postgraduate programs, research has shown that students have come to perceive statistics negatively. One suggestion for improving students' attitude toward statistics is through the use of innovative instructional approaches. This paper investigates the extent to which scenario-based learning (SBL) method used in a Statistics for Research in Education course were related to improvement in postgraduate students' attitude toward statistics. Nineteen students who enrolled in the course during the first semester of 2019/2020 were taught using the SBL instructional method. Survey of Attitudes Toward Statistics-36 (SATS-36) was used to measure six statistics attitude components at the beginning and at the end of the course. Overall results show that there is a difference between mean score of attitude before and after exposure to scenario-based learning method. Scenario based learning has some positive effect on student attitude toward statistics.

AB  - Mechatronics is a multidisciplinary that includes a combination of mechanics, electronics, control systems, and computer science. The main objective of mechatronics learning is to establish a comprehensive mindset in the development of mechatronic systems. Project Based Learning (PBL) is an appropriate method for use in the learning process of mechatronic. The use of PBL by following the V model in system development process is expected to encourage the achievement of the main goal of learning in mechatronics lab. Demonstration of knowledge during the practical work done by drafting product development procedures documents, presentations, and project demo. The test result of mechatronics lab course based on PBL in Electronics Engineering Bandung State Polytechnic led to the conclusion that the model is acceptable and desirable to be passed with a few improvements. In addition, learners also feel there is a new challenge in following the PBL-based practicum.

AB  - This article addresses the need for researchers to move beyond discipline-specific approaches to research and practice and offers an example of how interdisciplinary understandings can increase knowledge in respective disciplines. The specific focus of the article is the shared challenges of broaching controversy in science and social studies classrooms. Although there is much that social studies teachers can learn about the teaching of controversial public issues from the challenges science educators face in teaching evolutionary theory, and vice versa, the two literature bases have little overlap. Through this example of broaching curricular controversy in the classroom, the author argues that content instruction can be improved by increasing awareness of research and practice in other disciplines.

AB  - This article describes a required capstone course for students in the Global Supply Chain Management (GSCM) Program at Bryant University, designed to prepare students for a career in supply chain management. Student teams work on semester-long projects for locally and regionally based companies. The projects are supported by all GSCM faculty who teach in the Information Systems and Analytics, Management, and Marketing departments. Since the inception of this capstone course in the fall of 2010, a total of 83 projects for 42 companies have been completed. Hence this article discusses an extensive number of projects over an extended period of time, and our insights should be of interest to supply chain faculty who currently have, or plan to include, empirical projects as a key component of their course or supply chain program. We present a brief literature review on teaching supply chain management, and then describe the practicum capstone course, Empirical Applications in Global Supply Chain Management. We provide company and project descriptions and discuss project outcomes. Students have estimated savings/earnings impact of $109.5 million from 35 projects completed over a 4-year period. Although not without challenges, the practicum capstone course provides students with an integrative, multidisciplinary experience that better prepares them for their careers.

AB  - Identity is the core of who we are as individuals. It shapes how we present ourselves, our expectations of how we interact with others and their treatment of us, and forms the basis of what we believe are our capabilities and potential. Identity is not limited to individuals, but also includes groups, such as clubs, organizations, and professions. In fact, identification within a profession is an essential rite of passage, which often follows the completion of an educational degree or an intensive training program, both of which have a strong influence on the construction and shape of the individual's professional identity. While in MLIS programs, like many undergraduate programs, students develop a sense of community, which is reinforced through internships, work experiences and membership in professional organizations. The context of a community is key to the development of professional. Interdisciplinary fields, such as library and information science, use these communities to share information across disciplines and develop academic norms. LIS educators help to develop this identity through course work and interactions with students. As a result, LIS educators need to understand their role and how their teaching contributes to the profession holistically rather than focus on individual positions or roles.

AB  - Environmental art education is growing in popularity in college and university programs as the arts begin to play a more prominent role in environmental and sustainability education. As this emerging field of study is an interdisciplinary endeavor that draws from the more established fields of visual art education and environmental education, environmental art education offers a means to increase the pool of potential learners to those in the arts and sciences, as well as diversify learning to ensure that it is memorable and authentic. This article describes two different approaches to the design of courses in this emerging field from the perspectives of both science and art educators, in hopes of providing direction on the development of curricula and pedagogy in environmental art education to other educators.
