AB  - In 2006 Jeanette Wing, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, proposed computational thinking (CT) as a literacy just as important as reading, writing, and mathematics. Wing defined CT as a set of skills and strategies computer scientists use to solve complex, computational problems (Wing 2006). The computer science and education research communities, along with the authors of the "Next Generation Science Standards" (NGSS Lead States 2013; see box, p. 28), agree that CT is essential for students' successful participation in today's economy To help teachers incorporate CT into their classrooms, David Weintrop and his colleagues (2016) proposed the Computational Thinking in Mathematics and Science Taxonomy (Figure 1). In an effort to move CT beyond the computer lab and into the mathematics and science classrooms, their framework proposes 22 CT practices divided into four categories. This article describes a project that incorporates many of the practices outlined in their broad view of computational thinking. The Boom. Bust. Build. project employs a project-based learning (PBL) approach (Krajcik and Blumenfeld 2006) to teach computational thinking and NGSS-aligned environmental science concepts through redevelopment of a fictional city. The project is student-centered, collaborative, authentic, includes student choice and autonomy, and could be made interdisciplinary through collaboration with civics and economics classes (Knoll 1997). Furthermore, teachers serve as facilitators and guides rather than driving the process.

AB  - Using a state-wide college student dataset, this study examines how the level of college students' spiritual/religious engagement varies by academic disciplines and how the impact of such engagement on affective college outcomes varies across different academic disciplines. Findings show that students majoring in soft-applied-life disciplines (e.g., education, public health, and counseling) are more likely to engage in spiritual/religious activities whereas those who major in the hard-applied-life disciplines (e.g., agriculture, animal sciences, nursing) and hard-applied-nonlife disciplines (e.g., engineering, computer sciences, pharmacy) are less likely to do so. Our findings also suggest that students in some academic disciplines benefit more or less than their counterparts in other academic disciplines.

AB  - This primarily online Master's degree program focused on advancing K-8 teachers' interdisciplinary mathematical and science content knowledge while integrating appropriate digital technologies as learning and teaching tools. The mixed-method, interpretive study examined in-service teachers' technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) within the context of interdisciplinary content knowledge, pedagogical strategies for teaching interdisciplinary topics, and technological knowledge when applied to teaching and learning interdisciplinary content. The results documented ways specific coursework in the graduate program impacted the teachers' overarching conceptions of teaching interdisciplinary topics, their knowledge of students' understanding and thinking, their instructional strategies, and their knowledge of curriculum and curriculum materials for learning in interdisciplinary contexts with the integration of appropriate technologies.

AB  - Computer-assisted language learning, or CALL, is an interdisciplinary area of research, positioned between science and social science, computing and education, linguistics and applied linguistics. This paper argues that by appropriating methods originating in some areas of CALL-related research, for example human-computer interaction (HCI) or psycholinguistics, the agenda of "attention-focus" research can be shifted from a cognitive perspective to a learner-centred approach; understanding online language learning and teaching spaces as mediated by technology; second/foreign language learning; and online teaching culture. Taking a method that has traditionally been used within a positivist paradigm, the authors exemplify the potential of eyetracking to advance online language learning research--extending it in ways compatible with a sociocultural paradigm. This is evidenced by two pioneering studies in which an innovative combination of methods allows participants, whose gaze focus was recorded during synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC), to reflect back on their involvement. Eyetracking is combined with stimulated recall interviews that trigger deep refection on learner and teacher strategies by directing participants' recollections on their attention focus. The rich, multifaceted results shown by this original and innovative use of eyetracking methods in a sociocultural framework suggest a way forward in researching online learning by integrating insider and outside views coherently and systematically.

AB  - Recognition of the value of a scientifically literate citizenry has driven American science education reform since the 1950s. We have seen some improvement in the comprehension of science facts in the past 10-20 years, but far less improvement in Americans' understanding of the nature of science. College science courses are ideal venues for promoting science literacy. However, in an effort to condense a complicated subject into a single semester, the nature of science is often lost amidst the facts presented in a freshman survey course, often the entirety  of a non-science major's experience in science. We argue that an interdisciplinary approach that integrates the sciences and the humanities can attract non-science majors, increasing these students' exposure to scientific concepts by relating them to students' existing interests and knowledge. This fosters science literacy by teaching students that science is a process of human inquiry with a distinct methodology, instead of simply a litany of facts. We recommend that a successful interdisciplinary course should present an engaging topic with which students can  identify, incorporate opportunities for student research, and offer site visits to working laboratories.

AB  - To promote the integration of aesthetic education into chemistry education, this study designed activities to photograph precipitation reaction experiments with a smartphone, thereby combining experimental inquiry with artistic creation across disciplines. These activities were divided into (i) perceiving, (ii) appreciating, (iii) exploring, and (iv) creating the beauty of chemistry. The participants first used macrophotography to capture the details and small changes of a precipitation reaction to obtain an impression of beauty. Then, they managed to understand, appreciate, and evaluate the beauty of the precipitation reaction from an artistic vision (admiring chemistry like an artist). Next, the students explored the fascinating phenomenon from a chemical perspective and looked for its inherent laws. Finally, they consistently improved the experimental and photographic methods and created works of scientific photography. These activities are suitable for students from primary school to college, and even for the general public. The experiments can be completed in only 1 min, but several hours can be spent to improve the results. In the end, most students are able to take high-quality photographs of precipitation reactions.

AB  - This study aims to reveal the trends in the related field by examining the researches evaluating the measurement invariance in education and psychology between 2008-2019. Accordingly, 99 articles published in three journals that were selected using the purposive sampling method among the journals indexed on Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) were analyzed within the scope of the study. As a result of the content analysis, in the studies investigating the measurement invariance, typical response tests were observed to be the most frequently employed tests, sample sizes often included 1501 or greater number of subjects, and data were mostly collected from students. The measurement invariance of the tests was mostly analyzed in terms of the gender variable. According to the results of the bibliometric analysis, on the other hand, only Multi-Group Confirmatory Factor Analysis was mostly conducted on the Mplus software package. In the studies, the most cited article was "Cheung and Rensvold (2002)", the author was "Cheung, G. W.", and the journal was "Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal". According to the results of the analysis, studies, references, and keywords including factor analysis were among the most commonly used group, which denotes that factor analysis has a crucial role in invariance measurement analyses.

AB  - In the last 5 years, there have been several literature reviews or meta-analyses investigating various aspects of STEM education; however, they have investigated a specific aspect of STEM, e.g. robotics, or digital games, or Early childhood, or Teacher perspectives. In addition, a broad-reaching review on STEM integration has not been conducted in the past 10 years. This article reports findings from a Systematic Qualitative Literature Review concerning STEM education for children aged 4-12 in formal education contexts. To provide context, the article initially presents descriptive findings (date and country of research, age of participants, research setting, and research methodologies used) in the 60 research articles that are included for analysis. The article then answers three research questions regarding the: (1) level of integration evident in the studies; (2) role of engineering in any such integration; and (3) teaching approaches used in the studies. Findings from this research suggest that there is still much work to be done to move from scenarios where STEM integration is claimed but is not evident in practice. To do so we encourage educators and researchers to (a) focus on authentic interdisciplinary approaches rather than the siloed approaches evident in the existing research; and (b) use a teaching approach such as problem-based or project-based learning that provide opportunities for authentic integration.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce Notice, Wonder, Feel, Act, and Reimagine (NWFAR) to promote social justice in data science (DS) education. NWFAR draws on intersectional feminist DS to scaffold critical perspectives towards systems of power and oppression and attend to students' experiences in designs for learning. NWFAR adds three practices that are typically not emphasized in learning designs for DS: feel--engaging emotions and the physical body; act--challenging, inspiring, or informing others towards change; and reimagine--envisioning how data, data methods, and data technologies could pursue different problems, solutions, and perspectives. We illustrate NWFAR through two design-based research projects from prior empirical work. Through these two examples, we demonstrate what thinking with NWFAR could look like in practice and highlight future possibilities for learning. We conclude with a discussion that focuses on the reimagining dimension, in which we highlight social-justice oriented theories

AB  - The approach that students take in their studies at university is critical not only for their academic success but is equally important in life-long learning for their career and professional development. Heutagogy is the study of self-determined learning and it is important that we appraise how students in higher education are developing their metacognitive awareness in how they learn and study effectively. Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary research area that involves the scientific study of the human mind. It helps provide new knowledge in relation to areas such as memory, problem solving, knowledge transfer and understanding of complex topics. Cognitive science has demonstrated that re-testing oneself on material when learning, enhances and promotes greater retention of knowledge compared to re-reading the material. Learning that is distributed or spaced out over multiple study sessions also allows for greater retention of knowledge in the longer-term compared to 'cramming' of information. To evaluate the use of effective study approaches and habits across three different levels of study in an undergraduate pharmacy programme, a survey study was employed. A paper-based survey was completed by first-, second- and third-year undergraduate pharmacy students (n=192) during class sessions. Although there was some evidence of metacognitive awareness such as using testing (retrieval practice) with practice problems; across all years, suboptimal study approaches such as rereading, copying notes and cramming were endorsed. A schedule of deadlines shaped the organisation of study and time management for most students. Self-testing was predominantly used to test learning rather than an approach used during learning. There was evidence of a difference between the cohorts in relation to decisions for prioritizing studying, returning to review course material and re-reading. The evidence from this study demonstrates that learners would require training on metacognitive awareness and effective study strategies to enable their self-determined learning capabilities to evolve. The linear progression through a programme of study alone will not achieve this. There is a need to embed and emphasize effective strategies for learning into curricula and for faculty to utilise metacognitive awareness in their teaching.

AB  - "Standards for Technological and Engineering Literacy" ("STEL") promotes science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, where technology and engineering play a critical role as subject integrators. Integration of STEM in project-based learning is an ideal approach, with benefits of enhancing student learning and 21st-century competencies. Contemporary educational reform requires science and engineering practices to be integrated and suggests that this integration should be explicit (International Technology and Engineering Educators Association [ITEEA], 2020; NRC 2012). However, teachers often experience challenges while presenting STEM content using an integrative approach. For a successful implementation of integrated STEM, teachers need to be informed about how to integrate STEM contents while also using essential pedagogical approaches. This article proposes an integrated STEM lesson titled "Designing Bugs and Innovative Technology" ("D-BAIT") as a practical and feasible model that high school STEM teachers can adopt in their classrooms. The "D-BAIT" lesson, developed by STEM researchers within a national STEM education project, teaches high school students engineering design using biomimicry, life science, and mathematics. This paper analyzes the "D-BAIT" lesson based on "STEL" and addresses how well the lesson aligns with project-based and problem-based instruction. The "D-BAIT" lesson will inform how design instruction can be blended into science and engineering practices, which will guide STEM teachers and educators to create and implement integrated STEM lessons.

AB  - A climate-literate population, capable of making informed decisions related to climate change, is of critical importance as society faces ever-increasing global temperatures and changes in the climate system. This project evaluates the effectiveness of a novel instructional approach that incorporates climate change science into a first-year undergraduate level writing course. Science content included in the course focuses on climate and global environmental change and how it relates to society, policy, and economics. The multidisciplinary nature of the course material allows the climate change science content to be addressed from different viewpoints and student perspectives. Student surveys and self-reflections indicate that fundamental climate change science concepts and content can be taught in the context of a nonscience course focused on writing. Selfreflections reveal that 50% of students reported new or continuing interest in science and climate science, 35% did not explicitly mention their attitude toward science, 10% remained uninterested, and 5% lost interest as a result of participating in the pilot course. To produce climate literate citizens, new methods such as the pilot course described in this study, can be used to incorporate the science of climate change into nonscience

AB  - The aim of this research is to determine the effectiveness of an enacted professional development (CPD) programme to promote teacher's self-efficacy with respect to implementing motivational, context-based science teaching, following an education through science (EtS), three-stage model approach. The CPD is designed, based on a constructivist, sociocultural professional development model (CSPM) to meet professional needs of each teacher within a predetermined teaching-learning approach and enacted through suitable instructional methods linked to teacher as learner, teacher as teacher and teacher as reflective practitioner. The effectiveness of the CPD is identified by means of a carefully constructed and validated Teacher Needs Questionnaire (TNQ), plus follow-up teacher interviews. Findings suggest the outcomes of the CPD, both from pre-post use of the TNQ and the undertaking of interventions, using teaching-learning modules based on the CPD, are effective in raising teacher's self-efficacy with respect to new interdisciplinary content knowledge, teaching approaches and classroom implementation, seen as being in line with curriculum expectations.

AB  - The US National Science Foundation's (NSF's) Undergraduate Biology and Mathematics (UBM) program significantly increased undergraduate research in the biomathematical sciences. We discuss three UBM-funded student research projects at Clarkson University that lie at the intersection of not just mathematics and biology, but also other fields. The first project focused on optimizing a network model for how the brain detects and reacts to threats, an important problem in neuroscience. The second project sought to classify species of lizards based on geometric features of their shapes. This is a classic problem in evolutionary biology that became an innovative problem in mathematical imaging science when the students developed methods to analyze on features extracted from image data. The final project was psychology based and aimed at developing statistical methods for analyzing the behavioral and psychosocial effects of caffeine use by college students. This article describes the logistics of our UBM research program, the student projects, and, most importantly, the lessons learned working with students and other researchers from a wide range of backgrounds in the formal setting of an NSF-funded undergraduate research program.

AB  - This review is a theoretical paper which examined gender stereotyping and social norms. The review was supported by feminist theory, critical theory and social psychology theory. The review utilizes a comprehensive strategy to investigate the theoretical lenses and consequences of gender stereotyping and social norms. The approach comprised of a few key stages. A survey incorporating gender stereotyping, social norms, feminist theory, critical theory and social psychology to assemble an all encompassing comprehension of the review was done. The review of gender stereotyping and social norms through critical assessment of key idea and viewpoints from feminist theory, critical theory and social psychology. The structure for revealing perplexing social peculiarities is given by the integration of feminist theory, critical theory and social psychology theory. This enlightened the basic component of inequality and injustice by considering the joint impact of gender, power and social setting. The review revealed the pervasive nature of gender stereotyping and social norms, their effect on causing inequality and injustice and the significance of promoting gender equality and social equity. In this way, the significance of interdisciplinary collaborative effort and combined actions in addressing the issue of gender stereotyping and social norms within educational setting and more extensive cultural setting. It emphasized the need for holistic approaches that will consider the broad intersection of power, ideology, and social issue in order to create gender equality and social justice both in the social and educational domain.

AB  - The need to develop interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) skills in young pupils has driven many educational systems to include STEM as a subject in primary schools. In this work, a science kit aimed at children from 8 to 14 years old is presented as a support platform for an innovative and stimulating approach to STEM learning. The peculiar design of the kit, based on modular components, is aimed to help develop a multitude of skills in the young students, dividing the learning process into two phases. During phase 1 the pupils build the experimental setup and visualize the scientific phenomena, while in phase 2, they are introduced and challenged to understand the principles on which these phenomena are based, guided by a handbook. This approach aims at making the experience more inclusive, stimulating the interest and passion of the pupils for scientific subjects.

AB  - Nowadays, solving problems is substantial for the social relationship human. Computational Thinking (CT) emerges as an interdisciplinary thought process encompassing mental abilities to help students solve and understand problems. Researchers invest in the methodological proposal of activities aimed at CT stimulation, educational approaches, and the conception of technologies that support these activities' execution. Educational Robotics (ER) is one of these technologies that stand out at different educational levels to favor teamwork, logical thinking, and creativity, skills intimately articulated with the computing paradigm. The main objective of this work is to investigate the impact of ER activities on CT development and subjects learning in the Technical and Vocational Education in High School. For this, we accomplished a study of intervention research type with students and teachers analyzing quantitative and qualitative aspects. The results indicate that the introduction of ER can favor students in the development of CT skills and learning High School subjects.

AB  - Family and consumer sciences (FCS) is an interdisciplinary study of the relationships between humans and their social, natural, and built environments. Critical thinking has been a vital part of the profession since its beginning. Ellen Swallow Richards founded the discipline in 1899 on the premise of improving quality of life for individuals, families, and communities by using critical thinking skills. The postmodern perspective of the profession integrates knowledge and applies science to complex issues facing families in society (Richards, 2000). Using this perspective, FCS educators help individuals use critical thinking to make informed decisions about well-being, relationships, and resources to achieve optimal quality of life. The National Association of State Administrators for Family and Consumer Sciences (NASAFCS) advocates critical thinking skills to promote reasoning for technical, interpretive, and reflective action on a problem while connecting academic and FCS content in the classroom (NASAFCS, 2008).

AB  - Background/Context: Literacy stands as a pivotal life skill, especially as it strengthens education across subjects. The elementary years are crucial for mastering literacy, yet national assessments show a decline in elementary students' reading proficiency, with only 33% of American fourth graders reading at grade level (National Center for Education Statistics, 2023). Effective early education can equip children with essential skills such as literacy. Historical programs like Perry Preschool and contemporary ones like Boston's pre-school program have shown significant long-term benefits (Heckman et al., 2010; Gray-Lobe et al., 2023). However, there is limited causal evidence on the lasting impact of early literacy programs. The "trifecta skills" framework suggests lasting effects occur when interventions target fundamental and malleable skills (Bailey et al., 2017). Incorporating science content into literacy programs offers rich language opportunities, which may support early skill development (Barnes et al., 2016; Dwyer et al., 2016; Lawrence et al., 2015). Purpose/Objective/Research Question: This study builds on the prior impact evaluation of Zoology One. The original study assessed its effectiveness on kindergarten students' literacy outcomes and found positive impacts on students' passage comprehension, motivation to read and letter name fluency (Gray et al., 2022). The objective of this paper is to investigate effects heterogeneity by cohort and long-term impacts up to four years after the intervention. Setting: School District of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Population/Participants/Subjects: The initial study involved 71 kindergarten classrooms across 21 schools, totaling 1,589 participants (Gray et al., 2022). The study spanned two school cohorts: Cohort 1 comprised 12 schools with 40 kindergarten classrooms during the 2016-17 academic year, and Cohort 2 included and additional nine schools with 31 kindergarten classrooms during the 2017-18 academic year. The analysis incorporated both intent-to-treat (ITT) and treatment-on-treated (TOT) analytical samples. Approximately 8% of the sample were designated as English Language Learners, 7% had an Individualized Education Plan, 66% were classified as economically disadvantaged, 73% were BIPOC, and 50% of the students were female. Intervention/Program/Practice: Zoology One is a kindergarten literacy curriculum that integrates science content. It involves a 90-minute instructional block that includes morning meeting, readers' and writers' workshops using science-based texts and materials, small-group instruction, and hands-on science exploration activities. Instruction is tailored through a data driven approach to formative assessment and leveling. In addition, the curriculum emphasizes the importance of building a culture around literacy and the volume of reading and writing through activities for independent reading, daily writing and science instruction, and home reading. Students in treatment classrooms received Zoology One as the literacy curriculum, and control classrooms experienced business as usual literacy instruction. Teachers in the treatment group received professional development and ongoing classroom-based coaching throughout the year. Research Design: The effectiveness of Zoology One was evaluated through a multi-site cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT), incorporating randomization at the classroom level with blocking on school (Gray et al., 2022). This design supports causal inferences about program impacts. Baseline was established between treatment and control. The current longitudinal study follows both cohorts over four school years. Data Collection and Analysis: The original study collected a variety of outcomes aligned with Zoology One's theory of change (Gray et al., 2022). These assessments were administered by both the school district and the research team and encompassed the Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests (WRMT), Kauffman Test of Education Achievement (KTEA) for writing, and AIMSweb. The current study examines follow-up outcomes on WRMT and AIMSweb in grades K through 2. In addition to exploring standardized measures, this study focuses on assessing long-term student achievement, measured through quarterly and final course letter grades in reading, writing, and science spanning 1st through 4th grades. Using course grades, we implemented a three-level mixed-effects ordinal logistic model to explore longitudinal impacts (Hedeker & Gibbons, 2006). Longitudinal analyses were followed-up with single year impact analyses to explore impacts on course grades from 1st to 4th grade. Exploratory analysis of treatment effect variation among subgroup of students over time were conducted. Different levels of attrition across grade levels were found. To address this issue, an inverse probability weighting (IPW) approach was used to minimize the bias of group differences at baseline between the retained sample and the sample of students who were dropped out due to missing outcomes in later grades. Findings/Results: The analysis indicates an overall positive average effect of Zoology One on reading, writing, and science over time. Notably, there is a significant positive effect in reading (OR = 1.52, 95% CI [1.18, 1.95], p = 0.004) and science (OR = 1.32, 95% CI [1.03, 1.69], p = 0.028), suggesting that students exposed to Zoo have higher odds of achieving a higher outcome level in reading and science (see Table 1). On average, the odds of Zoo students are 52% higher than those of control students in attaining a higher outcome level in reading, and 32% higher in science. The single-year impact analyses reveal a positive effect of the intervention in 2nd grade (OR = 1.43, 95% CI [1.19, 1.73], p = 0.008), 3rd grade (OR =1.40, 95% CI [1.15,1.71], p = 0.011), and 4th grade (OR = 1.42, 95% CI [1.19, 1.70], p = 0.005) in writing. Heterogeneity analyses revealed larger magnitude treatment effects among cohort 1 students on writing in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grade (see Table 2). Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of grades as intermediary outcomes in long-term skill development, especially in early childhood interventions. The timing of these outcomes may be important, shedding light on effects that may dissipate in elementary school only to resurface in adulthood, as seen in other programs like Perry Preschool and the Boston Pre-K program. By demonstrating impacts on course grades, our findings offer insight into comprehensive measures beyond traditional assessments. While challenges persist in measuring non-academic outcomes in early elementary school, our study provides nuanced understanding of the impact of blended literacy curricula without adverse effects.

AB  - This mixed-methods study explored the impact of science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) lessons on elementary students' STEAM knowledge, identities, and attitudes toward STEAM education. The study was conducted at an independent school in South Florida, United States, which employs arts integration pedagogy to serve at-risk students. Eleven third-grade students participated in the study. Paired t-tests and qualitative analyses of open-ended surveys were performed to examine their self-reported knowledge, identity, and attitudes. The findings revealed significant increases in students' self-reported knowledge of coding and programming robots. Qualitative data suggested that integrating art with science enhanced comprehension of scientific concepts. Regarding STEAM identity, the study showed a significant increase in students' self-reported competence in programming robots. Thematic analysis of qualitative data supported this finding, indicating that the lessons fostered creative problem-solving skills and self-recognition of these abilities.

AB  - Ample scientific literature recognises the role of visual thinking in the constructive process of ideas and mental images and the function of visual intelligence in the communicative processes. Starting from the sectoral studies, we have turned our attention to the visual communication of the results of scientific research, relating it to some characteristics of artistic communication to find a shared ground, that is, a third space inhabited by common languages and competencies. In so doing, we have overcome the traditional antinomy between humanists and scientists, starting instead from the results of a recent study that has shown how such an opposition does not find real confirmation in the sector of science communication. We have thus analysed three case studies (graphical abstract, augmented reality, audiovisual documentation) on the grounds of a 10-year long experience of research in the field of visual communication (iconography and iconology, art teaching, video research) to acknowledge visual thinking and graphical/artistic competencies, situated in the third space between didactics and art, a fundamental role in the formation of a scientist and a researcher.

AB  - Pre-service teachers (PSTs) often struggle to teach STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) content effectively due to lack of training on how to plan a STEM lesson in meaningful ways as well as which subjects to integrate. This dilemma often results in an avoidance of STEM methodology altogether. This paper describes a productive method for training PSTs to successfully teach STEM lessons by using Social Studies content to integrate with Mathematics and Science and to provide context and connection to real-world applications. Along with providing a STEM lesson, the article demonstrates the critical role Social Studies can play as the "glue" for some integrated lesson plans.

AB  - Despite widespread acknowledgment of the importance of interdisciplinary pedagogy, disciplinary teaching remains the norm on most campuses, primarily due to cost and institutional constraints. Bridging the gap between literature on interdisciplinary teaching and active-learning techniques, this article describes an innovative and less costly approach through the linkage of case-study active-learning techniques with interdisciplinary principles at a small liberal arts college. We apply this student-centered approach to teaching international development, a field that critically needs integration across several social sciences. A practical way for political scientists to encourage undergraduate-level interdisciplinary thinking is to develop a case study that asks students to utilize practical problem-solving skills and policy analysis. We analyze the implementation and assessment of such a case study, discuss its successes and shortcomings and provide suggestions for expanded implementation. We also discuss the broad applicability of this approach to topics that require integration across disciplines in a variety of institutional settings.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to present a conceptual framework to guide the design, development, implementation and evaluation of education and human resource development (HRD) efforts in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on the concept of a tempered radical approach to provide a framework for a critical HRD (CHRD) and explore ways by which this view can contribute to developing HR who possess the requisite tools and character to function efficiently in the 21st century and beyond. This paper followed a multidisciplinary integrated literature review approach. This paper also reviewed relevant models and theories that align with the goals of this research to provide a broader view of the problems with HRD in Ghana and to help develop a framework that seeks to provide a sustainable guide for those involved in HRD activities in Ghana. Findings: A positive outcome from the synergistic alignment between modern science and indigenous ecological knowledge moderated by the principles of CHRD will result in economic growth and development. HRD's contribution to economic growth and development and its consequential benefit to the actors will depend on how best CHRD goals are accomplished. Practical implications: The mediating role of the tempered radicalism will help modify the swiftness with which education and HRD programs are executed in Ghana. Originality/value: This paper presented the tempered radicalism approach as the quintessential model for education and HRD initiatives in Ghana. The application of tempered radicalism in HRD literature is novel.

AB  - Twenty-nine rising high school 12th grade students participated in a 4-week summer program designed to increase their interest in science and technology. The program was a blend of hands-on biology, chemistry, and technology modules that addressed the global issue of obesity. Student groups developed websites to address obesity in one of five countries -- Egypt, Mexico, Puerto Rico, United States, and the United Kingdom. Three university professors, two from Computer Information Systems (CIS) and one from Biology, formed a partnership to inspire high school students to embrace technology that conveyed scientific concepts about obesity. Survey results showed an increased interest and aptitude in science and technology. After our program, 68% of the students indicated that they plan to pursue a major in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (also referred to as STEM majors). Of those students who indicated an interest in STEM disciplines, the largest numbers noted their interest in the following majors: biology, engineering, computer science, computer information systems, and chemistry. At the end of the summer, 85% of the students agreed that the summer program activities helped them to better understand how the science and technology modules from the FUTURES/T.A.G.S. summer program were connected to obesity.

AB  - This study applied a bibliometric approach to a dataset of publications on women and educational leadership to critically explore the nature of research in the field and the utility of the bibliometric method in its mapping. The analysis was conducted on bibliographic records of 823 papers on women and educational leadership published from 1975 to 2020, which had been retrieved from the Web of Science. The results are presented in the form of lists of most impactful papers; most productive research centres/organizations and countries; similar lists of contributing disciplines and publication venues; as well as maps visualizing collaborative activity. A postcolonial feminist perspective used in interpretation of the results reveals that, on the one hand, the approach makes it possible to uncover the persistent coloniality and linguistic hegemony in the field, whereas, on the other hand, bibliometric metrification may contribute to Western epistemic violence and valorisation of scholarship in masculinist terms.

AB  - Two green chemistry courses have been introduced into the liberal arts curriculum at Susquehanna University. Green chemistry was integrated into an existing course, Chemical Concepts, and offered as Green Chemical Concepts for nonscience majors. This course is designed to instill an appreciation for green chemistry in a large and diverse group of students. The course follows a separate interactive lecture and laboratory format, consists of an atom economy workshop, and ends with students' collaborative group presentations on "life cycle assessment of a greener product". A chemistry elective, Green Chemistry, was also developed and offered to science majors. It is important that students from various areas of science be exposed to green chemistry, as many innovative science discoveries are made today through interdisciplinary collaborative work. This course follows a unique workshop style, integrating lectures with laboratory activities, and ends with student proposal presentations on "designing a greener product or process". These courses will help students in all areas make intelligent decisions in the future and explore solutions based on green chemistry principles, which will eventually serve a greater community, thereby supporting the liberal arts mission.

AB  - Although research in the field of language teaching and learning has appeared to enhance classroom pedagogy, I argue here that these advances have had a relatively small impact on actual foreign language learning. Unlike in most school subjects, the recipients of language pedagogy, i.e. the students, arrive in the classroom with several predetermined advantages or impediments that have a mitigating influence on the effectiveness of teaching practices, and these are not generally considered in sufficient detail by language teaching research (LTR). Recently, however, new findings arriving from research in biological science, using equipment and techniques that penetrate the brain, are providing remarkable insights on how languages are learnt. This success from the laboratory is contrasted with the limited improvements resulting from traditional LTR based in the social sciences. Thus, I contend that research into how languages are best taught requires a more interdisciplinary approach that includes methods and instruments from the biological sciences.

AB  - With growing numbers of university graduates, the choice of academic programs has gained in importance to enter the labor market successfully. Simultaneously, the link between the field of study and actual professional career is becoming increasingly blurry. This paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of these relations and to position geography in this wide spectrum. We develop a conceptual framework to systematically categorize the relations between academic programs and their associated labor markets. We employ this framework in a most-different-case design to quantitatively analyze the influence of the field on the graduates' career prospects, using student records of several German universities linked with administrative biographical data from social security records. We find evidence that the influence of the field of study on full-time employment and wage is substantial, controlling for various factors. Geographers do face difficulties on the labor market, but the demand for their core competencies -- interdisciplinary, spatially specific and sustainability-related thinking -- is rising through current societal developments. Moreover, we find some indication that those performance gaps are not an exceptional phenomenon of geographers but also apply to graduates of different fields of study with multidimensional and indirect links to the associated labor markets.

AB  - Technology and Engineering (T&E) education has traditionally included safety as a core component of its curriculum and instruction. Recommendations for safety instruction can be found in manual arts and industrial arts documents (Christy, 1938). Safety was emphasized across all grade levels, including the elementary grades (Miller & Boyd, 1970). At the elementary level the purpose was to, "promote the use of tools and develop a desirable attitude toward safety in the school and home" (Sotzin, 1960). Safety was also emphasized in the Standards for Industrial Arts Education Programs (Dugger, Bame, Pinder, & Miller, 1981). This focus on safety provided the foundation for identifying safety as a core concept in the field. Many of the safety resources and research findings from these eras helped to inform the safety practices used today. Currently, a number of content areas have identified safety as a fundamental component, specifically technology education (Gunter, 2007; ITEA, 2003), engineering education (Huffman, Grubbs, Strimel, & Gurganus, 2018), career and technical education (CTE) (Toglia, 2009), science education (NSTA, 2016), and elementary education (ACS, 2011; Weaver, 2017). This widespread focus on safety may be the result of increased hazards resulting from interdisciplinary STEM initiatives such as makerspaces and the addition of engineering practices within "Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)."

AB  - Current initiatives to transform undergraduate STEM education in the United States advocate for the use of multidimensional learning, wherein instruction provides opportunities for students to gain competency with fundamental or cross-disciplinary concepts and practices. To achieve this goal, the discipline-based education research (DBER) community is drawing on theories and approaches from the cognitive sciences to better understand how instructional choices may influence student cognition and performance. In this study, we investigate the extent to which adding visual representation to exam questions may alter the cognitive demand placed on the learner, thereby affecting exam performance. Exam questions were crafted in pairs -- one form embedded some necessary information within a visual representation, while the other comprised only text -- and distributed on exams across an undergraduate molecular life sciences curriculum. Comparison of analogous questions indicates that visual representation does affect performance on most questions; however, the nature of that effect depends on other features (e.g., format, cognitive level) of the task. Adding a visual representation to difficult open-response questions often decreased performance further, while adding a representation to similarly difficult forced-response items was more likely to increase performance. Drawing on cognitive theories of learning, we rationalize how the presence and interactivity of these elements may affect the cognitive load of the task and working memory efficiency. The findings of this study have implications for instructors regarding the design and interpretation of student assessments and call on researchers for deeper investigation of the relationship between student cognition and multidimensional assessments.

AB  - The structure of studies of moral education is basically interdisciplinary; it includes moral philosophy, psychology, and educational research. This article systematically analyses the structure of studies of moral educational from the vantage points of philosophy of science. Among the various theoretical frameworks in the field of philosophy of science, this article mainly utilizes the perspectives of Lakatos's research program. In particular, the article considers the relations and interactions between different fields, including moral philosophy, psychology, and educational research. Finally, the potential impacts of the new trends emerging from natural sciences that seem to be challenging to existing theoretical frameworks of moral education are examined using the vantage points of philosophy of science.

AB  - Digital technologies and the instructional contexts in which they are embedded can increase students' access to meaningful learning opportunities. Although there is a tradition of designing and integrating digital tools in secondary-grades project-based science instruction to enhance learners' access to disciplinary learning, the elementary grades have received less attention. This has left classroom teachers with limited guidance for leveraging affordances of digital tools in project-based learning (PBL) with younger learners. In this article, we describe the design and integration of digital tools in Multiple Literacies in Project-based Learning, a recent elementary-grade project-based science curriculum that integrates literacy and mathematics. We use the principles of Universal Design for Learning to characterize the affordances of these digital tools, with attention to how the interplay of the tools and the PBL environment in which they were embedded enhanced access to learning opportunities for all students.

AB  - Success in science and mathematics courses, and later in careers, requires more than disciplinary knowledge and general academic competencies. Students also need proficiency in certain key dispositions and life skills. This article is a systematic review of literature that examines what teachers believe about the non-academic skills necessary for student success in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classes and future careers in STEM fields. We report our results of the literature review and discuss these in terms of STEM SMART skills -- non-academic skills and dispositions that support students' learning across science and mathematics. These life skills and dispositions are usually not studied as academic skills; nevertheless, they are essential for long-term success in STEM fields. The acronym STEM SMART is intended to serve as a mnemonic to help educators and others remember and discuss these life skills and dispositions that support STEM learning.

AB  - Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is among the most commonly diagnosed disorders of children and youth. Young people receive their ADHD diagnoses and medical treatment in primary health care settings and can experience a range of behavioral and educational disabilities treated in the clinic, at home, and at school. We propose a team-based collaborative care model (TBCCM) to foster communication and collaboration among health care and education teams, embedding implementation science methods to promote and sustain evidence-based practices for youth with ADHD. Key features of the model include (a) effective leadership and teamwork within the two universal systems of education and health care, (b) use of data from multiple informants who describe and monitor student behavior within and across contexts, and (c) adoption and adaptation of evidence-based practices. We expect that these efforts to embed implementation science methods within a collaborative team structure will improve the uptake of evidence by intervention teams in the two systems, and thus optimize outcomes for children and youth with ADHD.

AB  - Despite historical national efforts to improve elementary science education, science instruction continues to be marginalized, varying by state. This study was designed to address the ongoing challenge of educating elementary preservice teachers (PSTs) to teach science. Elementary PSTs are one of the science education community's major links to schools and science education reform. However, they often lack a strong background in science, knowledge of effective science teaching strategies, and consequently have low confidence and self-efficacy. This investigation explored the initial learning of elementary PSTs using an interdisciplinary model of a scientific classroom discourse community during a science methods course. Findings post-methods course suggested that the PSTs gained confidence in how to teach inquiry-based elementary science and recognized inquiry-based science as an effective means for engaging student learning. Additionally, PSTs embraced the interdisciplinary model as one that benefits students' learning and effectively uses limited time in a school day.

AB  - This research presents the effect of innovation in the educational methodology applied to the teaching of topics in different areas, especially in public international law, trying to demonstrate how learning can be stimulated through artistic awareness. When comparing the different generations of students, we wonder if it is possible for teachers to follow the step of digital natives. In order to fill this generation gap, Tecnológico de Monterrey proposed to support projects of experimentation in educational innovation in various topics related to improving the teaching-learning process. Based on this premise, a group of teachers generate a model of educational innovation training, to facilitate learning for students through the development of creativity in how, when and where to generate learning, integrating challenging and interactive experiences through activities within the teaching practice. The use of traditional methods has led to the overwhelm of teachers, fatigue and pressure, therefore, the contribution of this project is aimed at the teacher to internalize his innovative and creative work, and see himself as a leader transformative in its teaching practice, establishing new teaching-learning spaces. Implementing learning activities through the imagination and measuring the impact on the student of the use of creative activities allows us to improve what we currently do. For this, an interdisciplinary workshop was created (thought and word, mind and body, music, visual arts) where the teacher, through practical and experiential activities, stimulates his imagination, recognizes his talents in creative and innovative thinking and develops resources which then leads to their teaching practice, by designing challenging learning experiences that inspire the student to creatively solve tasks and projects. In order to carry out the objective, we gathered eight professors from different areas (law, international relations, political science, languages, architecture, art, cultural diffusion) convinced that creativity improves the teacher's performance who rethinks its activities to allow learn more dynamically. It was sought to improve the performance of students who appreciated the approach to the subjects through didactic methods that the teacher had modified according to the passions observed outside the classroom.

AB  - Although Error Analysis (EA) has been broadly used in Foreign Language and Mother Tongue learning contexts, it has not been applied in the field of engineering and by STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) students in a systematic way. In this interdisciplinary pilot study, we applied the EA methodology to a wide corpus of exercises and essays written by third-year students of mechanical engineering, with the main purpose of achieving a precise diagnosis of the students' strengths and weaknesses in writing skills. For the analysis to be as exhaustive as possible, the errors were typologized into three main categories (linguistic, mathematical, and rhetorical-organizational), each of which is, in turn, subdivided into 15 items. The results show that the predominant errors are rhetorical-organizational (39%) and linguistic (38%). The application of EA permits the precise identification of the areas of improvement and the subsequent implementation of an educational design that allows STEM students to improve their communicative strategies, especially those related to the writing skills and, more precisely, those having to do with the optimal use of syntax, punctuation, rhetorical structure of the text, and mathematical coherence.

AB  - Open data sharing promises to accelerate the pace of discovery in the developmental and learning sciences, but significant technical, policy, and cultural barriers have limited its adoption. As a result, most research on learning and development remains shrouded in a culture of isolation. Data sharing is the rare exception (Gilmore, 2016). Many researchers who study teaching and learning in classroom, laboratory, museum, and home contexts use video as a primary source of raw research data. Unlike other measures, video captures the complexity, richness, and diversity of behavior. Moreover, because video is self-documenting, it presents significant potential for reuse. However, the potential for reuse goes largely unrealized because videos are rarely shared. Research videos contain information about participants' identities making the materials challenging to share. The large size of video files, diversity of formats, and incompatible software tools pose technical challenges. The Databrary (databrary.org) digital library enables researchers who study learning and development to store, share, stream, and annotate videos. In this article, we describe how Databrary has overcome barriers to sharing research videos and associated data and metadata. Databrary has developed solutions for respecting participants' privacy; for storing, streaming, and sharing videos; and for managing videos and associated metadata. The Databrary experience suggests ways that videos and other identifiable data collected in the context of educational research might be shared. Open data sharing enabled by Databrary can serve as a catalyst for a truly multidisciplinary science of learning.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to acknowledge the value of joint educational entrepreneurship programs: universities impact on economic growth by building collaborative networks in order to encourage innovation through interdisciplinary training schemes. The case of the master's degree in Entrepreneurial Innovation Management, set up jointly by the University of Salerno and the Universidad Católica de Pereira, is presented. Design/methodology/approach: In order to conduct a competitive market analysis, the latest data on master's degrees in economics and information technologies management have been collected by means of a scraping procedure in order to build a data set for analysis. The authors have considered the masters' degrees offered in Bogotá, where most universities of Colombia are located. Findings: The data point out that current master's degree courses do not recognize the importance of interdisciplinary training, which is in great demand in the world of work: economics and computer science never run together and rarely do universities collaborate within a network to set up joint programs. Practical implications: The entrepreneurial culture could yield economic and social benefits by training students for a dynamic, global and increasingly digital job market. The case study represents a first step in building a network, which could be extended to other countries in the future. Originality/value: The originality of the study lies in the proposal of a joint Italy-Colombia master's degree, which is set up within a higher education network and may prove useful in creating job opportunities in both countries involved. Moreover, the learning path balances two traditionally separated disciplinary fields: economics and computer engineering.

AB  - We conducted formative research to inform the creation of innovative new tools and strategies to engage professionals in communicating with youth with intellectual disabilities about sexual health. The research was guided by a multidisciplinary network of experts and an advisory board of self-advocates with intellectual disabilities and caregivers that make up Project SHINE: the Sexual Health Innovation Network for Equitable Education. A cross-sectional mixed-methods study utilized survey data from 632 disability support professionals who provide services to youth ages 16-24 with intellectual disabilities (ID). We then conducted focus groups with 36 professionals to obtain more in-depth information related to organizational support needs and suitable contexts, methods, and tools for sexuality education. Participants included licensed/credentialed direct service professionals (social workers, nurses, teachers), non-licensed direct service providers (case managers, supportive care specialists, residential care line staff), and program administrators. Quantitative and qualitative data analyses triangulated the findings across four content areas: attitudes about providing sexual health information to youth with ID, preparedness to communicate about sexuality, current communication practices, and professional needs in the field for new teaching tools and methods. We discuss how findings can be used to guide the creation and successful implementation of innovative new sexual health learning tools for youth with intellectual disabilities.

AB  - This paper describes assignments that have been implemented in a General Chemistry I course to promote science literacy. This course was chosen in particular because it reaches a broad audience, which includes nonscience majors. The assignment series begins with several discussions and tasks to develop information literacy, in which students find and critique sources of information and evaluate a journal article. It then culminates in an assignment that asks students to critically review a variety of information on a current issue and compose a written supported argument. This set of assignments gives our course a broader, liberal arts context, and according to student feedback, it has been successful in fostering science literacy. Adaptation for use in upper-level courses is also discussed.

AB  - In this article, we show how discussions of creating high-impact learning experiences led to the Undergraduate Videogame Symposium, a public venue where students from all disciplines presented their disciplinary learning to a non-disciplinary audience. After providing an introduction to the learning principles emphasized by the Interdisciplinary Writing Program (IWP), the sponsor of the symposium, we use research studies on critical literacy, game theory, and digital media literacy, and work on self-motivation to provide the foundations for our decision to choose gaming as the topic for the symposium. We then provide primary research data collected through interviews and participant observations to show that an undergraduate video game symposium draws on student personal and academic interests, and allows students to research a wide range of topics connected to such fields as education, anthropology, gender studies, rhetoric, psychology, science, art, music, engineering, political science, writing, business, and health sciences. Finally, we discuss our conclusions from hosting the interdisciplinary videogame symposium, and how events addressing interdisciplinary topics can be used as the stepping-stone for increasing interdisciplinary writing, research, design, and presentation spaces.

AB  - This study explores science teachers' views regarding Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) pedagogy and its interdisciplinary nature. It also seeks to identify teachers' views on the contextual factors that facilitate and hinder such pedagogy in their schools. Qualitative methodologies were used through focus group discussions and an interview protocol. From the specific contextual issues that were highlighted in the findings, was teacher self-efficacy, pedagogical-knowledge, issues related to establishing a collaborative school culture and familiarity to STEM education among school administrators, students and parents. Findings expressed teachers' concerns of their under-preparedness to enact STEM practices and illustrated that engineering is the least mentioned discipline to be integrated with science. The study ends with recommendations that could lead to develop a professional development model to enact STEM education in schools based on valuing partnership with universities and industries as a necessary step for enacting a STEM integrated model.

AB  - Biological systems exhibit strong dynamic variations; for example, a system may have a tendency towards either a steady state, periodic behaviour or chaotic oscillations. These findings, explained by dynamic systems theory, have allowed researchers to formally relate a wide variety of systems, such as the theory of rumour propagation, glucose metabolism or the activity of a neuronal circuit. Interestingly, among all of the dynamic characteristics mentioned, qualitative aspects frequently observed in highly complex systems can be obtained through the recursive application of a very simple parabolic function known as the logistic equation. Currently, the importance of these dynamic phenomena for biomedicine is recognized, but simple models such as the logistic equation have not been sufficiently exploited in the training of biologists and health professionals. We briefly review some properties of the dynamics governed by the logistic equation, with a direct application to the theory of cancer based on the dynamics of aneuploidy. We believe that this already known mathematical application is an opportunity for integrated teaching of mathematics and biology. For this purpose we finally provide an appendix with some activities, all of them related to this article, which can be practiced in a simple spreadsheet that we have shared.

AB  - Conventional teaching about obesity, especially within a physiology-based course, tends to focus on the biological aspects. Unfortunately, framing obesity from a solely biological perspective ignores many factors that contribute to the condition, leaving students with an overly simplistic idea. We developed an introductory exercise physiology course that was cotaught with a physiologist and a sociologist to provide health science majors with a more holistic view of complex socioscientific issues including obesity. From our course, students self-reported changes in their views about obesity and exercise to include more empathy as well as nuance regarding exercise and body size as physiological and biological processes that are experienced and take place socioculturally. We found value in this cross-disciplinary approach and recommend it as a frame for other exercise physiology courses; we recognize this is not always possible, so we also provide resources for faculty who do not have a sociologist to coteach with.

AB  - Recently, social scientists have begun to study the implications of increasing pressures in the early academic career. Studies focusing mostly on the life sciences have shown junior scholars making research decisions based on a productivity logic to increase their chances of career success. In this paper, we extend this literature to the very different context of economics, characterized by a dominant mainstream, a clear hierarchy, and an independent/small-team approach to scholarship. Adopting a culture-in-action framework, we analyze how cultural repertoires help early career economists deal with the sometimes competing career pressures associated with working in high-status departments. Drawing from in-depth interviews with tenure-track economists in three Scandinavian countries, we find that skillful use of "discovery-talk" and "delivery-talk" helps respondents respond to the challenges they face as junior academics. Implications for research include the avoidance of, e.g., interdisciplinary work and questions of only regional importance. Furthermore, the data indicate that discovery and delivery notions partly overlap and so contribute to preserving economics as a relatively coherent and homogenous field.

AB  - Over the past decade there has been a growing interest in sustainability education in colleges and universities across the United States, with a marked increase in the number of undergraduate and graduate degree programs, research institutes, and centers focused on sustainability. Evidence-based core competencies for interdisciplinary sustainability programs can provide suitable guidance for curricular and program development, research, policy, communication, and pedagogical approaches at academic institutions. They can also serve as a guide for students to select academic programs and potential career options, a reference for employers to understand qualifications of graduates, and the foundation for a potential specialized accreditation for interdisciplinary sustainability programs. The growing demand for well-qualified sustainability professionals within the public, private, and nonprofit sectors also points to the value of developing core competencies. "Strengthening Sustainability Programs and Curricula at the Undergraduate and Graduate Levels" provides expert insights for strengthening the emerging discipline of sustainability in higher education in the United States. This report describes the local, national, and global landscape related to sustainability education; examines the history and current status of sustainability education programs in the United States and globally; discusses employment prospects for sustainability graduates in terms of the opportunities and the skills that employers seek; and addresses diversity, equity, and inclusion in sustainability-related education and employment.

AB  - Computational thinking can provide a basis for problem solving, for making evidence-based decisions, and for learning to code or create programs. Therefore, it is critical that all students across the K-12 continuum--including students in the early grades--have opportunities to begin developing problem solving and computational thinking skills. Although computational thinking is central to computer science, CT skills, such as "abstraction", "problem decomposition", "algorithmic thinking", "pattern recognition", and "debugging" cut across multiple disciplines, promoting seamless integration in science and engineering (Wing 2016). Engineering design can be a context and approach for fostering computational thinking in formal and informal settings for elementary-age children. Through such learning experiences children can develop 21st-century skills vital for success in STEM+CT (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, computer science) careers. In this article, the authors share an engineering design activity that we employed to engage kindergarten to second-grade students in STEM+CT.

AB  - The development of problem solving skills is a shared goal in science, engineering, mathematics and technology education. In the applied sciences, problems are often open-ended and complex, requiring a multidisciplinary approach as well as new designs. In such cases, problem solving requires not only analytical capabilities, but also creativity and the ability to innovate. The development of an information system entails problem solving by means of design, hence creativity is integral to the task of an information systems (IS) professional. However, it appears that the teaching of creativity in IS programmes is under-researched and possibly neglected. This study investigates what is being done to foster creative ability of South African undergraduate IS students. At the same time, a theoretical framework for creativity teaching is developed. We find that the fostering of creative ability involves more than just the teaching of creativity techniques, and that creativity can be indirectly nurtured in multiple ways.

AB  - Despite calls for more attention to the preparation of those who prepare teachers, there have been few examples of institutionally sanctioned and structured learning opportunities created to equip faculty with the knowledge and skills necessary to become effective teacher educators. In this paper, we describe a cross-disciplinary and collaborative initiative that involves shadowing of colleagues as a means of supporting the professional learning of science teacher educators. We illustrate the unique affordance of this model and highlight our professional learning across multiple dimensions: cognitive, practical, relational, and emotional. We illustrate how shadowing can support the learning of faculty at different career stages and from different disciplinary backgrounds and entry points to teacher education through a series of vignettes of shadowing in a variety of course contexts. Finally, we offer considerations for the transferability of our model to other institutions and contexts, and how further research conducted in the context of shadowing could help deepen our understanding of the knowledge base of science teacher educators and how this knowledge is developed.

AB  - Since society and science need interdisciplinary works, the interesting topic of chaos is chosen for interdisciplinary education in physics. The educational programme contains various university-level activities such as computer simulations, chaos experiment and team projects besides ordinary teaching. According to the participants, the programme seems useful and good. In addition, we discuss some issues which can be important to interdisciplinary education in physics: for example the possible difficulties in programme design, the expertise barriers of non-major fields, the role of non-theoretical education in understanding and the project-type team activities.

AB  - This study investigated the interaction of disciplinary and interdisciplinary learning in a team-taught, first-year, interdisciplinary sustainability course. We surveyed (pre/post) both STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and non-STEM majors (N = 241), assessing attitudes and content knowledge. Responses were analyzed using factor analysis, classical test theory, and Rasch analysis. Multivariate analyses of variance were performed to look for pre/post differences and differences between groups. Confirmatory factor analysis verified that the content knowledge items adequately assessed disciplinary and interdisciplinary understanding separately. Tests indicated an adequate item difficulty range, but also a need for more items at the higher end. All groups improved significantly over the semester. Slightly higher gains for STEM students and a correlation between disciplinary, and interdisciplinary learning might indicate a possible benefit of "disciplinary grounding." The instrument vetted through this study expands the number of validated sustainability content knowledge items. Further, it allows users to probe content knowledge along both interdisciplinary and disciplinary dimensions.

AB  - Purpose: This conceptual paper explores the relationship between school structure, organisation, and home-school collaboration. It argues that the traditional and dominant secondary school model based on same-age organisation acts in ways that constrain home-school collaboration while claiming to value it. The paper proposes an alternative model (vertical tutoring), one that relies on home-school collaboration and developing the capacity to absorb the complexity that collaboration creates. Design/methodology/approach: Models of home-school collaboration abstracted from the research literature are set within a framework of organisational studies, complexity science, and systemic thinking, revealing incongruities between claimed values and operational practices. The paper contrasts the frailties endemic to same-age organisation with the advantages claimed by schools that have adopted a vertical tutoring (VT) system. Findings: The choice of organisational structure is a major influence on a school's capacity to develop the home-school collaboration needed to liberate individual and organisational learning. Same-age organisational structure has a reduced capacity for building the collaborative partnerships needed to engage parents in their child's learning process. Multi-age organisation matches capacity with learning demand, enabling agency and liberating management. Research limitations/implications: Current approaches to modelling rarely consider same-age operative structure and so are destined to restrict rather than enable home-school collaboration. The adoption of VT by schools broadens the scope of organisational analysis, positing a need for multi-disciplinary research able to link the form of school organisation to individual and organisational learning. Originality/value: VT is rarely mentioned in the research literature as an alternative to same-age structuration. This paper addresses this issue and draws upon complexity science, autopoietic theory, and systemic thinking to explain why current models of home-school collaboration are insufficiently situated in organisational practice.

AB  - Instructional scaffolds may promote science learning, particularly for topics that are controversial. Scaffolding may also need to be autonomy supportive, particularly for adolescents, and designed to facilitate scientific discourse and agency. The purpose of the present study was to investigate differences in middle school students' discourse and agency across two scaffold forms: one more autonomy-supportive and one less autonomy-supportive. We designed both to facilitate scientific evaluations about the connections between lines of evidence and alternative explanations about two geological phenomena: relations between hydraulic fracturing and earthquakes (less autonomy-supportive) and reliability of fossil evidence for inferring past surface changes (more autonomy-supportive). Integration of qualitative and quantitative findings revealed meaningful differences, with greater collective disciplinary agency expressed during the more autonomy-supportive form. Results support a burgeoning area of research suggesting that productive discourse and agency are necessary to prepare students to participate in a civically minded and inclusive society.

AB  - Agricultural researchers and science librarians must understand which research literature databases provide the most comprehensive coverage of agricultural subjects to support their inquiries. Once the domain of a few specialized databases, agricultural research literature is now covered by broad, multidisciplinary databases. The purpose of this study is to determine the most comprehensive database(s) for agricultural literature searching. We compared the coverage of eight bibliographic databases for a range of agricultural sub-topics to determine how much overlap exists and which database(s) best support discovery of agricultural research literature. We found that the multidisciplinary databases provided the most comprehensive coverage, along with one of the agriculture-specific databases. This study will help researchers and librarians determine where to invest their effort and resources when looking to find agricultural research content.

AB  - To promote undergraduate education reform, teaching professional development (TPD) efforts aim to encourage instructors to adopt evidence-based practices. However, many instructors do not attend TPD. There may be many reasons for this, including low intrinsic motivation to participate in TPD. Psychologists have dealt with motivational barriers in educational contexts using psychosocial interventions, brief activities that draw on a rich history of psychological research to subtly alter key, self-reinforcing psychological processes to yield long-term intrinsic motivation and behavioral changes. Psychosocial interventions, for example, have been used to alter students' noncognitive attitudes and beliefs, such as attributions and mindset, which positively influence students' motivation and academic performance. Here, we propose that insights from research on psychosocial interventions may be leveraged to design interventions that will increase instructors' motivation to participate in TPD, thus enhancing existing pedagogical reform efforts. We discuss psychological principles and "best practices" underlying effective psychosocial interventions that could guide the development of interventions to increase instructors' motivation to attend TPD. We encourage new interdisciplinary research collaborations to explore the potential of these interventions, which could be a new approach to mitigating at least one barrier to undergraduate education reform.

AB  - Understanding the relation between federal investment and research has implications for promoting science production in early childhood, a rapidly expanding area in education research and policy. Federally funded research has shaped fundamental issues in early childhood, yet few studies have systematically examined the relation between federal investment and publication output. Our study applies topic modeling and regression analyses on a text corpus of 15,608 publication and grant abstracts in early childhood education to distill the most prominent topics, and the relationship between grant funding and later publications within these topics. We find that grants topics focused on health and early intervention, while publications covered a wider interdisciplinary range. A topic's prevalence in grants, as a proxy of federal investment, was positively associated with its prevalence in publications in the following year. The study illustrates the affordances of textual analyses and contributes insights about how federal investment motivates scholarly production.

AB  - This paper reports the results of a review of 33 journal articles chosen from 87 empirical studies on learner identity in Chinese as a foreign/second language (CFL/CSL) education, published during the years 2005-2019. By analyzing the co-occurrence of keywords in these Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) journal articles, this review identifies the theoretical perspectives and topical trends of CFL/CSL education research on learner identity. The review shows that while such post-structuralist theories and notions as capital, identity and investment model have continued to play a predominant role in CFL/CSL identity research, interdisciplinary perspectives seem to also demonstrate their theoretical value and interpretive power. Furthermore, the review found that researchers explored a wide array of topical issues in relation to learner identity involved in the complex linguistic and social ecology of Chinese language learning. The review concludes with suggestions for future projects to consider that expand the thematic and theoretical scope by exploring intersections between different social categories and learner identities in societal contexts.

AB  - In this study, two multidisciplinary Social Sciences and Humanities research schools in Sweden have been investigated regarding disciplinary identity-making. This study investigates the meetings between different disciplines around a common thematic area of study for Ph.D. students. The Ph.D. students navigate through a complex social and organisational landscape with obligations and loyalties towards the discipline and the research school, which may be in conflict with each other. The main finding is that a multidisciplinary environment in fact creates strong disciplinary identities, partly in contrast to the purpose with the multidisciplinary research school. Encounters with Ph.D. students from other disciplines give the Ph.D. student something to relate to and to discuss e.g. with the supervisor. Another finding is that multidisciplinary research schools extend the perspectives of students. For some, new methods and theories from neighbouring disciplines were integrated and used, while for others the empirical scope of research was affected.

AB  - In light of the challenges facing science educators and special education teachers in Singapore, this study entails design-based research to develop participatory learning environments. Drawing upon Vygotskian perspectives, this case study was situated in an informal workshop around the theme of "day and night" working for Special Needs Students in Singapore. Moving away from traditional astronomy teaching, we aim to explore interdisciplinary multimodal modeling activities towards developing a participatory learning environment. As the main finings of this case study, the central benefits of interdisciplinary multimodal modeling activities are twofold: (1) promoting multiliteracies development using digital and multimodal resources for supporting the emotional and social experiences in developing learners' astronomical understanding; and (2) integrating learners' everyday experiences with scientific astronomical understanding for the development of higher cognitive functions. These findings emphasize the need for the cultural development of Special Needs Students.

AB  - The emphasis for STEM integration in school-based agricultural education (SBAE) classrooms is imperative, resulting in a need for teacher educators to generate a positive view on the integration. Specifically, SBAE teacher aspirants need to be prepared to deliver relevant agricultural curriculum grounded in STEM. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the content knowledge and interest in STEM-related careers for secondary students enrolled in SBAE programs in [State]. Pre-service SBAE teachers from [University] were charged with delivering a sustainable bioenergy unit of instruction to their students. This study resulted in a statistically significant improvement in students' STEM knowledge as a result of teaching the content and laboratory experiences (p < 0.01). Mean scores increased three letter grades and almost 30 percentage points. Unfortunately, minimal differences existed in student interest in STEM as a result of the experience. Future research needs to explore the preparedness of SBAE teachers to develop, teach, and evaluate the impact in all four content areas (i.e., science, technology, engineering, and math). In addition, the results of this study should be used to guide in the evaluation of state standards compared to national SBAE standards.

AB  - Increasingly, international competence is considered an important skill to be acquired from an undergraduate education. Because international exchange presents a challenge to many students, there is a need to develop and implement alternative means for incorporating international and cross-cultural experiences into the undergraduate classroom. We report on the implementation of a semester-long, virtually shared course offering between a U.S. and a Bolivian university. As STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) majors tend to be under-represented in study-abroad programs, this class sought to provide a multidisciplinary experience that could be relevant to both hard and social science majors. Furthermore, the relevance and learning impact of this class was enhanced through the incorporation of a service-learning component in conjunction with a rural Bolivian partner organization. The results of this experience show that virtually shared classroom experiences can successfully facilitate international experiences for undergraduate students.

AB  - This paper introduces the concept of digital structural violence and examines the negative role it could have in future learning systems. To address it, we propose a new interdisciplinary research agenda at the intersection of three current but disparate lines of work that: (1) Use the concept of epistemic privilege to theorise the inclusion of marginalised learners in the design of learning systems, and utilise participatory action research and emancipatory methodologies to pragmatically ensure this happens; (2) Support young learners and teachers to understand and build their own artificial intelligence algorithms; and (3) Develop sustainable interdisciplinary links with computer science to address digital structural violence at the algorithmic level and to make its societal implications and underlying processes more widely understood, especially by teachers. Taken together, these provide for a material form of resistance to digital structural violence and a theoretically and methodologically coherent future research agenda for building just learning systems.

AB  - Introducing students to a multidisciplinary research laboratory presents challenges in terms of learning specific technical skills and concepts but also with respect to integrating different technical elements to form a coherent picture of the research. Here we present a multidisciplinary series of experiments we have developed in the Electronic, Optical, and Nano Materials group at Sandia National Laboratories to introduce students to essential experimental methods and concepts spanning thin film synthesis, crystallography, electrochemistry, and optical spectroscopy. With minimal assistance from a qualified instructor, students apply a sol-gel method to synthesize electrochromic tungsten oxide (WO[subscript3]) thin films and evaluate their performance with electrochemistry, UV-vis spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. We find that the color changing WO[subscript3] films capture the students' attention, are technologically relevant, and make excellent materials platforms for multidisciplinary research as they invite investigation with a range of laboratory techniques. The variety of experimental methods combined here challenges the students to correlate the interplay between structure, processing, and properties central to materials science. The modular nature of this experiment set permits it to be tailored to the time constraints of individual students and also allows it to be applied to upper-level materials science or chemistry laboratories.

AB  - At a German university of technology, a large-scale project was funded as a part of the "Quality Pact for Teaching", a programme launched by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research to improve the quality of university teaching and study conditions. The project aims at intensifying interdisciplinary networking in teaching, promoting student engagement and motivating students to take a degree in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. We describe the new teaching projects psychology students were admitted to and how many psychology students were reached. We discuss the results and outline limitations concerning evaluation in a practical setting.

AB  - Recently there have been calls to expandSTEM education to include the arts and design, transforming STEM into STEAM in the K-20 classroom (Maeda, 2013). Like STEM, STEAM education stresses making connections between disciplines that were previously perceived as disparate. This has been conceptualized in different ways, such as: focusing on the creative design process that is fundamental to engineering and art (Bequette & Bequette, 2012); emphasizing the role of creative and synthetic thinking to enhance student interest and learning in science and mathematics; and showing the value in exploring the science and mathematics that underpin different artistic techniques (Wynn & Harris, 2012). In this article, the authors describe how a collaboration between art education, engineering, and landscape architecture led them to conceptualize STEAM as a social practice that reflects concerns for community engagement and ecological sustainability.

AB  - Novel assessment tools are more often used in class especially after the Bologna Process (Pereira, D.; Flores, M. A.; Niklasson, I. Assess. "Eval. Higher Educ." 2016, 41, (7), 1008-1032, DOI: 10.1080/02602938.2015.1055233) in Europe. "Kahoot" has emerged as an attractive and interactive gaming platform, and considerable education-research efforts in different kinds of subjects have been recently invested to evaluate "Kahoot" suitability for learning. One of the main ways of utilizing "Kahoot" is as an assessment tool, which has been shown to be effective in various education fields, but not yet in chemistry. Herein "Kahoot" was used for assessment in a whole-year chemistry class together with other more traditional means, such as solving problem sets or difficult questions. Surprisingly, students' esteem for "Kahoot" was the same or even less than for other means of assessment. Instead, problem solving was considered the most valuable task for the class. These results might be due to the nature of chemistry learning; although memorization is required, chemistry education places a higher weight on reasoning skills, which may cause the students to prefer training methods other than "Kahoot." According to these results, the competitive incentive and playfulness of a game is less preferred than the intrinsic challenge of solving a difficult question or problem.

AB  - Learning goal (LG) identification can greatly inform curriculum, teaching, and evaluation practices. The complex laboratory course setting, however, presents unique obstacles in developing appropriate LGs. For example, in addition to the large quantity and variety of content supported in the general chemistry laboratory program, the interests of faculty members from various chemistry subdisciplines and the service goals of such a course should be addressed. To optimize the instructional impact of limited laboratory contact time, achieve learning gains in basic and transferable (i.e., valuable in other sciences) laboratory learning content, and establish departmental consensus, a model was created for LG and assessment development that was inspired by interdisciplinary science laboratory LGs implemented at Rice University. These newly developed processes and materials were used to enhance the introductory chemistry laboratory curriculum at the University of British Columbia, involving a large (>1700 student) laboratory program. This model has potential to guide alignment and build consensus within, and possibly across, science laboratory instructional programs.

AB  - Nowadays, children and teenagers use technology products in an increasingly passive way. As simple consumers they cannot benefit from the opportunities of designing technology, which has a learning value. Educational Robotics (ER) programs are particularly effective in delivering contents of difficult disciplines: they can re-establish a balance between the learners and the technological devices, because the learners act as programmers and can develop their computational thinking. Therefore, we believe the school should upgrade its teaching methods, through the implementation of ER programs. This could be done without introducing a new subject, since technology could be considered like an interdisciplinary application module within pre-existing subjects. In this paper, we provide an overview of ER programs to share a practical guidance with those who want to plan educational workshops in their institutes. First, we analyze ER theoretical and epistemological fundamentals: ER has roots in recent and classic disciplines (psychology, cybernetics, robotics, cognitive science…), but it is also consistent with the principles of widely recognized pedagogies. Then, we describe successful Italian projects with a focus on regulations concerning ER programs. As a result of this analysis, we propose a brief guideline on the following topics: (a) needs analysis, (b) target segmentation, (c) objectives, (d) laboratory setting, (e) contents definition, (f) activities, (g) evaluation tools. Finally, we show that designing learning paths according to this method could also promote a more rigorous (and not only qualitative) evaluation, and then enhance both research and practice in this field.

AB  - This article reviews the literature on challenges faced by engineering faculty in educating their students on community-engaged, sustainable technical solutions in developing countries. We review a number of approaches to increasing teaching modules on social and community components of international development education, from adding capstone courses and educational track seminars to integrating content from other disciplines, particularly the social sciences. After summarising recent pedagogical strategies to increase content on community-focused development, we present a case study of how one engineering programme incorporates social work students and faculty to infuse strategies for community engagement in designing and implementing student-led global engineering development projects. We outline how this interdisciplinary pedagogical approach teaches students from the two disciplines to work together in addressing power balances, economic and social issues and overall sustainability of international development projects.

AB  - STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education in the United States faces a host of problems including low recruitment and retention in STEM disciplines, under-representation of multiple segments of the US population, and a host of other issues. These problems are well recognized and a variety of solutions are being implemented by interested parties at multiple points along the STEM education pipeline. Incorporating research into STEM classes is an effective way of enhancing student success in STEM education at the undergraduate level. This paper describes the development and implementation of a research-based laboratory module for community college General Biology I lab students that addresses potential relationships between water pollution and cancer while simultaneously implementing established High Impact Practices. This work is part of a larger effort to recruit and retain the next generation of Earth and Environmental Systems engineering students at the undergraduate level. Our inherently interdisciplinary model, which integrates multiple pedagogical elements, can be adapted for implementation in a wide variety of undergraduate STEM courses. This laboratory module allows students to benefit from authentic research, while gaining skills in gathering scientific data, making connections with global and personal issues, and illustrating relevant discipline concepts.

AB  - According to the World Economic Forum (2016), "more than one third (36%) of all jobs across all industries" (p.21) need problem-solving as a key skill. Trilling and Fadel (2009) noted the shift from industrial to knowledge-based economies, requiring students not only to possess content knowledge but also have skills that enable them to make sense of information and synthesise useful products. Students in this century would certainly be facing more complex and multifaceted problems as well. 21st century problems can include those of a biological nature, such as persistent and complex health disorders such as diabetes mellitus. Combating diabetes requires an understanding of biology (particularly homeostasis and hormones), a knowledge of biotechnology tools that can measure blood glucose concentration, engineering potential solutions that address or alleviate the problems associated with diabetes and using mathematics to compute personalised dosages of the patient's medication. As such, students need to be able to integrate knowledge from different disciplines to synthesise solutions to these complex, novel, and often persistent problems. Yet there have been few STEM activities focusing on problems of a biological nature. In light of this the authors designed a STEM task that is centred on a problem related to biology and hence requires the application of biological referent-centred knowledge to devise a solution to a complex problem related to pill coating. The integrated STEM biological problem was aimed to (1) expose students to inter-disciplinary problem-solving; and (2) shift the learning of biological content towards solving problems rather than in neat categories or topics as one would find in a textbook.

AB  - Interprofessional training is not uncommon in interpreting programmes but seems to be mainly practised in dialogue interpreting. This study reports on an interprofessional training session for conference interpreters and students of political science. A six-hour joint mock conference is annually organised at Ghent University by international students of political science andinterpreted by students of conference interpreting. After one such conference, questionnaires were administered to both groups to gauge experiences, quality perception and learning outcomes for conference interpreters. Findings revealed that students of conference interpreting appreciated the moderately student-centred approach and assessed the learning outcomes very positively, especially because the students of political science challenged their skills. Students of political science assessed the quality of interpretation positively. Relay and retour interpreting seem to cause some disruption. Regarding the three goals of interprofessional training -- to give professional groups an opportunity to learn about, with and from each other -- students of conference interpreting took the opportunity to learn with the political science group during the meeting, but appeared more reluctant to engage with them and learn from them during periods created for exchanges. In the concluding section, we suggest some remedies on how this learning could be maximised in future exercises.

AB  - The primary purpose is the implementation of the interdisciplinary approach to understanding and the construction of integrative models of understanding literary texts. The interdisciplinary methodological paradigm of studying text understanding, based on the principles of various sciences facilitating the identification of the text understanding essence (cognitive, anthropocentric, dialogue, interdisciplinary principles) is rationalized and described. Methods of various sciences are used in complex: the hermeneutic method (hermeneutic philosophy, hermeneutic psychology), the pragmatic understanding method (pragmatics), the cognitive analysis, the inference method (cognitive linguistics), the discourse analysis method (discourse linguistics) and the modelling method. A literary text understanding integrative model is offered which can be applied during the analysis of various types of texts and their interpretation. The research proves that the interdisciplinary approach facilitates the development of an integrative multilevel model of text understanding, on each level of which, knowledge required to ensure understanding is characterized and disciplines are indicated.

AB  - In this article, we present details of a new Academic Boredom Survey Instrument (ABSI) incorporating different measures of academic boredom's trait, state and other characteristic attributes for the exploratory study of student engagement in Higher Education (HE). Developed from a review of international research literature and our own empirical work in the field, validation of the ABSI proceeded in detail from a sample of 408 undergraduates enrolled on 16 arts, humanities and science degree programmes at two universities and two further education colleges in the UK. In terms of the ABSI's embedded trait and state questionnaires alone, Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis resulted in the establishment of three scales, with associated subscales, for general use (boredom proneness and class- and study-related boredom). Together with other characteristic attributes (e.g. sites and triggers, boredom frequency, feelings, coping strategies and revision and assignment boredom), additional data obtained from a modified version of the Shortened Experiences of Teaching and Learning Questionnaire (SETLQ) and course grades from student records, correlation and cluster analysis contributed further in terms of determining the robustness and value of the ABSI as an exploratory tool, as well as highlighting the predictive and diagnostic potential afforded when using complementary research instruments in combination. Offering availability for interdisciplinary use and critical comment across the UK HE sector as a whole, the ABSI has particular relevance in terms of designing and delivering courses, the professional development of staff, student profiling and the provision of student support.

AB  - Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) entered the general lexicon in the United States within the last ten years. Both Presidents Obama and Trump emphasized STEM education as a priority for the United States because the number of college graduates with STEM degrees is perceived as an important factor contributing to the global competitiveness of the United States. STEM refers to four disciplines but the acronym is generally interpreted to mean science or math rather than technology or engineering because only science and mathematics are included oftentimes in the school curriculum. In this paper, we describe our attempts to teach integrated STEM units to grades 3-8 students based on five different articles. The first two articles describe how we engaged grades 3-5 elementary students, in two different engineering design challenges (soda can crusher design and trash grabber design) by using our engineering design model. The third article summarizes how we taught epistemological aspects of engineering using picture books within an engineering design challenge. The fourth article illustrates how students in groups of two or three created biomimetic robots with coding. The fifth article details how students built an animatronic zoo showcasing a particular biome and animals living in it by using computational thinking.

AB  - Molecular life science is one of the fastest-growing fields of scientific and technical innovation, and biotechnology has profound effects on many aspects of daily life--often with deep, ethical dimensions. At the same time, the content is inherently complex, highly abstract, and deeply rooted in diverse disciplines ranging from "pure sciences," such as math, chemistry, and physics, through "applied sciences," such as medicine and agriculture, to subjects that are traditionally within the remit of humanities, notably philosophy and ethics. Together, these features pose diverse, important, and exciting challenges for tomorrow's teachers and educational establishments. With backgrounds in molecular life science research and secondary life science teaching, we (Tibell and Rundgren, respectively) bring different experiences, perspectives, concerns, and awareness of these issues. Taking the nature of the discipline as a starting point, we highlight important facets of molecular life science that are both characteristic of the domain and challenging for learning and education. Of these challenges, we focus most detail on content, reasoning difficulties, and communication issues. We also discuss implications for education research and teaching in the molecular life sciences.

AB  - Part One of this article ("Technology and Engineering Teacher," 75(4), December/January, 2016) presented a process that science, math, engineering, and technology teachers could use to collaborate and design integrated STEM courses. A conceptual framework was discussed that could provide a premise that educators interested in delivery of STEM content could reflect upon to integrate STEM disciplines in the classroom. The authors argued that this framework offered teachers a common philosophical understanding of how to integrate science and mathematical practices into an engineering/technology education course project. For the purposes of that paper, the designing of a safe swing set was utilized to illustrate how science, math, engineering, and technology teachers may forge a collaborative teaching effort to integrate STEM concepts into teaching practices. This paper examines what materials may withstand such forces safely in order to design a safe swing set. First, by referring to the Asunda and Mativo article, one notices there is a child who is 45 kg sitting on a swing that is 2 meters in length. Since lessons are learned using both metric units and United States Customary Units (USCU), and metric units were used in the past article, this article uses the Imperial system of measurement. The child weight in the Imperial system of measurement will be considered as 99 lbs., while the swing length will be 6.6 ft. The article next describes the lesson objectives, equipment/materials list, and the activity where students will construct a prototype swing set using the materials provided. Students will relate science and math concept(s) to engineering/technology education as discussed by the science, math, engineering, and technology teacher. A documented evaluation process can be designed based upon the identified learning objectives examined in students' artifacts, (i.e., in sketch designs, notebook) with science/math/engineering/technology education concepts and how these inform the construction of a chosen swing set design, the prototype, and any testing strategies the students may have documented. This approach may develop students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills through which they can transfer STEM-related skills and concepts to the 21st century STEM workplace.

AB  - Common core standards, interdisciplinary education, and discipline-specific literacy are common international education reforms. The constructive-interpretative language arts pairs (speaking-listening, writing-reading, representing-viewing) and the communication, construction, and persuasion functions of language are central in these movements. This research developed and validated a communication progression in science education for elementary-secondary schooling in Taiwan. The framework for the communication progression was based on relevant literature, international curricula, and focus-group deliberations; it consisted of three dimensions: presentation, reaction, and negotiation. Delphi deliberations with questionnaires were applied to experts to evaluate the theoretical considerations and to experienced science teachers to evaluate the practical considerations. Results confirmed the importance of communications in science learning and the developmental nature of communications across elementary, middle, and secondary schools and validated the proposed framework and progression. The communication progression has application to other international education systems as they address common core standards and curricula in language and science.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to understand the development track of skills mismatch research and discover the hidden internal connections between literature. Design/methodology/approach: The authors gathered data through scientometric quantitative analysis using CiteSpace. Specifically, this article applied basic analysis, journal cocitation analysis (JCA), author cocitation analysis (ACA) and document cocitation analysis (DCA), cluster analysis, citation burstness detection, scientific research cooperation analysis and coconcurrence analysis of keywords of 3,125 documents from Web of Science core collections for the period 2000-2020. Findings: Through the document cocitation analysis and the keywords' co-occurrence, this article identifies influential scholars, documents, research institutions, journals and research hotspots in research on the skills mismatch phenomenon. The results showed that the publications had ballooned, and the phenomenon has become an interdisciplinary research subject. The USA and Finland remain the main contributors, which is attributed to their high-yield institutions such as the University of Helsinki, the University of Witwatersrand, the University of Washington and so on. While the African continent lacks research on skills mismatch even with the continent's effort to overcome such a crucial issue. The paper presents an in-depth analysis of skills and educational mismatch issues to better understand the evolutionary trajectory of the collective knowledge over the past 20 years and highlight the areas of active pursuit. Research limitations/implications: The authors only used Web of Science core collection to collect data; however, they can added Scopus indexed database as well to extend the research trends and explore more new research hot topics to solve the skills mismatch phenomenon. Originality/value: The scientometric analysis is of great significance for identifying the potential relationship between the literature and investigating the knowledge evolution of skills mismatch research. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Labor Organization and the World Health Organization are the giants who are mostly concerned of the mismatch skills phenomenon. Researchers can refer to this study to understand the status quo, gaps and research trends to deal with the skills mismatch issue.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the views of pre-service science teachers about STEM education. A two-hour Arduino based STEM learning activity was conducted for fifteen pre-service science teachers. Afterwards, the views of the participants were investigated by conducting an online survey consisting of open-ended questions. Finally, the obtained data were analysed with the content analysis technique using NVivo 12. As a result of the analysis, it was concluded that pre-service teachers do not know the content of the STEM approach but at the same time, they think that STEM education should be applied in schools, and they want to learn how STEM can be used in classes. Based on the results, it is suggested that it should be beneficial to provide professional development to pre-service teachers regarding the content of the STEM approach.

AB  - With student-centered, hands-on approaches to real-world problems, integrated STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) curricula have the potential to engage students more authentically in multi-disciplinary learning and to learn mathematics more deeply. However, researchers have shown concern that the "M" is often a silent partner and have called for increasing mathematics' visibility in STEM curricula. Taking into account this background, this paper investigated how teachers' and students' engagement with mathematics within a specific lesson in an integrated STEM unit evolved over four years in two elementary teachers' classrooms and the factors the teachers pointed to that may explain their adaptations. Using classroom observations and teacher interviews, the results showed that the time engaged with the mathematics and the depth of engagement with the mathematics decreased over the four years. Five themes emerged that may explain their adaptations: 1) limited time, 2) the need to address required school academic standards in limited time, 3) materials and preparation, 4) the teachers' comfort with the curriculum and, to a lesser extent, 5) their perceptions of their students' abilities. These findings have implications for those that are writing, studying, or potentially using integrated STEM curricula in elementary schools.

AB  - This qualitative study, based on data from an ongoing after-school literacy and songwriting initiative, examines the multiliteracy practices of Noriah Rose and Koral, Black adolescent girls, and their socially situated meaning-making and sharing about loss. Specifically, we asked, "In what ways do youth grapple with complicated meanings of loss as they share creative and artistic songwriting practices?" We build upon interdisciplinary framings in literacy and social science research to advance new theoretical understandings of "literary practices of remembrance," highlighting the public sharing of independently authored digital compositions across various audiences through song. We conceptualize youths, enacting literacy practices of remembrance, as demonstrating three socially situated stances of sharing: evoking a passed-on narrative complicating temporality and permanence, historicizing artistic cultural expression, and demonstrating mutual sharing and stewardship of loss. We argue that various communities supported youths' meaning-making about loss, and we offer implications for teaching, research, and practice.

AB  - Educators globally are continually encouraged to use data to inform instructional improvement in schools, yet while there have been many recent innovations in data visualization and data science, educators are rarely included in dashboard co-design. On December 5 and 6, 2019, the Education Data Analytics Collaborative Workshop was held at Teachers College, Columbia University in New York City with approximately 80 participants. This workshop was part of the final phase of the collaborative National Science Foundation funded research project (#1560720) "Building Community and Capacity for Data-Intensive Evidence-Based Decision Making in Schools and Districts", a research practice partnership (RPP) on data use and evidence-based improvement cycles in collaboration with Nassau County Long Island BOCES (Board of Cooperative Education Services) and their 56 school districts in Nassau County Long Island, New York, USA. This edited book details the results from the workshop through 28 chapters from authors who were attendees, including educators, data scientists, and researchers. We aimed to achieve three goals through a collaborative workshop: (a) to bring educators together with data scientists in collaborative co-design to build conversation, workflows, visualizations, and pilot code; (b) to train educators and data scientists around data use in schools using the current data systems available and focusing on educator problems of practice; and (c) to publish open-access code as well as educator perceptions of this intersection of data use, visualization, and education data science to inform evidence-based improvement cycles for instructional improvement in schools. This book contains three sections: Section 1, Education Data Analytics Collaborative Workshop Organization and Studying the Event Itself, contains: (1) Introduction: Dashboards, Data Use, and Decision-making: A Data Collaborative Workshop Bringing Together Educators and Data Scientists (Alex J. Bowers); (2) Planning, Organizing, and Orchestrating the Education Data Collaborative Workshop (Alex J.

AB  - In response to the issue of why and how the humanities--and more broadly the liberal arts and sciences--have historically dominated honors education and disregarded preprofessional fields, the author finds that the crux of the problem is not the nature or worth of the disciplines involved or why this or that subject area is de facto included or excluded from honors. Instead, the author argues that honors is not about privileging specific content in any academic domain but about the approaches to teaching and learning that distinguish the honors enterprise. Grounded in creative, participatory, experiential strategies of what we know as active learning, honors is a way of teaching and learning that cuts across subject areas. Honors is pedagogy. As more STEM and preprofessional disciplines implement proven active learning pedagogies that have long been at the center of honors education, fields beyond the humanities and liberal arts will find mutually beneficial common ground with honors.

AB  - Educational data science (EDS) is an emerging, interdisciplinary research domain that seeks to improve educational assessment, teaching, and student learning through data analytics. Teachers have been portrayed in the EDS literature as users of pre-constructed data dashboards in educational technologies, with little consideration given to them as active producers of data analytics. This article presents the case study results of an EDS program at a large university in Midwestern U.S.A. in which faculty and instructors were provided with access to institutional data and data analytics technologies in order to explore questions related to their classroom and departmental environments. Semi-structured interviews of program participants were conducted to examine the participants' experiences as practitioner researchers in EDS. The analysis showed that participants were motivated to participate to improve their learning and educational environments through data analytics, as opposed to developing a research agenda in EDS; that participants experienced a range of barriers related to data literacy; and that participant community support in addition to administrative support are vital to teacher-focused EDS programs. This study adds to a small but growing body of research in EDS that considers teachers as producers and not just consumers of data analytics.

AB  - In this paper, I explore the need for particular types of interdisciplinarity, which I refer to as technical heteroglossia, in the face of neoliberal political and economic disenfranchisement. I examine the case of a group of medics (EMTs, nurses, and lay medical practitioners) known as street medics and their efforts to provide a working set of medical protocols for protesters, victims of natural disasters, and, more generally, communities resisting neoliberalism, militarism, and corporate power. To function, this network has had to explicitly embrace multiple medical traditions: allopathic (sometimes called Western), Chinese, herbalist, naturopathic, etc. Being able to speak within multiple traditions (medical heteroglossia) is deeply valued. I also recount the history of the medics and discuss at length the contextual forces that pull medics in different directions: allopathic medicine and more varied and unorthodox practices.

AB  - A skills gap from theoretical knowledge to practical application is always a critical issue in Taiwan's education field. The launch of 12-year Basic Education Curriculum and the emergence of the educational innovation industry arouse the awareness of project-based competency-oriented curriculum design. Introducing design thinking into the educational field has received significant attention in recent years owing to the fact that the characteristics of design thinking track with a similar vision of the "core competency" listed in the 12-year Basic Education Curriculum, including emphasizing on exploring and doing, interdisciplinary integration, and the real-world scenario. This research takes the "Campus Ambassador Program" held by Design for Change Taiwan (DFC Taiwan), an educational innovation organization, as a case study. The method of semi-constructed in-depth interview is selected to gather the information from the student teachers of the program's participants as well as the staffs of DFC Taiwan who are responsible for this program, in order to know the effectiveness of the student teachers' design thinking education program.

AB  - The survey data suggest a high technical and sufficient psychological readiness of Yaroslavl State University students to use mobile devices in learning. The results of the research prove that students have an above the average level of interest and motivation in learning with the help of mobile devices. Nevertheless, it is obvious that there is a need for popularizing mobile learning among students through organization of explanatory talks and encouragement on the part of the teaching staff. Two multidisciplinary cases with using modern IT-technologies in university educational process are presented. [For the complete proceedings, see ED579190.]

AB  - Grounded Theory is a systematic approach to social research that allows for new concepts and theories to emerge from gathered data, as opposed to relying on either established theory or personal conjecture to interpret social processes. Although Grounded Theory is a well-known method within social science literature, it is relatively unknown in art and design literature, even though it is useful for developing social context and human empathy. In recent years, the model has gained relative credibility in many other disciplines, offering potential advantages for interdisciplinary scenarios. This paper provides a detailed review of Grounded Theory from an educational perspective, and then concludes with some proposed pedagogical methods for art and design based practices.

AB  - In this paper I call for "new forms of thinking and new ways of theorizing" the complex relations between the biological and social in sport and physical culture. I illustrate the inseparability of our biological and social bodies in sport and physical culture via the case of exercise and female reproductive hormones. Inspired by feminist biologists and philosophers of science such as Lynda Birke and Elizabeth Grosz, I describe my current research project in which I am seeking to create space for female exercisers' (as distinct from female athletes) voices about their embodied experiences of exercise-associated amenorrhea. I offer reflections from my ongoing study and reveal a number of dilemmas that emerge as I consider how we might bring biology--and particularly hormones--back into conversations about women's moving bodies in non-reductionist and non-determinist terms. I conclude by advocating the need for more transdisciplinary approaches to help us move toward more multidimensional understandings of the body in sport and physical culture.

AB  - This article presents some results arising from the meta-analysis of the educational research that has been developed at Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Portugal). The intention was to understand the status of the educational research produced, the main thematic trends studied, affiliated scientific domains, conceptual frames mobilized, and methodological approaches used. The PhD theses that have been submitted for the doctoral degree in Educational Sciences were analyzed and for each one we searched for the research questions and/or research objectives pursued, the methodology of research developed, the entities examined (e.g., individuals, institutions, or organizations), the main theoretical perspectives assumed and the disciplinary, multidisciplinary, or transdisciplinary approach embraced. This enquiry revealed the predominance of qualitative approaches to research in education. Discovering what was done was a gateway to think about educational researchers training and to highlight some issues related to doctoral programs design, pedagogy, and teaching practices.

AB  - There has been longstanding interest in students' aesthetic feelings in engaging with school science, but new multimodal accounts of meaning-making, and changing curricular goals where science is integrated with other subjects, pose new methodological challenges for researching these feelings. In this paper, we aim to synthesise relevant literature as the bases for proposing methodological practices to address these new research challenges. We draw on past and current pragmatist and semiotic perspectives to justify our methodological approach. We claim that research on aesthetic feelings needs to identify: (a) the complex nature of aesthetic meaning/feeling processes and multiple influences on these processes and (b) short-term and longer-term consequences on participants' taste for, and learning in, science. Building on a practical epistemology, we propose that these questions can be addressed through multimodal analyses of aesthetic intentions and responses when embedded in teacher and student inquiry purposes, discursive interactions, artefact-making, and evaluative feelings/judgements. To illustrate the scope and challenges of these methodological strategies, we draw on examples of analyses in companion papers in this special issue, both when science is taught alone and when integrated with other subjects.

AB  - National Research Council polices (NRC, 2012a, 2012b) and the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) of 2015 (Pub. L. No. 114-145) call for educators to have active roles in teaching to achieve new goals and purposes for education. A high priority is teaching content knowledge and information fluency skills that will result in deep learning, higher order thinking, and college and career readiness. Information fluency involves abilities to find, evaluate and use print and digital information effectively, efficiently and ethically to create knowledge useful in solving real-world problems. This action research (Blaxter, Hughes, and Tight, 2010) investigates co-teaching in a college, undergraduate physical sciences course. Information and technology literacy skills (ACRL, 2016) were taught in the context of a 12-week unit about the design of control variable experiments. Co-teaching was done by a professor of physical sciences and a professor of library and information science. Assignment learning objectives provided a framework for analysis of 24 students' scores that tells a story of the process of co-teaching through articulation of two professors' engagement in instructional interactions, creation of materials and strategies to increase information fluency as well as descriptions of students' completion of assignments. It was concluded that co-teaching effectiveness involves intensity of effort in shared planning, organization, delivery and assessment of instruction; shared physical and/or virtual space of instruction; and in the combining two areas of academic expertise in delivery of cross-curricular instruction.

AB  - Data and its applications are increasingly ubiquitous in the rapidly digitizing world and consequently, students across different disciplines face increasing demand to develop skills to answer both academia's and businesses' increasing need to collect, manage, evaluate, apply and extract knowledge from data and critically reflect upon the derived insights. On the basis of recent experiences at the University of Ttingen, Germany, we present a new approach to teach the relevant data science skills as an introductory service course at the university or advanced college level. We describe the outline of a complete course that relies on case studies and project work built around contemporary data sets, including openly available online teaching resources.

AB  - Despite Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) advancements, general faculty adoption of effective teaching strategies has been slow, especially within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. One solution has been to focus on preparing future faculty. The Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL) is a national network preparing future STEM faculty for the professoriate through teaching professional development. CIRTL emphasizes a SoTL-parallel concept known as teaching-as-research (TAR), which trains future faculty to integrate research with teaching to promote ongoing pedagogical improvement. The local CIRTL leaders who run institutional-level programs connect their institution to the Network and engage in vital campus-based boundary-spanning roles. However, it is not clear what individual and institutional attributes influence their boundary-spanning behaviors. This article presents the results of four CIRTL institutional case studies that identified six boundary-spanning leadership traits and three institutional characteristics found to influence local CIRTL programs. The article concludes with six boundary-spanning leadership principles that can be applied more generally within the SoTL community.

AB  - Constructing explanations of scientific concepts is one of the most frequent strategies used in the science classroom and is a high-leverage teaching practice. This study analysed the explanations provided by student teachers in STEM areas from a socio-materiality perspective focused on verbal and nonverbal language and representations. The study was conducted in a hybrid research format by scholars and a preservice teacher. First, the study compared the representational elements used by 86 student teachers to construct explanations about various concepts in a roleplay setting. Next, a positioning analysis was done by a preservice teacher, to a selection of five of these explanations focused on the concept of "force". The positioning analysis highlighted the embedded voices in the construction of explanations, with a focus on the intersection between science and language. The results showed that the student teachers created explanations as static artefacts, mainly using examples, graphs and images to clarify the concepts. The voices of learners and scientists were mostly absent from the explanations, which led to the presentation of explanations in STEM areas as finished and unquestionable artefacts, with references neither to nature nor to the history of science. We reflect on the meanings attributed to learning to be a practitioner in the context of interconnecting science and language through explanations, as a process of meaning (re)production within the classroom. Implications for teacher education are discussed in order to enhance student teachers' awareness about constructing knowledge by enacting explanations in the science classroom.

AB  - This paper addresses a particular aspect of 21st century skills: the potential of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) to support students in developing skills for citizenship, life and careers. In this respect, including connections to the world of work in mathematics and science classes seems to be indispensable. Therefore, in this paper we outline the necessity of including such connections in education and the related theoretical background. We then present an international research study of long-term professional development courses involving inquiry-based learning and connections to the world of work. The course was designed on an international level for use in 13 countries and was subsequently implemented in these countries. The results of the pre-post study across all these countries show that such a course can indeed lead to the desired outcomes concerning the teachers and their teaching, but also that these outcomes are associated with teachers' beliefs as well as their perceptions of policy support, classroom management and time issues.

AB  - Education for sustainability -- understood as efforts to equip people with the knowledge and skills necessary to make environmental, social and economic decisions that consider the needs of present and future generations -- has been incorporated in the official curriculum of Australia as a 'cross-curriculum priority'. This research sought to understand practising primary school teachers' integration of the sustainability cross-curriculum priority into the curriculum. In this study, nine primary school teachers in the Perth metropolitan region (five generalist; four specialists -- including two science specialists) were interviewed about the extent to which the Western Australian Curriculum has guided and supported their teaching practices in relation to sustainability and the sustainability cross-curriculum priority. Through detailed and rich examples of classroom practice, the participants illustrated the web of interrelated factors that characterise the implementation of the sustainability cross-curriculum priority across various learning areas, including science. Participant experiences also alluded to the idea that the sustainability cross-curriculum priority is a valuable avenue for re-emphasising science concepts across learning areas. Overall, the most salient take-home message of this work is that, in addition to the various influences contributing to the implementation of the sustainability cross-curriculum priority (such as whether a school is considered sustainably built), teachers are the main actors in the implementation of sustainability and making informed decisions about how sustainability is to be incorporated in their teaching. However, in order for teachers to drive this implementation, their required level of support goes beyond the curriculum and includes active engagement from their school leadership teams.

and presentation skills, and resource mining. The second-year science cohort of 220 students is divided into small groups. Each group proposes a topic through which to explore the societal role played by chemistry. The program has two components: a report written by pairs of students and
a short competitive group presentation. The multiple positive outcomes of the program have been assessed, including the less tangible benefit of a renewed connectivity between students and staff engaged in the pursuit of chemistry. (Contains 3 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - The research experience for teachers (RET) professional development was a six-week long summer-intensive National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project that took place at a large university in western Texas. It was designed to provide a research-rich learning environment in data science and cybersecurity for STEM teachers in the region, which is mainly rural. Due to geographical isolation, rural teachers lack resources to prepare their middle and high school students for STEM careers and often find it difficult to bring innovative science teaching into their classrooms. The team was comprised of nine teachers, five professors, and six graduate students. We utilized discourse analysis within the situated perspective to examine teacher reflections and artifacts to discover how they assimilated disciplinary knowledge of data science and its application to cybersecurity and how they transferred this knowledge into their middle and high school curriculum. We found the teachers acquired this knowledge by gradually developing a scientist persona. They also acquired sophisticated pedagogical knowledge to integrate complex concepts into their middle and high school STEM curriculum without sacrificing the state standards, while creating a community of learners. This led to reduced feelings of isolation often experienced by rural teachers. It is clear that partnerships between universities and rural school districts can transform the way STEM disciplines are delivered, creating a strong pipeline for rural students in the STEM workforce.

AB  - The aim of the present study is to investigate the process of constructing a Multimedia Assisted Vocabulary Learning (MAVL) instrument at a university in Rwanda in 2009. The instrument is used in a one-computer classroom where students were taught in a foreign language and had little access to books. It consists of video clips featuring images, sound and text intended to facilitate learning and retention of technical vocabulary in a first-year electricity course. The construction takes theories of social constructivism and learning with multimedia as its point of departure. In response to the need for knowledge of scientific vocabulary, the researcher collaborated with a group of 82 students and their two teachers to select and encode 81 video clips of technical terminology. The gains from the process of constructing the instrument enabled collaborative and interdisciplinary learning and showed the potential to facilitate technical vocabulary acquisition.

AB  - As part of an outreach initiative by the Natural History Museum in Vienna, Austria, an interdisciplinary educational module was developed to teach students about sustainability through the lens of mineral resources used to produce mobile phones. The overall goal of the module is to provide teachers of different subjects with a multifaceted tool to include sustainability in their classrooms and create greater awareness of our resource-rich lifestyle. The evaluation of efficacy and impact of the module in formal classroom environments is facilitated through two case studies: an assessment of teacher experiences across Austria with our teaching kit, and an assessment of student learning in Austria and the U.S. During the development of the teaching module in Austria, workshops with 97 teachers were conducted to identify educators' needs and offer an interdisciplinary usable teaching kit. The study showed that teachers greatly appreciated the hands-on workshops and implemented the module in their curriculum. For the student study, 416 students from Vienna, Austria, (209 students) and the Greater Boston area in the U.S. (207 students) were taught the same module by the same instructor. Student performance and learning impact were assessed using pre and post questionnaires. For the Austrian students, an additional long-term post questionnaire was completed six months after the intervention. Students' short-term performances increased significantly immediately after the module. This paper describes the outreach project and our teaching module, and proposes the development of curriculum extensions and teacher professional development for implementing interdisciplinary science concepts.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the ways in which preservice elementary teacher candidates designed integrated reading and science lessons that evoked the use of similar cognitive skills in both subjects, such as sequencing, predicting, classifying, or noting cause and effect. The authors provided the candidates with a lesson plan template focused on making meaning for hands-on science activities along with appropriate fiction or nonfiction texts. We used qualitative content analysis to determine the candidates' (a) general approaches to integrated lesson planning, (b) use of pedagogical moves to promote science understanding and reading comprehension, and (c) use of essential elements of inquiry-based teaching. Results indicated most candidates demonstrated proficiency and creativity in identifying specific pedagogical moves to highlight students' cognition and metacognition of similar thinking skills and to drive home the science concepts. We discuss the possibilities for using science to leverage reading comprehension and reading to leverage science understandings in elementary classrooms.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to present a conceptual framework that integrates science and language learning for all students, including English learners (ELs). This framework is grounded in the mutually supportive nature of science instructional shifts, spurred by "A Framework for K-12 Science Education" (National Research Council, 2012. A framework for K-12 science education: Practices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas) and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), and language instructional shifts, informed by contemporary thinking in second language acquisition. First, we describe the conceptual framework that consists of our perspective and design principles. Then, we describe one approach for using the conceptual framework to develop NGSS-aligned instructional materials that promote science and language learning with elementary students, including ELs. Finally, we offer implications for future research for our own design research specifically and for the field more broadly. The conceptual framework highlights how substantive collaboration between content areas, such as science, and the field of EL education can help ensure that all students, and ELs in particular, are supported in meeting rigorous content standards while developing proficiency in English.

AB  - The focus on Computer Science Education at the K-12 level has been increasingly highlighted due to today's need for a populace with computational thinking skills, in addition to the expansion of careers related to computing and computer science. Programming helps facilitate students' examination of the nature of a problem and helps students to increase their computational thinking, problem-solving and higher-order thinking skills through the combination of multiple disciplines in areas such as science, the arts, engineering, and mathematics. How to facilitate the teaching of programming to younger learners has become an essential question, as programming by itself focuses more on structure, debugging, and syntaxes. Becoming involved with a second discipline provides students with additional opportunity to form creative solutions to a given problem as it provides a different perspective and helps link academic problem solving with the real world. The current study is an example of how to involve mathematics as the second discipline in the teaching of programming, and to see the differences between the acquisition of programming skills and its retention. Quasi-Experimental Research was conducted on a large sample (N = 188), with four groups randomly assigned as experimental and control groups. The results of the study show that the increment on students' programming skills and retention of those who learned programming through the integration of mathematics as the second discipline were higher than students who learned programming through traditional methods. These results were also found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05).

AB  - The United States invented a matrix sampling technique to impute five plausible scores of student performance in its National Assessment of Educational Progress. That approach was adopted by a Trend in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) for international comparison. In this paper, baseline data from TIMSS 1995 are analyzed at the seventh grade to examine correlation of plausible scores between mathematics and science. Canonical correlation is introduced to address a non-additive nature of correlation coefficient and reduce Type I error in the result aggregation. Besides revealing the impact of interdisciplinary correlation, this investigation reconfirms importance of student performance in each core subject.

AB  - Analysis of stochastic processes can be used to engender critical thinking. Quantum dots have a reversible, stochastic transition between luminescent and nonluminescent states. The luminescence intermittency is known as blinking and is not evident from ensemble measurements. In order to stimulate critical thinking, students design, perform, and analyze a semiconductor quantum dot blinking laboratory experiment. The design of the experiment and stochastic nature of the data collected require students to make judgements throughout the course of the single-particle measurement and analysis. Some of the decisions do not have uniquely correct answers, challenging the students to engage in critical thinking. We propose that students' self-examined decision making develops a constructivist view of science. The experiment is visually striking, is interdisciplinary, and develops higher order thinking.

AB  - We designed a collaborative course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) between an Analytical Chemistry course and an Environmental Toxicology course to engage students in a research project that cannot rely on one discipline alone. This study reports on 47 students' self-reported experiences with the course outcomes and their opinions of the CURE project. Students in both courses increased their levels of experience in skills related to the CURE project, including their ability to design a project where the outcome was unknown. Further, most students felt a sense of project ownership, but their ownership was attributed only to the positive aspects of the CURE. At the end of the CURE, the students in both classes demonstrated the ability to connect ideas and techniques learned in the course to a broader environmental research question. We also suggest several tips for developing collaborative CUREs in undergraduate courses.

AB  - Interdisciplinary curriculum development is challenging in the sense that materials from more than one discipline have to be integrated in a seamless manner. A faculty member has to develop expertise in multiple disciplines in order to teach an interdisciplinary course, or the course has to be team-taught. Both approaches are difficult to implement. There are administrative issues, such as proportional posting of expenditures across departmental budgets for the courses taught collaboratively, or courses with students from multiple departments. This paper describes the development and teaching of a sequence of bioinformatics related interdisciplinary courses for incorporation into undergraduate biology curricula. Three courses were developed with collaboration between the Departments of Biology and Computer Science at Tuskegee University. Each course contains contents from different subjects, traditionally considered to be virtually independent of each other. The courses have contents from biology, computer science, statistics, mathematics and biochemistry. The first two courses, Introduction to Bioscience Computing and Biological Algorithms & Data Structures, cover the computing and computer science fundamentals necessary for the informed use of bioinformatics tools. The third is an introductory course in bioinformatics. The focus was on teaching the effective use of bioinformatics tools, as compared to development of bioinformatics tools which is more relevant at the graduate level. Administrative issues encountered are also discussed. This work was supported by a NSF HBCU-UP grant.

AB  - Environmental Chemistry covers a range of topics within the discipline of chemistry, from toxicology to legislation, which warrants interdisciplinary study. Consequently, problem-based learning (PBL), a style of student-centered learning which facilitates the integration of multiple subjects, was investigated to determine if it would be a more appropriate instructional method for teaching Environmental Chemistry than the traditional teacher-centered education model. This article describes the practical aspects of course development and implementation of PBL in a master's level course in Environmental Chemistry. Overall, the results, which were collected from the initial two years of the course, indicated that the students were pleased and found PBL to be an efficient methodology for not only learning, but also acquiring an in-depth understanding of Environmental Chemistry. This is intended as a case-study with the target audience consisting primarily of high school and undergraduate chemistry teachers, but may also be useful for teachers in other subject areas with an interest in student-centered education.

AB  - Professional development programs might affect teachers' perceptions of how STEM disciplines are interconnected. The purpose of this research was to examine the change in perceptions of science teachers particularly in disadvantageous schools, who participated in a practice-based professional development program offered in Turkey, about STEM, entrepreneurship, and E-STEM, and their experiences related to E-STEM. This qualitative research had a phenomenological design. The participants were totally 30 science teachers who were teaching in each of the seven geographical regions of Turkey. The data were collected through semi-structured pre- and post-focus group interview forms finalized after the expert review and pilot study. Furthermore, the science teachers were asked to keep a diary about the implementation process throughout the research. The data collected through focus group interviews were examined using content analysis and the data collected through the diaries were examined using descriptive analysis. The findings of the study indicate that the science teachers defined E-STEM as a process containing the aspects of entrepreneurship (communication, perseverance and determination, self-confidence, motivation, risk-taking, presentation, and marketing) more comprehensively compared to the pre-interviews.

AB  - We report here a teacher action research project in which a Systems Thinking approach was implemented into a 15 h Depth Study for students in their final year of secondary chemistry. Students were introduced to the concept of Systems Thinking and the use of systems maps, along with the United Nations Global Goals for Sustainable Development (SDGs). Integrating these ideas, students created their own systems maps for specific chemical processes. Specifically, they represented their chemistry curriculum content knowledge in the context of the SDGs, by considering whether the impact of each aspect of the chemical process is positive, negative, or neutral for each SDG. The purpose of the approach was to give students the opportunity to situate their knowledge of sustainability in the context of the sourcing, uses, and other intended and unintended consequences of a variety of chemical processes, and how these processes impact the wider global community. The teacher action research was conducted through the development and testing of the teaching materials as part of an iterative cycle of improvement. The teaching and assessment approach was evaluated utilizing reflections of the teacher in an action research cycle. The project is described in the context of how Systems Thinking influenced the inclusion of sustainability as a cross-curriculum priority in Australia. This report gives secondary teachers tools to implement Systems Thinking in their own classrooms in a way that integrates it within the chemistry curriculum without requiring additional time or resources.

AB  - As the COVID-19 pandemic became widespread in early 2020, people around the world felt scared, confused, and at a loss for how to help their fellow humans. Suddenly, young and old alike needed to understand the science of virology and how to protect themselves and others, while the world's scientific understanding of the specific COVID-19 virus continued to evolve. In response to this critical need, the Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC) collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the InterAcademy Partnership (IAP) to create a community research guide called "COVID-19! How Can I Protect Myself and Others?," which focused on the protective behaviors necessary to ensure public health. To disseminate this module, the SSEC leveraged a network of partners from around the world who shared the goal of providing high-quality science and STEM education to young people. One key partner was Innovation for Science Education (INNOVEC) based in Mexico. Through the Smithsonian's timely content and the innovative efforts of INNOVEC and others to reach young learners around the globe, "COVID-19! How Can I Protect Myself and Others?" has supported more than 2 million young people in 36 countries to discover, understand, and act in order to protect themselves and others.

AB  - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is among the most commonly diagnosed disorders of children and youth. Young people receive their ADHD diagnoses and medical treatment in primary health care settings and can experience a range of behavioral and educational disabilities treated in the clinic, at home, and at school. We propose a Team-Based Collaborative Care Model (TBCCM) to foster communication and collaboration among health care and education teams, embedding implementation science methods to promote and sustain evidence-based practices for youth with ADHD. Key features of the model include: (a) effective leadership and teamwork within the two universal systems of education and health care; (b) use of data from multiple informants who describe and monitor student behavior within and across contexts; and (c) adoption and adaptation of evidence-based practices. We expect that these efforts to embed implementation science methods within a collaborative team structure will improve the uptake of evidence by intervention teams in the two systems, and thus optimize outcomes for children and youth with ADHD.

AB  - Children and youth in schools are subject to the effects of the larger culture's attitudes and values related to body size. When negatively biased, these attitudes and values can have detrimental effects and thus emerge as relevant to educational and psychological consultants. Drawing on the nascent field of Fat Studies with its focus on the cultural meanings attached to large bodies, we identify direct implications of fat phobia for school-age children and youth. Via a brief case example, an initial review of literature, and several examples of health-positive programming, we describe the social justice implications of fat phobia for consultants in school and community settings. In this consideration of the role of consultants for addressing fat bias and supporting health, we also suggest the merit of applied interdisciplinarity as a strong ground for consultation research and practice. The academic area of Fat Studies provides illustration of the integration of disciplinary perspectives (e.g., sociology, anthropology, biology, psychology). Educational and psychological consultation is ideally situated for systematically engaging such interdisciplinarity in support of practical outcomes that are healthy, sustainable, and socially just.

AB  - Higher education studies give considerable attention to understanding "change." The interest in change reflects the historical conditions in which higher education emerged as a distinct field of study. Around the mid-twentieth century, a pragmatic need for an academic response to managing larger and more complex higher education institutions and systems was taking shape. This need gave rise to a tradition of studying change in higher education, which has continued into the present. To explore how higher education researchers have been grappling with the problem of change, we examine a selection of works published in this and other higher education outlets since the 1970s. We organize our exploration around three distinct yet interrelated lines of research: (a) change within "higher education institutions," which in higher education studies are typically conceptualized as organizations; (b) change concerning "nation-states," which are usually conceptualized as systems; and (c) "transnational" change, sometimes referred to also as global. Each line of research features the field's telltale dual orientation: (i) contributing to abstract knowledge through academic inquiry, on the one hand, and (ii) generating practical and actionable insights for decision makers, on the other. We find that the field's dual orientation shapes knowledge creation along each line of inquiry, yet with important variations. We propose more generally that higher education studies' ability to balance the two orientations is an important source of its legitimacy as a field of research.

AB  - Transitioning to university can be a daunting endeavour, with student success dependent on a myriad of effects (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). Understanding how to navigate university systems, who to meet, how to get help, how to study, and what goals to set can be hard to grasp (Valle et al., 2003). We provide an overview of the new interdisciplinary foundations course, which piloted in fall 2014, for first-year Faculty of Science students at McMaster University. This course provides a taste of research-based learning (Healey, Jenkins, & Lea, 2014) and develops essential skills that are important for an undergraduate degree and future academic or career plans, exposes students to a wide range of departments and programs in the Faculty of Science, and invites students to reflect on their academic journey and how it may be changing as a result of the course. This customized approach intentionally teaches students how to locate and use institutional resources and the expectations that the institution has of its students, while offering opportunities to create networks of support essential for student success and retention (Kuh, Cruce, Shoup, Kinzie, & Gonyea, 2008), and speaks to a number of considerations highlighted in the literature (e.g., Ambrose, Bridges, DiPietro, Lovett, & Norman, 2010). Other factors considered include balancing the needs of the Faculty, the resources available, and the goals, demands, and interests of the students. In this paper, we describe the course's design, structure and implementation, key components of the course, support from upper-level science students, and preliminary pedagogical results, which assess its impact on and perception by students.

AB  - While middle school is a critical phase for science career development for all students (Maltese & Tai, 2009), this stage presents considerations for females in science, in particular. During middle school, the decline in science interest is greater for females than males and, for most students, the level of science interest developed during this middle school stage will persist throughout their lifetime, thereby influencing science career interests and attainment (Todd & Zvoch, 2017). This study aimed to stimulate and sustain middle school female students' interest in science study and careers by transforming opportunities for their participation in classroom science in ways that better appealed to and supported female science students. Research has shown that collaborative and active engagement with peers, hands-on and tangible modes of engagement, significant real-world connections, and choice have been effective in supporting middle school female students in science. Arts-integration has been explored as a cohesive framework that could potentially incorporate each of these characteristics into a science learning environment for five middle school female students. Pre- and post-interviews served as data to investigate the impact of a four-week arts-integrated science unit on the students' interests in science and science careers. The students explicitly discussed the positive effects of collaborative and active engagement with peers, hands-on and tangible modes of engagement, and significant real-world connections on their interest in science and science career planning. While they did not explicitly acknowledge choice, all of the girls indicated thorough enjoyment from learning and engaging in science in the ways presented in the study. All of the students advanced in their career planning as a result of experiences in the unit, either in terms of science careers or the arts. Findings are discussed in light of related research and future lines of inquiry.

AB  - This literature review explores the impact of music on tonal language learning, with a focus on Mandarin Chinese. Utilising searches across major databases such as ERIC (EBSCO), ProQuest Central, Google Scholar, and Web of Science from 2005 to 2024, we selected relevant peer-reviewed English-language articles examining music's role in aiding tone acquisition and related cognitive processes. From 30 publications, findings are categorised into theoretical relationships, cognitive effects, melodic intonation therapy (MIT) applications and digital music applications. Theoretical frameworks emphasise the correlation between musicality and language proficiency, highlighting musicians' enhanced tonal perception and production skills. Cognitive effects include music's influence on pronunciation, memory and cultural understanding. MIT's effectiveness in tonal language learning is then discussed, emphasising its potential to improve cortical representations of tone categories. Finally, digital music applications are examined, focusing on language learning apps incorporating music for personalised and engaging learning experiences. The review finds significant literature reporting that music-based methodologies, aligned with experiential learning paradigms, hold significant potential in Mandarin Chinese acquisition. They enhance listening comprehension, spoken language production, and understanding of grammar and syntax. Similar to MIT principles, music-assisted tonal language learning utilises exaggerated melody and rhythm to improve language production, especially with complex words. This review is motivated by the recognition of music's potential benefits in language education, especially for tonal languages. It aims to provide educators and researchers with insights into effective methods and applications, guiding instructional practices and stimulating further empirical investigations in this interdisciplinary field. Ultimately, it contributes to the ongoing discourse on optimising tonal language learning methodologies.

AB  - The article provides an overview of the conclusions reached by the British Academy Childhood Policy Programme in its final report. The programme explored the role of the state in childhood and how children and childhood are conceptualised in policy-making. The aim was to apply an inter-disciplinary social sciences and humanities lens in order to reframe debates around childhood policies and to encourage a more consistent and integrated approach to them. The article first sets childhood policy in a wider political and policy context, noting the significant variation between different parts of the UK. It then explores three key themes that emerged from the project's first phase: the tension between conceptualising childhood as a time of 'being' and 'becoming'; children's rights; and children's voices and participation. In each case the diversity among children and the inequalities they face is emphasised. The article concludes with a set of principles derived from the analysis of the themes and designed to encourage debate.

AB  - Previous research demonstrates that integration of science and literacy instruction in primary grades has positive outcomes for students' science and literacy development. However, variations in how science and literacy are enacted suggest integration may not be sufficient to meet the literacy and science needs of all students in an equitable manner. The purpose of this study was to examine two first-grade teachers' science integration during literacy instruction in one high- and one low-income school context within one urban district. Analysis of field notes, transcripts of lessons, and interviews revealed that expectations to integrate science during time set aside for literacy instruction without consideration of contextual factors perpetuated and concealed ongoing inequities in science education for students from the lowest income school. Further, this study adds to evidence from prior studies demonstrating that reading of science-related texts alone, as a substitute for instruction in science as a discipline, does not provide students with the resources needed to learn to think, talk, and act as scientists. Findings from this study require researchers and policy-makers to address the context-specific factors that shape instructional contexts in ways that limit or expand the potential of integrated science--literacy instruction in urban schools.

AB  - This study aimed to raise awareness of maker education for pre-service teachers and discuss maker education in their major subjects by developing and applying a maker education course for pre-service teachers with various majors based on novel engineering (NE), a teaching and learning method that combines humanities and engineering. Accordingly, the course was developed following the procedure of the Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation (ADDIE) model, and the educational effectiveness was investigated using test tools. The educational effect and difficulties were also examined through the analysis of reflective journals written by 20 pre-service teachers with various majors who participated in the course. To investigate the educational effectiveness of the developed course, the science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) literacy of the participants--before and after the course--was measured, with the results demonstrating a statistically significant improvement. Analysis of the reflective journals identified a recognition of sharing effectiveness, the joy of making, and an in-depth understanding of maker education as education effects, and a lack of understanding of techniques, the burden of prototype fabrication, and the limitation of majoring subjects as difficulties experienced during the activities. This study verified that NE could be used as a significant maker education measure for pre-service teachers with various majors. Based on this verification, this study also proposes a strategy to develop more effective NE-based maker education.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to share worked examples of skills profiling within the universal micro-credential framework, a novel approach designed to further the enablement of 21st century skills which are defined here as a generalized series of competencies gained by a learner that enable them to self-reflect, self-regulate and self-optimize their capabilities within highly emergent contexts. This approach improves interdisciplinary learning and assessment paths for computing education by providing personalized learning and assessment options and by enabling curricula to better accommodate both internal and external interdisciplinary content. Through these worked examples, this article addresses potential solutions to fundamental and persistent structural issues in today's learning-earning ecosystem. Most significant of these issues is what the authors refer to as a "capability-competency chasm," a term used to describe an enduring gap that creates problematic deficits for learners as they transition between education and employment. At the core of the universal micro-credential framework is skills profiling, which can leverage micro-credential pathways and badge catalogues, both within the context of computing education in particular and across higher education in general. Accounting for the complexity of implementing system-wide redesign in highly variable higher-education contexts, this article also briefly references the role of design patterns to enable such implementation. Collectively, these flexible credentialing innovations offer a globally innovative solution to systemic challenges, explaining both the importance of addressing such challenges and the opportunities arising from them.

AB  - Arts integration research has focused on documenting how the teaching of specific art forms can be integrated with "core" academic subject matters (e.g. science, mathematics and literacy). However, the question of how the teaching of multiple art forms themselves can be integrated in schools remains to be explored by educational researchers. This paper draws on data collected at a secondary school in Singapore. The case study analyses how three art teachers, using the idea of "space" as organizing theme, implemented a module of instruction that connected concepts and processes from a variety of art forms (including dance, music, drama and visual arts). We present evidence from curriculum materials, lesson plans, student-teacher classroom interactions and students' productions. Students were able to reflect upon the importance of space within the arts, analyse the points of convergence and divergence among several art forms, experiment with space and create their own interdisciplinary performances. Our ultimate aim is to provide insights that might inspire art teachers in designing instructional units focused on "big ideas". We suggest that allowing more curricular freedom and providing teachers with adequate structures for interdisciplinary collaboration are key to achieving meaningful levels of integration.

AB  - Training in research methods is a crucial component of the student experience in further and higher education. A common set of statistical and experimental design methods are taught across a broad range of non-mathematics disciplines, spanning STEM subjects, medicine, and the social sciences. Understanding these methods is central to students' ability to engage with their course, tutors, and the literature. It is also the key to enabling students to become not only practitioners of their chosen subject, but also statistically literate citizens, capable of understanding and evaluating everyday statistics. The first aim of this paper is to review the specific set of challenges faced by staff and students teaching and learning statistics within non-mathematics disciplines. Secondly, we review best practice and current trends in the design of motivating and effective statistics courses for non-specialists. Our findings suggest that many of the key challenges stem from negative attitudes towards statistics coupled with poor motivation to study the subject, factors which are exacerbated by statistics anxiety. Fortunately, because these challenges are so widespread, and have attracted the attention of innovative educators across broad disciplines, there is a wealth of good ideas and resources available to statistics teachers seeking ways to create effective learning experiences.

AB  - The adoption of Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) in Spain has affected educational spending and introduced modifications in learning and assessment procedures for students. While positive effects are noticeable in terms of language learning, evidence concerning the impact on non-linguistic subject areas has been less forthcoming. This study, which forms part of the wider MON-CLIL investigation into CLIL instruction in monolingual areas of Spain, aims to contribute to the developing body of knowledge by comparing academic performance in science in primary education and natural science in compulsory secondary education. In addition to comparing school results for a sample of 93 public, charter (semi-private) and private primary students and 139 public and charter secondary students (total = 232), this study also involved a stepwise discriminant analysis with other potential intervening variables in order to determine the extent to which differences might be due to instruction type or to other factors. Significant differences were detected between certain school types in favour of non-CLIL groups in primary education, while differences also existed between public secondary groups in favour of CLIL. These findings seem to indicate that CLIL instruction had no detrimental effects on the science learning of the secondary learners participating in the study.

AB  - Integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in physical education (PE) has received increased attention. PE teachers' past behaviors and behavioral intentions of integrating STEM education in their teaching were investigated in this cross-sectional survey via the lens of the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Primary and secondary school PE teachers (n = 165) completed a survey that measured their behaviors and intentions surrounding STEM. The results indicated that only 19.4% of the PE teachers sometimes or often integrated STEM education in their teaching. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavior control positively predicted PE teachers' behavioral intentions, which was consistent with the TPB. These findings support the utility of TPB in understanding PE teachers' intentions to integrate STEM education in PE classrooms. The findings also provide the first evidence-based data for policymakers to promote STEM education in PE.

AB  - Increasing diversity in the geosciences has remained a challenge, despite large investments made by federal agencies in minority-serving institutions (MSIs) and historically black universities and colleges (HBCUs). With increasing challenges associated with climate and environmental change and severe and frequent natural disasters that disproportionately affect underrepresented minorities, HBCUs and MSIs are primed to lead the creation of a diverse workforce responding to these challenges. In this article, I use as examples the outcomes, successes, and challenges of two federally funded programs to increase diversity in the geosciences at an HBCU: North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NCAT). The lessons learned from these programs and best practices and strategies that could be applied to build and sustain geosciences programs at HBCUs and MSIs are presented. The programs were the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Educational Partnership program (EPP)-funded NOAA Interdisciplinary Scientific Environmental Technology Cooperative Science Center (ISETCSC) involving two HBCUs and three MSIs and the National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded Opportunities for Enhancing Diversity in the Geosciences (OEDG) Track I at an HBCU and Track 2 involving two HBCUs and two MSIs. One of the successfully accomplished goals of the ISETCSC was increasing research capacity in NOAA-relevant STEM areas at HBCUs and MSIs and building sustained research and educational capacity in the atmospheric sciences at NCAT. The OEDG Track 1 program, however, failed to develop a sustained geophysics program at NCAT. These experiences showed that one-time funding might not be enough to grow programs to be self-sustaining at these institutions, unless the programs are incorporated in their long-term strategic plans. Furthermore, when institutions apply for and receive grants for new program development in the geosciences, they need to be accountable in fulfilling the commitments and promises expressed in acquiring the funds.

AB  - The present study aims to deepen our understanding of the relationship between metacognitive awareness and approaches to learning in a multidisciplinary context of higher education using a person-oriented approach. The participants in the present study were 462 third year students of humanities, social sciences and theology. The students filled in a HowULearn questionnaire which included 18 items related to metacognitive awareness and 12 to approaches to learning. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to explore the factor structure of the instruments. The data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation, K-means cluster analysis and One-way ANOVA. The results showed that two dimensions of metacognitive awareness, namely knowledge about cognition and regulation of cognition, emerged from the data. Knowledge about cognition was evaluated higher than regulation of cognition. The results showed that both dimensions of metacognitive awareness were statistically significantly related to a deep approach to learning and organized studying and negatively to an unreflective approach. Furthermore, three learning profiles were identified and they differed in both of these dimensions of metacognitive awareness. More precisely, students representing "organized students" applying a deep approach had higher scores on knowledge about cognition as well as on regulation of cognition compared with the students representing "unorganized studentsapplying a deep approach" or those with a "dissonant profile." In addition, students representing the "dissonant profile" had statistically significantly lower scores on knowledge about cognition than those students representing "unorganized students applying a deep approach." The present study implies that students with different study profiles need different types of support for the metacognitive awareness of their own learning processes.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the opinions of the secondary and high school mathematics teachers and mathematics teacher candidates who have been educated about HTTM learning process and experienced HTTM activities in the classroom environment about HTTM learning process. The study is a basic qualitative research study conducted with a qualitative understanding. The sample of the study consisted of three secondary school maths teachers working in different secondary schools and three high school math teachers working in different high schools in Turkey during 2016-2017 academic year, five senior class students who are secondary school mathematics teacher candidates taking teaching practice course and applying teaching practices at different secondary schools and five high school mathematics teacher candidates applying teaching practices at different high schools. The data of the study is comprised of video analysis of the interviews conducted through semi-structured interview form with the secondary and high school mathematics teachers and mathematics teacher candidates. Content analysis technique was used in the research. As a result of the data analysis, a two-dimensional structure related to HTTM learning process was obtained. In the first dimension of the findings 15 themes were obtained. These are preparation, time, flexibility, interdisciplinary nature, contemporary skills, technology integration, history of science integration, working with groups, metacognitive skills, conceptual understanding, projects, problem posing, motivation, evaluation and teacher competency. In the second dimension of the findings; benefits, difficulties and suggestions related to 15 themes were put forward.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research provides new insight beyond a singular epistemological and methodological framework. Such collaboration can help increase readership outside a narrow disciplinary angle. Likewise, working with scholars outside one's field can help address new questions using a multidimensional approach. However, working within an interdisciplinary department can produce challenges, especially within small departments. Existing literature has addressed several challenges for academics working in small departments, including increased workload, limited course releases, and limited funding. This article addresses the professional isolation from working in a small interdisciplinary department and provides strategies to overcome these challenges.

AB  - Research in international large-scale assessment (ILSA) has become an increasingly popular field of study in education. Consequently, interest and debate in the field by practitioners, researchers, policymakers, and the public has grown over the past decades. This study adopts a descriptive bibliometric approach to map modern research on ILSA in education and provide an up-to-date picture of the recent developments and structure of the field. The analysis of 2,233 journal articles indexed in the Web of Sciences database revealed that ILSA research in education is an emerging field in a stage of exponential growth that has become increasingly international with recent substantive contributions from China, Spain, and Turkey. Research in the field is currently produced by a tupid network of scholars with diverse geographical backgrounds that engage frequently in national and international research collaborations. Also, the field is relatively interdisciplinary and has developed grounded on nine differentiated historical paths. The PISA program has received the greatest attention in the field, and a wide variety of topics have been addressed in the literature in the last decades, including equity and quality education, globalization and education policy, measurement and statistics, student motivation and self-concept, and interpersonal relationships. The paper concludes by pointing to the potential of future ILSA research to make use of new more relevant instrumentation, data linkages, and trans-regional collaborations.

AB  - Epistemological preferences in Western academies over the centuries became the measuring rod for what is to count as valid knowledge in thinking about development. The genealogy of the sciences of law and economics can be traced back to the Roman and British empires. The problem is posed in this paper as to the question of how remnants of these genealogies continue to influence development models and to what extent the academy may be in need of transformation by the inclusion of epistemologies and ethics found in modernity's "other", i.e. in cultures that continue to exist outside modernity. This transformation of the academy by enlargement, it is argued, would become more feasible by scientific methodologies inspired by forms of transdisciplinarity, trilateral science, and "praxis."

AB  - Focus of this article is the current situation characterized by students' de-rootedness and possible measures to improve the situation within the frame of education for sustainable development. My main line of argument is that science teachers can practice teaching in such a way that students are brought in deeper contact to the environment. I discuss efforts to promote aesthetic experience in science class and in science teacher education. Within a wide range of definitions, my main understanding of aesthetic experience is that of pre-conceptual experience, relational to the environment and incorporated in students' embodied knowledge. I ground the idea of Earth at rest in Husserl's phenomenological philosophy and Heidegger's notion of science' deprivation of the world. A critique of the ontological reversal leads to an ontological re-reversal that implies giving lifeworld experience back its value and rooting scientific concepts in students' everyday lives. Six aspects of facilitating grounding in sustainability-oriented science teaching and teacher education are highlighted and discussed: students' everyday knowledge and experience, aesthetic experience and grounding, fostering aesthetic sensibility, cross-curricular integration with art, ontological and epistemological aspects, and belongingness and (re-)connection to Earth. I conclude that both science students and student-teachers need to practice their sense of caring and belonging, as well as refining their sensibility towards the world. With an intention of educating for a sustainable development, there is an urgent need for a critical discussion in science education when it comes to engaging learners for a sustainable future.

AB  - In Latvia, a new curriculum is introduced to provide the opportunity to acquire skills in multidisciplinary context. To achieve that, schools need to implement projects. In this paper, one example of a multidisciplinary project where fieldwork is involved is described. The aim of the research was to create support materials for teachers and students based on practice to experience multidisciplinary fieldwork to develop competencies. In the end, thirteen different support materials for teachers and students were piloted. [For the full proceedings, see ED619611.]

AB  - Despite the impetus from professional organizations for science and mathematics integration, few teacher training programs provide opportunities for teachers to develop the knowledge and skills in effective content integration. This study reports on the impact of a graduate course on in-service middle school, math, and science teachers' professional knowledge for content integration and their integration practice. This course model draws on the extant research on science and mathematics integration. Quantitative and qualitative results suggest the course increased teacher professional knowledge and improved integration practice. Integration practice was evaluated utilizing a project-based measure: the Mathematics and Science Integration Rubric (MASIR). Results indicate that although the integration practice and teacher conceptions of integration moved toward a more coherent application of integrated instruction, the combination of content knowledge and teacher feedback should be targets of extended professional learning. Implications for broader professional development issues for science and mathematics teachers are discussed.

AB  - Background: The importance of music and play in early childhood development is widely acknowledged. However, no recent studies have investigated the potential of music-inspired free play to foster scientific exploration. Aim: The purpose of this qualitative case study is to explain the rationale in utilising musical skills, knowledge and experiences during free play to foster scientific exploration, applying a constructivist approach with the learner placed at the centre of the educational process, while the teacher acts as observer and facilitator. Setting: Data were primarily collected through documents to create a concept map that informed observations of preschoolers during free play at two day-care centres in Mohadin in the North-West Province of South Africa. Methods: An explanatory case study provided the context for this study and a document analysis informed the findings. Results: Through data analysis, key themes were identified from the literature and observations to generate a conceptual model that illustrates the influence of music-inspired free play to foster scientific exploration by stimulating creativity and emphasising the necessity of free play in preschool settings. Conclusion: The conclusion of this investigation was a better understanding of the capacity of young learners to apply scientific exploration, utilising a transdisciplinary approach for teaching and learning the sciences in the early years to develop a better understanding of their world through music-inspired free play.

AB  - The Integrated Food Safety Centers of Excellence aim to develop novel learning methods to educate and train the future public health workforce to investigate foodborne outbreaks. The Foodborne Outbreak Challenge (FOC) was a one-day event hosted by the Colorado Integrated Food Safety Center of Excellence at the Colorado School of Public Health. The FOC incorporated experiential, problem-based, and interdisciplinary pedagogies from case studies, simulation exercises, and public health case competitions, to deliver a novel learning experience that met the training needs of a multidisciplinary foodborne outbreak response team with diverse skills sets. The event received positive feedback, and participants demonstrated knowledge gain. Event materials are available for other institutions to use.

AB  - Large first-year biology classes, with their heavy emphasis on factual content, contribute to low student engagement and misrepresent the dynamic, interdisciplinary nature of biological science. We sought to redesign a course to deliver fundamental biology curriculum through the study of health, promote skills development, and encourage a deeper level of learning for a large, multi-section first-year class. We describe the Biological Concepts of Health course designed to encourage higher-order learning and teach oral communication and independent learning skills to large numbers of first-year students. We used the Blooming Biology Tool to determine the cognitive skills level assessed in the newly developed course and the courses it replaced. This evidence-based approach demonstrated that our new course design achieved the goal of encouraging a deeper level of cognition, and further, successfully introduced both oral communication and independent learning skills in large first-year classes.

AB  - In the particular case of Spain, student and teacher difficulties associated with the mathematical discipline have been evidenced in PISA and TEDS-M reports. As we consider that the teachers' difficulties are connected to the students' performance, we propose a multi-disciplinary approach to deliver specific didactic/mathematical knowledge to the trainee teachers. Such additional instruction shall be meaningfully connected to the real needs of the schools, so a service-learning approach is proposed here. In the present manuscript, the trainee teachers have co-designed educational escape rooms (in coordination with local schools) with the aim of mobilizing curricular knowledge. The goal of the educational escape rooms is to foster the mathematic-related competencies by establishing meaningful connections to other curricular disciplines (music-related knowledge, in the case of this study). This paper reports on the particular experience developed with a group of students (trainee teachers) while designing their educational escape rooms, focusing on the particular case of a specific student to evidence the formative potential of the procedure. The didactic suitability of the proposed escape room has been analyzed and professional development has also been discussed, showing the mobilization of relevant professional skills and fostering the related music and mathematical didactic competencies by shifting the teaching perspective from an algorithmic point of view to a more "reasoning and designing" strategy. This constitutes an evidence of the formative potential on the co-design of educational escape rooms, when designed in the frame of a service learning approach.

AB  - In order to increase student commitment from the beginning of students' university careers, the Technische Universität Darmstadt has introduced interdisciplinary study projects involving first-year students from the engineering, natural, social and history, economics and/or human sciences departments. The didactic concept includes sophisticated task design, individual responsibility and a differentiated support system. Using a self-determination theory framework, this study examined the effects of the projects based on survey findings from two projects with more than 1000 students. The results showed that the projects were successful in fulfilling students' basic psychological needs and in promoting students' academic engagement. Basic psychological needs were found to be significant predictors of academic engagement. These findings suggest that interdisciplinary study projects can potentially contribute to improving higher education as they fulfil students' basic psychological needs for competence, relatedness and autonomy and enhance students' academic engagement.

AB  - This study examines the entanglement of affects that occurred during a short episode at a science museum. The episode involved a small number of children and a teacher who had come to the museum in the context of a school field trip. It took place inside an exhibit called 'Hmong House', which reproduced various components of a traditional house of the Hmong people. A key aim of this paper is to trace, via the microethnographic analysis of a brief video recording, an affective journey meshing mathematical tessellation and Hmong shamanism. In addition, we elaborate on ways in which disparate themes, such as tessellation and shamanism, became interwoven in the life of those visiting the Hmong House at the time. The episode of the Hmong House may inspire other activities in which students or visitors, with life trajectories partially rooted in Indigenous cultures, can share practices that are foreign to other students. The most important qualities of these activities, we suggest, are the respectful dignity with which they are demonstrated and engaged with, and the freedom to undertake interdisciplinary journeys -- without subjection to artificial disciplinary boundaries -- in which improvisation and surprising turns are expected and ever-present.

AB  - In response to a request from a campus student organization, faculty from three fields came together to develop and teach an integrated interdisciplinary course on water issues and social activism. This course, "Water as Life, Death, and Power," brought together topics from the fields of anthropology, biology and chemistry to explore water rights, access to clean water, and water treatment methods. Students enrolled in the course developed projects related to a variety of local and global water issues to present real-world solutions at a university-wide student research showcase. This article describes how we organized the learning community, composed of students, faculty, and staff, and outlines the training process of developing a sense of community, content integration, and interdisciplinary teaching techniques.

AB  - Most science curricular reform efforts are designed by administrators or science education experts. It is less common for teachers to work collaboratively across disciplines to create, implement, and disseminate an integrated STEM curriculum developed for noncollege-bound students that ended up being popular across student populations at the school. The integrated Geometry in Construction curriculum was developed 12 years ago and has since been adopted by over 425 schools across the United States. This intrinsic case study describes the experiences and perceptions of two high school teachers (one in mathematics and one in industrial science/engineering) as they achieved agency to initiate a deep and sustained reform effort. Drawing on the theory of teacher agency, the factors motivating the teachers to enact their beliefs about students and teaching are described. As a result of increased professional agency (driven by professional discontentment, willingness to take risks, and encouragement by mentors), these two teachers (a) cogenerated integrated engineering-math curriculum with one another and their students and (b) addressed the needs of their community for affordable housing.

AB  - Despite decades of effort to broaden participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), many fields remain demographically skewed. Marginalized and minoritized people are still underrepresented in and underserved by the sciences. In this paper, the author considers the question, "How do we improve representation in STEM?" by reflecting on his own journey and themes such as imposter syndrome, decentering, meritocracy, and activism. Importantly, "underrepresentation" is not a mysterious happenstance but rather a predictable outcome of systemic inequity and systematic exclusion. By attending to the mechanisms of oppression, we can enact interventions that address root causes instead of symptoms. There are multiple ways that our research, teaching, and practice might change "the system" by making inclusion and equity the focus of our work, applying these principles to frame research questions and interpret findings, and adopting methods and practices that are inclusive and equitable.

AB  - We consider the philosophical and pedagogical aspects of "man-labour" system and justify its interdisciplinarity. On the basis of results of scientific researches the need for an objective systematization and specialization in pedagogy is emphasized. Four areas of education sciences systematization, proposed by Z. Vyatrovsky are analyzed. Particular attention is paid to the problems of the dialectical relationship of labour pedagogy, labour psychology and vocational pedagogy in globalization and integration processes. In this context prognostic significance of research aimed at dynamic development of "man-labour" system in the information and technology community is revealed.

AB  - Research into differentiation and profiling of knowledge producing institutions through the lenses of institutional logics and field embeddedness have proliferated in recent years. By discussing this process in the context of research groups, as those basic units in which knowledge production epistemically and practically takes place, this article offers a contribution to the theoretical discussion on organisational differentiation. Based on a small-N comparative case study of research groups operating in different national and organisational contexts on a single, highly competitive and interdisciplinary applied sciences field, nanosciences, the article proposes research group profiles as heuristic devices to explore both the embeddedness and strategic agency of research groups.

AB  - The "collegium" learning community teaches mid-career graduate students intentionally to prepare for and create learning opportunities for their undergraduate students, what the authors call "teaching on purpose." The design addresses the lack of alignment between research on learning and preparation of faculty for teaching, supports graduate students' development as scholars, primes them for responsible participation in a multidisciplinary campus community, and introduces teaching as a field of inquiry. Case studies demonstrate that participants' pedagogies moved from assumptions to theories and from anecdotes to evidence and prepared them to become advocates for teaching change. This effective and transferable collegium model can bridge the divide between the science and application of learning.

AB  - Multidisciplinary lab experiments combining microfluidics, nanoparticle synthesis, and characterization are presented. These experiments rely on the implementation of affordable yet efficient microfluidic setups based on perfluoroalkoxyalkane (PFA) capillary coils and standard HPLC connectors in upper undergraduate chemistry laboratories. Fundamental principles and concepts as well as practical tips for the rapid deployment of microfluidics are presented. In-line membrane separation, the segmented-flow regime, high-temperature experiments, and in-line analytical techniques are illustrated by the preparation of inorganic nanoparticles (silver, gold, and cadmium selenide or telluride) in microreactors. Besides microfluidics, analytical techniques for nanoparticle analysis are also illustrated.

AB  - We describe the impact of a hybrid Earth and space science course, taught online and complemented by a 2-hour face-to-face lab, on the science teaching self-efficacy of elementary preservice teachers over a 3-year span. Guided by the two overarching objectives of engaging students in the content and increasing their comfort level with teaching science, we designed and implemented a writing-to-learn assignment on the importance of science teaching (for four semesters) and a lesson plan with demonstration on common children's misconceptions in Earth and space science (for two semesters). In the last two semesters, the specific assignment was dropped to accommodate increased enrollment. Pre- and post-STEBI-B (Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument) results show a consistent increase in the students' personal science teaching efficacy scores and no change in the students' science teaching outcome expectancy scores that did not change when the semester-long assignment was dropped. Content learning, as measured using the average scores of four proctored exams and final course grades, was also independent of the type of activity and its presence or absence. These results suggest that a hybrid Earth and space science course is a viable mechanism to improve the personal self-efficacy for science teaching of this cohort of students.

AB  - This paper describes the structure and the underlying rationale of a new course dedicated to capability maturity model integration (CMMI)-directed design of wireless sensor networks (WSNs)-based biomedical applications that stresses: 1) engineering-, medico-engineering-, and informatics-related issues; 2) design for general- and special-purpose systems; and 3) the creation of synergistic effects that enable formation of entrepreneurial multidisciplinary teams able to organize and implement the development of these health-related pervasive computing applications. Formal education so far still focuses on treating only strictly separated and specialized topic areas. However, as the need for cooperation and mutual learning between students oriented toward different fields grows, the need for a multidisciplinary educational approach becomes more and more important. For a technical education to be complete, it is no longer enough to train scientists and engineers solely in technical areas. In development and implementation of technology-driven applications, multidisciplinary issues should be properly addressed in the academic sense. The interdisciplinary understanding and synergy achieved are tested through examinations and workshops. The transdisciplinary knowledge improvement is also statistically evaluated, using a system of metrics developed experimentally. (Contains 9 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - The energy concept is one of the most important ideas for students to understand. Looking at phenomena through the lens of energy provides powerful tools to model, analyse and predict phenomena in the scientific disciplines. The cross-disciplinary nature of the energy concept enables students to look at phenomena from different angles, helping them to develop a more integrated understanding of science. In this article we will discuss the role of four key ideas about the energy concept that students need to understand, namely energy transformation, transfer, degradation and conservation. Based on research showing that students progress from an initial understanding of energy transformation and transfer, through understanding degradation to finally understanding conservation, we will propose a teaching sequence that may help to successively build an integrated understanding of energy throughout physics instruction based on these key ideas.

AB  - The aim of this research is to examine the effect of STEAM (STEM + Arts) education, which is an interdisciplinary approach that has been frequently used in developed countries in recent years, on the science course learning outcomes of students with specific learning disabilities. The model of the research was structured as a mixed design and was realized with an explanatory sequential design. In this context, the research took place in two separate interactive stages. In the first stage, a quantitative method was applied. In this section, a one-group pretest--posttest pre-experimental model was used. The research was carried out with 4 students who were studying in a state primary school in a province in the Southern Region of Anatolia and who were diagnosed with specific learning disabilities. As data collection tools, an academic achievement test and STEAM process rubric were used. Means and standard deviations were used in the analysis of the data collected from the pretest, posttest, persistence test and rubrics. In the qualitative section of the study, interviews were conducted with the participants in order to evaluate STEAM education in the light of the quantitative stage, and diaries were kept for the participants in the context of a more in-depth and objective examination of the process. The data collected by qualitative data tools were subjected to content analysis and direct quotations were made from the opinions and diaries of the participants. As a result of the research, it was determined that the quantitative findings overlapped with the qualitative findings. It was observed that the STEAM activities increased the academic success of the participants, that their motivation was high, and that they were curious and eager for the activities. In addition, it was revealed that they made an effort to use the knowledge and experience they had gained from the STEAM activities in other courses.

AB  - The focus of this research was to test the impact of an authentic science experience on preservice teachers' self-efficacy and their beliefs about their perceived outcomes with middle level students. Data show that there was a statistically significant decrease in the levels of self-efficacy towards teaching science and no significant change in their beliefs about having positive outcomes. Three institutions (a university, a local park district and a school district) formed a partnership with the mission of enhancing science learning for middle school students. The pre-service teachers examined artifacts discovered during an archeological dig of a chair factory and created inter-disciplinary units based on the artifacts during science methods courses. Pre-service teachers then taught these units to 4th graders, when they visited the park.

AB  - In order to create professional development experiences, curriculum materials, and policies that support elementary school teachers to embed computational thinking (CT) in their teaching, researchers and teacher educators must understand ways teachers see CT as connecting to their classroom practices. We interviewed 12 elementary school teachers, probing their understanding six components of CT (abstraction, algorithmic thinking, automation, debugging, decomposition, and generalization) and how those components relate to their math and science teaching. Results suggested that teachers saw stronger connections between CT and their mathematics instruction than between CT and their science instruction. We also found that teachers draw upon their existing knowledge of CT-related terminology to make connections to their math and science instruction that could be leveraged in professional development. Teachers were, however, concerned about bringing CT into teaching due to limited class time and the difficulties of addressing high level CT thinking in developmentally appropriate ways. We discuss these results and their implications future research and the design of curriculum and professional development.

AB  - The C4 Scholar Program (Cross Curricular Career Community) is an interdisciplinary, multi-semester learning community for first-year developmental students at a comprehensive midwestern state university. Faculty members from two units, Retention & Student Success and Arts and Sciences, created the program to address a persistent gap in retention between developmental and non-developmental first-year students. This article provides a description of the pilot phase and an explanation of how the ensuing comparative analysis led to adoption of a program framework based on business management literature. The framework, which was implemented with the next two cohorts, contributed to strong comparative gains in performance and retention.

AB  - To recruit underrepresented students with demonstrated financial need into STEM disciplines, Lock Haven University established the interdisciplinary Nano Scholars Program, offering National Science Foundation-funded scholarships, academic support, and social support. Small cohort sizes, a student-led science learning community (the Nano Club), and mentored undergraduate research fostered academic and cocurricular student engagement. Nano Scholars outperformed matched control peers on overall GPA, average number of credits per semester, graduation in 4 years, and graduate school placement rates. A comprehensive program fostering engagement through individualized attention, a robust learning community, meaningful research opportunities, and peer and alumni support is essential.

AB  - Science often takes a back burner to English Language Arts (ELA) and Math. With ELA and Math being tested from early years and school funding relying on each, many teachers are pushed by administrators to spend as much time as possible on those two subjects. During the authors' years as classroom teachers and professional development providers, they have attempted to find creative ways to make sure that students experience the joy, wonder, and excitement of science "through" other content areas--for their sense of responsibility to their students and per their administrators' requests. Learners have to talk "about something," listen "about something," read "about something," and write "about something." The authors' thinking and practice centers around making "that something" be science. In this article, the authors share their process of cross-curricular design via a lesson about forces. They have implemented this lesson with their K-2 and 3-5 students and teacher-learners. The content is relatable and comprehensible to teachers across grade levels. This lesson serves as an example of the process the authors follow for all their science and ELA lessons.

AB  - Many major funding organizations, policymakers, government agencies, and other higher education stakeholders want higher education to encourage interdisciplinary learning so that students graduate with the requisite skills to take on complex jobs in science, policy, business, and industry. Calls for this kind of change have been most urgent within the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields; they are key to America's capacity to maintain its global economic position, yet their enrollments have been shrinking in recent years. Studies have demonstrated that students with exposure to interdisciplinary learning experiences tend to be retained as majors, as well as gaining preparation for successful careers and life in the 21st century. Project Kaleidoscope (PKAL) has been looking at systemic ways to create interdisciplinary teaching and learning environments. Like the National Academies report, PKAL thinks that campuses across the country have not created environments hospitable to interdisciplinarity. In this article, the authors highlight research conducted on one of the major projects facilitated by PKAL: Facilitating Interdisciplinary Learning (FIDL), funded by the W.M. Keck foundation. This project is among the largest to examine the facilitation of interdisciplinary learning. The authors report on the lessons learned from this initiative in how to bring interdisciplinary learning to scale. First, they briefly review the institutionalization theory that they used to frame their findings. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - This paper presents the findings from a qualitative study exploring students' perceptions of what constitutes technological knowledge. Technological knowledge dimensions from previous literature do not seem to be student-led, but rather suggested by the authors. It is therefore important to incorporate student views in order to create a more evidence-based taxonomy. Previous taxonomies of technological knowledge are also heavily linked to engineering-related disciplines, however definitions for use across the field of education and learning technologies would be helpful. In this study, a sample of student volunteers were interviewed about their understanding of technology enhanced learning and technological knowledge. The students were from a range of disciplines, not just engineering and science, so that technology knowledge for the general student population would be represented. An inductive thematic analysis was then carried out on the interview transcripts. Three knowledge types were derived from the thematic analysis: practical knowledge; structural knowledge; and computer science knowledge. These three empirically-derived technological dimensions were then mapped onto existing taxonomical structures from the literature. Finally, this paper discusses the implications of the student-generated dimensions for educators.

AB  - This essay analyzes and develops recent views about explanation in biology. Philosophers of biology have parted with the received deductive-nomological model of scientific explanation primarily by attempting to capture actual biological theorizing and practice. This includes an endorsement of different kinds of explanation (e.g., mathematical and causal-mechanistic), a joint study of discovery and explanation, and an abandonment of models of theory reduction in favor of accounts of explanatory reduction. Of particular current interest are philosophical accounts of complex explanations that appeal to different levels of organismal organization and use contributions from different biological disciplines. The essay lays out one model that views explanatory integration across different disciplines as being structured by scientific problems. I emphasize the philosophical need to take the explanatory aims pursued by different groups of scientists into account, as explanatory aims determine whether different explanations are competing or complementary and govern the dynamics of scientific practice, including interdisciplinary research. I distinguish different kinds of pluralism that philosophers have endorsed in the context of explanation in biology, and draw several implications for science education, especially the need to teach science as an interdisciplinary and dynamic practice guided by scientific problems and explanatory aims.

AB  - In recent years, there has been upsurge of interest in the applications of interdisciplinary perspectives on science in science education. Within this framework, the implications of the so-called "economics of science" is virtually an uncharted territory. In this paper, we trace a set of arguments that provide a dialectic engagement with two conflicting agendas: (a) the broadening of science education to include the contextual positioning of science including economical dimensions of science, and (b) the guarding of the proliferation and reinforcement of those aspects of economics of science such as commodification of scientific knowledge that embraces inequity and restricted access to the products of the scientific enterprise. Our aim is broadly to engage, as science education researchers, in the debates in economics of science so as to investigate the reciprocal interactions that might exist with science education. In so doing, we draw out some recommendations whereby the goals of science education might provide as much input into the intellectual debates within philosophy of science on issues related to the commercialisation and commodification of scientific knowledge. We explore some implications of commodification of science in the context of modelling and argumentation in science education.

AB  - In writing science summaries, student writers frequently borrow language fragments from source texts. While taking a text's ideas verbatim is commonly considered a failure in writers' expected use of their own words or even plagiarism, imitating "linguistic chunks" from skilled speakers is also an effective practice in language development. This study argues for the need to investigate textual borrowing (TB) from a developmental perspective. A total of 956 U.S. upper-elementary and middle school L1 students were administered a reading comprehension test, a written summary task, and a receptive academic language assessment. Multiple indices were generated to capture TB frequency, length, and one particular function of TB (i.e., definitions). Results revealed that 68% of summaries contained at least one incidence of TB. As expected, both TB frequency and length were negatively associated with reading comprehension and academic language skills. However, students in higher grades demonstrated significantly more and longer TB in comparison to their younger counterparts when summarizing the same passage. In addition, the frequency of borrowed word strings and the ratio of definitional borrowing were positively associated with summary writing quality, and the latter association was found to be stronger for students with higher academic language skills. Implications for pedagogy and future research are discussed. [For the corresponding grantee submission, see ED614239.]

AB  - Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education has become an international priority. STEM education provides students with interdisciplinary knowledge and promotes the cultivation of high-level skills. However, STEM training opportunities for teachers are rare, which results in fewer opportunities for primary and secondary students to receive high-quality engineering education. Novel Engineering is an innovative strategy to integrate engineering and literacy in STEM education. To this end, the researchers developed, implemented and evaluated a novel engineering STEM software program based on the story of Robinson Crusoe. A quasi-experimental single-group pre- and posttest research method was adopted. A total of 72 students in two seventh grade classes at a junior middle school in Shanghai participated in the study. Data were collected and analysed through STEM learning interest scales, flow status scales, interviews and students' STEM work scores. The research findings demonstrated that students gave a high evaluation of the novel engineering STEM software program. Furthermore, this STEM software program contributed to students' significant improvements in the attitudes of mathematics and 21st century skill and provided students with a lasting and better flow experience. Finally, suggestions were proposed for STEM software design, implementation and evaluation.

AB  - Epistemic Insight is a research and education initiative that is seeking to establish effective ways to help school students to appreciate the power and limitations of science. In particular, the idea is that experiences and explanations devised by a teacher who is focused on what happens inside the science classroom might not be interpreted as intended by students--who in turn are "generalists" moving from subject to subject and in and out of school.

AB  - The use of big data in smart cities poses new questions about higher education and community-university engagement practices in addressing longstanding social and economic exclusion in urban communities. Drawing on transdisciplinary ideas in higher education, cultural theory, and science and technology studies, primary concerns in the era of big data are considered with current conceptualizations of higher education engagement and anchor institution purposes. Tensions in the narratives of civic engagement and democratic practice for community well-being are juxtaposed with tensions in the smart citizen narrative implied by the idealized smart city design. A new framing of community-university relations under what I term "hyper-local" engagement is suggested for more justice-oriented and democratic practices when universities interact with their surrounding communities given the impending and sweeping changes occurring from the use of big data in social policy.

AB  - Experience working in multidisciplinary teams is important both to prepare Computer Science (CS) students for industry and to improve their communication with teammates from disciplines other than their own. This article describes the evolution and results of collaborations among three courses: an undergraduate CS course about user interface design and implementation, an undergraduate Scientific and Technical Communication (STC) course about usability and instructions writing, and a graduate CS/Human Factors course about user-interface evaluation and usability testing. Students from all three courses work with scientists to complete the scientist-sponsored citizen science Android applications (apps). Students from the undergraduate CS and STC courses form multidisciplinary teams to design and implement apps, while the graduate students consult with the teams by evaluating and user-testing the apps. The collaboration's effectiveness was assessed using student surveys, interviews, and evaluations of student work. This article compares the collaboration within the teams and the coordination with the scientists across two years of activities in order to determine the effectiveness of course modifications. The article concludes with recommendations for improving the collaboration within teams and the coordination with clients in multidisciplinary course projects.

AB  - This paper reviews university-level efforts to improve understanding of anthropogenic global climate change (AGCC) through curricula that enable student scientific inquiry. We examined 152 refereed publications and proceedings from academic conferences and selected 26 cases of inquiry learning that overcome specific challenges to AGCC teaching. This review identifies both the strengths and weaknesses of each of these case studies. It is the first to go beyond examining the impact of specific inquiry instructional approaches to offer a synthesis of cases. We find that inquiry teaching can succeed by concretising scientific processes, providing access to global data and evidence, imparting critical and higher order thinking about AGCC science/policy and contextualising learning with places and scientific facts. We recommend educational researchers and scientists collaborate to create and refine curricula that utilise geospatial technologies, climate models and communication technologies to bring students into contact with scientists, climate data and authentic AGCC research processes. Many available science education technologies and curricula also require further research to maximise trade-offs between implementation and training costs and their educational value.

AB  - Background: Blending collaborative learning and project-based learning (PBL) based on Wolff (2003) design categories, students interacted in a learning environment where they developed their technology integration practices as well as their technological and collaborative skills. Purpose: The study aims to understand how seventh grade students perceive a collaborative web-based science project in light of Wolff's design categories. The goal of the project is to develop their technological and collaborative skills, to educate them about technology integration practices, and to provide an optimum collaborative, PBL experience. Sample: Seventh grade students aged 12-14 (n = 15) were selected from a rural K-12 school in Turkey through purposeful sampling. Design and methods: The current study applied proactive action research since it focused on utilizing a new way to enhance students' technological and collaborative skills and to demonstrate technology integration into science coursework. Data were collected qualitatively through interviews, observation forms, forum archives, and website evaluation rubrics. Results: The results found virtual spaces such as online tutorials, forums, and collaborative and communicative tools to be beneficial for collaborative PBL. The study supported Wolff's design features for a collaborative PBL environment, applying features appropriate for a rural K-12 school setting and creating a digitally-enriched environment. As the forum could not be used as effectively as expected because of school limitations, more flexible spaces independent of time and space were needed. Conclusions: This study's interdisciplinary, collaborative PBL was efficient in enhancing students' advanced technological and collaborative skills, as well as exposing them to practices for integrating technology into science. The study applied design features for a collaborative PBL environment with certain revisions.

AB  - Improving the mathematical skills of undergraduate Engineering and Information Technology (EIT) students has been an enduring challenge for educators. Lecturers continually implement new strategies that try to overcome the challenges encountered in teaching university students with varying levels of success being encountered. This paper provides insight into how educators have handled the challenges students face in their mathematics learning journey. In addition, the paper highlights some of the methods used to improve the performance of these students as problem solvers, as well as the development and implementation of creative techniques that may have made the situation more successful and less challenging. The literature was searched through using a structured literature review approach based on the primary databases: Scopus; the Education Research Complete (ERC); and the Education Resources Information Centre (ERIC). This study followed the three main steps of a systematic literature review: retrieval, selection, and analysis of the literature. Analysis of the literature showed that there is still a need to further develop and deliver innovative pedagogical strategies for teaching mathematics to EIT students. It is recommended that an interdisciplinary approach, inclusive of technology, will lead to increased understanding, improve performance and, ultimately, enhance student satisfaction.

AB  - This article outlines the 'Big Ideas' approach to curriculum reform, as applied in the 'Principles and Big Ideas of Science Education' project. A critical analysis follows of the outcomes of the University of Exeter's 'Identifying Principles and Big Ideas for Religious Education' project, which sought to apply the same approach to Religious Education (RE) in English schools. This project made great headway in generating 'Big Ideas' to inform and improve the selection and sequencing of RE curriculum content. However, its primary focus on subject content knowledge means that 'Big Ideas' about epistemology and methodology are lacking. The article recommends an additional focus on multi-disciplinary, multi-methodological, inquiry-based, reflexive learning, which would ask why, how, where and by whom our 'knowledge' of religion(s) and worldview(s) is generated. In this regard, the article posits four 'Big Ideas about the study of religion(s) and worldview(s)' to highlight the symbiotic relationship between knowledge and knower, and to reject the false dichotomy between the object of study and method of study. In so doing, it draws upon the theoretical framework underpinning the 'RE-searchers approach' to primary school RE, which correspondingly exemplifies how such ideas can be taught in practice.

AB  - Purpose: This paper reflects on the Sustainability Research Symposium (SRS), a long-term student-led initiative (seven years) at McGill University in Montréal, Canada, that seeks to foster interdisciplinary dialogue among students and researchers by using the sustainability sciences as a bridge concept. The purpose of this study is to explore the effectiveness of the SRS in fostering sustainability literacy. Design/methodology/approach: Past participants of the SRS were invited to complete a survey to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of the symposia from a participants' perspective. A mix of descriptive statistics and axial and thematic coding were used to analyze survey responses (n = 56). This study links theory and practice to explore the outcomes of symposia as tools for students to engage with sustainability research in university campuses. Findings: Survey findings indicated that participants are from multiple disciplinary backgrounds and that they are often interested in sustainability research without being identified as sustainability researchers. Overall, the survey findings suggested that student-organized symposia can be effective mechanisms to enhance exposure to interdisciplinary research and to integrate sustainability sciences outside the classroom. Practical implications: Despite being a one-day event, the survey findings suggest that symposia can offer an "initiation" toward interdisciplinary dialogue and around sustainability research that can have lasting impacts beyond the time frame of the event. Originality/value: Although research symposia are widespread in university campuses, there is little published information on the effectiveness of student-organized symposia as vectors for sustainability literacy. This original contribution presents a case study of the effectiveness of an annual symposium at one Canadian university, organized by students from the Faculties of Science, Arts and Management.

AB  - In this essay, Quentin Wheeler-Bell aims to reframe recent attempts to rethink the core principles of critical pedagogy. He argues that these attempts have been unsuccessful because they reproduce a deeper problem -- specifically, an identity crisis -- within critical pedagogy. The source of this problem, he contends, is that those working in this tradition have, over time, become more distant from and forgetful of its roots in critical theory; as a result, critical pedagogy is now in a state of dilution and fragmentation in which critical pedagogues are unable to bring the plurality of critical education approaches together theoretically around a set of shared principles. In order to address this problem and begin to reframe the core principles of critical pedagogy, Wheeler-Bell first briefly sketches the debates around Max Horkheimer's classic essay "Critical Theory and Traditional Theory," focusing on why critical theory grew into an interdisciplinary tradition situated between philosophy and social science. Then he explains why the recent attempts to rethink critical pedagogy rely upon a problematic, albeit dominant, narrative of the critical education tradition -- a narrative that only tacitly recognizes a connection between critical education and critical theory. This dominant narrative contributes to the identity crisis within critical education because it supports a collective memory loss regarding the importance of both philosophy and social science to critical theory. Finally, Wheeler-Bell attempts to develop a thin definition of critical education: one that connects critical education back to its roots in critical theory, while respecting the plurality of critical education approaches.

AB  - This study has been conducted to investigate the opinions of mathematics teacher candidates on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) training and the activities designed by them. It has been carried out using the case study method, which is one of the qualitative research patterns. In this study, semi-structured interview forms and activity cards have been used to gather data. While semi-structured interview forms served to elicit teacher candidates' opinions on STEM, activity cards were employed to ask them to design an activity in which they could put their training on STEM into practice. The study has been conducted with 34 senior mathematics education students and the data obtained have been analyzed using the content analysis method. It has been concluded that mathematics teacher candidates have positive views on STEM training. The activities designed by the candidate teachers can be categorized under four categories, which are interdisciplinary, the engineering field it is related to, the preferred method and the activities that are not suitable for STEM. Teacher candidates should be trained on how to integrate STEM education into their lessons. Stem activity examples should be presented to teacher candidates for applicability.

AB  - Purpose: This article aims at presenting the original design of the teaching of Economic and Social Sciences (SES) in the French High School and at demonstrating that the issue of pluralism lies at the core of the various controversies surrounding it since its creation. Approach: This article is based on more than 40 interviews with SES teachers and key personalities, on curricula and official reports analyses and on a ten years participating observation in the SES teachers professional association. Findings: This text strives to display how the defense of pluralism has become a core issue to SES teachers, as a "mobilized group" as well as in their individual professional practices. Research implications: Such statements may be deepen in two directions. The first consists in comparing the French situation to that in other countries as regards the teaching of economics and social sciences in high school. The second may imply to investigate deeper about teachers' training and practices about such issues. Practical implications: The other aim of this text is raising debates about the objectives of teaching economics and social sciences in general in high school in a context where school is more and more committed to strengthening citizenship as well as preparing for higher education and professional life.

AB  - With the development of a strong bioeconomy sector related to the creation of next-generation biorefineries, heterogeneous catalysis is receiving renewed attention. Indeed, catalysis is at the core of biorefinery design, and many new catalysts and catalytic processes are being developed. On the one hand, they are based on knowledge acquired during the last century to efficiently upgrade fossil resources. On the other hand, they take advantage of the opportunity of having new substrates on which novel conversion technologies, derived from recent fundamental advances and new concepts developed in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, can be tested and applied. In this context, there is a global trend for establishing new courses throughout the world to train students and professionals in the bioeconomy/biorefinery sector. Such courses encompass many different fields in a multidisciplinary approach, including agronomy, logistics, life cycle assessment, biotechnologies, process design, economics, and, obviously, chemistry. For the last of these, a specific important role is given to catalysis, and more especially to heterogeneous catalysis. Such courses need to explain the basics of each scientific field involved before giving concrete examples of research/development. Among them, the aforementioned heterogeneous catalysis is an especially complex scientific field in which surface science, spectroscopy, thermodynamics, and other disciplines are intimately interwoven. While many references presenting specific aspects of catalysis can be found, concise documents encompassing all of the angles of this very rich field--including its most recent developments and prospects, aimed at a readership already trained in chemistry--are scarce. This paper gives a global and simple "heterogeneous catalysis tour" to explain in a concise way what heterogeneous catalysis is without going into too much detail. The students who would like to know more about some specific aspects will find useful authoritative references in the text, making this paper a good introduction to all aspects of heterogeneous catalysis.

AB  - In higher education, case studies can be utilized to have students put themselves into problems faced by a protagonist and, by doing so, address academic or career-related issues. Working through these issues provides students with an opportunity to gain applied perspective and experiences. Professors in higher education who choose this method of teaching require navigational tools to ensure that students achieve stated learning objectives. "Case Study Methodology in Higher Education" is an essential research publication that focuses on the history and theories relating to case study methodology including techniques for writing case studies and utilizing them in university settings to prepare students for real-life career-related scenarios. This publication features a wide range of topics such as educational leadership, case writing, and teacher education. It is essential for educators, career professionals, higher education faculty, researchers, and students. This book contains the following chapters: (1) Case Study: Defining and Differentiating Among Types of Case Studies (Susanna Tardi); (2) Types of Case Studies (Pam Epler); (3) Using Case Studies in the Higher Education Classroom: Case Studies in Higher Education -- What's the Big Idea?

AB  - Technological fields, like engineering, are in desperate need of more qualified workers, yet not enough students are pursuing studies in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) that would prepare them for technical careers. Unfortunately, many students have no interest in STEM careers, particularly engineering, because they are not exposed to topics in these fields during their K-12 studies. Most K-12 teachers have not been trained to integrate relevant STEM topics into their classroom teaching and curriculum materials. This article explores best practices for bringing engineering into the science and mathematics curriculum of secondary school classrooms by describing a project that utilizes concepts representing the merger of medicine, robotics, and information technology. Specific examples demonstrating the integration into the teaching of physics, biology, and chemistry are provided. Also considered are the critical issues of professional development for classroom teachers, improved preparation of future teachers of STEM, and the development of curriculum materials that address state and national content standards.

AB  - Many mathematics educators are not aware of a strong connection that exists between the education of computer programming and mathematics. The reason may be that they have not been exposed to computer programming. This connection is worth exploring, given the current trends of automation and Industry 4.0. Therefore, in this paper we take a closer look at the Common Core's eight Mathematical Practice Standards. We show how each one of them can be reinforced through computer programming. The following discussion is virtually independent of the choice of a concrete programming language. Therefore, in the interest of simplicity, we will use a well-known educational programming language named Karel the Robot based on (Pattis, 1995) which is freely available online in NCLab (NCLab, 2019). The visual character of this language will allow us to provide more illustrative examples than would be possible with a standard programming language such as Java, C++ or Python.

AB  - Purpose: Interdisciplinarity is necessary to explain or solve complex problems and questions of today's world. Therefore, it's important to analyze the situation within an educational institution to get to know what students think about interdisciplinary work. The purpose of this paper is to try to achieve an insight into how e-learning technologies (like WebCT) are perceived by students and to what degree information and communication technologies (ICTs) could improve communication and cooperation between students. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of two online surveys and the attendance of a course, the experiences and approaches of students were analyzed. Findings: The results show that most of the students see the positive aspects of interdisciplinary interchange and the benefit of learning from each other, so most of them are open minded regarding interdisciplinarity--an important requirement is given. Information and communication technologies are a good instrument to strengthen the cooperation and communication between students and can further be a helpful device for an interdisciplinary working approach. Practical implications: Based on these findings, more accesses to interdisciplinary cooperation can be worked out especially in the master program we have analyzed which sees interdisciplinarity as one of its main goals. Knowing that the openness and readiness from students' side is given, the offer for interdisciplinary ways of interchange could be expanded. Social implications: The results show that the students are open-minded to other students' knowledge and views, which also shows the mutual acceptance and respect for other opinions. This is very important for teamwork and also for multicultural interchange on an international basis. Originality/value: Not only in social regard but also for complex questions of science and society in general the results of student's experiences and approaches are auspicious for international frameworks.

AB  - Importance of online learning has become more critical with the advent of a global pandemic. Effective online learning requires design characteristics that support learning that crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries. The example of educational delivery of food safety encompasses multiple disciplines to prepare students for real-world situations, practical problem-solving, and to be "future proof" as food safety becomes more quantitative. This study explicates how six simulation-based learning modules were evaluated, two each in microbiological growth/inactivation, food process dynamics with microbiological growth/inactivation, and risk assessment. Each group of three modules was targeted to the students in undergraduate food science and engineering programs. Altogether, the 6 modules were implemented and assessed in 17 courses at 14 universities over 5 years. The effectiveness of the module-based approach was sustained across subject matter (microbiology, process, and risk), disciplines (food science and engineering), and their implementations. Students' and instructors' survey responses indicated the modules' value in real-world and practical problem-solving ability. Instructors were also motivated to implement the modules as they saw the potential for improvement in student understanding, how modules reinforced course learning outcomes, the quality of support provided with modules, and their ability to replace existing course assessment without adding work for the instructor or the students. This self-learning, module-based approach to introduce interdisciplinary content employed has proven successful. The template for making these modules is described in sufficient detail so future modules can be built for a wide variety of subject matter beyond food safety.

AB  - The use of comics can be a powerful tool to expand educational outreach efforts for improving the health and well-being of people everywhere. Dr. Ian Williams coined the term "graphic medicine" to denote the use of comics in medical education and patient care ("Graphic Medicine"). Alzheimer's disease affects approximately five million Americans and is expected to triple to 13.8 million by 2050. Hispanics and Blacks are disproportionately affected at a higher rate than other groups ("Facts and Figures"). There is a lack of culturally relevant educational materials available for these populations. To address this disparity, an interdisciplinary community engaged collaboration was initiated with the Alzheimer's Association West Texas Chapter, The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), and Dukes Comics to produce a series of virtual workshops entitled, "Journaling and Doodling for Stress Reduction and Relaxation" for caregivers of people living with Alzheimer's and other dementias. These sessions were live-streamed and began during the COVID-19 pandemic. Spanish sessions have also been provided to the public. Health information about the disease process and common caregiver challenges are provided in each session. A guided journaling and doodling activity are also included. Journaling has been shown to be an effective and easy tool to use for stress management (Scott). The impetus behind this project was to address the dire need for increasing access to Alzheimer's disease education and resources in El Paso, Texas, a border community that is also home to Fort Bliss Army base. Hispanics comprise approximately 82% of the population and include a large Spanish-speaking segment. Language is often a barrier to health care access and education. To meet the aim of increasing accessibility, the workshops and comics are available in both English and Spanish and soon in-person. This project received a 2022 joint seed grant from Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso and UTEP to conduct research and examine data from these workshops that will be provided in-person in marginalized and multilingual Latina communities surrounding El Paso starting in the fall.
