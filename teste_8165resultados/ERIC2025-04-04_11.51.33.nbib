AB  - This study extends the extant research demonstrating the educational benefits of diversity and examines how undergraduate students across disciplinary contexts acquire a set of pluralistic skills and dispositions necessary for today's diverse workforce and society. The sample consisted of 4697 students who participated in a longitudinal study in the Fall of 2000 and Spring of 2002 at nine different public institutions. Findings from the study emphasize the importance of structural diversity in promoting positive interactions across race, which in turn produce positive indirect effects on students' intergroup learning and second-year pluralistic orientation. The study also demonstrates the varying ways in which students in different majors acquire pluralistic skills, especially students in the engineering and life sciences. The study concludes with implications for practice and policy in the wake of the affirmative action case at the University of Michigan.

AB  - The decrease in urban green spaces limits the opportunities for adults and children to experience nature and learn about the environment. Yet, it is only when children experience nature in the outdoors that they can learn best to love it and strive to preserve it. As such, the need to include biodiversity studies in the curriculum becomes a pressing demand on today's teachers. In this article, the authors describe how they established a long-term plant biodiversity study of a forested urban green space and suggest how other teachers and students could implement this study. In their study, the authors worked with middle school and high school students, both within a classroom setting and as a part of extracurricular activities. The authors found that the effectiveness was uniform across the entire spectrum of age groups and settings; the level of motivation and enthusiasm among students was very high in all groups. In this article, the author provides details of how they set up plots and initially collected data for their long-term plant biodiversity study, as well as suggestions for how such data may be analyzed. The authors also show how their project tied in with the "National Standards for Science Education" and its interdisciplinary connections. In the second part of the article, the authors highlight changes to conduct the study even with limited resources. Their guidelines can be used to set up plots in any forested green space in any school's vicinity. (Contains 5 figures and 3 tables.)

AB  - As teachers, they strive to implement imaginative, creative lessons to connect their students with the dynamic mystery of science. To help infuse curricular programs with the philosophy of learning by doing, the staff of Emerson Junior-Senior High School designed and implemented an authentic interdisciplinary project called "Research@the.River.com." Originally created in spring 2001 as a pilot program to test various mechanisms designed by the district to enhance student achievement, "Research@the.River.com" is a project-based learning metaphor geared to expanding students' creative and critical-thinking skills. The abilities of the students to use inference, develop and refine objective opinions, and employ investigative principles for cause-and-effect relationships were identified early as desired areas for improvement.

AB  - This article discusses the findings of a survey of nearly 300 computing professionals who are involved in the design and/or development of software across a variety of industries. We report on the surveyed professionals' perceptions of the importance of a range of topics and skills, and the degree to which 55 recent graduates felt that each topic or skill was emphasized in their undergraduate experience. Our findings highlight the value of breadth and flexibility in technical skills, and the universal importance of critical thinking, problem solving, on-the-job learning, and the ability to work well in cross-disciplinary teams. These findings align roughly with recommendations by the ACM/IEEE task force on computing curricula. However, the recent graduates we surveyed report inconsistent coverage of these most important areas within their degree experiences. We discuss implications for education and for future research.

AB  - This article describes a developmental systems approach to applied developmental science (ADS), which provides a framework to design and evaluate technology-rich programs that promote positive development by emphasizing the strengths and assets of young people instead of focusing on diminishing or preventing risk-taking behaviors. Until now, most of the psychoeducational programs conceived within the ADS model have not focused on the role of new technologies in young people's lives. This absence is particularly striking given that, in today's world, new technologies play an important role in different areas of the lives of young people, such as education, entertainment, socialization, and communication. This article presents the concept of identity construction environments (ICE), an interdisciplinary model that proposes guidelines to design and study new technologies purposefully created to promote positive youth development (PYD). Two types of ICE have been developed: one focusing on stand-alone technologies for learning, such as the Zora virtual city; and the other focusing on an approach for developing technologically rich learning contexts, such as the Project Inter-Actions robotics workshops. This article presents both examples of ICE and describes how their design fosters the 6 components of PYD. Initial findings from pilot studies conducted with very different populations of youth engaged in both types of ICE--such as young children, adolescents, and chronically ill children--are presented.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of introducing active methodologies in the Computer Architecture course taught in the second year of the Computer Engineering Bachelor's degree program at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Spain. The paper reports the experience from three academic years, 2011-2012, 2012-2013, and 2013-2014, in which three types of data were considered for analysis: students' dedication, as measured by time spent on the project, their marks, and their level of satisfaction. The study shows that about 86% of students are satisfied with the teaching methodology and are willing to continue using it in future courses. The study also shows that the active methodologies used contribute to the students' cross-curricular training and do not generate any great increase in student workload. Finally, a statistical analysis of the evolution of student performance showed that marks improved to a statistically significant extent after introducing active methodologies.

AB  - Since the ratification of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, both publicly traded companies and their respective financial statement auditors have struggled to comply with the requirements of the legislation. Utilizing three individual Delphi studies, separately, I surveyed partners, managers, and staff associates in the United States from each of the "Big 4" international accounting firms to ascertain from each respective group what knowledge domains and technical skills are most important in the practice of Sarbanes-Oxley-related information assurance compliance. Analysis of the data collected provided the basis for the development and subsequent implementation of a new interdisciplinary business curriculum in information assurance.

AB  - The main concern of this article is to illustrate how West Point equips future Army officers with an appreciation and understanding of cultural knowledge. A unique, multidisciplinary goal-based approach to curricular design and assessment (of students as well as the academic program) is described, focusing on the structure, process, and content of student experiences that contribute to the achievement of the cultural perspectives goal. The author reviews what the institution's assessment data are telling us about student achievement of this goal and how we use this evidence to improve the academic quality of the curriculum. And finally, the article draws informative lessons from our experience, particularly in terms of models and processes that may prove helpful for other colleges and universities throughout the United States that are striving to ensure their undergraduates acquire a robust cultural perspective.

AB  - Educational practice today encourages interdisciplinary teaching as teachers address important basic themes from a variety of angles. In this article, the author talks about one of her successful projects that focuses on "sense of place" as one such theme, with the more specific charge of viewing Earth from both scientific and artistic perspectives. The project combines satellite imagery and the technique of silk painting in batik, which allows students to record their geospatial understanding in a visual way. Here, she explains how geospatial technology can help students visually investigate Earth's surface and how art can become a vital aid in that understanding. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - This article addresses how kinesiological research on children should advance. Using the study of motor development as a backdrop, the article is divided into three sections. The first section relates the four fundamental questions in motor development that have been asked throughout its history. The second section describes four areas of advancing knowledge, primarily from other disciplinary fields, that provide new approaches or paradigms that can advance us in answering these old but relevant questions. The third section suggests that there may be new questions equally or more deserving to be answered because they have broad and applied societal implications. These new questions require interdisciplinary and translational methods that we, as a field, are uniquely able to address. (Contains 1 table, 2 figures and 3 notes.)

AB  - Over the last three decades many universities have offered various programmes related to Information Systems. However, the rapid changes in recent years demand constant evaluation and modification of education programmes. Recent challenges include, for instance, the move towards programmes that are more applied and professionally-orientated. The Bologna Declaration in Europe with its three level study structure as well as the increasing pressure to ensure funding within most departments adds further pressure to many universities. Despite attempts being made to provide reference to curricula and guidelines, many universities and faculties struggle with the proper direction and design of the information systems curricula. Common reference curricula related to information systems are, for example: the IS 2002; Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in information systems; the MSIS 2000: Model Curriculum and Guidelines for Graduate Degree Programs in Information Systems. Although these guidelines have existed for many years, many discussions and disagreements exist on the content and direction of information systems curricula and information systems as a discipline. Recently a joint task force of the Association for Computing Machinery and Association of Information Systems is aiming at revising the IS 2002 undergraduate curriculum (Topi et al., 2007). At the same time we are experiencing decreasing enrolments in information system programmes worldwide (Granger, Dick, Luftman, Slyke, & Watson, 2007). This article views information systems study programmes from an engineering perspective and presents a framework for structuring information systems programmes within Europe. We amalgamated the IS 2002 and MSIS 2000 model curriculum with a recommendation for studying business informatics, published from the German Society for Informatics (Gesellschaft fur Informatik, 2003). The framework was used to identify differences between selected study programmes currently in place for information systems curricula. For the study we selected two historically different educational systems: the United Kingdom and Ireland as representative for the Anglophone area and Germany, Austria, and Switzerland as representative of a continental European approach. We collected data from 20 Universities and classified the studied subject areas along our framework. Our results show that even in the context of the Bologna Declaration and common credit transfer systems, the study programmes nationally and internationally remain very diverse. Indeed, this makes comparisons between study programmes difficult to ascertain. The analysis reveals indications that the controversy in information systems is often due to two related but fundamentally diverse streams, one being a technology and engineering-orientated focus and the other being a business- and management-orientated emphasis. The relatively strong inclusion of engineering principles appears to be typical for business informatics degrees, emphasizing both mathematics and structural science. Logistics, accounting, and economics are specific courses which are common to most business informatics curricula. The study led to the development and accreditation of a business informatics study programme at Dublin City University. In this article we summarize the curriculum and present experiences made during the accreditation process. Indeed the accreditation process confirmed our earlier result , that information systems have two fundamentally different streams: technology and managerial orientation. This programme was introduced in September 2006, with a relative low number of students enrolling in the programme, and we report on experiences made during the last two years of running the programme. Graduates from this programme were all recruited into related employment. Furthermore, practitioners confirmed the career relevant curriculum. Due to this success, we expect increased attractiveness of the programme. However, the lack of adequate funding to market and promote the degree could impact on the enrollment numbers of the degree. The final curriculum comprises a balanced and interdisciplinary structure that centers on engineering principles and focuses on transformation, models and methods. The engineering emphasis throughout the programme is seen as one important characteristic. This differentiates the proposed programme from other management oriented information systems degrees. Therefore the business informatics approach appears to us to be innovative with regard to its interdisciplinary character. Furthermore the engineering perspective and the integration of cultural studies and practical experiences in an international setting equip graduates with unique and career oriented capabilities. The paper concludes that business informatics is not just a new term, but instead offers an engineering oriented stream on information systems. As such, business informatics can complement the traditional managerial oriented study programmes. (Contains 3 tables.

AB  - The digital revolution is upon us, bringing with it disruptive forces in every aspect of business and personal interactions. The business marketing function has become so technologically driven it is sometimes hard to tell where the boundaries between the Marketing and Information Systems disciplines lie. The new world of digital marketing has changed how both marketing and technology professionals approach their jobs. Digital has created new roles, and much of what we knew and taught in higher education is no longer viable. New hybrid education programs are required to equip the new generation of workers with the skills they need to be successful. While marketing and information systems and technology education programs will undoubtedly continue to exist as separate entities, there are opportunities for cross pollination between the two disciplines. Just as corporate enterprises will need to embrace this new way of doing business if they are to be successful, so too will academic enterprises need to incorporate new methods and new ideas into their offerings if they are to remain competitive with their peer institutions. This paper explores the concept of how this new digital world has transformed the marketing function, the impact it has on the consumerization of information technology, and how higher education will have to respond. Digital has arrived, and it is here to stay.

AB  - Investigating and understanding novel antibacterial agents is a necessary task as there is a constant increase in the number of multidrug-resistant bacterial species. The use of nanotechnology to combat drug-resistant bacteria is an important research area. The laboratory experiment described herein demonstrates that changes in the nanostructure of a material lead to significantly different antibacterial efficacies. Silver has been known to be an effective antibacterial agent throughout history, but its therapeutic uses are limited when present as either the bulk material or cations in solution. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)and DNA-templated silver nanoclusters (DNA-AgNCs) are both nanostructured silver materials that show vastly different antibacterial activities when incubated with "E. coli" in liquid culture. This work aims to provide students with hands-on experience in the synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials and basic microbiology skills; moreover, it is applicable to undergraduate and graduate curricula.

AB  - Teachers' lack of knowledge abound computational thinking (CT) and limited opportunities to incorporate CT in existing curricula pose unique challenges at the elementary level. Despite the crucial role of professional development (PD) in preparing elementary school teachers to integrate CT in classroom instruction, there is little research documenting PD programs that focus on integration in literacy and mathematics compared to other subject areas. In this work, we present a PD program that integrates CT with disciplinary content to support teachers as they integrate CT with literacy and mathematics in elementary school classrooms. Using data from multiple sources, we present findings from two case studies to examine the impact of PD on teachers' integration of CT with content in lesson planning and implementation. Findings have implications related to the integration of CT in elementary school and teacher PD.

AB  - It is well-known that the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model has a family of periodic orbits, but does not possess limit cycles and therefore the model is said to be structurally unstable. The Lotka-Volterra model is a special case of a much larger group namely the quadratic population models and it can be shown that none of them can produce limit cycles. The surprising finding is that by combining two quadratic models a quadratic population model with two limit cycles is uncovered. Although the model looks simple at first glance it provides a rich source of dynamics and deserves attention. In this paper, we revisit a model that has its origin in the work of Dubois and Closset. A set of two quadratic population models interact as piecewise defined differential equations. The model has been discussed by Ren Yongtai and Han Li, cryptically written and showing some linguistic and typographical errors, but providing an excellent vehicle for developing skills in mathematical modelling, differential equations and technology for the young researcher. We explore the model in clearer detail and supplement the theory with rich graphical illustration. The paper has the purpose of providing an example of how a young researcher, such as a postgraduate student in biomathematics, can expand on an existing model by making use of current technology.

AB  - Morehouse School of Medicine elected to restructure its first-year medical curriculum by transitioning from a discipline-based to an integrated program. The anatomy course, with regional dissection at its core, served as the backbone for this integration by weaving the content from prior traditional courses into the curriculum around the anatomy topics. There were four primary goals for this restructuring process. Goal 1: develop new integrated courses. Course boundaries were established at locations where logical breaks in anatomy content occurred. Four new courses were created, each containing integrated subject content. Goal 2: establish a curriculum management team. The team consisted of course directors, subject specialists, and a curriculum director. This team worked together to efficiently manage the new curriculum. Goal 3: launch contemporary examination and question banking methods. An electronic system, in which images could be included, was implemented for examinations and quizzes, and for storing and refining questions. Goal 4: ensure equitable distribution of standardized examinations and course grading systems among all courses. Assessments included quizzes, in-course examinations, and National Board of Medical Examiners® (NBME®) Subject Examinations. A standard plan assigned the contribution of each to the final course grade. Significant improvement was seen on subject examinations. Once the obstacles and challenges of integration were overcome, a robust and efficient education program was developed. The curriculum is expected to continue evolving and improving, while retaining full regional dissection as a core element.

AB  - We characterize the recently included programming content in Swedish mathematics textbooks for elementary school. Especially, the connection between programming content and traditional mathematical content has been considered. The analytical tools used are based on the so-called 5E's, a theoretical framework of action, developed within the ScratchMath project, and Brennan and Resnick's (2012) terms computational concepts and practices. The result uncovers "follow a procedure" as the dominating action, in which the concepts stepwise instruction and repeated pattern were frequent. Bridging between programming and mathematics is weak in the sense that the programming content does not enhance the possibility to explore mathematical concepts and ideas.

AB  - This paper relates the story of two professors that have made a bridge between the two cultures, science and humanities. They teach a humanities course together in which they explore the nature of the two cultures, their differences and their commonalities. The processes of team-building and planning produced five heuristic questions for the course around which the paper is organized: (1) Have science and the humanities always been separate cultures?; (2) What are the respective worldviews out of which scientists and humanists work?; (3) Can the two cultures be bridged?; (4) What sort of dialogue can bring about that connection?; and (5) Can students understand and become participants in that dialogue? The paper describes this team teaching experience from its conceptual beginnings through the actualization of those concepts. In it, the authors will talk about "doing" the course, what they have learned from teaching it, and how they have changed from the experience.

AB  - Archaeology is a highly interdisciplinary field. Its main goal is to construct culture histories, but it uses many scientific methods in the process. Ethical dilemmas inherent in archaeology make it a good vehicle for teaching ethics and character in the classroom (Moe 2000). The interdisciplinary nature of the field makes it possible to weave ethics and character throughout the curriculum, using archaeology as a theme. Recognizing the potential of archaeology to teach ethics in a meaningful way, Utah Project Archaeology, the Utah State Office of Education, and the Utah Museum of Natural History formed the Ethics and Archaeology Partnership to explore ways to use archaeology to teach ethics, character, and citizenship in a series of professional development opportunities for Utah educators in grades K-12. This article describes the partnership and the lessons learned by participants.

AB  - The ULINCS Project research describes how elementary teachers learned a model for integrating skills of mathematics, reading, and writing with the teaching of science which led to increased teaching skills and enhanced student achievement. This joint university and school district project was funded by an Eisenhower Grant, and focused on educators working in teams to synthesize curriculum standards while planning and teaching an integrated unit. The evidence indicates that when two or more teachers at a grade level were involved in the ULINCS Project, student achievement across the grade level improved. These experienced elementary teacher participants attained a personal level of self-efficacy, and adopted dispositions that allowed them to work at a comfortable pace when dealing with district and statewide changes. Although all schools and classes in the district evidenced achievement gains, the students in classes taught by the ULINCS teachers evidenced greater gains. The research results document increases in student achievement as well as teachers' personal development. Not surprisingly, there is a direct link between teacher thinking and student performance. The "invisible" thinking skills of teachers help generate new possibilities and increase instructional flexibility. When given a sustained professional development opportunity that challenges their content knowledge and pedagogical thinking, teachers may develop an increased capacity which leads to a high level of professional efficacy.

AB  - This paper outlines the results of a collaborative effort between members of staff in the Departments of Life Sciences and Language, Linguistics and Philosophy, which involved the implementation of Writing Across the Curriculum strategies in an Ecology course. The lecturer for this course had expressed concerns regarding the poor quality of the laboratory reports presented and weak essays submitted by students. In order to enhance students' understanding of the content to be included in the report, and to improve expression of thought in writing, we agreed to "treat" a sample of students selected from two laboratory groups by giving each group the other's lab report to read and to subsequently carry out the experiments described. Additionally a select group of students engaged in the planning, writing and revising of responses to past exam essay questions. Results showed that final exam grades for the "treated" group and the writing group were significantly higher than their "non treated" and "non writing" counterparts. Feedback from students was generally positive. Implications and limitations are discussed. (Contains 5 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Constructivist, hands-on, inquiry-based, science activities may have a curative potential that could be valuable in a psychological assistance programme for child victims of violence and war. To investigate this idea, pilot sessions were performed in an orphanage located in Ruhengeri, Rwanda, with seven young adults and two groups of 11 children aged from 9 to 16 years. Despite a number of imperfections in this attempt, significant observations have been made. First, a sound communication was established with all, even with the young adults who at the beginning were not as enthusiastic as the children. Furthermore, some children, originally isolated, silent and sad, displayed a high degree of happiness during the activities, and an overall increasing positive change of attitude. In addition, they appropriated well some principles of experimental science. This suggests that a joint development of science literacy and joy may be an interesting approach, both in education and therapy. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - This article describes the creation of a university-based cross-disciplinary collaboration with elementary schools to address the challenges faced by teacher preparation programs in providing preservice teachers opportunities to design integrated STEM learning environments. The partnership focused on the design of an electric car unit and complementary materials. The rationale for this topic was twofold: to build capacity on "NGSS"-aligned STEM learning environment design among preservice and inservice teachers and to foster literacy on electric vehicles. The article also discusses the learning opportunities afforded to all collaborators and the lessons learned from the design and implementation process.

AB  - Over the past several decades, researchers have used economics to understand a number of issues in education policy. This article argues that some education researchers have defined economics too narrowly, neglecting several areas of economics research that cut across disciplinary boundaries. One subdiscipline of economics that might be of use in education, but which has not been applied much to it, is behavioral economics, which incorporates psychological knowledge about human behavior to enhance and extend economic models of decision making. This article reviews some of the behavioral concepts in economics that are most likely to inform education research and policy--prospect theory, framing effects, status quo bias, paradox of choice, and intrinsic motivation--and suggests directions for further research.

AB  - Recent reviews of environmental education (EE) research converge with pedagogical trends in the education literature to situated and constructivist learning and the need for greater researcher reflexivity about the assumptions and conduct of research. These trends also elaborate the need in EE and education for sustainable development and related fields of curriculum inquiry and theory for learners to critically examine their own and others' experiences of the various places they regularly encounter. In this article, the author describes a humanly constructive approach to inquiry. This curriculum of 9 questions can be used in its entirety or selectively infused into existing curriculum and pedagogical and research efforts. Because the questions focus on learners' everyday experiences of environmentally problematic and enabling circumstances, this different perspective of curriculum theory reiterates those historical imperatives for experiential, problem (re)solving, interdisciplinary, and participatory action strategies.

AB  - City cemeteries are often very old, with gravestones dating back to the early 1800s. Some of the markers are carved out of rocks and may be quite simple, containing only names of the deceased and dates of birth and death; others contain no information at all. This is in sharp contrast to some of the very elaborate markers carved out of granite with intricate designs and embellishments seen today. Learning experiences are important both inside and outside of the classroom. A walking tour of a local  cemetery is an excellent way to allow students the opportunity to connect with the community's past while at the same time providing a successful collaborative curriculum experience with history.

AB  - For many teachers, integration of subjects like science and reading makes perfect sense; for others--including many school administrators--it does not. For these individuals, integration is an approach that takes away valuable time needed to ensure that specific learning goals are met in each discrete subject. By building on the common ground between the subjects, you can address learning goals in both subjects without compromising either subject. In addition, you can maximize efficiency within the school day. So, the next time faced with an administrator who advises, "We must focus all our efforts on our Language Arts program" or a colleague who confides, "I don't have time to teach science anymore," share the rationale for integration presented here. It is possible to teach both subjects--effectively--through integration.

AB  - Understanding of Earth's systems, including the crucial role of human beings within them, is an important part of citizens' ability to think intelligently and critically about the environment, pollution, sustainability and other socio-economic and scientific issues central to life in the modern world. Part of this understanding involves seeing the world as an integrated whole in which what happens in diverse places in the world may be equally relevant for students' lives. In this regard, it makes sense to study both remote and local environments within the system thinking approach--where such distinctions naturally become blurred. The present research, accordingly, focuses on a study unit entitled "Life at the Poles" and investigates the development of junior high school students' understanding of Earth systems and their level of conceptual complexity as a result of participating in it. The "Life at the Poles" unit is based on the "explanatory story" approach where one central theme is used as a focal point for an interdisciplinary study of certain natural phenomena, in this case, the possibility of life under the extreme conditions at the poles. Concept maps and Likert-type questionnaires were employed as research tools, allowing the collected data to be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The research findings indicate that the students significantly improved their Earth systems understanding and, importantly, greatly increased their awareness of human beings' influence on the environment, including remote environments such as the pole.

AB  - There is a disconnect between the cutting-edge research done in academic laboratories, such as nanotechnology, and what is taught in undergraduate laboratories. In the current undergraduate curriculum, very few students get a chance to do hands-on experiments in nanotechnology-related fields, most of which are through selective undergraduate research programs. In most cases, complicated synthesis procedures, expensive reagents, and the requirement for specific instrumentation prevent broad adaptation of nanotechnology-based experiments to laboratory courses. DNA, being a nanoscale molecule, has recently been used in bottom-up nanotechnology with applications in sensing, nanorobotics, and computing. In this article, we propose a simple experiment involving the synthesis of a DNA nanoswitch that can change its shape from a linear "off" state to a looped "on" state in the presence of a target DNA molecule. The experiment also demonstrates the programmable topology of the looped state of the nanoswitch and its effect on gel migration. The experiment is easy to adapt in an undergraduate laboratory, requires only agarose gel electrophoresis, has a minimal setup cost for materials, and can be completed in a 3 hour time frame.
