AB  - Computing is a complex, multidisciplinary field that requires a range of professional proficiencies. Computing students are expected to develop in-depth knowledge and skills, integrate and apply their knowledge flexibly to solve complex problems, and work successfully in teams. However, many students who graduate with degrees in computing fail to meet these expectations. In addressing these challenges, Kun Huang, Yifei Dong, and Xun Ge have been inspired by the success of many open source software development (OSSD) communities. Using a design-based research approach, their study proposes an alternative solution to the current problems in computing education. Specifically, after examining a successful open-source software development community, Huang, Dong, and Ge analyzed and summarized its characteristics: projects as shared enterprise, motivation in joining the OSSD community, distributed expertise and expanded community, careful and systematic project planning, collaborative knowledge building, and OSSD system affordances. Using these features as design guidelines, they developed a software engineering class with its own OSSD environment. In this article they describe the course itself, share their initial findings of its pedagogical benefits, and discuss the implications of their continuing research for the future of computing education.

AB  - In the U.S. Antarctic Program, NSF-funded scientists--most from universities--perform basic research in geosciences and other disciplines at research stations or field camps throughout the continent and the Southern Ocean. Scholars in the humanities, as well as support specialists from various fields, work closely together with the scientists. Mutual dependence for everything ranging from transportation to meals is typical. Anecdotal evidence is that participants benefit in their professional and personal lives from the close associations in both the work and the domestic proximities that are normal. This Commentary describes the work of some individuals who have advanced understanding of Antarctic topics in collaborative approaches.

AB  - Many teachers find developing a new lesson or course quite difficult. It would be nice to have all necessary information, lesson plans and assessment materials ready at hand. But most often, they find themselves on their own when it comes to lesson and course development. The author faced this situation when he was asked to develop a lesson on fuel cell technology for science and industrial technology students. In this article, the author shares his experience with fuel cell course development to give other educators an effective procedure to follow as they develop their own courses.

AB  - In this contribution, I reflect on how multilingual pedagogies can be added to STEM and S.T.E.M. practices, in what could be called a "double-crossing": on the one hand, crossing linguistic boundaries and, on the other, crossing specific subject knowledge. Based on a content analysis of teachers' interviews referring to their pedagogical experiences with a multilingual platform providing subject content in several languages, I reflect on the extent to which and how multilingual STEM and S.T.E.M. pedagogies are implemented and accounted for. More specifically, I analyse the arguments put forward by teachers for using or not using multilingual practices in STEM and S.T.E.M. and I delve into the apparent contradictions underlying the fact that, despite using a multilingual platform, its multilingual affordances are sometimes overlooked, underestimated or even used in monolingualised practices in multilingual settings.

AB  - Understanding scientific phenomena in terms of complex systems principles is both scientifically and pedagogically important. Situations from different disciplines of science are often governed by the same principle, and so promoting knowledge transfer across disciplines makes valuable cross-fertilization and scientific unification possible. Although evidence for this kind of transfer has historically been controversial, experiments and observations of students suggest pedagogical methods for promoting transfer of complex systems principles. One powerful strategy is for students to actively interpret the elements and interactions of perceptually grounded scenarios. Such interpretation can be facilitated through the presentation of a situation alongside a description of how the agents in the situation are behaving, and by students exploring and constructing computational models of the situation. The resulting knowledge can be both concretely grounded yet highly perspective dependent and generalizeable. We discuss methods for coordinating computational and mental models of complex systems, the roles of idealization and concreteness in fostering understanding and generalization, and other complementary theoretical approaches to achieving transfer.

AB  - In this article, the author talks about his most successful electric vehicle project that links school and industry. Some people in the public school arena stereotype industrial technology as a dumping ground for underachieving students, and many of his students believed that they could not succeed in higher education classes. He challenged himself to build up his students' confidence by developing creative and exciting educational alternatives that would link their school with the local business community. Their project really got students motivated. This technology-based activity also had the potential to serve as a hub for learning, allowing the school to tie math, science, and English into a central project. He talks about his source of inspiration and their support for the industry. The author also details how the project led to many other valuable activities.

AB  - Objective: Psychotherapy and biological psychiatry remain divided in psychiatry residency curricula. Behavioral neurobiology and neuropsychiatry provide a systems-level framework that allows teachers to integrate biology, psychodynamics, and psychology. Method: The authors detail the underlying assumptions and outline of a neural systems-based neuroscience course they teach at the National Capital Consortium Psychiatry Residency Program. They review course assessment reports and classroom observations. Results: Self-report measures and teacher observations are encouraging. By the end of the course, residents are able to discuss both neurobiological and psychodynamic/psychological concepts of distributed biological neural networks. They verbalize an understanding that psychology "is" biology, that any distinction is artificial, and that both are valuable. Conclusions: A neuroscience curriculum founded on the underlying principles of behavioral neurobiology and neuropsychiatry is inherently anti-reductionistic and facilitates the acquisition of detailed information as well as critical thinking and cross-disciplinary correlations with psychological theories and psychotherapy.

AB  - The numerical ability of Irish students in international and national assessments is weaker than for literacy, particularly among higher-performing students. The aim of this study was to design a national teacher professional development programme to encourage teachers at post-primary level to develop numeracy competency across the post-primary curriculum. The project explored how numeracy and mathematics can be integrated meaningfully and constructively in a range of carrier subjects and explore how these subjects can, in turn, influence the manner in which relevant concepts can be addressed in mathematics lessons. The theory underpinning the effective design followed a model of professional development incorporating four strategies. The study was conducted over three school years and the pedagogical approaches adopted by teachers in the cross-curricular integration of numeracy are presented. How the approach supported teachers' learning is also presented according to a model of teacher agency in professional development and school reform, examining (1) individual practice; (2) outcomes; (3) perceived work context; and (4) school reform. The discussion points which arise describe the community of practice that evolved and the readiness of the participant teachers to embrace professional development in preparation for curricular reform.

AB  - The six articles in the special features section of this journal issue focus on the use of children's literature in all areas of the curriculum. The first article concerns the use of mathematics trade books and offers ways of using new books in learning stations to foster independent learning. The second article discusses criteria for selecting science trade books and suggests ways for using science books in a primary grade classroom. The third article discusses change in the social studies and offers teaching methods that stimulate children's thinking about historical and current events. The fourth article points out a variety of ways trade books can be used during language arts lessons and suggests activities for specific areas of the language arts. The fifth article describes  a library curriculum activity that helps to develop children's critiquing ability and their higher thinking processes. The final article in this section suggests ways in which the media specialist, curriculum specialist, and classroom teacher can work together to relate trade books about the arts to the curriculum. The remaining three articles in the journal issue deal with creative reading and writing, classroom materials for the gifted, and the content reading approach. (FL)

AB  - For Mr. Kim's fifth-grade students, recess is not just for playing and getting exercise! One spring, he observed a small group of his students near their class bluebird box, examining various bird feathers found on the ground. Building on students' natural curiosity, Mr. Kim purchased some feathers for further exploration in the classroom. He was enthusiastic about developing learning experiences to capture and direct their initial observations and questions. Mr. Kim knew that Mrs. Garcia, the elementary art teacher, would enjoy planning an art lesson to incorporate both science and art concepts with direct observations in nature. Together they planned a series of activities to last a week. In this article, fifth-grade students explored science-process skills and art concepts through a creative bird project. The teachers were proud that the project had not only excited students about learning and helped them make connections among content areas but also inspired their colleagues to do the same.

AB  - Interprofessional education (IPE) for health and social care students may improve attitudes toward IPE and interprofessional collaboration (IPC). The quality of research on the association between IPE and attitudes is mediocre and IPE effect sizes are unknown. Students at a college in Toronto, Canada, attended an IPE workshop. A comparison group of non-attenders was formed. Both groups completed pre- and post-workshop questionnaires and two measurement scales for IPE attitudes--the Interprofessional Education Perceptions Scale and the University of West England questionnaire. Eight multiple linear regressions modeled post-workshop attitude scores as a function of workshop attendance, pre-workshop attitudes, and background factors. Workshop effect sizes and relative importance of variables were estimated. Published results were used to calculate IPE effect sizes in other studies. Pre-workshop measures of post-workshop attitudes were dominant, positive predictors of outcomes; other predictors were subordinate to them. The relationship between workshop attendance and IPE attitudes was positive in seven models, statistically significant in four (P less than 0.05), and not statistically significant in four. In hierarchical regressions the average workshop effect was small, about 0.08 in [delta]R[squared] terms, amounting to about one-quarter of a model's explained variance. The workshop was associated with improved IPE and IPC attitudes in some domains but not others. The results should help educators focus IPE efforts on IPE/IPC attitudes where small, short-term improvements can be obtained.

AB  - Plants are crucial parts of ecosystems but are traditionally considered boring and difficult by students. It is therefore not clear whether factual knowledge about plants contributes to building positive attitudes and interest in botany. We investigated whether factual knowledge about monocotyledonous plants is associated with secondary students' attitudes toward and interest in plants. Furthermore, we examined whether self-reported plant cultivation experiences and gender differences exist in attitudes toward plants. Factual knowledge about monocotyledonous plants significantly correlated with attitudes toward plants and these attitudes were greatly influenced by interest in botany, ecology, evolution, and zoology, but not with other, more distant biological disciplines (e.g. microbiology, or health and nutrition). Females received better scores in knowledge and attitudes toward plants, but interest in plants was similar between males and females. We suggest that (1) factual knowledge in botany is essential in building positive attitudes toward plants and that (2) inter-connections between botany with zoology, ecology and evolution may help with elimination of plant blindness and building positive attitudes toward plants.

AB  - There have been many systematic approaches to solving the problem of how to make science courses interesting to students. One that is currently receiving attention in the sciences is the use of civic engagement within the classroom. This approach works well in small enrollment courses, but it is logistically difficult to implement in large enrollment courses. Large enrollment classes lend themselves more naturally to other civic engagement approaches, such as special topics courses with individual or group research projects. The authors choose to meld the two approaches, thus creating a collection of activity modules for environmental science courses that use a personalized civic engagement model. In this way each student looks at his or her individual impact on society and the environment and researches how to change it. The activity modules they have created seek to engage students on issues vital to the public (climate change, energy, ground-level ozone, etc.). At the conclusion of each module, students calculate just how much they impact their environment or the environment impacts them during the course of their normal day. They then investigate ways that they can change this impact by making changes in their lifestyle.

AB  - The study of the history of the English language can help students become aware of major issues in several academic fields, including history, literature, political science, anthropology, communication, economics, the Arts, and, of course, languages and linguistics. Even though instructors may not have an especially broad background in the Humanities, the students themselves bring their own set of interests to the course. The students' curiosity for their already existing interests can be exploited to broaden the course and to help them see connections between methodologies and subjects. With carefully designed assignments--perhaps using the assistance of colleagues in other fields--an instructor can make a course in the history of the English language a catalyst for learning in a variety of academic areas.

AB  - The scope and magnitude of our planet's environmental crisis is a sobering reality confronting humanity with the daunting and complex nature of ecological degradation and restoration. The macrocosmic nature of this crisis has not left a species, ecosystem, biome or human society untouched. Moreover, as humanity struggles to gain its bearings at the crossroads of hope, we have become aware that the environmental crisis has impacted nearly every human discipline--from art to zoology--of the post-modern era. The complexity of ecological dynamics provides compelling evidence that this complex problem will require novel collaborative and interdisciplinary approaches to the production of knowledge, the search for creative solutions and the necessary ethical horizon in the effort to achieve ecological restoration and planetary sustainability. To that end this article proposes a significant role for the creative partnership between science and theology as applied to the microcosmic case study of restoring salmon and steelhead populations in the Lower Columbia River Basin of the Pacific Northwest. Readers should bear in mind that the current status of salmon recover efforts in the Pacific Northwest is a dynamic ongoing process. Consequently, this article is of necessity a snapshot view taken at a moment in time.

AB  - Increasing interest over the last twenty years in quality Greek and Latin translations seems to be primarily a reflection of the "paperback revolution." Figures and trend reports from various publishers illustrate the burgeoning numbers of classical works in translation. This new availability has enabled students of literature, history, political science, and the sciences to be aware of the classical antecedents of their individual disciplines. There is an additional need for 1-volume anthologies of Greek and Roman selections which would elucidate the roots of knowledge in each subject area. (AF)

AB  - The first PhD specialty program in Geropsychology that launched in fall, 2004 at CU-Colorado Springs is described. Consistent with a scientist-practitioner model, the curriculum sequence builds systematically from basic to complex knowledge and skills across the domains of scientific psychology, research methodology, general clinical, geropsychology science, and clinical geropsychology. Practicum experiences also build skills in core clinical competencies needed by geropsychologists, including assessment, psychotherapy, neuropsychological evaluations, caregiver consultation and counseling, health psychology, and outreach/prevention. Research mentoring prepares students with the skills needed to conduct independent research useful to the clinical practice of geropsychology. Challenges faced in the process of developing the program include the development of a training clinic, balancing specialty and generalized training, building a specialty culture while maintaining faculty integration, attracting faculty and students during a start-up phase, and defining an identity within the field. The mental health services center that was launched to meet training needs while addressing a services niche in the community contributes substantially to the essence of this program, and is described in some detail. Future opportunities and challenges include program funding, heavy demands of specialty training on top of generalist training, maintaining congruence between expectations of clinical and non-clinical faculty, providing interdisciplinary experience, and expansion of practicum opportunities.

AB  - Life has become infinitely more complicated, time increasingly precious and society increasingly visual. In higher education we seem to be doing more with less, producing greater amounts of data to support the validity of the work and courses are quantified by the value placed upon by assessment. In this vein, a voice from the trenches calls for a conversation regarding art and its place in the Core Curriculum of our institutions. The definition of "the arts", culture and its place within the institution of higher education implies attitudes and values which may need to be viewed from a different perspective. The hierarchy within "the arts" established through perceptions, stereotypes, bias, and economics creates an uneven playing field as we are forced to vie for crumbs left within a Core experience. As artists and proponents of the arts, we, ourselves, tend to "take for granted", if not undervalue the dynamics inherent within our specific disciplines and specializations. We fail our students, institutions and future generations when the linkages between sciences, technology, art and design in today's world are not clear. We should employ the arts as a foundation for building experiences which will allow us to nurture "life-long learners" who are able to view challenges and situations with a more analytical and creative eye.

AB  - Engineering design activities can help educators to apply concepts and processes from within and across STEM domains. To facilitate these connections, there is a need for sustained, job-embedded, and collegial professional development that brings together teachers from across STEM domains to engage in design-based activities. These activities can help teachers better understand engineering design processes and can foster collaborations. This can lead to a culture shift within the school by which integration of STEM concepts and process becomes more seamless for both educators and their students. This paper describes a research-based model for professional development to promote engineering pedagogy to support learning of STEM concepts within and across domains.

AB  - In August 2005, the National Endowment for Financial Education® (NEFE®) hosted a groundbreaking event, bringing educators from a variety of disciplines together to explore how to make financial literacy programs more effective. This was the first symposium ever to combine financial educators with leaders from other fields--neuroscience, change theory, behavioral economics, and psychology--with the common goal of finding new ways to help move people toward taking positive actions to create a healthier financial future. The symposium, titled "Closing the Gap Between Knowledge and Behavior: Turning Education into Action," was organized around four featured presentations that examined topics as diverse as the implications of brain biology on behavior, effective programs that incorporate change theory, observed economic behavior versus traditional economic theory, and the psychology of an individual's money personality. From this fertile cross-pollination of ideas, participants developed a list of exciting next steps: defining research and resource needs, proposing changes and new directions for financial educators, and identifying relationships that need to be leveraged to build more effective financial literacy programs. A white paper report on this symposium follows. [This paper is the result of a symposium sponsored by the National Endowment for Financial Education.]

AB  - Despite the belief that liberal learning is a necessary component of the professional nursing student?s education, the scientific focus has held prominence in nursing education (Valiga and Bruderle 1997). In the twenty first century, thoughtful linking of liberal learning to professional nursing education takes on renewed urgency. As early as the 1970s, nursing education literature asserted that when the liberal arts are taught in discrete curricular courses, the connections between these courses and the learning needs of the professional nurse remain unrecognized. In an effort to address this disconnect between liberal learning and professional nursing courses, some general and nursing educators have argued that efforts should be directed at methods to integrate liberal learning within nursing courses (Newell 1989; Valiga and Bruderle 1997). The purpose of the study described here was to examine the current nature of the integration of the humanities learning activities within nursing courses in baccalaureate nursing education. In addition, nursing faculty perceptions on the achievement of the goals related to these humanities learning activities were explored. Furthermore, faculty views regarding motivation for integrating with the humanities as well as the perceived obstacles were examined. Recommendations from this study include increasing interdisciplinary dialogue that promotes faculty awareness of this value through faculty development programs. Furthermore, administrative leadership is needed to support faculty in "trying out" innovative teaching/learning strategies. Expanding societal and health care complexities demands that professional nursing education be tailored to prepare responsible, democratic citizens as well as empowered, competent, compassionate professional nurses.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to suggest ways of using research on children's reasoning and learning to elaborate on existing national standards and to improve large-scale and classroom assessments. The authors suggest that "learning progressions"--descriptions of successively more sophisticated ways of reasoning within a content domain based on research syntheses and conceptual analyses--can be useful tools for using research on children's learning to improve assessments. Such learning progressions should be organized around central concepts and principles of a discipline (i.e., its "big ideas") and show how those big ideas are elaborated, interrelated, and transformed with instruction. They should also specify how those big ideas are enacted in specific practices that allow students to use them in meaningful ways, enactments the authors describe as "learning performances". Learning progressions thus can provide a basis for ongoing dialogue between science learning researchers and measurement specialists, leading to the development of assessments that use both standards documents and science learning research as resources and that will give teachers, curriculum developers, and policymakers more insight into students' scientific reasoning. The authors illustrate their argument by developing a learning progression for an important scientific topic--matter and atomic-molecular theory--and using it to generate sample learning performances and assessment items.

AB  - Disciplinary literacy instruction during kindergarten through second grade enables students to begin developing facility with consuming, producing, and learning from texts in academic disciplines across their school careers and for full civic participation. Extant intervention studies and descriptions of practice in the primary grades offer understanding of disciplinary literacy instruction when it is enacted with researchers' help and/or by teachers with expertise in disciplinary literacy. To address disciplinary literacy in the primary grades, insight into what primary teachers focus on and how they support students' disciplinary literacy learning during their naturally-occurring instruction is needed. This exploratory collective case study examined the disciplinary literacy learning opportunities available in first-grade teachers' instruction. Participants included four teachers in four elementary schools situated in a large city in the Midwest. Audio records and field notes were collected over a period of five months during teachers' literacy instruction. Open coding, progressive refinement of codes, and categorical analyses revealed limited instructional emphasis on disciplinary literacy. When learning opportunities were observed, teachers' foci and support centered on the social foundations of disciplinary literacy and included sharing of information and student practice. Also, problematic disciplinary literacy learning opportunities were noted. This study underscores the urgent need for additional attention to disciplinary literacy as it is situated within the primary grades, with particular import for how first-grade teachers enact disciplinary literacy instruction.

AB  - Throughout history, people have moved themselves and cargo across water in boats and other types of vessels. Most vessels are developed using a technological design process, which typically involves problem solving and a series of steps. The designer documents each step to provide an accurate record of accomplishments and information to guide further decision making. The process eventually leads to designs or documentation used to direct construction of the vessel. This article presents a highly motivating boat design-and-construction activity for technology students that provides substantial science, math, communication and engineering experience.

AB  - In today's technology-laden society human-computer interaction (HCI) is an important knowledge area for computer scientists and software engineers. This paper surveys existing approaches to incorporate HCI into computer science (CS) and such related issues as the perceived gap between the interests of the HCI community and the needs of CS educators. It presents several implementations of the HCI subset of the CC'01 curricular guidelines, targeting CS educators with varying degrees of HCI expertise. These implementations include course/module outlines from freshman to graduate levels, suggested texts, and project ideas and issues, such as programming languages and environments. Most importantly, each outline incorporates Bloom's taxonomy to identify the depth of knowledge to be mastered by students. This paper condenses collaborative contributions of 26 HCI/CS educators aiming to improve HCI coverage in mainstream CS curricula. (Contains 11 tables.)

AB  - Within the broad perspective of school and social exclusion, this article pays attention to an important factor of exclusion: overweight and obesity in primary school children. An interdisciplinary research was conducted and aimed at the study of social representations and practices surrounding food which primary school children, their parents and their teachers hold. This article proposes, firstly, an analysis of drawings produced by the children. Most of them represented dinner time as a social event when the family gathers together. It is pictured as a pleasant and joyful moment of the day, in settings of people standing close to one another or sitting around a table. While concrete references to the act of eating are present, it is the spirit of family reunion that predominates. Secondly, the article will clarify the perspectives teachers have regarding their role in educating for healthy food habits. Holding a prevention perspective, the conclusion will stress the importance of partnerships  between parents and schools that should be enacted. Joint interventions should be planned for.

AB  - Criticizes the notion that the empiricism of economics is more valid (and therefore more valuable) to the field of political science than the more subjective efforts of area studies. Specifically responds to Robert Bates's categorization of area studies as "unscientific" and unduly "humanist." Briefly discusses significant works within area studies. (MJP)

AB  - This article examines the role of gesture in the shared meaning-making processes of 6th-grade students studying plate tectonics using a data visualization tool; specifically, a geographic information system. Students' verbal and gestural characterizations of key concepts of plate motions (i.e., "subduction", "rift", and "buckling") were transcribed and coded across episodes of small-group work during the course of the unit, tracking emergent concepts and their subsequent refinements. The emergence histories of these concepts showed that they were initiated in gesture before they were conveyed in speech. Once they appeared in speech, speech and gesture figured prominently in the further elaboration, modification, and refinement of the key concepts. Gestures introduced by 1 member of the group were picked up and used by peers. Gestures were found to afford joint attention to concepts and negotiation of meaning in the group (e.g., through manual manipulation, imitation, and correction of gestures). These interactions appeared to advance the group's shared understanding of plate tectonics, and to mediate individual student learning. The findings suggest that explicit attention to gesture in instruction and assessment may impact the development of domain understandings in science investigations.

AB  - Engaged learning seeks to cultivate integrative approaches that require students to use multiple points of view or approaches in their coursework. Similarly, civically engaged courses ask students to consider public problems that involve multiple stakeholders, institutions, and policies. We are interested in whether courses designed to meet civic engagement goals might also improve student self-assessment of integrative learning at our institution and could serve as a developmental step toward more holistic strategies. To test our hypothesis that student participation in civic engagement would improve student self-assessment of integrative learning, we compared summative student survey scores from students enrolled in similar courses with and without a civic engagement component (n = 275). Boxplot and statistical analysis (unpaired two-sample Wilcoxon test) were used to determine if civic engagement pedagogy made any meaningful impact on integrative learning. Our results show strong overall improvement in survey scores after civic engagement courses.

AB  - Physical educators are pressured not only to teach their subject area and motivate children to become active, but also implement a cross-disciplinary curriculum. A cross-disciplinary curriculum is defined as developing learning experiences that integrate physical education with mathematics, science, language arts, social studies, and the arts. Such curriculum allows the learning experience to be more meaningful, fun, and rewarding for students by bridging the gap between physical education and other subject areas. In this article, the authors propose another approach that enable children to apply critical-thinking skills in group setting. They believe this approach is more effective as studies show that cooperative education has a positive impact on the students and their learning. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - We describe an innovative preorientation curriculum (POC) for a Master of Biostatistics (MB) program. The goal of the POC is to fill critical skills gaps for students entering the MB program from heterogeneous backgrounds so they are prepared to engage in the program's rigorous, fast-paced training upon arrival. To achieve this goal, we introduce a structured approach to thinking that forms the foundation of a sound mental map of Biostatistics, which will assist students in their subsequent efforts to master the discipline. Based on constructivist principles, the POC covers mathematical and statistical theory, data analysis methods, programming, and statistical practice through a sequence of instruction that encourages reflection, extension, and connection between topics. The POC is modular, self-paced, and offered online via a cloud-hosted interactive learning management system (LMS). Students are required to complete the curriculum prior to the MB program orientation. We describe the rationale, design, features, and initial evaluation of the POC. Finally, to help programs interested in designing similar curricula, we provide a detailed instruction sequence description of one topic.

Data to address this question were collected during six weeks of observation and discussions with students at a suburban high school of 1500 students. Additional data were obtained from student and teacher generated documents, such as lesson plans, handouts, student journals, reports and presentations. This study assumed six critical elements of engineering design: problem definition, development of solutions, analysis/modeling, experimentation, decision making and teamwork. These six elements of an iterative process were derived from a review of engineering design literature and became a lens through which the classroom learning experiences were viewed. Evident in the observations was the theme of student transition from teacher driven problems with narrow boundaries, to student driven problem definition with wide boundaries. In this research, projects started as small individual activities early in the fall term. As the semester progressed, projects became more complex, and a necessity for teamwork emerged. Each activity in the fall provided students with experience and skills in areas of engineering design and material fabrication. This preparation provided a conceptual and practical foundation for the open-ended spring design challenge. (Contains 4 figures and 2 tables.)

AB  - The rapid onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, has brought to light how important technology may be to the socio-economic development of a nation, particularly in Africa. The study conducted a narrative review of pertinent literature to objectively assess the effects of two types of emerging digital technologies (Artificial Intelligence [AI]) and nanotechnologies in Africa. The results showed that emerging technology-related research, development, and deployment are happening throughout Africa. Nanotechnology and AI have had a substantial impact in many spheres of African economies. The study, however, acknowledges in its conclusion that not all African nations have derived the same benefits from emerging technologies, including the digitalisation processes. There are still large disparities in the accessibility of technology and digital skills in several rural and underdeveloped areas in Africa. Thus, recommendations on how to close these gaps are provided for all African countries to profit more consistently from the emerging technologies and the digitalisation processes.

AB  - The big question which has arisen with the growth of ICT is how to incorporate this new technology into existing curriculum. The authors relate how they established a viable cooperation and transfer of knowledge between subjects biology and ICT in their school in Slovenia. The result was that their students produced more than 150 biological Web pages, covering topics like evolution, genetics, human anatomy, birds and mammals. During the implementation of this program, the authors relate that they can achieve desirable outcomes only through cooperation between the teachers of IT and biology. The first underlying reason is that the IT teacher can not be an expert in every discipline, so she cannot recognize if web pages produced by the students contains data from corrupted sources, is trivial, or even wrong. Without cooperation, students would produce technically correct Web pages but with questionable content. As such, the authors suggest that work must be carefully balanced between teachers, so students are taught things about computer and they get to put their knowledge into practice in other subjects.

AB  - This study investigates the motivation of African American master's degree students in computing to pursue a PhD in Computing. Specifically, we sought to understand the motivation of those students attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the United States. Our framework was founded on the premise that an adequate theoretical rooting of broadening participation calls for reflections on the nature and practice of justice. Motivation, nonetheless, remained the core factor, albeit addressing it within a context of justice or lack thereof. The study shows that while most students seem intrinsically motivated by a desire to learn, leading to a likelihood to pursue a PhD, extrinsic factors such as funding and employability constitute the highest hindrance to such likelihood.

AB  - The two articles dealing with problem solving and technology in this publication should be useful to those developing the kinds of materials, experiences, and thinking that elementary school industrial arts offers children. The first article accepts problem solving as an educational goal and reports a timely and universally acceptable approach. Earle Lomon, Bette Beck, and Carolyn Arbetter present the need for problem solving abilities at all levels of the population and demand integrative and flexible cognitive skills. They provide examples of how problem solving can be arrived at through the Unified Science and Mathematics for Elementary Schools program, which helps children develop real problem-solving abilities. In the second article Robert M. W. Travers compares the long  developments in the early technologies of metals with the development of education. He suggests that a technology can be developed by borrowing from other fields (such as operant conditioning efforts) or through unique development based upon sound scientific knowledge (such as educating man as an information retrieval system in light of computer technology).

AB  - A postal survey was conducted regarding statistical techniques, research methods and software used in the workplace by 913 graduates with PhD and Masters degrees in the biological sciences, psychology, business, economics, and statistics. The study identified gaps between topics and techniques learned at university and those used in the workplace, and points to deficiencies in statistical preparation for employment. Courses requested include multivariate statistics, generalized linear models, research design and power analysis taught with minimal emphasis on probability and mathematics. Recommendations are presented, such as expanding statistical service courses to eliminate gaps, the development of intensive workshops for postgraduate students and for workplace retraining, or involving staff from other departments to provide context for statistics teaching.

AB  - With the present forum contribution, I respond to the paper "Discerning contextual complexities in STEM career pathways--Insights from successful Latinas" by Alejandro Gallard Martínez, Wesley Pitts, Silvia Lizette Ramos de Robles, Katie L. Milton Brkich, Belinda Flores Bustos, and Lorena Claeys. I aim to augment the thoughts of Gallard Martínez et al. with a meta-analysis of the specific methodological approach. I point out the function and, likewise, the importance of metaphors for modelling and theoretically conceptualizing research. I argue, that metaphors have a clarifying function in accentuating the focus and perspective of research, which, in consequence, influences the theoretical modelling, and, in particular, the choice of research methods and the data interpretation. I focus on the three concept domains, PIPELINE, PATHWAY and INTERSECTION, as each concept provides knowledge structure, which, in current research, is projected on STEM careers of women. Further, I elaborate limitations of the leaky pipeline metaphor, as it does not provide adequate structural similarities to highlight the situated social, cultural, and historical dimensions of STEM, as well as their materialization in individual experiences and the positioning of human beings. I close my contribution by highlighting approaches of intersectional analysis in the field of STEM.

AB  - The core curriculum accompanied the development of the academic discipline with multiple names such as Kinesiology, Exercise and Sport Science, and Health and Human Performance. It provides commonalties for undergraduate majors. It is timely to renew this curriculum. Renewal involves strategic reappraisals. It may stimulate change or reaffirm the status quo. Renewal of the core curriculum might include a retrospective analysis of conflicts and differences accompanying the academic discipline's development. These conflicts and differences remain salient today. They invite unified frameworks in substitution for the oft-divisive concepts of discipline and profession. The core curriculum can be linked to faculty identities, interests, and careers. Consequently, the preparation, career aspirations, and knowledge orientations of faculty merit consideration in the renewal process. Other renewal priorities include the curriculum's theory of learning as well as research on its outcomes and impacts. (Contains 1 figure and 14 endnotes.)

AB  - The disciplines of anatomy and surgery are not dichotomous since one is dependent on the other. Traditionally, surgeons predominantly taught gross and clinical anatomy. In this review, we examine the context of how human anatomy is taught nowadays. In essence, we discovered that there are certain discernable trends consistently observable between the American and British systems. In Singapore, the British Russell Group first influenced its education landscape but now more so by the American Ivy League. Singapore now has three medical schools all offering differing anatomy curricula, which serves as an opportune time for it to consider if there is a best approach given that the practice of surgery is also evolving in parallel. This review discusses the various pedagogies and issues involved, and will serve as a forum and stimulus for discussion. By tweaking the curriculum correctly and the lessons learnt, future doctors and surgeons in training will receive a better anatomical education, not just in Singapore but the world in general. Key recommendations include the use of body painting, clay, plasticine to facilitate the learning of anatomy, and the implementation of a body donation program. Furthermore, strategic mergers with key stakeholders will also ensure the survival of the discipline.
