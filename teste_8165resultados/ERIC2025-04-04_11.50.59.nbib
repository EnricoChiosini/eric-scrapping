AB  - The food-energy-water (FEW) nexus framework calls for a systems perspective on addressing complex sustainability challenges. As a sustainability science field, nexus research should in theory bring together transdisciplinary approaches drawing from a range of stakeholder knowledge and experiences. This approach would align with the competence-based training for future sustainability leaders advocated for in sustainability education literature. In practice, the field is dominated by techno-scientific approaches with superficial or peripheral attention paid to issues of social justice and community engagement. In this article, we explore how this imbalance in the literature reflects a breakdown between the ideals of sustainability training and the reality of training at the nexus and describe obstacles that may be contributing to this breakdown, including a prejudice towards the idea of "objective" science, institutional incentives, and disciplinary culture. To address these concerns, we introduce a research project focused on assessing the training of future researchers at the FEW nexus and exploring how these programs train students in particular views of what is important at the FEW nexus, such as technological solutions, stakeholder collaboration, and/or issues of equity and justice. It will also provide recommendations for creating open learning environments that are competence-based, and that incorporate multiple methods, acknowledgments of limitations, and alternate ways of knowing.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this paper is to discuss the importance of multidisciplinary training in the perceived development of social entrepreneurship competence. By means of a sample of an ethics class, this study seeks to argue the relevance of new social entrepreneurs having a broad training, beyond the knowledge they receive from the business area. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a quantitative analysis methodology. Based on the application of a validated questionnaire measuring the perceived development of social entrepreneurship competence, a longitudinal measurement was carried out at two points in time, at the beginning and at the end of an ethics course, in a sample population of 132 undergraduate students. Based on these results, a multifactorial diagnosis was made using a Z-test. Findings: Overall, the sample results did not show a significant improvement in their level of perception of students' development of the social entrepreneurship competence. However, the individual results of the perceived development of sub-competences that make up this competence did reflect some development, especially the sub-competence of social innovation. Thus, this study demonstrates that there is a measurable impact of the contribution of other disciplines, in this case the ethical education, in the training of new entrepreneurs, arguing the importance of multidisciplinary training. Practical implications: The results of this study contribute to the work of universities in developing social entrepreneurship competence. Based on its findings, institutions will be able to recognize the relevance of multidisciplinary training in the generation of new social entrepreneurs, valuing other disciplinary areas, such as humanities and social sciences, beyond training based exclusively on business knowledge. A key point to capitalize on in training practices for social entrepreneurship is "social innovation", due to the sense of transcendence and impact that universities should seek, precisely because of their social responsibility to create value. Originality/value: This research provides empirical evidence of the impact of ethics education on social entrepreneurship education. It argues the importance of reflecting on multidisciplinary education as a complementary element in the perceived development of social entrepreneurship competence in students.

AB  - Scientific knowledge is growing rapidly, particularly in biochemistry, an interdisciplinary subject in which the courses attract diverse students with varied disciplinary interests and career goals. Thus, there is a need to teach skills and concepts in biochemistry in a way that is both compelling to a variety of learners and also relevant to careers in science, health, and related areas. This article describes a pair of literature-based group writing assignments developed for a two-semester biochemistry sequence with 30-50 students per section. Adaptable to application in many biochemistry courses, these projects reinforce core threshold concepts while teaching information literacy skills and connecting to biochemistry applications in medicine and technology. Strategies for structured instruction and management prior to and during work on the assignments are presented for instructors in order to maximize student success and impact. While writing assignments have become commonplace in upper-division biology courses, such a matched pair of mini-review assignments for a two-semester biochemistry sequence interweaving information literacy, core concepts, and applications has not been reported previously. Improved performance from the first to second semester indicates that these assignments help students learn skills that are useful for self-directed learning.

AB  - Purpose: In times when digitized and blended learning paradigms are getting more profuse, the COVID-19 pandemic substantially changed the dynamics of this program, forcing all the courses to migrate to virtual modality. This study highlights the biological engineering courses at the University of the Republic (Universidad de la República) in Uruguay pertaining to the adaptations to virtual learning environments during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyzing its impact through the courses taught in the virtual setting. Design/methodology/approach: Global education has seen a significant paradigm shift over the last few years, changing from a specialized approach to a broader transdisciplinary approach. Especially in life sciences, different fields of specializations have started to share a common space in the area of applied research and development. Based on this transdisciplinary approach, the Biological Engineering program was designed at the University of the Republic (Universidad de la República), Uruguay. Findings: The new challenges posed by the virtual modality on the pedagogical areas like course design, teaching methodologies and evaluations and logistical aspects like laboratory-setting have sparked a considerable change in different aspects of the courses. However, despite the changes to virtual modality in this year, the student-performance showed an overall improvement compared to the last year. Originality/value: With the changing direction of pedagogy and research in biological engineering across the world, it is quintessential to adapt university courses to the same, promoting an environment where the scientific and engineering disciplines merge and the learning methodologies lead to a dynamic and adaptive ubiquitous learning environment.

AB  - Historically, societies have relied on universities and colleges to provide a space for young citizens to experiment with and explore the innovative approaches needed to address contemporary problems. Yet today, many universities serve as diploma mills that succeed in getting students onto the job market, but fail to give those students tools for real innovation. This article discusses the importance of college-level science classrooms practicing interdisciplinarity (combining of two or more academic disciplines into one activity). College-level science classrooms can practice interdisciplinarity by merging coursework at three levels: (1) between the trades and traditional learning; (2) among traditional divisions of knowledge (e.g., science and humanities); and (3) within traditional divisions of knowledge (e.g., within the sciences). Science courses could explicitly teach content and also explore real-world problems in lab sections. College science administrators and teachers can leverage role models by creating a culture of mentoring; by addressing heart, compassion, beauty, and critical thinking in the college classroom; thereby reclaiming their roles as leaders of progress and innovation, and thereby turning away from the diploma mill paradigm.

AB  - Purpose: The paper aims to explore and analyse the potential of campus living learning laboratory (LLL) as an integrated mechanism to provide the innovative and creative teaching and learning experiences, robust research output and strengthening the campus sustainability initiatives by using the sustainability science approach. Design/methodology/approach: The challenge to adopt sustainability science as an interdisciplinary approach juxtaposed against the structure, teaching and learning of single disciplinary approach in institution of higher education (IHE). The LLL approach can be one of the options on how the integrative teaching and learning, combination fundamental and applied research and campus operations should conduct to strengthen the implementation of campus sustainability. Findings: The review of application of LLL from several campus sustainability and combining with the experiences in conducting the UTM Campus sustainability results the strategic operational mechanism of the integration process. Research limitations/implications: The LLL approach which applies the sustainability science approach did not cover the challenges and issue related to the inter-, inter- and trans-disciplinary during the campus LLL application. Further study needs to be conducted to strengthen the fundamental approach to developing campus LLL as one approach to operationalizing the Sustainable Development agenda in IHE. Practical implications: The experiences and findings produces from this study help other campus sustainability to articulate the benefits of campus LLL initiatives, anticipate implementation challenges in teaching and learning, research output and the operation. The problem-solving nature of sustainability science provides a platform for implementing campus sustainability initiatives which allow inter-, inter- and trans-disciplinary approach for a more synergize effort of a real case study and project based approach. Social implications: Furthermore, the implementation of LLL challenges the researcher/academia to provide prompt response as part of societal learning process in strengthening applied-based research as well as to contribute to the fundamental research. Successful LLL approach require both top-down commitments from the top management of the university and bottom-up drive from interested faculty, core research themes, operations and students. Originality/value: The integrative framework and operational mechanism to operate LLL in campus sustainability which resulted from the analysis taken from several universities that implement campus sustainability is the origin values of significant contribution from this study.

AB  - The number of health psychology courses offered in higher education institutions has dramatically increased over the past 30 years. Health psychology courses provide students a unique opportunity to learn about important public health issues and health disparities affecting our society from a biopsychosocial perspective. Prior research indicates that students taking these courses, many of whom are non-biology majors, often report feeling anxious about learning the underlying biological mechanisms that affect health outcomes, particularly as they relate to stress and disease. Therefore, innovative teaching strategies, such as the use of active learning approaches, are needed to promote student confidence and engagement in learning these interdisciplinary models of health. Despite rapid advancements and innovations in health technologies, few health psychology courses have integrated these technologies as a modality of active learning. This article describes the implementation of health technologies (e.g., biosensors, biofeedback equipment, wearable technologies) as an active learning modality and innovative teaching approach to promote student engagement and learning outcomes in an undergraduate health psychology course taught in the U.S. Eighty students from a minority-serving university participated in this pilot course redesign. Student responses to the use of health technologies in their course were very positive. A description of the course curriculum is provided and results from student responses and feedback are presented. Implications and recommendations for implementing these technologies and pedagogies in future health courses are also discussed, including university support for sustaining these high impact teaching practices.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has been regarded as an essential skill set that students should acquire from their early years of life. As a thinking practice applicable to problem-solving processes, it has been argued that CT can be demonstrated and incorporated into other disciplines. While most studies have focused on CT integration with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), this article extends to the STEAM (science, technology, engineering, the arts, and mathematics) perspective with an emphasis on the role of the arts in early CT learning. After selecting nine representative studies in this area, we conducted an in-depth examination around three themes. First, we synthesized the definition and features of early CT in the selected literature. Second, we drew attention to how CT facilitates STEM learning for young children. Next, based on examining the third theme regarding arts integration with early CT, we identified future directions for researching CT in early childhood STEAM education. The investigation aims to inspire future scholarly efforts to provide powerful learning opportunities for young children by integrating early CT into interdisciplinary STEAM domains.

AB  - The aim of this study is to provide a current synthesis of Online Inquiry-Based Learning (OIBL) systems that use argumentation as a pedagogy. Data were collected from three databases: Scopus, Web of Science, and ERIC. The present review synthesized the findings of 73 studies from 2010 to June 2023. A qualitative content analysis was conducted to examine the inquiry-based systems regarding design features that support argumentation and learning outcomes. Four design features were identified: engaging students in unique and meaningful topics, providing visualization and scaffolding tools, collaborative inquiry in groups, and sharing and critiquing arguments. Most studies provided scaffolding and visualization support, while a few allowed students to engage in unique and meaningful topics. Most studies measured higher-level cognitive outcomes in contrast to lower-level outcomes. Future studies need to design systems for a more diverse population of students with improved collaboration support. In addition, this review identified a need to focus more on interdisciplinary topics rather than natural science.

AB  - Analysis of results from research in cognitive science and discipline-based education in recent years suggests that student thinking and learning can be better understood and investigated by adopting a systemic perspective that recognizes the complex and dynamic interactions taking place within and across multiple interconnected and interdependent levels that shape student reasoning in academic settings, including individual and classroom levels. In this first article, we review and discuss the results from research that have helped us better understand the complex system dynamics that characterize thinking and learning at the individual student level. The second article in the set [Talanquer et al. "J. Chem. Educ." 10.1021/acs.jchemed.3c00839] addresses issues at the classroom level. In both papers, we use our analysis to foreground major research insights gained in recent years and to summarize their implications for chemistry education.

AB  - Student engagement is a central concept for educational practitioners, researchers, and evaluators, especially working with learners historically minoritised in science developing their self-efficacy. Design-oriented projects in invention education show potential for promoting equitable engagement, partly by building upon learners' sociocultural backgrounds and experiences. However, the relationship between more social and more individual conceptions of student engagement is not yet well understood. We took a cultural psychology approach to design-based research for planning, implementing, and analysing a five-day camp in the Northeast US, wherein grades 6-8 students invented an electronic door and a free-choice invention. Our mixed-methods case study for convergence revealed some statistically significant changes in engagement and self-efficacy for inventing, which qualitative analyses suggest were related to campers' cognitive self-efficacy for ability with technology, campers' perceived agency for inter- and trans-disciplinary approaches to inventing, and the camp's social infrastructure for student participation. Further, we found evidence differentiating individual and social levels of affective/emotional, behavioural, and cognitive engagement, supporting a six-part model over previous three- and four-part models. We conclude with conjectures about the camp's enactment, learning processes, and outcomes, providing an educational model that could be useful in designing similar environments for user- or activity-centred design projects.

AB  - Aquaponics is the combination of aquaculture and hydroponic technology to grow fish and plants together. While aquaponics can play a role in food security, it may also be a potential educational tool because of its interdisciplinary nature and required technological skills. With aquaponics, students could conduct activities involving chemistry, physics, biology and sustainability to solidify their understanding of scientific theories. The interdisciplinary nature of aquaponics may make it an appealing tool for science education, yet that same aspect may also make an aquaponics system challenging to implement and manage. Given this paradox, this exploratory research assessed challenges and solutions facing aquaponics in education with a focus on implementation. In-depth interview data were collected through phone interviews with educators (N = 10) who currently, or had in the past five years, used an aquaponics system in educational settings in North America. Participants reported two challenges: technical difficulties as a result of the nature of aquaponics and restrictions as a result of school settings. Solutions given by participants were physical aquaponics system modifications and the development of community connections and support, passion for aquaponics and expertise. These findings will help educators manage their expectations for aquaponics while establishing objectives for their individual settings.

AB  - Collaborations between artists and scientists are increasingly a feature of the cultural landscape. Traditionally this relationship is seen as art in the service of science whereby artists use their skills to visually communicate complex scientific ideas. However, a hybrid form of collaborative, experimentally-driven practice has emerged over the last 30 years where artists and scientists work together to explore the creative possibilities and speculative futures represented by the intersection of these two 'cultures.' The MA Art in Science programme at Liverpool School of Art and Design facilitates discussions and interactions between subjects that have traditionally been studied in isolation within Higher Education. This paper details and discusses the theoretical foundations that have informed the curriculum design and its pedagogical ethos, describes the collaborative learning experiences at the heart of the programme, and offers an insight on how the programme's approach to transdisciplinary art-science collaborative practice could be utilised across disciplines.

AB  - The paper reports about a study that examines changes in teachers' incorporation of epistemic practices in their design of engineering lessons and compares them to their views about the nature of engineering knowledge across 100 hours of professional development. Nineteen K-8 teachers in the USA, who were new to teaching engineering as part of a shift in science learning standards, participated. We focused on four areas of engineering practice and epistemology, namely the orientation of engineering toward solutions, the role of context in defining engineering design specifications, the role and nature of data and evidence, and the interdisciplinary nature of science and engineering. Comparisons of changes in teachers' incorporation of epistemic practices show some reflection of changes in their views about the nature of engineering knowledge. Comparisons suggest that they were able to design instruction with appropriate epistemic practices while not necessarily understanding related features of the nature of engineering.

AB  - The interdisciplinary aspect of natural disasters requires their correlation with more than one discipline and orientation for understanding and teaching the inevitable nature of disasters. This study aimed to design a teacher training program called the Interdisciplinary Disaster Education Program (IDEP) and reveal its effect on improving teachers' natural disaster literacy. Furthermore, teachers' opinions about program were examined. The mixed-method design was used in the study. The study participants consisted of 36 teachers (science, classroom, and social studies teachers) working on different subjects. Data were obtained using the Natural Disaster Literacy Scale and the survey for the IDEP. The data collected from the scale were analyzed using two-way mixed ANOVA. The qualitative data collected from the survey were subjected to content analysis. The results indicated that the IDEP statistically improved teachers' natural disaster literacy. Moreover, the survey results highlighted that different instructional activities (experiments, modeling, workshops, rock/soil analysis, coding, augmented reality, and STEM applications, etc.) related to natural disasters contributed to a lot of professional and personal knowledge of teachers, particularly disaster management.

AB  - As introductory chemistry courses expose students to many distinctive properties of matter, it is helpful to systematically evaluate and relate different measures such as mass, moles, and molarity, or specific heat capacity and heat capacity. Intensive and extensive designations help distinguish intrinsic and component properties of a system and are often introduced to students, but they are infrequently explored or exploited beyond introductory chapters. Intensive metrics used to address green chemistry principles include process mass efficiency, median lethal dose, and radiative forcing. These sustainability metrics build on fundamental measures introduced in general chemistry such as yield, concentration, and energy by collecting extensive components of a system with complementary intensive measures. As interdisciplinary sustainability metrics bridge scales and systems and connect chemical, environmental, and engineering concerns, they can be used to help further explain and employ concepts currently taught in a general chemistry course. This commentary serves to examine the extensive and intensive nature of measures found in a first-semester general chemistry course and classify them alongside relevant sustainability metrics. While general chemistry is not necessarily an outlet to fully explore these metrics, the introduction and exploration of these metrics, such as process mass efficiency in relation to yield, may better allow them to practice general chemistry learning objectives both inside and outside the classroom.

AB  - An increasing culture of performativity has led to changes in the organizational landscape of academic institutions. While the impact of these changes on outputs is well documented, their impact on academics' strategic research agendas is still an emerging topic. This study expands upon previous research on this issue and focuses on comparing these dynamics across all fields of science using a global sample of academics. We found that most of the relationships between organizational features and research agendas were mostly consistent across disciplines, with variations mainly in the strength rather than the direction of effects. The perceived access to resources, autonomy, and collegiality was the key driver in promoting ambitious, collaborative, discovery-driven, and multidisciplinary agendas. Furthermore, our findings suggest a concerning trend in research institutions: academics that are more willing to stay in their institutions and are more aligned with its demands are less inclined to pursue trailblazing agendas. Although most of these effects were universal, some field-specific dynamics are also discussed, notably in what concerns the so-called "hard" sciences. This study highlights the importance of promoting a collegial environment with a high degree of autonomy to foster discovery-driven research and underscores the potential risks of the "publish or perish" culture prevalent in academia.

AB  - Mind, brain, and education is a field developed with two key purposes: (1) to accelerate the knowledge developed through research by using an interdisciplinary approach, and (2) to create a bridge to connect and apply this knowledge to educational practice. While great progress has been made with regard to the interdisciplinary efforts of mind, brain and education, a chasm remains between the fields of science and educational practice. This article presents the case for bridging that chasm through the development of a translational and bidirectional framework that allows the fields of science and educational practice to access and influence each other. The characteristics of such a framework are proposed as theory-driven and perspective-neutral, interdisciplinary and interdependent, grounded in the science of development, context-sensitive, and allowing for falsifiability. Potential enablers for the successful implementation of such a framework are proposed.

AB  - This study featured findings from a three-year National Science Foundation (NSF) funded research project at a STEM focused college. 'Project Synapse' was developed to build relevance between disciplines through authentic collaborations between biology and chemistry content. Integrated science practices were explicitly addressed during investigations of interdisciplinary topics such as microscopy and redox reactions. This study focused on the impact of one integrated laboratory-based intervention on student nature of science (NOS) understanding. Using a previously validated survey, Views on Nature of Science (VNOS), student NOS knowledge was assessed at the beginning and end of the academic school year. Structured interviews were conducted to gather a more indepth understanding of student thinking. Additional qualitative data sets included participant observations of labs, interviews with in instructors, and focus groups with students. Project Synapse students performed better on both the pre and post assessments of NOS understanding. At the close of the academic year, Project Synapse students scored higher in the domains of inference and theoretical entities in science and nature of scientific theories as compared to students not exposed to the model. Students in both the control and experimental group struggled to discriminate between theories and laws or provide specific examples. his integrated model offered a more authentic look at the actual practices of science through investigations that extended beyond a single subject area. Findings suggest that this collaborative instructional model may provide greater opportunities to address NOS content throughout the school year.

AB  - In this three-part article we seek to establish connections between the emerging framework of "sustainability science" and the methodological basis of research and practice in science education in order to bring forth knowledge and competences for sustainability. The first and second parts deal with the implications of taking a sustainability view in relation to knowledge processes. The complexity, uncertainty and urgency of global environmental problems challenge the foundations of reductionist Western science. Within such debate, the proposal of sustainability science advocates for inter-disciplinary and inter-paradigmatic collaboration and it includes the requirements of "post-normal science" proposing a respectful dialogue between experts and non-experts in the construction of new scientific knowledge. Such a change of epistemology is rooted into participation, deliberation and the gathering of extended-facts where cultural framings and values are the hard components in the face of soft facts. A reflection on language and communication processes is thus the focus of knowledge practices and educational approaches aimed at sustainability. Language contains the roots of conceptual thinking (including scientific knowledge) and each culture and society are defined and limited by the language that is used to describe and act upon the world. Within a scenario of sustainability, a discussion of scientific language is in order to retrace the connections between language and culture, and to promote a holistic view based on pluralism and dialogue. Drawing on the linguistic reflection, the third part gives examples of teaching and learning situations involving prospective science teachers in action-research contexts: these activities are set out to promote linguistic integration and to introduce reflexive process into science learning. Discussion will focus on the methodological features of a learning process that is akin to a communal and emancipatory research process within a sustainability scenario.

AB  - Learning Management Systems are instructional platforms that offer opportunities to address the development of core competencies across disciplines. The emergence of instructional models which place greater emphasis on core skill development in science education help to build interdisciplinary communities through curricular connectivity and complementary contextual learning applications. Herein we report on an interconnected core concept and skills approach combining the blended structured use of the Learning Management System (LMS) with a core curricular context for biology and chemistry content. This hybrid was applied to the entry chemistry course for science majors. The threefold interconnected biology-chemistry core concept umbrella areas are Chemical Identity/Matter Classification, the Mole Concept, and Energy. A web-facilitated pedagogy was utilized for the complementary entry-level biological science course. The results provide preliminary evidence of the potential of this instructional approach as a means to both build interdisciplinary community in STEM education and innovate instruction for improved learning outcomes.

AB  - Wesley College is a private, primarily undergraduate minority-serving institution located in the historic district of Dover, Delaware (DE). The College recently revised its baccalaureate biological chemistry program requirements to include a one-semester Physical Chemistry for the Life Sciences course and project-based experiential learning courses using instrumentation, data-collection, data-storage, statistical-modeling analysis, visualization, and computational techniques. In this revised curriculum, students begin with a traditional set of biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics major core-requirements, a geographic information systems (GIS) course, a choice of an instrumental analysis course or a statistical analysis systems (SAS) programming course, and then, students can add major-electives that further add depth and value to their future post-graduate specialty areas. Open-sourced georeferenced census, health and health disparity data were coupled with GIS and SAS tools, in a public health surveillance system project, based on US county zip-codes, to develop use-cases for chronic adult obesity where income, poverty status, health insurance coverage, education, and age were categorical variables. Across the 48 contiguous states, obesity rates are found to be directly proportional to high poverty and inversely proportional to median income and educational achievement. For the State of Delaware, age and educational attainment were found to be limiting obesity risk-factors in its adult population. Furthermore, the 2004-2010 obesity trends showed that for two of the less densely populated Delaware counties; Sussex and Kent, the rates of adult obesity were found to be progressing at much higher proportions when compared to the national average.

AB  - The modern world can be described as a globalized risk society. It is characterized by increasing complexity, unpredictable consequences of techno-scientific innovations and production, and its environmental consequences. Therefore, chemistry, just like many other knowledge areas, is in an ongoing process of "environmentalization." For example, green chemistry has emerged as a new chemical metadiscipline and movement. The philosophy of green chemistry was originally based on a suggestion of twelve principles for environment-friendly chemistry research and production. The present article problematizes limitations in green chemistry when it comes to education. It argues that the philosophy of green chemistry in the context of education needs to be extended with socio-critical perspectives to form educated professionals and citizens who are able to understand the complexity of the world, to make value-based decisions, and to become able to engage more thoroughly in democratic decision-making on sustainability issues. Different versions of sustainability-oriented science/chemistry education are discussed to sharpen a focus on the most complex type, which is "Bildung"-oriented, focusing emancipation and leading to eco-reflexive education. The term "eco-reflexive" is used for a problematizing stance towards the modern risk society, an understanding of the complexity of life and society and their interactions, and a responsibility for individual and collective actions towards socio-ecojustice and global sustainability. The philosophical foundation and characteristics of eco-reflexive science education are sketched on in the article.

AB  - The community engagement project described in this article took the form of the re-invention and re-interpretation of a historic symbol (Diana the elephant) on the Potchefstroom Campus of North-West University (NWU), South Africa. In 2015, the Faculty of Education Sciences invited staff and students to reinterpret the elephant (a symbol of education, longevity, wisdom, care, stamina, memory) in a new and more multicultural, multilingual, inclusive and environmentally conscious South Africa. The participatory process described, and the related outcomes, involved learning by students and academics across disciplines (the conceptualisation, design, engineering and creation of the structure) and collaboration between academics, children and adults from the community, all with a strong service-learning dimension in relation to teacher education.

AB  - This commentary was stimulated by Yeping Li's first editorial (2014) citing one of the journal's goals as adding multidisciplinary perspectives to current studies of single disciplines comprising the focus of other journals. In this commentary, I argue for a greater focus on STEM integration, with a more equitable representation of the four disciplines in studies purporting to advance STEM learning. The STEM acronym is often used in reference to just one of the disciplines, commonly science. Although the integration of STEM disciplines is increasingly advocated in the literature, studies that address multiple disciplines appear scant with mixed findings and inadequate directions for STEM advancement. Perspectives on how discipline integration can be achieved are varied, with reference to multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary approaches adding to the debates. Such approaches include core concepts and skills being taught separately in each discipline but housed within a common theme; the introduction of closely linked concepts and skills from two or more disciplines with the aim of deepening understanding and skills; and the adoption of a transdisciplinary approach, where knowledge and skills from two or more disciplines are applied to real-world problems and projects with the aim of shaping the total learning experience. Research that targets STEM integration is an embryonic field with respect to advancing curriculum development and various student outcomes. For example, we still need more studies on how student learning outcomes arise not only from different forms of STEM integration but also from the particular disciplines that are being integrated. As noted in this commentary, it seems that mathematics learning benefits less than the other disciplines in programs claiming to focus on STEM integration. Factors contributing to this finding warrant more scrutiny. Likewise, learning outcomes for engineering within K-12 integrated STEM programs appear under-researched. This commentary advocates a greater focus on these two disciplines within integrated STEM education research. Drawing on recommendations from the literature, suggestions are offered for addressing the challenges of integrating multiple disciplines faced by the STEM community.

AB  - In this study, we sought to examine the influence of a 12-week design-based elective Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) course on pre-service chemistry teachers' content knowledge, STEM conceptions, and engineering and engineering design views. To attain the goals determined, we utilized five STEM activities starting with a daily-life problem and an iterative engineering design process to solve the problem. A chemistry test with 11 two-tier items, and interviews focusing on STEM and engineering conceptions were administered at the beginning and at the end of the course. Moreover, a reflection paper was collected after each activity. Eight junior pre-service chemistry teachers participated in the study voluntarily. Deductive and inductive data analyses were used to investigate the influence of the course on participants' content knowledge, STEM conceptions, and engineering and engineering design views. The results revealed that the design-based STEM course helped pre-service teachers deepen their content knowledge. Additionally, most of the participants defined integrated STEM education as an acronym (n = 6) and very few mentioned the interdisciplinary dimension of STEM education superficially at the beginning (n = 3). At the end, they mentioned interdisciplinary nature as connecting at least two dimensions of STEM, and they emphasized engaging in real-world problems, designing a product or process and inquiry-based and/or problem-based learning. Regarding engineering and engineering design views, a similar development was observed. Although their views were undeveloped or underdeveloped at the beginning, they enriched their views and mentioned defining criteria, creativity and integration to science and mathematics that are characteristics of engineering and design processes. Implications for including STEM courses in pre-service teacher education programs were provided.

AB  - In theory, STEM (interdisciplinary science, technology, engineering and mathematics) is cross-disciplinary and situated in real-world problem-solving contexts. In practice, STEM disciplines are often implemented separately using contrived contexts. This paper examines theoretical and empirical aspects of Montessori middle school science in the United States, and its alignment with the conceptual framework of integrated STEM. We selected Montessori adolescent environments because the Montessori philosophy involves interdisciplinary application contextualized in purposeful work and learning. Our research sought to investigate how Montessori middle schools have designed their science programs, and to situate these findings within the current landscape of STEM education and reform-based science. Based on the results of our survey of 96 U.S. Montessori middle schools, we argue Montessori offers an integrated educational approach that meaningfully situates academic disciplines to mirror local and global challenges, well supported by theory and literature on STEM and situated learning theories. We assert that integrated STEM happens organically in many Montessori middle schools, and takes place through authentic work in communities of practice. Our research communicates the value of looking outside traditional school settings to examine alternative formal education spaces, like Montessori classrooms where integrated STEM happens organically.

AB  - In this article, the authors discuss the use of ecological concepts (ecology, boundary, niche) in educational research to understand if and how these concepts from one field of science (ecology) can bring a new understanding to another field of science (education). We have conducted a systematic search in the ERIC database to identify articles where key concepts from ecology, such as ecosystem, boundaries and niche, are used in educational research. An algorithm inspired by Rodger's (2000) contextual model of concept analysis was used to examine how the concepts contribute to explore, explain or understand an educational system or an educational process. We find that the use of ecology-oriented concepts is related to a circular rather than a linear causality between actors and environment and between thoughts and actions. Thus, an ecological educational approach is characterised by wholeness, and emphasizes context as well as the complex interconnected mechanisms in educational processes.

AB  - In physics education, equations are commonly seen as calculation tools to solve problems or as concise descriptions of experimental regularities. In physical science, however, equations often play a much more important role associated with the formulation of theories to provide explanations for physical phenomena. In order to overcome this inconsistency, one crucial step is to improve physics teacher education. In this work, we describe the structure of a course that was given to physics teacher students at the end of their master's degree in two European universities. The course had two main goals: (1) To investigate the complex interplay between physics and mathematics from a historical and philosophical perspective and (2) To expand students' repertoire of explanations regarding possible ways to derive certain school-relevant equations. A qualitative analysis on a case study basis was conducted to investigate the learning outcomes of the course. Here, we focus on the comparative analysis of two students who had considerably different views of the math-physics interplay in the beginning of the course. Our general results point to important changes on some of the students' views on the role of mathematics in physics, an increase in the participants' awareness of the difficulties faced by learners to understand physics equations and a broadening in the students' repertoire to answer "Why?" questions formulated to equations. Based on this analysis, further implications for physics teacher education are derived.

AB  - The ability to listen closely, speak clearly, write coherently, read with comprehension, and to create and critique media offerings in science contexts is essential for effective science teaching. How might instructors develop such abilities in a physics course for prospective elementary and middle school teachers? We describe here such a course, involving collaboration among physics, science education, and literacy faculty members and two graduate assistants. Meeting twice a week for 10 weeks, the course emphasized questioning, predicting, exploring, observing, discussing, writing, and reading in physical science contexts. We report common themes about aspects that fostered or hindered science and literacy learning, changes in views about science teaching and learning, and positive shifts in interest in science and intended teaching practices.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the clinical readiness of simulation-based education (SBE) in preparing nursing and midwifery students for clinical practice in sub-Saharan Africa. This study has synthesised the findings from existing research studies and provides an overview of the current state of SBE in nursing and midwifery programs in the region. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative meta-synthesis of previous studies was conducted using the following steps: developing a review question, developing and a search strategy, extracting and meta-synthesis of the themes from the literature and meta-synthesis of themes. Five databases were searched for from existing English literature (PubMed, Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Professional Literature [CINAHL], PsycINFO, EMBASE and ScienceDirect Medline, CINAHL and Science Direct), including grey literature on the subject. Eight qualitative studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa between 2014 and 2022 were included. Hawker et al.'s framework was used to assess quality. Findings: The following themes emerged from the literature. Theme 1: Improved skills and competencies through realism and repetition. Theme 2: Improved skills and competencies through realism and repetition. Theme 3: Improved learning through debriefing and reflection. Theme 4: Constraints of simulation as a pedagogical teaching strategy. Research limitations/implications: The qualitative meta-synthesis intended to cover articles from 2012 to 2022. Between 2012 and 2013, the authors could not identify purely qualitative studies from sub-Saharan Africa. The studies identified were either mixed methods or purely quantitative. This constitutes a study limitation. Practical implications: Findings emphasise educator training in SBE. Comprehensive multidisciplinary training, complemented by expertise and planned debriefing sessions, serves as a catalyst for fostering reflective learning. Well-equipped simulation infrastructure is essential in preparing students for their professional competencies for optimal patient outcomes. Additional research is imperative to improve the implementation of SBE in sub-Saharan Africa. Originality/value: The originality and value of SBE in nursing and midwifery programs in sub-Saharan Africa lie in its contextual relevance, adaptation to resource constraints, innovative teaching methodologies, provision of a safe learning environment, promotion of interprofessional collaboration and potential for research and evidence generation. These factors contribute to advancing nursing and midwifery education and improving healthcare outcomes in the region. This study fills this gap in the literature.

AB  - The aim with this study was to analyse and explore how physical sciences, engineering science and technology subjects (technical electrical technology, technical civil technology, technical mechanical technology) can contribute to the alignment of the technical sciences curriculum. We used document analysis to collect data. An analysis of the curriculum and assessment policy statements (CAPS) for technical sciences, physical sciences, electrical technology, civil technology, mechanical technology, and textbooks for engineering science was done. The findings of the study suggest that the technical science curriculum is a replica of the physical science curriculum. We recommend that the technical sciences curriculum be reviewed such that relevant scientific concepts can be used to bridge the gaps identified in the curriculum. The implications are that a new, aligned technical sciences curriculum that is relevant for technology subjects must be developed.

AB  - Calculus is one of the primary avenues for initial quantitative training of students in all science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, but life science students have been found to underperform in the traditional calculus setting. As a result, and because of perceived lack of its contribution to the understanding of biology, calculus is being actively cut from biology program requirements at many institutions. Here, we present an alternative: a model for learning mathematics that sees the partner disciplines as crucial to student success. We equip faculty with information to engage in dialogue within and between disciplinary departments involved in quantitative education. This includes presenting a process for interdisciplinary development and implementation of biology-oriented Calculus I courses at two institutions with different constituents, goals, and curricular constraints. When life science students enrolled in these redesigned calculus courses are compared with life science students enrolled in traditional calculus courses, students in the redesigned calculus courses learn calculus concepts and skills as well as their traditional course peers; however, the students in the redesigned courses experience more authentic life science applications and are more likely to stay and succeed in the course than their peers who are enrolled in traditional courses. Therefore, these redesigned calculus courses hold promise in helping life science undergraduate students attain "Vision and Change" recommended competencies.

AB  - This forum paper is a reflection about the paper written by Valérie Frède and illustrates how it influences my work as a Ph.D. student in education. It focuses mainly on the relationship to knowledge and the clash between student culture and Western science culture in classroom. In this forum paper, I will briefly explain why these two ideas seems important to me, and then use the example of climate education to illustrate why it is important to inform a socioconstructivist and transformative way of teaching in science classroom. It also contributes to assert the responsibility we have, as teachers or researchers, to value youth initial conceptions about consensual concepts like night-and-day cycle or more interdisciplinary or complex issue like climate change. [This paper addresses issues raised in Valérie Frède's "Comprehension of the Night and Day Cycle Among French and Cameroonian Children Aged 7-8 Years" (EJ1226677).]

AB  - Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) is an educational approach that integrates language learning with content teaching of subjects such as science. The CLIL approach regards culture a core component, however, science teachers often struggle to integrate a cultural component in their lessons. This study describes a pedagogical intervention using CLIL in a state school in Bogotá, Colombia. The first cycle of an action research project was implemented over the course of 1 year with 50 students (aged 15-19 years) and their teacher. Students used technology-enhanced CLIL-based environmental learning projects to integrate content (science) and a vehicular language (English). Questionnaires, a teacher's journal, artefacts, and interviews were used to collect data. The findings show students' positive perceptions of CLIL and highlight the value of explicitly considering a cultural component in science lessons, framed through a lens of scientific citizenship. Implications for CLIL and science education are discussed.

AB  - The practical work described here is designed for third-year bachelor students in Life Sciences attending a kidney physiology course. It illustrates how urinary biochemistry can be used for a medical diagnosis. Students have to measure glucose, proteins, and creatinine concentrations in three simulated urine samples. First, they independently elaborate detailed protocols from the biochemical kit's technical sheets. Second, after correction of the protocols by the teacher, they perform the biochemical assays. Finally, students write a report in which they interpret the biochemical data and use them in the context of histological images assigned to each urine sample. With their results, their theoretical background and scientific articles supplied by the teacher, they establish the diagnosis indicating which patients are diseased and from which disease they are suffering (diabetes without nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy or hypertensive nephropathy). The originality of this practical work is to give student autonomy from the start of the project by requiring them to write the protocols, and determine the diagnosis by themselves. Simple and inexpensive, this practical forces students to mobilize their knowledge in renal physiology and pathophysiology as well as those acquired in other disciplines such as biochemistry or cellular biology. A survey conducted on two classes of students confirmed that this type of training helps students to better understand renal physiology, to realize the importance of interdisciplinarity (biochemistry, histology, and physiology) and to develop confidence in their ability to work independently.

Data analysis techniques applied were: collecting data, presenting data, and drawing conclusions. The results of this study were the school's vision and mission, parents, science teachers and religion teachers caused students to like or dislike science. Students assessed science as important because it was a provision to continue higher education, it was useful for carrying out daily activities, and it had historical considerations to restore the glory of Islam through science. Pleasant learning, creative packaging, being able to motivate, to connect science and religion, investigative activities, being humorous, being able to connect science with everyday life and to explain well were students' perceptions of a good teacher. The reasons students selected Tahfidz boarding school were the attitudes of science teachers, religion teachers, its school vision and mission, and attitudes of parents. Pleasant learning by a professional teacher was conducted by presenting creative learning, and having good emotional control. The implication of the results of this research is that the management of science learning in religious-based Islamic boarding schools needs to pay attention to the desires and needs of students in learning.

AB  - Despite advancements in global communication and interpersonal networks, in-person discussions and scholarly discourses often falter in the classroom--stifling innovation and preventing opportunities to foster deeper human connection. This study explores the remedy of facilitation: the art and science of enabling a group to unleash its creativity, address conflict, and unlock collective wisdom. Authors present a variety of facilitation techniques used in teaching honors students (n = 13) and closely examine how students articulate their personal learning outcomes after practicing effective facilitations. Liberating structures, which engage everyone in problem-solving, practicing self-discovery, and envisioning potential solutions, are used. Reflective assessments indicate student growth and skill development, including flexibility, adaptability, and communicative agility. With honors programs and colleges as loci for multidisciplinary learning and holistic leadership development, authors encourage practitioners to take active roles in fostering the next generation of facilitators. Ideas for future curricular adaptations are presented.

AB  - In times of rapid technological innovation and global challenges, the development of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) competencies becomes important. They improve the personal scientific literacy of citizens, enhance international economic competitiveness and are an essential foundation for responsible citizenship, including the ethical custodianship of our planet. The latest programme for international student assessment results, however, indicate that even in economically mature countries such as those in Europe, and the USA and Australia, approximately 20% of students lack sufficient skills in mathematics or science. This trend serves to highlight the urgent need for action in relation to STEM education. While it is widely acknowledged that mathematics underpins all other STEM disciplines, there is clear evidence it plays an understated role in integrated STEM education. In this article, we address an element of this concern by examining the role of mathematics within STEM education and how it might be advanced through three interdisciplinary approaches: (1) twenty-first century skills; (2) mathematical modelling; and (3) education for responsible citizenship. At the end of the paper we discuss the potential for research in relation to these three aspects and point to what work needs to be done in the future.

AB  - English is widely recognized as an international language for education communication, which has led to the development of several English for Academic Purposes (EAP) subjects for Thai students learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL), especially in specialized school programs. The primary objective of these EAP subjects is to prepare Thai students for academic success in an increasingly interconnected world. Therefore, appropriate learning materials are needed to enhance students' academic language proficiency and ability to engage in interdisciplinary studies. As part of a full research and development project, this preliminary study was conducted to investigate the voices of Thai secondary school students and teachers for theme-based learning materials design in an English for Science and Mathematics (ESM) subject. Focus group and individual interviews were used to explore the experiences and opinions of students and teachers in the Enrichment Program of Science, Mathematics, Technology, and Environment (SMTE). The study identified specific academic English literacy needs, including reading strategies, planning for paragraph writing, sentence structure, knowledge of vocabulary and grammar, and learning materials preferences of the SMTE students. These empirical findings could offer valuable insights for materials developers and English language teachers engaged in designing learning materials for students with specific needs.

AB  - In response to the globally escalating number of language learners tasked with learning science through a foreign language, this review seeks to bring new perspectives by reframing research findings, still dominated by historical language assumptions, through a contemporary language lens. We aim to unearth, amalgamate and expose the potentials of non-linguistic modes described by the theory of multiliteracies that appear sporadic and fragmentary within studies due to their linguistic focus, as we surmise they offer language learners alternative avenues for meaning-making. 40 peer-reviewed empirical studies published between 1995 and 2019 were systematically found and examined using theoretical thematic analysis to expand our understandings. We conjectured findings that appeared contingent upon non-linguistic modes but did not prominently feature in the reported results. In doing so, we used a multimodal and translanguaging lens from which three themes and educational implications emerged. The integration of non-linguistic modes in science: (1) aided language learners' science discourse, provided they had access to multiple modes and agency over expression; (2) facilitated multicultural learning communities validating each learner as a sense maker; and (3) promoted authentic and equitable learning experiences. Other noteworthy findings, such as the influence of the tactile mode, are discussed. Recommendations to future researchers include adopting epistemologies of language fitting to our century and developing transdisciplinary approaches to research.

AB  - This book contains the full text of papers and posters presented at the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2021), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (W.I.A.R.S.), that this year had to be transformed into a fully Virtual Conference as a result of the Coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic. Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2021 received 478 submissions, from more than 40 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters and Workshops. The conference accepted for presentation 160 submissions (34% acceptance rate), from which, 151 submissions are published in full text in this book. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. This book contains the results of the research and developments conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to promote growth in research methods intimately related to teaching, learning and applications in Education nowadays. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, who will extend our view in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues, by sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. [This document contains the proceedings of the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2021) (Virtual Conference). The proceedings were published by inScience Press.

AB  - Research suggests that a girl's career interests in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) declines between grades 6 and 8. Similarly, in middle school, there is a decrease in physical activity among girls. Researchers at the University of Rhode Island (URI) conducted a chemistry-based science camp that took place over the public school spring break with the goal of increasing girls' interest in chemistry and physical activity. The camp included 42 middle school age girls in grades 6 through 8 from schools throughout Rhode Island. Interdisciplinary curricula were created to link chemistry with physical activity concepts used in physical education classes. Overall, the girls enjoyed the interdisciplinary curriculum and found the connection between science and physical activity to be interesting; as a result, similar science-based interdisciplinary curricula may have the capacity to promote physical activity as well as STEM career interests in girls.

AB  - Recent reforms in science education have supported the inclusion of engineering in K-12 curricula. To this end, many science classrooms have incorporated engineering units that include design tasks. Design is an integral part of engineering and helps students think in creative and interdisciplinary ways. In this study, we examined middle-school students' naturally occurring design conversations in small design teams and their learning of science as a result of engaging in an engineering and science unit. We found that the proportion of different thought processes used by boys and girls was quite similar. Both girls and boys produced a higher percentage of ideas or thoughts associated with divergent thinking, but a lower proportion in convergent thinking, evaluative thinking, and cognitive memory. In addition, gender composition of design teams influenced thought processes expressed by girls and boys. Interestingly, in mixed teams, both girls and boys expressed less divergent thinking than those in single-sex teams. With regard to science content learning, both girls and boys showed statistically significant learning gains. There were no significant gender differences in the pre- and post-test scores. These results suggest that participating in an engineering design task in small design teams provided students opportunities to engage in productive thinking and enhance their learning of the targeted science concept--ecosystems.

AB  - The purpose of this investigation is to examine how teacher candidates create and teach lesson plans that include trade books and the 5E model of inquiry science. Specifically, this study examines how elementary school teacher candidates, enrolled in a science methods course, intended to use trade books to teach interdisciplinary science and English/Language Arts lessons using the 5E Model of Instruction (Bybee, 1997). Inductive qualitative analysis reveals that science trade books can be used to increase the amount of class time spent on science. Implications for elementary pre-service teacher preparation programs are discussed.

AB  - STEAM, where the "A" represents arts and humanities, is considered a transdisciplinary learning process that has the potential to increase diverse participation in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. However, a well-defined conceptual model that clearly articulates essential components of the STEAM approach is needed to conduct empirical research on STEAM's efficacy--in particular, the teaching content that should be considered when enacting STEAM teaching practices. This paper proposes a conceptual model of STEAM, providing educators with the opportunity to teach effectively using transdisciplinary inquiry. The instructional content domain of the model includes problem-based delivery, discipline integration, and problem-solving skills.

AB  - A pilot test for the design and construction of digital lessons for integrated social science teaching is presented in this study. Combing conventional texts, applications made with Google Earth, and images from the web, three lessons for the sixth grade were created: (1) Evolution of Man, (2) Physical Geography of the Earth, and (3) Pre-Columbian America. Interactive workshops were held with a group of 60 teachers from the city of Montería, Colombia, to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that allowed for the construction of a SWOT matrix. SWOT analysis allowed for the identification of educational limitations in Montería resulting from limited classroom access to computers and the internet and the insufficient teacher knowledge regarding information technology and geotechnologies. This analysis also allowed for the identification of guidelines for the development of digital lessons. These lessons serve as a methodological proposal for teaching social science, promoting the integration of such topics as geography, history, and environmental science. This integrative method motivated the teachers, who believed that it could be a path to true integration of the social sciences.

AB  - Integrating engineering and technology concepts into K-12 science and math curricula through engineering design project-based learning has been found to increase students' interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), however preparing teachers to shift to interdisciplinary teaching remains a significant challenge. Primarily teachers need to develop both skills and attitudes toward interdisciplinary teaching. In doing so, professional development (PD) is considered a key component in helping teachers through this transformation process. In an educational environment of accountability, measuring the effects of PD programs on teacher behaviors and capacity is essential but often elusive. The current study describes the change in attitudes to interdisciplinary teaching of 29 self-selected middle and high school teachers who participated a PD workshop and in delivering a 12-15 week interdisciplinary teaching and design problem unit that spanned multiple STEM subjects. This quasi-experimental pilot study implemented a single group pretest-posttest design using survey methods to collect data from the participants at two intervals; at the time of the PD workshop and at the completion of the teaching unit that emphasized a long-term engineering design problem. The goals of this research are to (1) assess the changes in attitudes to interdisciplinary teaching, attitudes to teamwork, teaching satisfaction, and resistance to change, (2) explore relationships among these changes, (3) and describe the variation in these changes across teachers' gender, school level, discipline taught, and education level.

AB  - Understanding the nature of science (NOS) has emerged as a core curricular goal since at least the 1960s. While science education reforms around the world have shed light on various epistemic and social underpinnings of science, how science curriculum documents portray the nature of other related disciplines such as mathematics and engineering has drawn little attention. Such lack of attention is surprising, given the growing interest among educators in the integrated approach to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and the frequent emphasis on STEM in recent curriculum policy. The study reported in this paper aimed to understand how recent science education reform documents from the USA, Korea and Taiwan compare with regard to their representation of the nature of STEM disciplines. Using the framework of the family resemblance approach (FRA), we present a comparative analysis of three recent science education standards documents to examine their coverage of the epistemic underpinnings of STEM disciplines, particularly with regard to the disciplinary aims, values and practices. The results indicate that the features specific to science and shared by science and engineering were most frequently addressed in the standards documents, whereas mathematics-related features were rarely mentioned. Furthermore, there was variation in the coverage in terms of the nature of STEM disciplines. Based on the findings, we discuss the contributions of the FRA framework in analysing STEM curricula in an interdisciplinary manner and make suggestions for integrating the nature of STEM disciplines in science curriculum documents.

AB  - Harmful plastic debris found on beaches and in the oceans are not limited to drinking straws or bags. There are several synthetic organic polymers that can be used to make different kinds of plastic materials and have resulted in billions of tons of waste that can reach the aquatic biome and are harmful to freshwater and marine communities as well as humans. Small pieces, known as microplastics, are very small (<5mm) and can readily be ingested by marine organisms, causing dangerous threats to the food supply chain. Although plastic debris appears as particles of varying size, shape, color, and chemical composition, its origin or source cannot easy be identified by the naked eye. Sometimes, it is also difficult to identify whether debris is made of plastics materials. However, plastic debris sources can be revealed by applying basic concepts of the interaction of infrared radiation with matter. If a sample is irradiated with infrared light, a part of the radiation can be absorbed and provide detailed information about the structure of chemical compounds, such as the arrangement of nuclei and chemical bonds within the molecule. Chemical features of a molecule allow identification of the type of polymer that makes up a plastic material. In this paper the authors describe a multidisciplinary approach to teaching the interaction of infrared light and the vibrating process of molecules to characterize plastic pollutants. The practical classes involve both indoor and outdoor activities, divided into four steps: choice of case study site; plastic debris sampling; sample preparation and physical and chemical characterization of plastic debris (size, color, shape and polymer type); data interpretation and identification of the main plastic debris sources. The first three steps, which include outdoor activities, can also be performed by students of all ages, as well as by geography, environmental science and biology teachers who are fundamental in multidisciplinary studies. The data interpretation step that involves the polymer identification is performed at the laboratory, by using ATR-FTIR and/or optical transmittance sensor systems. Finally, the identification of the main plastic debris sources and the final conclusions are tasks that can be performed in a multidisciplinary way.

AB  - In order to motivate secondary school pupils for STEM studies and professions, a teaching approach with a focus on integration of STEM components is developed. This paper focuses on the integration of physics and mathematics into an engineering design problem in K10 education, namely building and heating a model of a passive house with a sun boiler. Specific attention is given to the core ideas of integrated STEM while developing this module. These applied ideas comprise problem-centered and cooperative learning, with explicit attention to research and design, as well as taking into account results from discipline specific educational research results.

AB  - How can school mathematics prepare citizens for a democratic society? Answers to this question are not static; they change as society and its problems change. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with its corresponding disease COVID-19 presents such a problem: what is needed to navigate this complex situation that involves, among other things, mathematics? Using the essay genre, we use three narratives from three countries--Italy, the USA (California), and Germany--to reflect on the goals of teaching mathematics during this crisis and examine aspects of each country's standards for mathematics education. These three stories are framed by the authors' backgrounds, experiences, interests, their country's situation, and response to the pandemic. We first present the three narratives and then examine common issues across them that might provide insights beyond this current crisis, for preparing students to become active citizens. In particular, we focus on three issues: (1) developing a positive mindset toward mathematics to engage with and reflect on real-world problems, (2) improving interdisciplinary connections to the sciences to better understand how science professional practices and insights are similar or different from everyday practices, and (3) considering interpersonal and collective matters beyond the individual.

AB  - Long before "fake news" became a catchphrase, misguided beliefs about scientific truths undermined the free exercise of democracy and personal decision-making. Journalistic norms such as providing false balance in the name of "objectivity," deliberate manipulation by vested interests, and the human tendency toward confirmation bias combined to enable the dissemination of damaging misinformation about tobacco, climate change, vaccines, nuclear power, genetically modified foods, and other topics critical to the health and welfare of the modern world. This article examines an innovative new course designed to teach a mixed group of journalism and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) majors to evaluate expertise and bias, examine data and misrepresentation, and develop evidence-based communication on complex scientific topics. The course covered concepts such as fact-checking, validation, fraud, the "backfire effect," confirmation bias, limitations of the scientific method, conspiracy theories, misuse of statistics, and the role of journalists and scientists as truth-tellers in society. Journalism and science students learned to communicate with each other and with their respective audiences. A series of critical thinking assignments culminated in a final project where students, working in mixed teams, developed an interactive multimedia project communicating a controversial science topic to the public. This interdisciplinary course is offered as one model for teaching science literacy and information literacy to journalism and STEM students.

AB  - The science of learning (learning science) is an emerging interdisciplinary field that concerns itself with how the brain learns and remembers important information. The authors describe an innovative extracurricular program that introduced first-year undergraduate students in engineering to learning science, specifically the biological steps in the learning process and study strategies consistent with that process. The evaluation of the first two years of the program included data about attendance, satisfaction, grade point average, retention, and learning approach. This article describes the program and its evaluation findings, and the authors offer a critique in light of expert opinion and relevant research in order to improve program evaluation, recruitment, retention, and possibly effectiveness.

AB  - Over the last two decades, the growth and development of the fields of Dance Science and Pedagogy, as practice, research and area of study, has changed the landscape of 21st Century training and performance. The aim of this paper is to stimulate thinking and initiate dialogue between practitioners and academics in the exploration of new solutions to ongoing pedagogical tensions within the vocational training environment. In recognising the challenge which an interdisciplinary approach brings to dance (integrating the science of content and the art of delivery), this paper explores the integration of coaching pedagogical concepts and practices, to inform an innovative approach to dancer empowerment, placing the dancer central to the learning environment. The paper proposes an empowered dancer focused framework for coaching with the emphasis being placed on the development of the dancer displaying the skills of self-determined, decision-making and are empowered across the life cycle of their career(s).

AB  - Public administration can be considered as an applied, interdisciplinary field, whose study demands the contribution of a range of disciplines, including political science, management, law, sociology and others. The article argues that the disciplines of public administration should also include philosophy, not as a discipline (philosophy is not a discipline in the sense modern sciences are; rather, at the roots of philosophy are key questions: what there is (ontology); who we are (philosophy of the mind); how to live well (ethics); how to live well together (political philosophy) and so on) but as the foundation of all the other disciplines studying public administration, from political science (whose roots are in political philosophy), to management and sociology (whose underpinnings are in ontological conceptions of the individual and society), to law (whose roots are in the philosophy of law) and so on. If philosophy is foundational to public administration, then two key questions arise: in researching public administration, what is the contribution of philosophy to advancing our understanding of public administration? And in the teaching of public administration, what is the place of philosophy in the curricula of public administration programmes? The article, after briefly reviewing the philosophical foundations of public administration, aims to discuss the latter question about the contribution of philosophy to educational and training programmes in the field of public administration, and the place of philosophy in public administration education curricula.

AB  - Purpose: Interprofessional practice (IPP) is one way to structure collaborations to more effectively meet the complex needs of students in educational settings. This article explores the lessons learned when one research team implemented interprofessional education (IPE) experiences in partnership with a public elementary school and pre-service professionals from elementary education, special education and communication science and disorders. Design/methodology/approach: This reflective article explores the lived experiences of researchers and partners who completed an IPE experience within one professional development school's site. Researcher anecdotes are included to support the viewpoints shared. Findings: It was discovered that IPE experiences are essential to facilitate meaningful collaborations for pre-service professionals to learn with and from one another; however, this requires time, preparation and is most effective when teacher mentors and university professors lead with vulnerability and model flexibility. Investment in IPE is challenging but worth the effort when learning outcomes are realized. Originality/value: Specific details regarding the structure of this experience are shared as well as future directional goals for programs hoping to implement IPE in their professional practice programs.

AB  - The interdisciplinary science of conservation biology provides undergraduate biology students with the opportunity to connect the biological sciences with disciplines including economics, social science and philosophy to address challenging conservation issues. Because of its complexity, students do not often have the opportunity to practise conservation biology. To increase exposure to this science, this paper describes a virtual rainforest island on which students collect data related to forest carbon storage, while also confronting ethical issues. Students are asked to independently make decisions, collect data and explore the island before writing a research report with recommendations for the future management of the island's forests. The ethics of decision-making are addressed in the students' research reports and are reinforced through guided class discussion. Students will complete this activity with increased ethical awareness, as well as a better understanding of the challenges associated with the practise of conservation biology.

AB  - This study, undertaken in the Northwest USA, explores how graduate students in an interdisciplinary social-ecological systems research course engaged with concepts of epistemic difference and Indigenous knowledge as part of a required module titled "Ways of Knowing" to engage social and ecological change in climate science. We describe how graduate students engaged with Indigenous ways of knowing and discussion of interdisciplinary equity across knowledge systems and methodologies. Analysis of student perspectives drawn from fieldnotes, student course work, and post-course interviews illuminates tensions in preparing interdisciplinary science researchers to navigate epistemic difference. Students embraced Indigenous ways of knowing as useful for conceptualizing complex tensions in social-ecological systems research, while simultaneously sidestepping deeply rooted issues of power and coloniality in research. We trace two primary ways Indigenous ways of knowing informed interdisciplinary processes in students' conceptualizations of social-ecological challenges: Science as more expansive: Reflexivity and interpersonal dilemmas; and Grappling with power and settler colonial discomfort. We argue that continued engagement in epistemic difference, particularly Indigenous knowledges, is necessary for cultivating scientific engagement in complex notions of knowledge equity in climate sciences involving Indigenous peoples/lands. Finding underscore how changes in graduate research training can expand research imaginaries, however, such expansions need to be systematic and multi-stranded to interrupt the deep-rooted marginalization of non-Western knowledges in scientific research.

AB  - An interdisciplinary approach provides many benefits that warrant the need for its use at technical universities teaching foreign language as an academic discipline. This article reviews recent Russian researches focused on interdisciplinary integration, summarizes advantages and proves overall high efficacy of the interdisciplinary approach to teaching a foreign language for students. When taken as a basis, this approach was found to open up new prospects for implementation of didactic principles of learning at foreign language classes. The article describes the implementation of the principles of interdisciplinary coordination, systematicity and consistency, scientificity, occupational focus, visualization, affordability, strength, consciousness, pro-active behavior, educational training, availability, focus on student's individual character, and intercultural interaction within the framework of the interdisciplinary approach. Incorporation of these principles is demonstrated using training of students of the National Research Nuclear University MEPhI [Moscow Engineering Physics Institute] as an example. At MEPhI, students learn a foreign language during the entire period of their education and study the following credit modules: Introduction into General Technical Foreign Language; General Technical Foreign Language; Occupation-oriented Foreign Language; Foreign Language for Occupation-oriented Communication, Business Communication; Foreign Language for Academic Research; and Communication Foreign Language (in-depth study).

AB  - This paper describes the development and implementation of engaging and supportive experiences to promote student engagement, persistence, and success at a commuter, open enrollment, public, minority-serving institution. Project components included faculty development at the SENCER Summer Institute (SSI) 2016, attended by a team comprised of an academic administrator, full-time faculty from English and math, and part-time faculty in chemistry; creation of a virtual learning community of freshmen enrolled in chemistry, English, and math, linked by the specific theme of the environmental impacts of de-icing roads with salt and the overarching theme of the impacts of human activities on the environment; and peer mentoring in chemistry. Faculty reflections and grade distributions indicate this is a promising approach and suggest strategies for overcoming challenges.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: This study was aimed at enhancing students' learning of software engineering methods. A collaboration between the Computer Science, Business Management, and Product Design programs was formed to work on actual projects with real clients. This interdisciplinary form of collaboration simulates the realities of a diverse Software Engineering team. Background: A collaborative approach implemented through projects has been the established pedagogy for introducing the Software Engineering course to undergraduate Computer Science students. The collaboration, however, is limited to collaboration among Computer Science students and their clients. This case study explored an enhancement to the collaborative approach to project development by integrating other related disciplines into the project development framework; hence, the Interdisciplinary Approach. Methodology: This study adopted the case method approach. An interdisciplinary service innovation activity was proposed to invite other disciplines in the learning process of the computer science students. The agile methodology Scrum was used as the software development approach during project development. Survey data were collected from the students to establish (a) their perception of the interdisciplinary approach to project development; (b) the factors that influenced success or failure of their team to deliver the project; and (c) the perceived skills or knowledge that they acquired from the interdisciplinary approach. Analysis of data followed a mixed method approach. Contribution: The study improved the current pedagogy for Software Engineering education by integrating other related disciplines into the software project development framework. Findings: Data collected showed that the students generally accepted the interdisciplinary approach to project development. Factors such as project relevance, teamwork, time and schedule, and administration support, among others, affect team performance towards project completion. In the case of the Computer Science students, results show that students have learned skills during the experience that, as literature reveal, can only be acquired or mastered in their future profession as software engineers. Recommendations for Practitioners: The active collaboration of the industry with the University and the involvement of the other related courses in teaching software engineering methods are critical to the development of the students, not only in learning the methodology but also as a working professional. Recommendation for Researchers: It is interesting to know and eventually understand the interactions between interdisciplinary team members in the conduct of Software Engineering practices while working on their projects. More specifically, what creative tensions arise and how do the interdisciplinary teams handle the discourse?

AB  - We have developed a multivariate and multidisciplinary lab experiment on the synthesis of alginate hydrogel beads of various sizes and dye encapsulation for upper-division undergraduate and graduate students. This experiment introduces students to several common concepts in polymer chemistry, materials science, and drug delivery. The experiment series runs over two 3-h laboratories where students first synthesize alginate beads by dropwise addition of an alginate solution into aqueous CaCl2. The alginate bead size is regulated physically via the dropper opening and chemically via cross-linking ion variation, cross-linking time, and surfactant. During the second lab session, students explore the effects of bead size and solution environment on the gel's loading capacity, encapsulation efficiency, and controlled release using a model dye. Finally, students present their results, methodology, and data analysis to the class. A report and an exam allow the students to demonstrate their knowledge. Students learn critical drug delivery concepts throughout the project, including controlling particle size, loading capacity, and encapsulation efficiency. They also acquire valuable insight into the applications of gel particles and standard techniques used in industrial and academic research. The developed lab experience includes experiments of varying difficulty and can be adapted to first- and second-year undergraduate students by simplifying the suggested laboratory procedures.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine sustainability-related challenges in the two Western Balkan countries--Albania and Kosovo. It discusses the opportunities of local higher education institutions (HEIs) taking responsibility to tackle these challenges by providing professional development through science-society collaboration in innovative training sessions for university educators. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review on actual challenges and transformations of higher education for sustainable development (ESD) in Albania and Kosovo will be the starting point of this paper. Subsequently, experiences from the on-going European Union (EU) project "ConSus" will be used to draw both a competence framework for ESD within science-society collaboration based on the training sessions, as well as possible scaling opportunities. Findings: The paper draws possible approaches of training sessions for university educators promoting sustainable development and science-society collaboration in higher education. They will be concluded by addressing possible scaling opportunities of the project's activities. Practical implications: The experiences of the ConSus training sessions will outline competences of university educators in ESD gained in relation to transdisciplinary collaboration in research and teaching. Originality/value: The paper will contribute to ESD approaches in higher education in Albania and Kosovo. Furthermore, scaling possibilities will be discussed to systematically implement ESD approaches also in higher hierarchical levels and other HEIs.

AB  - Improving young people's engagement in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) is being promoted worldwide as a means of addressing projected shortfalls in expertise needed to further nations' economic, social and environmental goals. Responding to this, schools are reforming traditional discipline-based curricula into interdisciplinary approaches based on problem and project-based designs, to make STEM learning more relevant and meaningful for students. This study drew on a dataset of 449 Australian principal and teacher interviews, to identify factors influencing STEM curriculum in their schools. It utilised Ecological Systems Theory to build understanding relating to the influence of activities and outputs originating at macro, exo and meso system levels, on STEM curriculum and practices in classrooms. Results demonstrated how many innovative schools were able to successfully leverage community, business and national resources to enhance their STEM curriculum, while others struggled due to limitations imposed by geographic or socio-economic factors, or limited access to resources, expertise or advice. Central to achieving this was the powerful influence of principals' and teachers' "proximal processes" and "developmental assets" in establishing effective and engaging interdisciplinary STEM curricula, despite constraints imposed by, at best, ambiguous national and state curriculum and policies, rigid assessment regimes and compliance-focused reporting requirements.

AB  - The shortage of rehabilitation health personnel in Cameroon is a limiting factor to attaining full health coverage under Sustainable Development Goal 3 of ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all ages. This problem has been accentuated by the low level and quality of training of rehabilitation workers such as physiotherapists. This was partly due to the poor understanding of the profession of physiotherapy. The profession had also been devaluated to massage therapy or just a paramedical practice, requiring training programs of 2 years or less. This has caused a huge rehabilitation personnel gap which the Baptist Institute of Health Sciences is aimed at addressing with the Bachelor of Sciences in Physiotherapy curriculum and training. The paper aims to evaluate the aptness of the Tyler-designed curriculum in addressing the rehabilitation skill gap. The Baptist Institute of Health Sciences developed a 4-year Bachelor of Sciences curriculum designed using the Tyler Model as a training intervention to address this problem. This curriculum mapping tool is used to evaluate the designed curriculum for vertical, horizontal, interdisciplinary, and subject-area coherence and redundancy. This is to assess the structure of the curriculum in preparing physiotherapists to operate in full physiotherapists competencies in integrating rehabilitation between primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare systems as defined World Health Organization. It was found that the curriculum has zero vertical redundancy (coherent with no content overlap) as it systematically covers 16 curriculum tracks. The zero vertical redundancy reveals the aptness of the curriculum as it includes all 8 domains provided by the Physiotherapists Educational framework and more. These 16 curriculum tracks are pedagogically grouped into three broad levels of competencies namely the fundamental, core, and specialty expertise competencies levels. They are progressively fashioned to train the habits of the mind and develop the appropriate skills proficiency outcomes (SPOs) in the physiotherapists in training. The curriculum has horizontal redundancy (skill repetition development cycle) created by the spiral curriculum approach used in reinforcing the skills proficiency Outcomes (SPOs) across the three competencies categories. This is because the physiotherapist in training grows in the 6 skills proficiency outcomes (SPOs) from comprehensive examination and assessment through to recommendation and patient self-management skills at all three levels.

AB  - From its inception in 2016 through 2019, the Baltimore SCIART Consortium offered an annual 10-week interdisciplinary summer research program for undergraduate students. Each year, the program mentored approximately 10 students, many from primarily undergraduate institutions including minority serving institutions and historically black colleges and universities. Throughout the sessions, the students were exposed to the career paths of art conservation and art conservation science as they worked in the laboratories of scientists, engineers, art conservators, and art conservation scientists at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, Johns Hopkins University, and the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore. Preparations for the 2020 program were underway when the COVID-19 pandemic shifted the undergraduate research paradigm to a virtual experience. An in-person, laboratory-based program was no longer an option, and this challenged the SCIART team to investigate novel ways to offer a rigorous, engaging undergraduate research program in a fully virtual setting. The result was an intensive, three-week pilot program in which four SCIART students learned about and successfully applied open-source periodic density functional theory software packages to explore the interactions between small molecule adsorbates and mineral-based surfaces relevant to art conservation. This case study exemplifies how educators and research leaders were able to strategically pivot and provide an adapted curriculum for a unique, interdisciplinary, and fully virtual undergraduate research experience. The implication is a potential (scalable) model for culturally engaging research opportunities for historically underrepresented students in STEM, both during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Contemporary research models are becoming increasingly transdisciplinary (TD), multilevel, community-connected, and bent on expediting the movement of research to impact. This requires not only fresh thinking about the science of social work but an educational architecture that fosters both cross-disciplinary understanding of complex underlying determinants and the ability to translate that knowledge into effective, sustainable action. This article illustrates the need for greater intentionality and coherence in preparing social work practitioners and researchers for participation in this changing landscape. We focus here on doctoral level training, but underscore opportunities for a robust educational "pipeline" linking undergraduate and graduate professional degree preparation to that at the doctoral and postdoctoral levels. We summarize selected literature that defines and operationalizes TD translational research, reflect strategically on social work's positioning within this scientific "marketplace," and offer recommendations for capacity building in social work doctoral education.

AB  - In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, mathematicians and physical philosophers managed to study, via mathematics, various physical systems of the sublunar world through idealized and simplified models of these systems, constructed with the help of geometry. By analyzing these models, they were able to formulate new concepts, laws and theories of physics and then through models again, to apply these concepts and theories to new physical phenomena and check the results by means of experiment. Students' difficulties with the mathematics of high school physics are well known. Science education research attributes them to inadequately deep understanding of mathematics and mainly to inadequate understanding of the meaning of symbolic mathematical expressions. There seem to be, however, more causes of these difficulties. One of them, not independent from the previous ones, is the complex meaning of the algebraic concepts used in school physics (e.g. variables, parameters, functions), as well as the complexities added by physics itself (e.g. that equations' symbols represent magnitudes with empirical meaning and units instead of pure numbers). Another source of difficulties is that the theories and laws of physics are often applied, via mathematics, to simplified, and idealized physical models of the world and not to the world itself. This concerns not only the applications of basic theories but also all authentic end-of-the-chapter problems. Hence, students have to understand and participate in a complex interplay between physics concepts and theories, physical and mathematical models, and the real world, often without being aware that they are working with models and not directly with the real world.

AB  - Drawn from the cultural-historical theories of knowing and doing science, this article uses the concept of professional vision to explore what scientists and experienced teachers see and articulate as important aspects of climate science practices. The study takes an abductive reasoning approach to analyze scientists' videotaped lectures to recognize what scientists pay attention to in their explanations of climate science practices. It then analyzes how ideas scientists attended align with experienced teachers' sense-making of scientific practices to teach climate change. The findings show that experienced teachers' and scientists' explanations showed alignment in the focus on scientific practices, but indicated variations in the temporal and spatial reasoning of climate data. Furthermore, the interdisciplinarity of climate science was emphasized in climate scientists' lectures, but was not apparent once scientists and teachers shared the same culture in meetings to provide feedback to preservice teachers. Given the importance of teaching through scientific practices in classrooms, this study provides suggestions to capture the epistemic diversity of scientific disciplines.

AB  - An increased reliance on nanotechnology and recent developments in materials fabrication coincide with a greater prevalence of 3D printers in high schools. We developed this lesson to foster an exploration of interdisciplinary fields and to increase access to recent advances in materials chemistry through two different learning modules. The lab focuses on designing a 3D-printable guide to assist in consistent and reproducible growth of TiO2 nanotubes. The first module involves the collaborative and rapid prototyping of a 3D-printed template, and the second module is focused on implementing the designs from the first module to grow TiO2 nanotubes in a lab environment. The advantages to this approach include the utilization of widespread technologies and the usage of common laboratory reagents. This lesson has been tested in the high school classroom, and it was found that its implementation is suitable for both high school and early undergraduate laboratories.

AB  - Science teacher educators (STEs) have key roles in the educational system through their preparation of pre- and in-service science teachers and in implementing future-oriented policy reforms. Given the complexity and importance of their role, what types of knowledge do STEs need? STEs come from a range of backgrounds and there are few systematic routes for their ongoing learning. Hence, there is a need for tools that can help define and assess STEs' competence. The purpose of this theoretical paper is to highlight central knowledge domains for STEs. We draw on previous work and add perspectives from current trends in science education and teacher education to describe four knowledge domains for STEs: natural science, science education in school, science teacher education and science education research. The main contribution of the paper is an updated conceptualisation of the nature of STEs' knowledge and qualifications, taking into account current requirements for future-oriented science education and teacher education including deeper learning and critical thinking skills, cross-curricular work, education for sustainable development, and research-based teacher education. The four knowledge domains can serve as a tool for identifying needs, recruiting staff with desired expertise, and tailoring interventions to support professional development for STEs from various backgrounds.

AB  - Metaverse is understood with technological terms such as augmented reality, lifelogging, mirrored worlds, and virtual worlds, and using a metaverse platform is considered an emerging form of learning. Yet, its pedagogical features, such as self-learning, collaborative learning, and learning-by-doing, are identical to those of online learning. In this study, we argue that metaverse-based learning refers to a new reality learners create by assuming that the existence of reality is different in the metaverse. We extracted six educational values in epistemological and ontological senses, reviewing the four realities of the metaverse, including virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and extended reality, which is a way to avoid technological determinists'; approach to education. Based on the values -- bottom-up, collaboration, authorship, ownership, interconnectivity, and community, primary school children's (year 5 & 6) groups (n = 20) redesigned 20 assigned school spaces such as classroom teacher office, science room, and music room on their chosen metaverse platforms. Throughout the thematic analysis of design artifacts, activity scenarios, and reflection &amp; presentation, we discovered four themes: collaborative learning with co-ownership and co-authorship; being interconnected with all living and non-living things; co-participants with different roles; and transdisciplinary research-driven learning, which is used to articulate a framework for metaverse-based learning, which is different from online learning.

AB  - The allocation of scientific funding through grant programs is crucial for research advancement. While independent peer panels typically handle evaluations, their decisions can lean on personal preferences that go beyond the stated criteria, leading to inconsistencies and potential biases. Given these concerns, our study employs a novel method, using simulated, data-driven, and narrative personas of fictional candidates, to identify the attributes that significantly influence panelist choices and profile what an optimal candidate would look like. Our findings reveal a preference for mid-career, multidisciplinary researchers with significant publications, citations, and prior project experience. Such optimal candidates also lean toward applied science, collaborative research, interactions with both industry and the public, and a progressive stance on science. Contrary to existing literature, this study found indications of a bias toward female candidates, which we interpret as a result of deliberate correction caused by awareness of existing biases in academia. Age emerged as another influential factor, suggesting either a preference for younger researchers or a perception of waning productivity among seasoned academics. Consistency in a candidate's profile, rather than standout attributes, was also favored by panelists.

AB  - A multidisciplinary science experiment was performed in K-12 classrooms focusing on the interconnection between technology with geology and chemistry. The engagement and passion for science of over eight hundred students across twenty-one classrooms, utilizing a combination of hands-on activities using relationships between Earth and space rock studies, followed by a remote access session wherein students remotely employed the use of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to validate their findings was investigated. Participants represent predominantly low-income minority communities, with little exposure to the themes and equipment used, despite being freely available resources. Students indicated greatly increased interest in scientific practices and careers, as well as a better grasp of the content as a result of the lab and remote access coupling format.

AB  - Key features of open video repositories (OVRs) are outlined, followed by brief descriptions of specific websites relevant to the social sciences. Although most were created by instructors over the past 10 years to facilitate teaching and learning, significant variation in kind, quality, and number per discipline were discovered. Economics and psychology have the most extensive sets of repositories, while political science has the least development. Among original-content websites, economics has the strongest collection in terms of production values, given substantial support from wealthy donors to advance political and economic agendas. Economics also provides virtually all edited-content OVRs. Sociology stands out in having the most developed website in which found video is applied to teaching and learning. Numerous multidisciplinary sites of quality have also emerged in recent years.

AB  - In this work we investigate the place and the importance of environmental education (EE) in Moroccan high school education with a focus on Physics/Chemistry and Biology/Geology classes. It is performed within a comparative method by using an interdisciplinary approach in order to understand the presence and the pedagogical styles adopted for the implementation of EE in both disciplines. This study is accomplished via an anthropological theory of knowledge to analyze textbooks and a questionnaire administered to 90 teachers of these disciplines throughout different high schools in Oujda academy, Morocco. The analyses of collected data were performed by adopting a statistical descriptive method. Results show that the presence and the importance of EE are mediocre and its contribution to learning activity is dominated by informative pedagogical style. Similarly, questionnaire results reveal that the implementation of EE in their practices cannot enable learners to construct competencies and skills that would help them adopt a positive behavior towards the environment because first, the presence of EE in their classes is almost absent especially in P/C classes, second, teachers' practices are overwhelmed by the informative pedagogical style. Furthermore, respondents have never benefited from basic and in-service training and their interdisciplinary professional collaboration is totally lacking.

AB  - Students' argumentation skills are considered a central tool to contribute to scientific controversies in the science classroom. Scientific controversies of social relevance (socioscientific issues; SSI) are subject to multiple viewpoints that are often rooted in diverse disciplines. However, the relationship between issue familiarity and students' multidisciplinary argumentation is still a matter under discussion. This study: (1) explores whether the selection of a particular issue (animal testing) enables students' engagement in multidisciplinary argumentation without additional issue familiarisation, i.e., using only their existing knowledge; and (2) clarifies the relationship between increased issue familiarity and students' multidisciplinary argumentation. One hundred and sixty three ninth and tenth graders participated in this study, of whom one hundred and six took part in a teaching unit to familiarise themselves with the issue of animal testing. The study's results demonstrate that animal testing constitutes an effective issue to engage students with the complexity of SSI without requiring more than basic familiarity prior to engagement. The results further demonstrate that increased issue familiarity can enhance the overall diversity of discipline-related arguments amongst students; however, not all disciplines were enhanced equally. The findings suggest that more instructional guidance seems to be needed to assist students in broadening their arguments.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of chemistry activities applied in summer science camp on secondary school students. Action research was used in the study as the method. The sample of the study consists of 48 7th grade students who study at elementary school in Çayeli district of Rize province, in Turkey. Each week 24 students participated in the camp, which lasted two weeks. The activities that were carried out are: "The Gases in the Air", "Sad Tears of the Sky", "Recycling", "Let's Use Soap and Be Clean", "Soap Foam Fountain". During the activities, "Chemistry Science Interview Form" including four open-ended questions related to chemistry was applied to the students before and after the activities in the camp. Besides, "Reflective Journals" were used to reveal the participants' thoughts about the chemistry activities that were applied in the camp. Content analysis was used in analyzing the data collection tools. It was found out that students can use more conceptions and statements on chemistry, and they can associate them with daily life in a better way after the science camp. Also, the findings indicate that chemistry activities which were carried out within the scope of the project contribute to chemistry, and to the students' interest in this profession.

AB  - The 360 Degree Global Education Model (360 Global Ed Model) provides a comprehensive framework for creating meaningful interdisciplinary student team learning through international service learning. Providing successful multi-disciplined undergraduate education necessitates creating a foundation for productive team-science based learning between disciplines. The pedagogical foundation employed by Breitkreuz and Songer within the 360 Global Ed model creates a shared values student dialogue for enhancing undergraduate team learning and performance. This paper provides a summary of the 360 Global Ed Model, a discussion of methods used to create a student shared dialogue ("Team Learning Foundation"), lessons learned, and student outcomes. Methods for shared dialogues include creating a team-defined mission, team-defined behavioral standards, building shared cultural understandings and expectations for developing cultural intelligence, and developing realistic expectations for interpersonal understandings through use of self-assessments. Student team-led projects provide an authentic context impetus for implementing the team learning foundation. [For the full proceedings, see ED631133.]

AB  - Data-driven decision making has now moved beyond its traditional domains--operations research, business economics, computer sciences, and business statistics--to "softer subjects," such as human resource management, organization behavior, and business communication. In this context, teaching with technology encourages students to systematically apply domain knowledge to communicate across a wide variety of stakeholders. In the era of multimodal forms of communication and multiple data sources, management students must be analytical when writing compelling reports and giving persuasive presentations. They should be well versed in using both quantitative and qualitative techniques for report writing and presentation. Drawing on authentic user-generated comments on social media, this article presents two case studies on (a) crisis communication by 30 CEOs and (b) culture shock experienced by foreign tourists sojourning in India, China, and the United Arab Emirates, to demonstrate how master's in business administration (MBA) students could derive insights from the online comments to make strategic decisions for organizational benefit and make reports based on those findings. The article asserts that this could help to cultivate a data-analytic mindset among the students by preparing them to communicate small (and big) data-driven analysis to relevant stakeholders. It attempts to suggest ways to develop MBA students' ability to analyze their potential audiences as well as to generate meaningful insights from the available information on social media websites. Finally, it hopes to nudge business communication instructors to embrace multidisciplinary perspectives for planning a technology-based business communication assignment involving the social media landscape. Instructors can not only use the two case studies to illustrate ways to integrate technology with teaching but also create their own mini cases to improve the decision-making, report-writing, and business report presentation skills of their students.

AB  - The need to map the evolution of trends in any field of activity arises when a large amount of data is available on that activity, thus making impossible a manual exploration of the data in order to understand how the field or the activity is evolving. Topic and trend mapping is a mature field with hundreds of publications on approaches, methods and tools for data collection, analysis, feature extraction and reduction, clustering and visualisation tools and algorithms. Our study aims to map the evolution of topics published by the journal "Education for Information. Interdisciplinary Journal on Information Studies" (EFI henceforth) which has been in existence since 1983, in order to understand how this journal has evolved and how it is positioned with regard to the field of Library and Information Science to which it belongs. Our study is part of the body of work on topic detection and text mining. Our results showed that the journal displayed a remarkable stability in its editorial policy over more than three decades. With the arrival of its third Editor in Chief in 2018, a shift towards more technologically oriented topics and to specialties from other fields are perceptible such as health information, data science and digital humanities.

AB  - This exploratory case study affirmed the merit of using science fiction-inspired story writing to help Saudi Arabian Grade 10 female students learn science. Recognizing that teacher-centered rote learning was not reaching her rural students in the western part of Riyadh Province, the female teacher in this case switched to the constructivist active learning pedagogy, especially story writing. The case study report reflects data from a teacher interview, classroom observations (n = 2), and a content analysis of students' (N = 25) two homework assignments. In the spirit of science fiction (SF), they were required to (a) demonstrate their science learning by weaving their imagination and personalities with the world of arthropods and writing a story that reflected the values and principles they aspired to spread in society and (b) answer the third conditional sentence question "What would you ask god for if you were a Crustacean?" A content analysis confirmed that students correctly used science facts while creatively and innovatively using their imagination to write stories reflective of their value systems. They valued identity, societal recognition, validation and respect, enduring friendships, dialogue and conversations, protection, and family. Regarding the God/Crustacean question, they wanted to be happy, at peace, safe, valued, respected, and have a clean place to live. The study confirmed the value of further investigating the use of the science fiction genre in Saudi science education and using writing to learn science.

AB  - In 2010, Nolan and Temple Lang proposed "integration of computing concepts into statistics curricula at all levels." The unprecedented growth in data and emphasis on data science has provided an impetus to finally realizing full implementations of this in new statistics and data science programs and courses. We discuss a proposal for the stealth development of computational skills in students' exposure to introductory data science through careful, scaffolded exposure to computation and its power. Our intent is to support students, regardless of interest and self-efficacy in coding, in becoming data-driven learners, who are capable of asking complex questions about the world around them, and then answering those questions through the use of data-driven inquiry. Reference is made to the computer science and statistics consensus curriculum frameworks the International Data Science in Schools Project (IDSSP) recently published for secondary school data science or introductory tertiary programs, designed to optimize data-science accessibility.

AB  - Kinesiology is a diverse field revolving around a core ideology of physical activity. Because of its multidisciplinary nature, kinesiology is an area that is made for interdisciplinary collaboration. This article evaluates kinesiology and the wide range of potential interdisciplinary collaborations, specifically through the lens of the areas of biology, technology, business, education, law, psychology, sociology, and recreation management. The evaluation further explores barriers to potential collaborations and proposes a model for success. Using the diffusion of innovations theory as a framework, this article outlines who needs to be involved and gives a recommended model of implementation. In the end, the rocky road of interdisciplinary collaboration within kinesiology can be successfully navigated. Furthermore, this evaluation finds that interdisciplinary collaboration is essential in the field of kinesiology and should be strategically implemented.

AB  - Many students regard physics as an isolated, sophisticated and perhaps a boring branch of science. Meanwhile, physics is embedded in most events and issues of society, culture and everyday life. To find and include such relevant contexts is one of the challenges for every physics teacher. Here we present our findings, which concern the classic "The Canterbury Tales" by Geoffrey Chaucer. Some important questions are still open and disputed, such as the dates of events in the story. In particular, physics can provide a method for an approximate estimation of the dates and places of the events in the tales. This paper provides some of the details.

AB  - Although science education and mathematics education share many characteristics as neighboring research disciplines, comparisons between the two research fields in the literature have rarely been made. In this study, we examine the two fields' similarities and differences in the local context of South Korea by analyzing 2,426 research articles published in 15 selected local journals from both fields. The analysis revealed interesting commonalities and divergences across the two fields, suggesting a high degree of similarity in the distribution of research topics across the two fields. Nevertheless, some topics were more frequently studied in one field than the other. Based on the results, we suggest that understanding the ongoing research agendas and aims of adjacent disciplines such as mathematics education will be beneficial to the science education community by allowing self-reflection and facilitating interdisciplinary communication and collaboration. Several potential ways in which the two disciplines can cross-fertilize are discussed.

AB  - As the value of multi-disciplinary working in the business and research worlds is becoming more recognised, the number of inter-disciplinary postgraduate environmental and health sciences courses is also increasing. Equally, the popularity of problem-based learning (PBL) is expected to grow and influence instructional approaches in many disciplines. However, very limited research has been conducted to explore the perception of students of PBL in inter- or multi-disciplinary environments; particularly wide-ranging multi-disciplinary courses which cross the natural-social science barrier. The findings from this case study evidence the difficulties and benefits students derive from group PBL, many of which stem from working in multi-disciplinary and multi-skilled groups on a part-time basis. Acknowledging, accepting and overcoming conflicts based upon prior experience that influences epistemological and ontological beliefs may be key to the development of effective PBL in inter-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary programmes. Recommendations for good pedagogic practice to maximise learning in postgraduate environmental and science education are made.

AB  - Today, science is often regarded as a discipline that is more theoretical and less applicable. It is not clear how science works in society. The problems examined in this literature review are how the development of research on the integration of science, technology, and entrepreneurship in science learning in addition to how bibliometric networks and learning research trends integrate science, technology, and entrepreneurship. The search for articles using the Publish or Perish software was carried out on December 18, 2020. The data generated was in the form of metadata extracted from Google Scholar and Scopus through the API key, with the keyword science learning, STS, STEM, STEAM, and entrepreneurship from 2015-2020. As the result, 851 article was downloaded with their metadata which is stored in ris and tidied up in the delay. The data that has been obtained is excluded from proceedings, theses, book chapters, modules, theses, reports, and comments. Visualization with VOSviewer is carried out in three visualizations, namely network, overlay, and density. The results of the analysis show that the dominant topics are educational technology and environmental science. Research trends in 2020 are PjBL, entrepreneurship, and STEM. The less researched topics are the relationship between learning outcomes and entrepreneurship, and science technology.

AB  - Integration of computational data science (CDS) into the university curriculum offers several advantages for students, faculty and the institution. This article discusses the benefits to students of introducing CDS into the university curriculum with a focus on developing skills in cheminformatics, data analysis, structure--activity relationships, modelling and simulation. Moreover, CDS can enable students to engage with complex chemical and toxicological data in new and dynamic ways, helping them to develop a more nuanced understanding of the potential hazards and risks associated with different chemicals and substances. On the other hand, it can foster greater collaboration between students and faculty and with external partners in industry and government. This can lead to the development of more effective and efficient toxicological testing methods and tools to screen chemicals for potential hazards and aid the development of environmentally friendly chemicals. Overall, the integration of CDS into the university curriculum will help prepare the next generation of scientists giving them a competitive edge to make considerable contributions to green chemistry, designing safer chemicals and non-animal testing methods. It will enable them to tackle modern challenges facing society including identifying safer and more sustainable chemicals and predicting the health and environmental impacts of novel chemical substances.

AB  - Background: Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) is a European innovative interdisciplinary educational convergence that intends to promote multilingual competence among students through the learning of the subjects in a second/foreign language. This approach is considered one of the significant developments in the field of education. Purpose: A research study was designed with the objective of exploring and understanding the nature and method of CLIL practices prevalent in bilingual primary and secondary school classrooms in Castilla La Mancha, Spain. Spain was chosen because it is one of the pioneering countries that steered an exhaustive variety of research and experiments in CLIL practices in its diverse educational contexts. Methods: Adopting qualitative research method Participant Classroom Observations, twenty classes of two bilingual schools--fifteen classes of Natural Science and Social Science in primary school and five classes of Music at Secondary School that used CLIL approach were observed and findings recorded using observation template. Results: The findings provided a myriad view of the bilingual experiences in the classrooms, diversity and range of pedagogical practices used, student teacher interaction dynamics present, positive learning environment provided for the students in the classes to mention a few. Conclusion: The study concludes with the understanding of the 'added value' and the numerous benefits the approach provides for the students. As a fresh and innovative approach, CLIL promotes holistic and meaningful learning catering to the needs of twenty first century education systems.

AB  - Global progress has arisen from scientific advances and we currently live in the age of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM); science as a way of increasing the knowledge base, technology as a means of manifesting the science, engineering as a way of building and creating with it, and mathematics to devise the language we use for science to explore new realities. Strengthening science-related economies requires more students to pursue STEM subjects which means that we need to retain them early in the education pipeline in order to strengthen knowledge-based communities and nations' economic growth. In Australia, however, there is a trend of more occupations requiring STEM skills while there is a declining interest in studying STEM subjects at secondary school. The disengagement of students from STEM subjects is most notable amongst girls towards the physical sciences such as physics and mathematics. When girls are considering life pathways at high school they generally view STEM subjects as difficult, leading to career pathways that are not aligned to their interests. With the exception of biology girls do not deem STEM subjects as relevant to improving the human condition. Moreover, the STEM subjects are not viewed as interconnected and contributing to areas of knowledge that impact our lives. To increase the accessibility of STEM subjects and STEM careers to enable students and unblock the pipeline into the work sector we need to rationalise how the STEM areas work together and impacts the fabric of life beyond the knowledge silos. In addition, as educators we need to show young people how STEM skills and learnings are integrated into areas such as psychology, economics, computing, and data science. In this paper we describe how a pilot of the "Growing Tall Poppies STEM" program (GTP) has enabled female high school students and (largely) female scientists at the University of the Sunshine Coast to explore the interdigitated nature of STEM subjects and psychology to support the understanding of how STEM skills are important, relevant, and life changing. By way of background, the GTP program framework was developed to encourage secondary students, particularly girls, to choose to study STEM subjects in their final years of secondary school by demonstrating (a) the relevance of these subjects to their everyday lives, (b) that girls are capable of STEM-related academic success, (c) that STEM subjects are career-empowering, by (d) providing examples that debunk the stereotypic expectations of female students and employees. This pilot project highlighted how the STEM skills of critical thinking, problem solving, and innovation can be used "beyond" traditional STEM disciplines such as psychology. In this regard, a group of four Year 10 girls were immersed in an applied social psychology laboratory in 2016 to participate in a genuine research investigation, and students were given autonomy to contribute and take charge of their own project question. Thus the girls experienced firsthand the interdisciplinary nature of STEM disciplines, and in this way STEM learnings were related to a broader range of applications and career paths for these students. While this pilot was the first university-high school GTP collaboration, pleasingly this group of students advised that they felt inspired to continue in their study of STEM subjects on their return to school, and indicated that they were more inclined to choose STEM subjects beyond Year 10.

AB  - This article addresses concerns about English competencies among Hispanic English as a second language (ESL) science students that perpetuate underrepresentation of Hispanic individuals in scientific discourse. Faculty and student perception surveys completed at the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey suggest that Hispanic ESL undergraduates require increased productive competencies in English. Those science majors with weak proficiency in English are significantly disadvantaged and current institutional practices don't address their needs. Recommendations include course development focused on productive competencies and interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss the history of the concept of function and emphasize in particular how problems in physics have led to essential changes in its definition and application in mathematical practices. Euler defined a function as an analytic expression, whereas Dirichlet defined it as a variable that depends in an arbitrary manner on another variable. The change was required when mathematicians discovered that analytic expressions were not sufficient to represent physical phenomena such as the vibration of a string (Euler) and heat conduction (Fourier and Dirichlet). The introduction of generalized functions or distributions is shown to stem partly from the development of new theories of physics such as electrical engineering and quantum mechanics that led to the use of improper functions such as the delta function that demanded a proper foundation. We argue that the development of student understanding of mathematics and its nature is enhanced by embedding mathematical concepts and theories, within an explicit-reflective framework, into a rich historical context emphasizing its interaction with other disciplines such as physics. Students recognize and become engaged with meta-discursive rules governing mathematics. Mathematics teachers can thereby teach inquiry in mathematics as it occurs in the sciences, as mathematical practice aimed at obtaining new mathematical knowledge. We illustrate such a historical teaching and learning of mathematics within an explicit and reflective framework by two examples of student-directed, problem-oriented project work following the Roskilde Model, in which the connection to physics is explicit and provides a learning space where the nature of mathematics and mathematical practices are linked to natural science.

AB  - Religions and beliefs are complex, contested and challenging aspects of the educational systems and cultural landscapes both in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) and in Northern Ireland (NI); part of a long and protracted history of colonial oppression and political struggles underpinned by religious and ethnic divisions. The deficit in the literature on third-level students' attitudes to religion and belief in the ROI and NI was a springboard to this multi-disciplinary funded research. Perspectives of 900 second-year university initial teacher education (ITE) and social science students, from 6 tertiary educational contexts were explored within an analytical framework provided by the European Values Survey and the European Social Survey for understanding values and beliefs among its citizenry. The research was undertaken to understand students' attitudes to a belief diverse society involving newly arrived immigrant and refugee groups. The authors argue that based on the research findings key issues such as religious or belief bias, and fear of religious or belief other, emerge for student stakeholders which will inform their professional practice(s). Research of this nature is particularly important in the context of Ireland (ROI and NI) where religious diversity has underpinned political turmoil and educational and cultural division in the past.

AB  - The evolution of resistance to antibiotics provides a timely and relevant topic for teaching undergraduate students evolutionary biology. Here, we present a module incorporating modified sequencing data from eight antibiotic resistant pathogen outbreaks in hospital settings with bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses. This module uses whole genome sequencing data from hospital outbreaks investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide examples of antibiotic resistance spread. Students work in groups to analyze outbreak data to identify the bacterial species and antibiotic resistance genes, to infer a phylogenetic tree examining relatedness among isolates, and to determine a possible source of the outbreak. Students then compile their results in individual reports and provide recommendations for preventing the further spread of antibiotic resistant organisms. In addition to providing genomic outbreak data, we include a teaching concepts guide discussing three integral components of the module: how evolutionary biology concepts of natural selection and competition impact antibiotic resistance; outbreak investigation information to aid in phylogenetic analysis and creation of recommendations; and instructions for the bioinformatics protocol. Completion of this module provides students an opportunity to think critically about the evolution of resistance, practice bioinformatics techniques, and relate evolutionary biology to current events.

AB  - This paper provides a conceptual analysis and methodology to improve the Next Generation Science Standards' focus on interdisciplinary connections. The paper identifies a plethora of connections across Disciplinary Core Ideas that are neglected by the NGSS. In addition, it presents a methodology to generate "educative" curriculum materials. The specific case of middle school global warming (MS.ESS3.D) is developed. Curriculum and assessment resources are presented and evaluated. It is expected that the approach exemplified in this paper will be useful for teachers and curriculum developers when designing lessons and teaching interdisciplinary science topics.

AB  - As the landscape of higher education gets more complex, there is a need to increase engagement and student reflection on their academic experiences. This research explores whether a threshold concept framework (TCF) can be used in an interdisciplinary social science culminating course as a tool for students to consider the transformative nature of their education and articulate the meaning of their educational experiences. Student reflective work was analyzed to see whether students can (1) understand TCF, which is typically used to analyze student learning, rather than as a reflective tool for students and (2) successfully apply TCF to their educational experiences. The authors conclude that using written reflections, students could understand and apply TCF to articulate the transformational nature of their education and consider the impact of their experiences as an undergraduate. These results illuminate the potential of using TCF as a pedagogical tool within the classroom and curriculum development.

AB  - This book contains the full text of papers and posters presented at the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2022), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (WIARS). Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2022 received 790 submissions, from more than 45 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. The conference accepted for presentation 263 submissions (33% acceptance rate), from which, 233 submissions are published in full text in these volumes. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. This is the Volume 1 of the book Education and New Developments 2022 and it contains the results of the research and developments conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to promote growth in research methods intimately related to teaching, learning and applications in Education nowadays. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, who will extend our view in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues, by sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This first volume focus in the main areas of Teachers and Students and Teaching and Learning. [For Volume 2, see ED622190. This document contains the proceedings of END 2022: International Conference on Education and New Developments (Madeira, Portugal, June 18-20, 2022).]

AB  - The combined lab and lecture course is designed around the themes of colorants (dyestuffs and pigments) and fibers (natural and human-made) for nonscience majors. Students dye natural and synthetic fibers with natural dyes such as turmeric, raspberries, tea, and cochineal insects as well as synthetic dyes. The students observe the colorfast properties of a dye and the changes made to a fiber during the dyeing process. Some chemical concepts introduced over the semester are light energy and color, solution chemistry, chemical bonding and bond polarity, acids and bases, and oxidizing and reducing agents. An important component of this class is introducing students to primary literature. The students, throughout the semester, read and discuss research articles on topics relevant to the coursework. The course culminates with students applying all they learned through a self-designed inquiry project. Students, in groups, write a research proposal using science research literature. At the end of the semester, the students in the lab conduct original research, which culminates with the students sharing their findings with the class in a conference-like setting. Students from two classes (N = 34) completed a SALG (student assessment of their learning gains) survey; SALG is a web-based instrument that allows students to assess their perceptions of learning gains made over the duration of the course. The students were asked about the gains they experienced from this course in collaborative work, scientific literacy skills, science attitudes, and connecting science to other situations. The students showed good gains in working in collaborative settings and knowing how to gather and use data. The students also reported a better understanding of how chemistry relates to other classes and how it can apply to other situations. The students were also taught how to critically read scientific research articles. While the improvement in critical reading was not as robust, it did indicate an improvement in the students' understanding of how to read scientific studies. This lab and lecture course, designed to increase interdisciplinary learning at the school--particularly with the school's fashion, marketing, and communication majors--piqued students' interest in chemistry, improved their understanding of scientific processes, and helped them understand the role of chemistry in other subjects.

AB  - Purpose: Arts-integration is a promising approach to building students' abilities to create and critique arguments with data, also known as informal inferential reasoning (IIR). However, differences in disciplinary practices and routines, as well as school organization and culture, can pose barriers to subject integration. The purpose of this study is to describe synergies and tensions between data science and the arts, and how these can create or constrain opportunities for learners to engage in IIR. Design/methodology/approach: The authors co-designed and implemented four arts-integrated data literacy units with 10 teachers of arts and mathematics in middle school classrooms from four different schools in the USA. The data include student-generated artwork and their written rationales, and interviews with teachers and students. Through maximum variation sampling, the authors identified examples from the data to illustrate disciplinary synergies and tensions that appeared to support different IIR processes among students. Findings: Aspects of artistic representation, including embodiment, narrative and visual image; and aspects of the culture of arts, including an emphasis on personal experience, the acknowledgement of subjectivity and considerations for the audience's perspective, created synergies and tensions that both offered and hindered opportunities for IIR (i.e. going beyond data, using data as evidence and expressing uncertainty). Originality/value: This study answers calls for humanistic approaches to data literacy education. It contributes an interdisciplinary perspective on data literacy that complements other context-oriented perspectives on data science. This study also offers recommendations for how designers and educators can capitalize on synergies and mitigate tensions between domains to promote successful IIR in arts-integrated data literacy education.

AB  - What guidance does research provide about how to improve school district performance in the United States? Despite over 30 years of inquiry on the topic of effective districts, existing frameworks are relatively narrow in terms of disciplinary focus (primarily educational leadership perspectives) and research design (primarily qualitative case studies). To bridge this gap for researchers, we first review the theoretical literatures on how districts are thought to affect educational outcomes, arguing that an expanded set of disciplinary perspectives--organizational behavior, political science, economics--have distinct theories about the types of district-level policies that might improve district-wide performance. Using these frameworks as a guide, we next conduct a review of quantitative studies that estimate the relationship between district-level inputs and educational outcomes, finding benefits of policies that cross disciplinary perspectives: higher teacher salaries, data use, and school autonomy and parental choice in the context of district-wide turnarounds. Our review also reveals the need for significant additional causal evidence and provides an inter-disciplinary map of theorized pathways through which district-level policies could influence student outcomes that are ripe for rigorous testing.

AB  - There has been a focus on improving teachers' views of nature of science for decades. The method in which researchers improve views of nature of science, however, varies greatly. This study aimed to improve elementary preservice teachers' views of nature of science and nature of science instruction through a course assignment that required the preservice teachers to use speaking, listening, and writing skills through an interview with young children. They were then asked to write an analysis paper explaining their students' views of nature of science and implications for their future practice. After engaging with the interdisciplinary work of a scientist through nature of science modules and the interview during field experiences, the elementary preservice teachers developed more informed views of science and gained an understanding of the importance of nature of science instruction.

AB  - The sustained recruitment and retention of students in STEM majors is a national concern. Although the rate of attrition in these majors is comparable to other majors, the demand for trained scientists to enter the workforce with a baccalaureate degree is high. To enhance retention and support of STEM students from their first year until graduation, we established a Residential Learning Community (RLC) for STEM majors at York College of Pennsylvania. Although similar learning communities already existed, this was the first of its kind at this institution. The primary components included living on campus with a roommate also in the program, taking courses like general chemistry and First-Year Seminar as a designated cohort, and receiving increased faculty mentoring through advising. The RLC, named STEM Scholars, was developed with significant institutional buy-in and interdisciplinary faculty support but without financial backing. Several key takeaways are reported in this article, notably the need for funding to support a STEM cohort program. The effectiveness of the program and its components continues to be assessed; results of the assessment will be shared in the future. Successful components of STEM Scholars can be incorporated at other institutions to enhance STEM education.

AB  - The combination of education and robots is becoming an increasingly important issue. Although researchers have conducted some studies on educational robotics in STEM education at the undergraduate level, no research examined the effects of gamified educational robotics on participants' motivation and creativity. Therefore, this study examines the effects of gamified educational robots on participants' learning motivation and creativity in STEM. A quasi-experimental research design was used in this study. A total of 108 students from two classes enrolled in the information technology course were involved as participants. Learning motivation and creativity scales were used to collect data. The participants were introduced to a gamified educational robot as the course objective, learning content, and game mechanism to increase motivation and help students solve problems. In contrast, students in the control group received conventional instruction consisting of group discussions and lectures. Activities in both groups were held for eighteen weeks in three phases. The results showed that gamified educational robots could enhance learning motivation and positively influence learners' creativity. The results also indicate that learning motivation has significant effects on creativity, and students with high motivation perform better in terms of creativity. The results strengthen interdisciplinary STEM teaching and promote students' learning outcomes.

AB  - Developing student self-efficacy and conceptualizing the importance of core ideas are seen as important learning areas in science education. Such core ideas can be elucidated with respect to the science discipline as well as interdisciplinary learning. Schools can be expected to promote high levels of students' self-efficacy in acquiring major disciplinary ideas and guiding students toward recognizing the importance of gaining work and life skills. This research sought to develop models describing students' gains in perceived self-efficacy and importance of work and life skills as well as indicating the relationship with both disciplinary and interdisciplinary core ideas in science education. Using a validated instrument, data were collected from Grade 8 (n = 218) (14-15 years old) and Grade 11 (n = 95) (17-18 years old) students. Models were created based on confirmatory factor analysis and parallel analysis. This research shows that there is need to make changes in secondary school studies so as to more clearly recognize a framework for both disciplinary and interdisciplinary core ideas, shown to be important for enabling students to prepare for their future life and careers.

AB  - This research aims to produce integrated biology teaching materials with the values of the Al-Qur'an and As-Sunnah that are valid and effective in improving cognitive, psychomotor, and strengthening students' faith and devotion. This development research (R&D) uses the ADDIE model which consists of five stages, i.e. analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. The data collection techniques used were literature studies, observations, interviews, questionnaires, and tests. Data collection instruments used include interview sheets, validation sheets, questionnaire sheets, pre-test and post-test question sheets, observation sheets, and checklists. The teaching materials were validated by three validators (material experts, learning experts, Al-Qur'an/Hadist experts), and practitioners from several biology teachers from different schools. The data was analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively (triangulation). The research results showed that the teaching materials developed met the very valid category based on the assessment of material experts, learning experts, Al-Qur'an/Hadist experts, and practitioners. Moreover, the products received excellent responses from the students. The teaching materials could improve students' cognitive and psychomotor and also increase students' values of faith and piety. Further action will be extended to schools, especially schools with Islamic nuances so that they can be used both as self-taught materials for students and as teaching materials for teachers to use in the learning process.

AB  - The most challenging global problems of our age involve coupled human--environmental systems within the Food-Energy-Water Nexus. The undergraduate students currently in our classrooms will be tomorrow's global citizens, each of whom must be prepared to understand and reason about these challenges and ultimately make decisions about them in a variety of contexts. Postsecondary institutions, then, must afford students multidisciplinary, STEM-based experiences that help them develop this knowledge and skillset. In light of this need, we developed and taught an introductory undergraduate course--Water in Society--grounded in contemporary, real-world, "socio-hydrological" issues. The course, designed to serve the needs of both STEM majors and nonmajors, was designed and offered by an interdisciplinary team of hydrology, economics, and science education faculty. Key course themes include engagement with authentic data, scientific models and modeling, multimodal forms of scientific communication, and research-based best practices for effective STEM instruction. Here, we describe the first iteration of the course, including elements of the class that exemplify these primary course themes and pedagogical reflection on instructional experiences and student feedback.

AB  - The Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) movement argues that broad-based education that promotes creativity recognizes student learning diversity, increases student engagement and can potentially enhance Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) learning by embracing cross-cutting translational skills common to STEM and arts and design disciplines. This article describes and discusses the advocacy strategy designed at Rhode Island School of Design to promote STEAM education policy. Recommendations presented include (a) recognition of the arts (and design) as core subjects alongside STEM; (b) addressing issues of equity/resources to deliver arts education; (c) calling for research into potential outcomes of STEAM educational models; and (d) funding for professional development and latitude for teachers to explore interdisciplinary learning.

AB  - Glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) is the most widely used herbicide on earth. A simple assay to quantify glyphosate concentrations in environmental samples was developed as part of an interdisciplinary effort linking introductory laboratory courses in chemistry, biology, and microbiology. In this 3 h laboratory experiment, students used UV-vis spectroscopy to quantify glyphosate in prepared unknowns and supernatants from glyphosate-treated soil samples. Regression analysis indicated that the assay is linear up to 20.0 ppm, making it particularly useful for detection of low levels of glyphosate in environmental samples. The assay can be used to quantify the activity of glyphosate-degrading soil microorganisms by comparing glyphosate levels between autoclaved and nonautoclaved soil slurries.

AB  - Semiotics is the study of signs addressing their action, usage, communication and signification (meaning). Edusemiotics--educational semiotics--is a recently developed direction in educational theory that takes semiotics as its foundational philosophy and explores the philosophical specifics of semiotics in educational contexts. As a novel theoretical field of inquiry, it is complemented by research known under the banner "semiotics in education", which is largely an applied enterprise. In this respect edusemiotics is a new conceptual framework for both theoretical and empirical studies. Edusemiotics has also been given the status of being a new branch of theoretical semiotics and it was launched as such at the 12th World Congress of the International Association for Semiotic Studies in September 2014 at the New Bulgarian University in Sofia. The article presents "semiosis" as the action of signs across culture AND nature and posits "learning" in terms of developing semiotic consciousness and semiotic competence. Semiosis is a process and as such it defies the Cartesian philosophy of substance-dualism that still informs the culture of education. The paper focuses specifically on university education permeated by disciplinary boundaries and the fragmentation of knowledge grounded in objective science inherited from modernity. Where is semiotics as the science of signs (or relations) in the context of academic culture? The authors conclude by affirming the transdisciplinary character of semiotics and edusemiotics and specify the distinctive focal points of transdisciplinary knowledge afforded by edusemiotics.

AB  - A two-axis solar tracker and its interactive kiosk were designed by an interdisciplinary team of students and faculty. The objective was to develop a publicly accessible kiosk that would facilitate the study of energy usage and production on campus. Tracking is accomplished by an open-loop algorithm, microcontroller, and ham radio rotator. Solar panel output is monitored in real time and displayed to the public with lights and digits that can be read by the casual passersby. While maximum power point tracking is the most accurate means of quantifying the output power of a photovoltaic panel, simplicity and design constraints dictated the use of short-circuit current as a proxy for power. A touchscreen display allows kiosk visitors to compare two solar panels, an automatic tracker that faces the sun, and an identical panel whose elevation and azimuth can be controlled with a virtual joystick. This project was a capstone experience for students in physics/engineering, computer science, and instructional technology. We discuss technical challenges and design choices, as well as the educational goals of the kiosk.

AB  - Metacognition comprises both the ability to be aware of one's cognitive processes (metacognitive knowledge) and to regulate them (metacognitive control). Research in educational sciences has amassed a large body of evidence on the importance of metacognition in learning and academic achievement. More recently, metacognition has been studied from experimental and cognitive neuroscience perspectives. This research has started to identify brain regions that encode metacognitive processes. However, the educational and neuroscience disciplines have largely developed separately with little exchange and communication. In this article, we review the literature on metacognition in educational and cognitive neuroscience and identify entry points for synthesis. We argue that to improve our understanding of metacognition, future research needs to (i) investigate the degree to which different protocols relate to the similar or different metacognitive constructs and processes, (ii) implement experiments to identify neural substrates necessary for metacognition based on protocols used in educational sciences, (iii) study the effects of training metacognitive knowledge in the brain, and (iv) perform developmental research in the metacognitive brain and compare it with the existing developmental literature from educational sciences regarding the domain-generality of metacognition.

AB  - Trends in development of folklore studies in the research and education space at Ukrainian and foreign universities have been analyzed. They are fundamentalization, synthesis of academic science and educational practice, professionalization, institutionalization, humanitarization, anthropoligization, interdisciplinarity. It has been defined that in Ukrainian and foreign folkloristic discourse of the 20th--the beginning of the 21st centuries, folklore is studied through the prism of functional, communicative, anthropological, context-based approaches that is partially realized in the official definition of folklore according to the 1989 UNESCO Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and Folklore. It has been found out that while structuring the content of folkloristic disciplines as well as directing future specialists' researches the multivectoring of folklore studies allows instructors to use the achievements of folkloristic directions that were formed in historical retrospective and actively developed at the modern stage: linguofolkloristics, ethnomusicology, folk therapy (folk music therapy, fairytale therapy, folk dance therapy), etc. It has been justified that folklore studies in Ukrainian and foreign research and education space is being developed as an interdisciplinary science based on the historical and pedagogical experience and taking into account modern integration processes that define the problematics of the content of folkloristic, culturological training of future pedagogue-researcher who is to be educated as a man of culture, nationally aware and, at the same time, multicultural personality.

AB  - This study provides a solid validity inferential network to guide the development, interpretation, and use of machine learning-based next-generation science assessments (NGSAs). Given that machine learning (ML) has been broadly implemented in the automatic scoring of constructed responses, essays, simulations, educational games, and interdisciplinary assessments to advance the evidence collection and inference of student science learning, we contend that additional validity issues arise for science assessments due to the involvement of ML. These emerging validity issues may not be addressed by prior validity frameworks developed for either non-science or non-ML assessments. We thus examine the changes brought in by ML to science assessments and identify seven critical validity issues of ML-based NGSAs: potential risk of misrepresenting the construct of interest, potential confounders due to that more variables may involve, nonalignment between interpretation and use of scores and designed learning goals, nonalignment between interpretation and use of scores and actual learning quality, nonalignment between machine scores and rubrics, limited generalizable ability of machine algorithmic models, and limited extrapolating ability of machine algorithmic models. Based on the seven validity issues identified, we propose a validity inferential network to address the cognitive, instructional, and inferential validity of ML-based NGSAs. To demonstrate the utility of this network, we present an exemplar of ML-based next-generation science assessments that was developed using a seven-step ML framework. We articulate how we used the validity inferential network to ensure accountable assessment design, as well as valid interpretation and use of machine scores.

AB  - Contribution: This longitudinal study modeled student leadership growth in a course sequence supporting long-term, large-scale, multidisciplinary projects embedded in faculty research. Students (half from computer science, computational media, electrical engineering, and computer engineering) participated for 1-4 semesters. Background: Project- based learning (PBL) is used widely in higher education. It is used in industry for leadership development, but leadership development in project-based learning (PBL) has not been explored in higher education. A preliminary analysis implied leadership growth through the third semester of participation, but the design did not control for attrition. Research Questions: At the student level, how do leadership role ratings change over multiple semesters of participation? Do first (and second) semester ratings differ by number of semesters students eventually participate? Methodology: The study involved two peer evaluation questions on 1) the degree to which students coordinated the team's work and 2) served as technical/content area leaders. Analysis employed analysis of variance to examine attrition by initial ratings (N = 1045) and multilevel growth modeling to study change over time (N = 585). A strength of using peer evaluations is the large sample size, but a weakness is that the tool was developed for student assessment and not educational research. The study did not control for participation in leadership programs outside the course. Findings: On average, individual leadership role ratings increased each semester through the third semester of participation. Ratings of students who left the program after 1 or 2 semesters did not differ from ratings for those who participated longer.

AB  - Plant-derived natural products are an important source of potential medicines and continue to have a major impact on the drug discovery process. Natural product discovery assignments provide an opportunity to present various experimental techniques to undergraduate students in introductory medicinal chemistry. This assignment was developed to serve as a meaningful hands-on exercise to introduce undergraduate Chemistry students to the common procedure in the early phase of drug discovery using inexpensive corn silk, in which the final year undergraduate student used Recycling Preparative High-Performance Liquid Chromatography to separate and purify steroids from corn silk. The student used advanced spectroscopic methods such as UV, IR, and one- and two-dimensional NMR to elucidate the structures of these steroids. The cytotoxic activity of these steroids was also evaluated and found to be non-cytotoxic to normal human MRC-5 cells at 60 µg/mL via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. With this assignment, students gain meaningful multidisciplinary hands-on exercises with the common procedure in the early stages of drug discovery and understand the process of isolating natural compounds that may lead to the development of new drugs.

AB  - Background: The advent of new and emerging technologies and industries has highlighted the need to equip youth with a unique skillset necessary to cope with a rapidly changing and complex digital era and adapt to modern societies' demands. This need has led to the development of teaching approaches to equip students with creative and innovative skills to help prevent any future skills gap. This shift has fuelled the growth of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) Education worldwide. Objectives: Our goal was to engage in a systematic review of the literature to identify the application and prevalence of emerging technologies within the landscape of STEAM Education. Methods: We engaged in a systematic review of the literature. Following the application of exclusion criteria to 461 studies, 43 studies were extracted and analysed. Findings and Conclusions: Analysis of these studies provides evidence of the fast-growing use of innovative emerging technologies within the STEAM landscape across all levels of education, from early childhood to college-level settings. Our analysis reveals an emphasis on developing STEAM-related disciplinary knowledge and the desire to develop students' 21st-century skills with a notable lack of targeted emphasis on developing understandings in the arts disciplines. We identify the need for carefully designed intervention studies involving collaboration between multidisciplinary STEAM experts that use high-quality measures which support the development of inferences relating to learning outcomes arising from such interventions.

AB  - An interdisciplinary Pop-Up Learning Community (PLC) allowed students from various disciplines with different levels of content knowledge to discuss their perspectives on and beliefs about climate change. The impact of this event on students' climate change beliefs was gauged by a survey from the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. This survey, the Six Americas Super Short Survey, consists of four questions relating to climate change belief. During the event, students participated in various activities, including faculty modeling of discussions about climate change using and highlighting their disciplinary perspectives and analysis skills, communications exercises, interdisciplinary table discussions, and writing in response to a social media message. After the conclusion of the event, students submitted reflections on their experiences at the PLC, which supplemented data collected during the event. Students gained an understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of climate change discussions and applied general education skills and knowledge to spoken and written conversations about climate change.

AB  - Energy is one of the most central and richly connected ideas across all science disciplines. The purpose of this study was to develop a measurement instrument for assessing students' understanding of the energy concept within and across different science disciplines. To achieve this goal, the Inter-Disciplinary Energy concept Assessment (IDEA) was developed through a pilot test, consisting of 49 items presented in pairs: multiple-choice questions followed by open-ended justification questions. The IDEA was administered to 356 college students in the United States. The partial credit Rasch model was applied to establish evidence of validity and reliability of measures for the IDEA. Results showed that the IDEA can produce reliable and valid measures of student understanding of the energy concept in different science disciplines. No statistical difference was found between the average difficulties of items across disciplines. In addition, the four science disciplines were positively correlated in terms of student understanding of the energy concept. When item difficulties were analyzed by science content topics, it was found that students have difficulty in understanding the energy concept in atomic structure, wave, electric and magnetic energy, and modern physics content areas. This result suggests that students' difficulty in understanding the energy concept is compounded with specific science contents.

AB  - Universities are recognizing the need to prepare graduates to think conceptually and have the ability to take on complex, real-world problems. Strategies to assess conceptual knowledge are limited and often require more time and effort to complete than is accessible for most undergraduate courses. Card sorting is a very broad technique for understanding how people group concepts, but in higher education has typically been used to show a student's development towards expert-like thinking in a discipline as a whole. However, it typically does not give much insight into how we should change our teaching. In this paper, using the novel setting of two terms of a first-year, earth and ocean science lab that uses problem-based learning (PBL), we show how one can generate a card sort that is built using course learning goals and then use the analysis to make actionable improvements to course instruction. Using a card sort designed so that the expert sort corresponds to learning goals supported by the lab activities, we found that in both offerings of the course students generally moved towards expert-like sorting with a reduction in novice-like sorting. A striking feature stood out in both terms of the course, with one question scoring significantly lower than any other expert pairings, despite a change in the wording of that question between terms. This suggests that our course materials do not promote this specific conceptual connection that we had expected and gives us a clear place to look for issues in our course material. In a broader context, our results suggest that tailoring card sort questions to material at a course level, rather than at the discipline level, can provide a manageable, routine assessment of conceptual knowledge in students, while also providing feedback on the quality of course materials.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to present a new master's programme for promoting energy access and energy efficiency in Southern Africa. Design/methodology/approach: A transdisciplinary approach called "participatory integrated assessment of energy systems" (PARTICIPIA) was used for the development of the curriculum. This approach is based on the two emerging fields of "multi-scale integrated assessment" and "science for governance", which bring innovative concepts and methods. Findings: The application of the PARTICIPIA methodology to three case studies reveals that the proposed transdisciplinary approach could support energy and development policies in the region. The implementation of the PARTICIPIA curriculum in three higher education institutions reveals its ability to respond to the needs of specific contexts and its connection with existing higher education programmes. Practical implications: Considering energy issues from a transdisciplinary approach in higher education is absolutely critical because such a holistic view cannot be achieved through engineering curricula. Deliberate and greater efforts should be made to integrate methods from "multi-scale integrated assessment" and "science for governance" in higher education curricula to train a new breed of modern-day energy planners in charge of coming up with solutions that are shared by all relevant stakeholders. Originality/value: This paper presents an innovative higher education curriculum in terms of the attention given to energy access and energy efficiency that affect the southern Africa region and the nature of the methodology adopted to face these issues.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to explore the effects of an alternative learning environment, such as the video game making (VGM) within science content, on computational thinking (CT) skills development and student performance. Design/methodology/approach: A didactic intervention was performed for five weeks. Two student groups were taught the same computational concepts in two ways. One group was taught by constructing a video game within science content to practice science and computing curriculum while the other group constructed appropriately designed projects to practice only the computing curriculum. Additionally, the students constructed a pretest project before the beginning of the intervention and a post-test project after its end. Results were based on quantitative and qualitative code analysis and interviews from the students. Findings: VGM within science content resulted in projects with more CT skills and also supported students to effectively apply their acquired coding skills, after the end of the intervention. Practical implications: The results of this study suggest an interdisciplinary environment, such as the VGM within science content, which can effectively support CT skills development and computing curriculum. Originality/value: Although VGM has been successfully applied to teach science content, this study explored the potential influence of this learning environment on CT skills development and coding fluency. Such interdisciplinary educational environments could be applied in the typical school settings to promote a plethora of skills and academic contents.

AB  - In this paper we study the changes in academic library services inspired by the Open Science movement and especially the changes prompted from Open Data as a founding part of Open Science. We argue that academic libraries face the even bigger challenges for accommodating and providing support for Open Big Data composed from existing raw data sets and new massive sets generated from data driven research. Ensuring the veracity of Open Big Data is a complex problem dominated by data science. For academic libraries, that challenge triggers not only the expansion of traditional library services, but also leads to adoption of a set of new roles and responsibilities. That includes, but is not limited to development of the supporting models for Research Data Management, providing Data Management Plan assistance, expanding the qualifications of library personnel toward data science literacy, integration of the library services into research and educational process by taking part in research grants and many others. We outline several approaches taken by some academic libraries and by libraries at the City University of New York (CUNY) to meet necessities imposed by doing research and education with Open Big Data -- from changes in libraries' administrative structure, changes in personnel qualifications and duties, leading the interdisciplinary advisory groups, to active collaboration in principal projects.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a science experimental guidebook for the mainstreamed students with learning disabilities and investigate its effect on their conceptual understanding of physical events. Through case study research methodology, the sample of the study consisted of 12 mainstreamed students with learning disabilities. To collect data, a conceptual understanding test, a drawing test, and interviews were used. The data were analyzed using four categories (sound understanding, partial understanding, alternative understanding, and no understanding). The results showed that the guidebook positively affected conceptual understanding of the mainstreamed students with learning disabilities. Even though the mainstreamed students with learning disabilities tended to comprehend related concepts through hands-on and minds-on activities/experiences, they still had some problems at transferring their gained knowledge to novel situations. Moreover, the results indicated that the mainstreamed students with learning disabilities were more successful in expressing their thoughts with drawings than the conceptual understanding test and interviews. The present study suggests that future studies should implement interdisciplinary approaches that intertwine special education with science education, mathematics education, and reading-writing practices.

AB  - Background: The South African Department of Basic Education (DBE) aims to expand science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) learning in the national curriculum through a "Digital Skills for All Curriculum" (DSfAC) for Grade R-9. The DSfAC intends to educate a STEM-literate future citizenry with refined computational thinking (CT), and coding and robotics skills. As with all learning, foundations are ideally laid when children are young and when they form habits of thinking that can ultimately serve as their first building blocks for successful learning. Current theoretical frameworks describe how teachers can include CT, coding and other STEM related constructs in their teaching. In the curriculum plan, a conceptual framework that underpins the design of teaching materials to support STEM literacy teaching, has, however, not yet been forwarded. Aim: Presenting a conceptual framework that has served as the design heuristic for a dialogue reading programme (DRP) for young children. The programme consists of three picture books, created to develop young children's digital skills and related vocabulary as outlined in the DSfAC through story texts and pictures. Method: I implemented an iterative participatory approach to develop the conceptual framework. Conclusion: The development of teaching materials, like a DRP, should have its genesis in a confluence of three interdisciplinary components to develop a conceptual framework: (1) scientific research and theories; (2) an iterative participatory approach which involves teachers, parents, children, and other role players in the development process; and (3) systematic utilisation of existing examples of relevant teaching materials.

AB  - The act of making provides students with an opportunity to create and design by using materials and technologies. Scholars who examine learning through making maintain that maker approaches to solving problems, creating designs, and thinking about real-world ideas promote the development of abstract thinking skills, such as modeling, and computational thinking (CT) skills. Our goal is to research the use of specific methods of maker education--such as experimenting with tools and hands-on designs--in learning mathematics. We ask: what are the benefits and potential outcomes for designing and teaching learning activities which integrate technology maker practices and pedagogies in mathematics and other school concepts in STEM contexts? We analyzed qualitative data on the benefits and potential outcomes of maker practices and pedagogies from three cases in Canada and Brazil. The researchers designed and facilitated the tasks to study the experiences of participants. Participants were observed, interviewed (or asked interview questions via a questionnaire), and completed reflection prompts. Their activities were recorded. The results show that learning from maker practices and pedagogies augments the learning of individual STEM disciplines, with specific settings and activity designs offering varied foci on mathematics and technology, on science, engineering and mathematics, or on science, technology and mathematics. Students, preservice teachers and teachers benefit in cognitive, interdisciplinary and social (situated) ways. Further research is needed to explore how deeper and other benefits, including critical benefits, may be achieved for learning and teaching mathematics and to explore which practices and pedagogies are associated with more potential outcomes.

AB  - Many newsworthy events have brought with them scientific developments that have furthered the knowledge and understanding of the world and impacted life today. Events such as these can provide the perfect way to link history with science and provide children with the opportunity to make the connection between science and everyday life. As Primary Science Teaching Trust (PSTT) mentors for the North West Area of England (Michele) and North Wales Region (Kathy), along with teacher Naomi Shallcross, have developed a set of resources based on key historical eras: 1066, 1666 and 1966. Science lies at the heart of these resources and the structure encourages progression in understanding, highlights the 'working scientifically' elements and links directly to the National Curriculum in England programmes of study for science and history (DfE, 2013a,b). Throughout each of the resources presented, careful consideration has been given to developing science enquiry skills, all linked to the history context. It is the authors' belief that using science as a vehicle for teaching history brings positives and allows relevance and continuity for both subjects.

AB  - Learning standards for K-12 science education emphasize the importance of engaging students in practices that scientists perform in their profession. K-12 teachers are expected to engage students in scientific modeling, which entails constructing, testing, evaluating, and revising their own models of science phenomena while pursuing an epistemic goal. However, conceptualizing models of unobservable science phenomena without support is daunting for students. We propose that creating science simulations with block-based coding in Scratch is a promising approach to support student's scientific modeling and learning to code. However, research indicates that preservice and in-service science teachers often hold a deficient understanding of scientific modeling instruction, and lack experience teaching with coding. Professional learning on use of block-based coding in scientific modeling instruction is needed though such interdisciplinary research is scarce. In this paper, we review pertinent literature and propose five guidelines for teacher educators striving to offer such professional learning. The guidelines informed the design and development of coding in scientific modeling lessons (CS-ModeL), which is a module and an online tool for scaffolding teachers' learning to code science simulations, and to integrate simulation coding activities into scientific modeling lessons, respectively. We discuss how guidelines informed the design and development of CS-ModeL, as well as plans for future research.

AB  - According to the curricula in various countries, teachers in the subject areas of science, social science and language are often expected to collaborate on cross-curricular issues such as sustainable development (SD) in the 9-year compulsory school. This study is based in Sweden and investigates teachers' teaching traditions. The overall aim of this study is to understand what educational content teacher teams can offer students through cross-curricular collaborations. The specific aim in Part 1 of this article is to discern the distribution of teachers' teaching traditions from different subject areas. Part 2 offers a reflection tool for teachers and teacher teams to discern teaching traditions. The results show that teachers from different subject areas stress different yet complimentary aspects of environmental and sustainability (ESE) teaching. A fair distribution of teaching traditions in a teacher team will offer students better learning opportunities to develop and enhance their action competence for sustainable development.

AB  - Learners of English as a new language and the teachers who find these young people in their classrooms face many challenges. For secondary science educators, this is often rooted in a general lack of professional development models for the design and implementation of science/language integrated instruction. To address this issue, the present study examines how participation in a paired professional development initiative with focus on multimodalities impacts teachers' pedagogical expertise in both language and science learning. We specifically examine the expert understandings and pedagogical skills developed by two teachers, one chemistry, one English to Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), who co-designed and co-taught science/language integrated lessons. Analysis of the pair's collaborative processes, resulting lessons, and their reflections on these reveals expertise gained in three main areas: attending to both content and language, seamless integration of multimodal technology, and formative assessment. Implications for the pairing of language and science educators along with roles and impacts of multimodal teaching strategies are discussed. Lastly, a language/content pairing model with emphasis on multimodal teaching strategies is recommended as an effective means for meeting the challenges of linguistically diverse science classrooms.

AB  - Civic education in undergraduate institutions is of vital importance to the civic health of society, but faculty often find it difficult to incorporate civic components into existing courses and lack the resources to incorporate civic outreach into their curriculum. As a result, research has shown that time spend on civic engagement is limited. Additionally, civic engagement is rarely discussed, much less encouraged, outside of political science or other social science classes. In this article, we assess the outcomes of a unique co-curricular civic engagement research and learning program in which undergraduate students are required to work with an external partner, usually a municipal agency or nonprofit, to complete an independent research project. Using quantitative and qualitative student evaluations, we find that students had an overwhelmingly positive experience with the program. They especially appreciated the opportunity to work on "real world" issues in an interdisciplinary setting. They also expressed a desire for a longer program that extended beyond a single semester. We discuss the potential implications of these findings.

AB  - As an emerging field of theory, research, and practice, STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) has received attention for its efforts to incorporate the arts into the rubric of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) learning. In particular, many informal educators have embraced it as an inclusive and authentic approach to engaging young people with STEM. Yet, as with many nascent fields, the conceptualization and usage of STEAM is somewhat ambivalent and weakly theorized. On the one hand, STEAM offers significant promise through its focus on multiple ways of knowing and new pathways to equitable learning. On the other hand, it is often deployed in theory, pedagogy, and practice in ambiguous or potentially problematic ways toward varying ends. This paper attempts to disentangle some of the key tensions and contradictions of the STEAM concept as currently operationalized in educational research, policy, and practice. We pay particular attention to the transformative learning potential supported by contexts where STEAM is conceptualized as both pedagogical and mutually instrumental. That is, neither STEM nor arts are privileged over the other, but both are equally in play. We link the possibilities suggested by this approach to emerging theories for understanding how designing for and surfacing epistemic practices linked to the relevant disciplines being integrated into STEAM programs may point the way toward resolving tensions in inter- and transdisciplinary learning approaches.

AB  - The study aimed to examine the effects of design-based STEM activities developed for renewable energy sources on science teacher candidates' perceptions, attitudes, and behavioral orientations. The one-group pretest-posttest design was used. The participants comprised 40 second-grade teacher candidates studying at a public university, and the study lasted for 14 weeks. The data were collected using a renewable energy perception scale, renewable energy sources attitude scale, sustainable consumption behavior scale, and STEM product-performance observation form. The results demonstrated that design-based STEM activities towards renewable energy sources enhanced teacher candidates' perception, attitude, and behavior toward renewable energy sources. However, there was no statistically significant increase in the unneeded consumption sub-dimension of the sustainable consumption behavior scale and the renewable energy-environment relationship sub-dimension of the renewable energy perception scale.

AB  - To recruit and retain more students in all science disciplines at our small (5,000 student) public university, we implemented an interdisciplinary strategy focusing on nanotechnology and enhanced undergraduate research. Inherently interdisciplinary, the novelty of nanotechnology and its growing career potential appeal to students. To engage students in learning and to keep them engaged, we offer progressively more independent research opportunities with faculty mentors and encourage participation in a robust science learning community that supports students outside the classroom. Activities beginning in the freshman year build connections with faculty members and student peers and foster a growing individual identity as scientists. Since implementing this approach in 2005, a total of 73 students have enrolled and 32 have graduated. Half of the currently enrolled students are biology-chemistry majors and the rest are physics majors. We have significantly increased the number of student publications in peer-reviewed journals. These gains were achieved without sacrificing standards: 32 graduates have earned on average 148 credits and maintained a mean GPA of 3.17, and half have gone on to graduate school.

AB  - To address the recent calls for integration between liberal arts education and the business curriculum, we designed the team-taught interdisciplinary course, How to Cell: Marketing Meets Microbiology. The course blended multiple introductory courses, focused on environmental issues involving microbiology, and addressed how they were being "marketed" to the public. It introduced students from business, science, and other majors to presumably unrelated topics. Our main objective was to help students gain a greater sense of awareness about the roles of business and science in environmental management activities.

AB  - The aim of this study is to find out effects of science teaching through Science-Technology-Society [STT] approach on elementary school students' creative thinking skills, attitudes towards science lesson, and academic success. To this end, a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design without the control group was used among quantitative research models. The study participants were composed of 6 classroom teachers who had previously taken in-service training [IST] on STS approach and their students (N=273) selected through random sampling. Study data were collected by using the Creative Thinking Skills Scale (CTSS), Science and Technology Course Attitude Survey [STCAS], and Academic Achievement Test [AAT]. The data were analyzed by conducting one-way ANOVA test with SPSS. The results showed that the students in STT classes could improve their creative thinking skills, attitudes towards science course, and academic achievement compared to their peers in the classes. It can thus be useful to encourage teachers to perform teaching based on approaches addressing science-technology-society relation. As another recommendation, it is suggested to prepare professional development programs.

AB  - Working remotely and collaboratively, our interdisciplinary team created an educational development workshop, "Thinking Skills for the 21st Century: Teaching for Transfer," in which participants not only experience, apply, and reflect on teaching across educational settings but also connect this work to principles that have been demonstrated by learning science to support the transfer of knowledge. We used backward design to develop the workshop and evidence-based pedagogies in its implementation. We facilitated the workshop at two different national meetings for distinct audiences and also as part of an on-campus faculty development program. Here, we report on the workshop development and revision, assessment of participant experience, and the evolution of our collaborative process.

AB  - In this article, we first (re)trace the presence and absence of mining, metals and extractionary practices, what we call MMEs, from environmental and sustainability curricular frameworks United Nations' Act Now Framework. Then, we critique the swelling markets, mentalities, and mastermindings used to develop and produce "clean" and "renewable" energy sources/solutions. As one of many examples, there is increasing skepticism among Indigenous communities that history may repeat itself as the quest for "clean" results in further displacement and violations of tribal sovereignty (Healy & Baker, 2021; Holzman & Waldman, 2022; Shah & Bloomer, 2018). Notwithstanding our (e.g., authors) academic positionalities in social studies education, one of our conclusions considers the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration between science and social studies on the issue of sustainability through MMEs.

AB  - General Studies (Sachunterricht) lesson, which includes social and science themes because of its interdisciplinary form, takes place in the curriculum of each class level at primary schools in Germany. The aim of this descriptive case study is to examine how the teaching process of third-grade General Studies lesson is run in terms of learning place, teaching methods and techniques, and materials. The participants of it are six teachers of third grade from three different primary schools. The data were collected through classroom observations and interviews with teachers. While analysing the data, the content and the descriptive analysis methods were used. The results indicate that the teachers use classrooms, corridors, the workshop room, the schoolyards, trip fields and sport fields as learning spaces. Some of the teaching methods and techniques used are learning stations, project, class council, field trips, experiments, cooperative learning and teachers choose various teaching materials, depending on the theme.

AB  - Examining an interdisciplinary university course for architecture, wood science, and engineering students, this paper studies how the students' ability to master digital workflows influenced their success in learning collaborative design skills. It highlights potential challenges and opportunities posed by the introduction of new digital tools to support emerging integrated building design in both education and professional practice. The particular course focuses on the wood industry, which is rapidly changing from a very traditional to a highly innovative sector and increasingly embracing the latest technological developments in computational design, simulation, and digital fabrication. This study explores the influence of parametric design on collaboration dynamics and workflow within an interdisciplinary group of students embodying the roles of manufacturer, engineer, and architect. Student-generated data of the first three years of the class is analyzed thematically to find correlations with productive collaborations. Focusing on a stage of an evolving teaching and learning process, this analysis allows identifications of common themes and patterns, suggesting implications for practice and future research. The course highlights the need to integrate data interoperability, collaboration skill-building, and material awareness in contemporary digitally enabled architecture, engineering, and construction education. The lessons learned in this course can be of value to academic programs and professional firms involved in incorporating digital design and interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - There is a broad consensus on the recognition of cinema as a means of acquiring media literacy. The problematization of cinema as an artistic expression and the promotion of interdisciplinarity between the areas of communication, cinema and education and artistic education in particular that have been established in the field of communication science teaching. In this context, the purpose of this article is to describe action-research projects that are repeated annually, when students are confronted with cinema, audiovisual language, analysis of still and moving images, the follow-up of documentary creation with students from different courses, and their involvement in the dynamization of an audiovisual space from the text of a Portuguese writer, Almada Negreiros "Manifesto Anti Dantas" or interviews in rural communities, using video cameras, within the International Project Rural 3.0 Service-Learning for Rural Development, which is an international transversal project, funded in July 2018 by E+ Knowledge Alliances, coordinated by the School of Education of the Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo, involving sixteen partners from eight European countries.

AB  - Teaching economic history requires the study of how to combine the economists' modeling and statistical methods with the methods used by historians and the other social sciences. It often involves learning how to search for quantitative data from a variety of sources and then building panel datasets that match the data found with existing datasets. Economic historians also must work with narrative sources to develop an understanding of the historical context and the political, social, and economic institutions that influence the research questions. In some settings, the analysis focuses fully on narrative evidence because it is the only material available. While modern studies are restricted because the future is unknown, economic history can examine issues in the short, intermediate, and long run. Economic history provides a rich palette for educating undergraduate students in economics and the social sciences. The field is even more interdisciplinary than the wedding of history and economics. In 1978, Nobel Laureate Douglass North described its task as the study of the performance and structure of economies through time. North's research agenda over the rest of his career combined politics, religion, perceptions, ideologies, the sociology of knowledge, and a variety of topics studied by scholars throughout the social sciences.

AB  - For the advancement of current and future economic and overall well-being to occur, STEM professionals are highly needed. STEM education is an approach that integrates science, technology, engineering and mathematics curricula into one interdisciplinary curriculum. In the context of STEM education, learners acquire deep and critical thinking abilities, which help them become creative and analytic thinkers, and hence innovators in their careers. For this to happen, the teacher must be trained to successfully design and effectively teach an integrated STEM curriculum. The purpose of this study was to analyze Saudi Arabian science and mathematics teachers' attitudes toward integrating Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in teaching before and after they participated in a short professional development program focused on STEM integration in a specific middle school science and mathematics content. The participants were 48 Saudi Arabian science and mathematics teachers, who participated in a 6-day program held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The research methodology was a pretest-posttest one group (pre-experimental) design. The primary data source was the Instrument for Teachers' Attitudes Toward Teaching Integrated STEM. The results indicate that Saudi Arabian science and mathematics teachers' perceptions of difficulties decreased due to their participation in the professional development program on integrated STEM. Meanwhile, the teachers' self-efficacy improved following their participation in the STEM professional development (PD) program. However, no perceived effect was found for the teachers' perceptions of the relevance of or their anxiety about or enjoyment of Integrated STEM teaching due to their participation in the 6-day PD program. We argue that Engaging teachers in integrated STEM professional development may improve their attitudes toward and increase their interest in teaching this approach. To improve teachers' attitudes toward, it is suggested that future PD programs should be long and continuous, and focus on training science and mathematics teachers to teach integrated STEM subjects.

AB  - Despite the interest, curiosity and the enthusiasm of the large public for Astronomy as a scientific discipline, it is absent from the current Romanian curriculum. We present here the results of two surveys that involve parents and teachers and show the necessity, the relevance and the usefulness of including astronomy as a discipline in the curriculum, or at least astronomical related content. We emphasize the interdisciplinary character of Astronomy and suggest using Astronomy as a tool in motivating students towards science and in integrating the science curriculum. Astronomy is amazingly the oldest interdisciplinary approach to science and a most natural way of curriculum integration.

AB  - Nowadays, the rapid spread of the interdisciplinary approach contributes to the development of disciplines and scientific developments in many ways. Therefore, how the interdisciplinary approach is addressed in the studies carried out is important in terms of guiding other studies. For this purpose, an attempt to determine how 155 doctorate theses which were written in science departments at a university located in Turkey's south between 2010-2016 addressed the study discipline, subject of study and interdisciplinary approach process was made in this study. Furthermore, the opinions of instructors working in these departments on the interdisciplinary approach were also examined. As a result of the study, it was seen that 140 theses were written with the disciplinary approach, 15 theses were written with the interdisciplinary approach, and they were also associated with economics, sociology, psychology and geography among social science disciplines. The facts that the concept of interdisciplinary is not exactly known and that the necessary conditions for studying have not been provided, the lack of time, the presence of gaps in disciplines and failure to ensure the adequate cooperation are important reasons for the limited number of studies carried out with the interdisciplinary approach. Therefore, it is important to promote interdisciplinary studies and to provide suitable conditions for studying.

AB  - This study examines the use of critical questions (CQs) as an 'explicit' pedagogical method in the nature of science to teach Chinese high school students topics of philosophy of science (POS). The study results, evaluated through deductive thematic and qualitative comparative analyses using Toulmin's argumentation patterns and a critical integrative argumentation model, revealed that students who participated in the POS course showed significant improvement in understanding and application of argumentation by asking CQs as suggested by instructors. This finding strongly supports the use of CQs for rebuttals in argumentation based on crisp qualitative comparative analysis. The study results have broad implications for how CQs can promote engagement in high school argumentation. The study conclusions highlight the limitations of oral questioning in classroom argumentation. Finally, the study discusses how POS can improve students' classroom argumentation.

AB  - Background: Little research exists which describes how mathematics and science constructivist beliefs are developed in a dual content mathematics/science methods course, and if beliefs within one discipline inform the other. If mathematics and science beliefs inform one another, then this would enrich learning in both disciplines. Purpose: The study's purpose was to (a) understand how a dual content methods course centered on problem-solving was able to concurrently enrich PSTs' mathematics and science beliefs, and (b) determine if PSTs entered the course with similar mathematics and science beliefs, and how these similar beliefs changed throughout the course. Sample: PSTs (N = 113) participated in ten iterations of the course. Design and methods: PSTs completed a mathematics and science belief instrument at the start and end of the course. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to determine if PSTs entered the course with similar or different beliefs in mathematics and science, and independent samples t-test was conducted to look for significant changes between the factors from the pretest and posttest. Results: Findings show that (a) the course caused PSTs' beliefs to become more constructivist-based; and (b) PSTs entered and exited the course with similar beliefs in mathematics and science. Conclusion: PSTs may have holistic constructivistic beliefs -- which stand in contrast to discipline-specific beliefs -- that inform the teaching and learning of both mathematics and science. Implications include that education programs should emphasize problem-solving and constructivism in courses outside of mathematics and science, to enrich instruction and learning in all courses.

AB  - Facilitating successful informal STEM learning experiences is essential for building knowledge and comfort with STEM content for children and teachers alike. Informal learning experiences are by nature hands-on and interdisciplinary and provide play-based, real-world, authentic learning experiences. This article describes what elementary teacher candidates learn about teaching science from facilitating a STEM event within school settings and outside regular school hours. The article also presents implications for elementary-teacher education.

AB  - This article describes a project that integrates English Language Arts (ELA) and coding into environmental science. For this project, students researched science content about human impact on the environment, communicated their findings through a traditionally formatted narrative story, and then used a coding program called Scratch to create an animation. Students had to use critical thinking to design an animation that effectively used text and visuals to communicate science concepts in an engaging and coherent way. The purpose of this interdisciplinary project on human impacts on the environment was threefold. First, it sought to deepen students' three-dimensional science learning by purposefully integrating related ELA standards. The reading and writing standards reinforced the science and engineering practice of obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information and the crosscutting concept of cause and effect (NRC 2012) within the context of Earth science. Second, it broadens students' understanding of human impacts on the environment; this is important not only from an academic learning standpoint but also from a global citizenship standpoint. Finally, it engages students in an opportunity to use coding to demonstrate their science and ELA learning. This lesson is aligned to fifth-grade Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and Common Core State Standards (CCSS) ELA standards; however, it was implemented in a fourth-grade classroom. The discrepancy exists because of slight differences between state and national standards.

AB  - This study is the first systematic review of research on outdoor learning occurring in all disciplines and interdisciplinary areas of study at higher education institutions in the United States and published in refereed English language journals. The article describes characteristics of outdoor learning research (OLR) and outdoor learning (OL). It discusses similarities, differences, challenges and trends as well as recommending additional research. The research protocol consists of a systematic search of 10 bibliographic databases using 18 keywords and 5 structural criteria to identify articles. This yielded 183 refereed articles published between 1996 and 2020 for analysis. Results and discussion are presented in seven categories. Outdoor learning research (OLR) publication frequency is growing, but is diffused among many journals resulting in limited communication of results. OLR is not a primary focus for most authors, limiting progress in understanding and development. OLR occurs at doctoral institutions and is distributed across disciplines and interdisciplinary areas. OLR is mostly descriptive, often case studies. Theory testing and inferential research is less common. Outdoor learning (OL) occurs in many academic areas with agriculture and social sciences, sustainability and adventure being most frequent. Learning methods use constructivist theory and experiential methods. Venues are diverse. OL drivers and barriers are generic and need elaboration. Enhanced learning and improved practices are stated outcomes. OL is a growing, but disjointed component of U.S. higher education. OLR demonstrates that OL addresses changing academic and participant interests. Recommendations to enhance OL practice are provided. Suggestions are made for future outdoor learning research.

AB  - This design case chronicles the efforts of an interdisciplinary team of researchers as they collaborated with middle grades science teachers and students to build and refine an epidemic disease curriculum module. The initial five-day design was delivered in five science classrooms at three nearby schools where researcher classroom observations and teacher feedback drove iterative refinements of the module's materials. The final design of this module consisted of four instructional days of modeling and simulation activities that integrate computational thinking practices, computer science concepts, and life sciences content. The paper aims to illustrate the design motivations to address contextual constraints such as tight curricular schedules and varied levels of exposure to programming for both teachers and students. The instructional materials presented in this design case were the result of a three-year long research-practice partnership with science teachers at nearby middle schools.

AB  - This paper describes a three-year curriculum innovation project on teaching about climate change. The innovation for this study focused on a socio-critical approach towards teaching climate change in four different teaching domains (biology, chemistry, physics and politics). The teaching itself explicitly aimed at general educational objectives, i.e., fostering students' communication and evaluation abilities as essential components for preparing young people for active participation in society. Participatory Action Research has been used as a collaborative strategy of cyclical curriculum innovation and research. Using past experiences and selected results from accompanying research, this project and its methodology will be reflected upon from the viewpoint of the chemistry group taking part in the project. Core issues reflected upon include how the project contributed to the creation of feasible curriculum materials, how it led to innovative structures in practice, and whether it supported experienced teachers' ongoing professional development. General considerations for the process of curriculum innovation will also be derived.

AB  - This paper draws together two important agendas in science education. The first is making science education more inclusive such that students from non-Western or indigenous cultures can benefit from culturally relevant curricula. The second is integrating technology into the curriculum under the umbrella of Science-Technology-Society (STS) education to embrace the social aspects of science, with technology serving as a bridge. The advancement of the first agenda is hindered by the pursuance by both Western and non-Western societies of narrow cultural and practical goals without considering the development of science and technology from a cross-cultural perspective. The second agenda is limited by the misconception that technology is applied science, leading to the exclusion from STS discussions of pre-science or indigenous technologies developed by non-Western cultures. Through selected case studies of the evolution of Chinese traditional technologies and their interaction with science, this paper offers a perspective from the Far East, and argues for situating culturally responsive science education in broader historical and cross-cultural contexts to acknowledge the multi-cultural contributions to science and technology. A form of cross-cultural STS education is advanced, encompassing the cultural basis of technological developments, technology diffusion, interactions of traditional technology with science, and the potential development of traditional or indigenous technologies. This approach provides a bridge between the existing universal science education paradigm promoted in the West and the different forms of multi-cultural education advocated by indigenous science educators. To translate theory into practice, a conceptual framework is proposed in which the essential transdisciplinary knowledge base, curricular goals, and pedagogical approaches are embedded.

AB  - The GoSTEAM program promotes authentic integration of the arts into PreK-12 computer science, engineering, and invention instruction. STEM and arts teachers come together to form STEAM Innovation Teams in collaboration with university-based coaches and creative Innovators-in-Residence. Starting with a STEAM professional development summer institute and continuing throughout the year, the teams come together to design and implement novel STEAM lessons and initiatives in their schools that integrate learning goals from both the STEM and the art disciplines. This type of transdisciplinary collaboration between colleagues from vastly different fields is new to most teachers and presents unique challenges. A primary goal of the GoSTEAM professional development is therefore to create safe, interdisciplinary spaces where meaningful, cross-disciplinary collaborations can occur. In 2019, this was accomplished through an intensive, 120- hour face-to-face summer professional institute that incorporated many community building activities and collaborative planning sessions. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the summer institute changed to an online format and faced the challenge of providing teachers with a personally meaningful STEAM experience during a summer of crisis. Results show that the 2020 institute successfully supported the teachers, energized them, and provided them with tools to augment their virtual instruction. This paper describes the program adaptations due to COVID-19.

AB  - Underpinning the teaching of coding with Computational Thinking has proved relevant for diverse learners, particularly given the increasing demand in upskilling for today's labour market. While literature on computing education is vast, it remains unexplored how existing CT conceptualisations relate to the learning opportunities needed for a meaningful application of coding in non-Computer Scientists' lives and careers. In order to identify and organise the learning opportunities in the literature about CT, we conducted a configurative literature review of studies published on Web of Science, between 2006 and 2021. Our sample gathers 34 papers and was analysed on NVivo to find key themes. We were able to organise framings of CT and related learning opportunities into three dimensions: functional, collaborative, and critical and creative. These dimensions make visible learning opportunities that range from individual cognitive development to interdisciplinary working with others, and to active participation in a technologically evolving society. By comparing and contrasting frameworks, we identify and explain different perspectives on skills. Furthermore, the three-dimensional model can guide pedagogical design and practice in coding courses.

AB  - An effective guided inquiry forensic case study (a pharmacy break-in) is described for first-year students. Four robust introductory forensic chemistry and biology experiments are used to analyze potential drug samples and determine the identity of a possible suspect. Students perform presumptive tests for blood on a "point of entry stain" sample; perform chemical presumptive tests on the "suspected drug" alongside known standards of codeine, morphine, and amphetamine; and carry out thin-layer chromatography analysis of the drug samples. They examine the specificity of the Kastle-Meyer and tetramethylbenzidine tests, prepare polymerase chain reaction samples from the suspects' DNA samples, and perform gel electrophoresis to analyze the results. Students are required to analyze and integrate the results and to apply their acquired knowledge within the context of an engaging forensic case study. This first-year laboratory is part of a forensic case study vertically integrated into the curriculum.

AB  - Background/Context: Youth activism, the broad-based leadership among young people who seek to challenge and build alternatives to oppressive social systems, has spread across the nation and globe. Yet youth activism is often hemmed in at school gates, particularly by school leaders charged with maintaining efficient school environments. Focus of Study: This article explores the roles and responsibilities of educational leaders committed to justice and asks: What does it mean to lead schools in times of (re)surgent youth activism? Research Design: To address this urgent question, we conducted an interdisciplinary review of youth participation in social movements that spans the fields of civic engagement, learning sciences, and social movement studies. Findings: We argue that youth activism offers profound sites of consequential learning, generative insights for organizational redesign, and imaginative visions for school and societal transformation. Based on these contributions, we offer the notion of educational leadership as accompaniment: a participatory praxis of leadership reflection and action that foregrounds an ethic of listening, attends to dominant forms of exclusion, and stands in solidarity with youth and their struggles for a more dignified and just world. Conclusions/Recommendations: Leadership as accompaniment challenges the deeply rooted managerial imperative in school administration scholarship and deepens opportunities for realizing existing leadership principles, such as those evident in the Professional Standards for Educational Leaders (PSEL). We conclude by discussing the social and material risks impacting those who exercise leadership as accompaniment, and consider what responsibilities such risks demand of education researchers.

AB  - Machine learning has evolved and expanded as an interdisciplinary research method for educational sciences. However, cheating detection of test collusion among multiple examinees or sets of examinees with unusual answer patterns using machine learning techniques has remained relatively unexplored. This study investigates collusion on multiple-choice tests by introducing feature representation methodologies and machine learning algorithms that can be jointly used as a promising method; they can be used not only to detect individual examinees involved in the collusion but also to evaluate test collusion with or without the groups of potentially dishonest examinees identified a priori. Furthermore, using small-sample examples, the visual detection procedures of the current study were articulated to help identify questionable item response groups and simultaneously focus on the specific individuals providing anomalous answers.

AB  - Although the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) has a substantial history as a research domain, never before has the rapid evolution of AI applications in education sparked such prominent public discourse. Given the already rapidly growing AIEd literature base in higher education, now is the time to ensure that the field has a solid research and conceptual grounding. This review of reviews is the first comprehensive meta review to explore the scope and nature of AIEd in higher education (AIHEd) research, by synthesising secondary research (e.g., systematic reviews), indexed in the Web of Science, Scopus, ERIC, EBSCOHost, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and ACM Digital Library, or captured through snowballing in OpenAlex, ResearchGate and Google Scholar. Reviews were included if they synthesised applications of AI solely in formal higher or continuing education, were published in English between 2018 and July 2023, were journal articles or full conference papers, and if they had a method section. 66 publications were included for data extraction and synthesis in EPPI Reviewer, which were predominantly systematic reviews (66.7%), published by authors from North America (27.3%), conducted in teams (89.4%) in mostly domestic-only collaborations (71.2%). Findings show that these reviews mostly focused on AIHEd generally (47.0%) or Profiling and Prediction (28.8%) as thematic foci, however key findings indicated a predominance of the use of Adaptive Systems and Personalisation in higher education. Research gaps identified suggest a need for greater ethical, methodological, and contextual considerations within future research, alongside interdisciplinary approaches to AIHEd application. Suggestions are provided to guide future primary and secondary research.

AB  - Religious matters have traditionally been considered as a sensitive subject in French state schools. Since 1989 and the first 'Muslim headscarf affair', faith-related conflicts in those institutions have been the subject of a relatively opaque counting policy. Mobilising several state institutions- which alternatively cooperate or compete- this quantification has deeply reshaped the way the French state perceived religious expressions, especially those linked to Islam, in schools. This article, based on newly released archives, uses an interdisciplinary approach (history, education science, political sociology) to study these political and administrative phenomena.

AB  - This paper presents an overview of critical policy scholarship (CPS) in education. Historically, policy research has been dominated by what is commonly referred to as the policy science tradition, which is positivist in its philosophical stance and instrumentalist in its purpose--it focuses on producing knowledge relevant for policy decisions. However, with the rise of interpretive social inquiry in the 1970s and against the backdrop of unique political developments in the 1980s, CPS emerged as an alternative policy research perspective. This review discusses the scope and foci of CPS in education under four themes: methodological assumptions, interdisciplinary roots, enduring analytical goals, and emerging empirical contexts. Implications of the prevalence of inequality, Big Data and digital panopticon for educational policymaking and policy research are also briefly discussed. The paper concludes that although its foci of analysis have shifted considerably in the last four decades, analytical interest and tools of CPS remain largely unchanged.

The framework incorporates levels of explanation and methodologies both from education and brain sciences. The purpose is to initiate a discussion on the major goals of educational neuroscience as a field, discuss which approaches can provide the ground for a fruitful transdisciplinary fusion of ideas and methods from relevant fields, and propose embodied approaches to cognition as a theoretical scaffold that can amalgamate the multiple levels of inquiry.

AB  - This paper gives the rationale and a draft outline for a framework for education to teach epistemic insight into schools in England. The motivation to research and propose a strategy to teach and assess epistemic insight followed research that investigated how students and teachers in primary and secondary schools respond to "big questions" about the nature of reality and human personhood. The research revealed that there are pressures in schools that dampen students' expressed curiosity in these types of questions and limit their developing epistemic insight into how science, religion and the wider humanities relate. These findings prompted the construction of a "framework for education" for students aged 5-16 designed to encourage students' expressed interest in "big questions" and develop their understanding of the ways that science interacts with other ways of knowing. The centrepiece of the framework is a sequence of learning objectives for epistemic insight, organised into three categories. The categories are, firstly, the nature of science in real world contexts and multidisciplinary arenas; secondly, ways of knowing and how they interact; and thirdly, the relationships between science and religion. Our current version of the Framework is constructed to respond to the way that teaching is organised in England. The key principles and many of the activities could be adopted and tailored to work in many other countries.

AB  - Background: The Framework for K-12 Science Education (NRC, 2012) and Next Generation Science Standards ([NGSS] NGSS Lead States, 2013) emphasize that all students from the earliest grades onward must have the opportunity to learn and actively participate in authentic science. In K-12 science instruction, this means that students should have the opportunity to learn by applying the three dimensions of science and engineering practices, disciplinary core ideas, and crosscutting concepts in the context of reasoning about phenomena and problem solving. Yet, the current reality is there is a lack of emphasis on teaching science in the early elementary grades and the quality of what is being taught varies tremendously, both in content and quality (NAS, 2022). Recently, NGSS-designed instructional materials for the elementary grades have become available to school districts, creating an opportunity for conducting evidence-based research on the efficacy of NGSS designed curricula. We conducted a study of an integrated science and literacy curriculum (ISLC) for first grade classrooms that was initially developed with funding from IES. The curriculum, now a part of the commercially available K-5 Amplify Science program, was designed to support integrated science, language, and literacy learning, consistent with the NGSS. We evaluated the efficacy of ISLC for improving first grade students' learning in relation to NGSS performance expectations and to Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy. Two primary research questions motivated this paper: (1) What is the impact of ISLC and accompanying professional learning on students' science and literacy learning? and (2) Does the impact of ISLC on learning vary for students with different prior achievement or other policy-relevant characteristics? Setting and Participants: The study was conducted in 40 ethnically and culturally diverse elementary schools across three districts in California, involving 82 first-grade teachers and 2035 students. One treatment school dropped from the study before the student outcome learning outcome assessments were administered. Each district was committed to providing regular science instruction in the early elementary grades. Table 1 shows the composition of the analytic student sample. Seventy percent of students receive free-or-reduced price lunch (FRPL) and 74 percent identify as Hispanic. Table 1 also shows the results of baseline equivalence tests for the analytic sample. Groups were equivalent at baseline on prior reading proficiency (Hedge g = 0.02) with some minor differences in ethnic composition. Intervention: The ISLC materials consist of three units, each focused on one of three science domains: life, physical, and Earth and space science. Each unit consists of 22 45-minute lessons that can be taught within a 6-8 week period. The curriculum adopts a model of literacy and science integration that embraces a reciprocal relationship: that reading, writing, and language can be employed to promote the learning of science; and that students can make substantial progress in literacy development when reading, writing, and language are used to support science learning. The curriculum includes 3 professional learning (PL) sessions (a total of 4 days) distributed across the school year and timed to prepare teachers to teach each unit. Research Design: Schools were randomly assigned within district to either implement ISLC materials (treatment) or their business as usual materials (control) in their first-grade classrooms. Prior to assignment, schools were matched on enrollment size, percent minority and percent economically disadvantaged students. Teachers in the control group were asked to teach with their regular curriculum materials and participate in typical science professional learning provided by their districts. Control teachers were accountable to the same NGSS performance expectations and coverage of the same Grade 1 science topics as treatment teachers. Outcome Measures: The outcome measures included two standardized Iowa Assessments for Grade 1 Reading and Science and two study-developed NGSS-aligned assessments of science learning and science vocabulary-in-use. All assessments were administered on paper by teachers in the spring towards the end of the school year. Spanish-versions of the assessments were administered by teachers when all their instruction was in Spanish. Further details on the study-developed assessments are included in the Appendix. Data Analysis: We investigated the effect of ISLC on student learning and possible moderators using a multilevel linear regression model (students within schools). Student-level covariates included prior reading scores from fall assessments, gender, English-learner (EL), FRPL and Individualized Education Plan (IEP) status, and ethnicity. At the school-level, the randomization block was the covariate. Results and Discussion: Table 2 shows the results of the impact analysis. We found statistically significantly positive effects of the ISLC curriculum on the study-developed science learning assessment (Hedges g = +0.24) and the science vocabulary-in-use assessment (Hedges g = +0.46). We also found a small positive effect (Hedges g = +0.09) on the science component of the standardized Iowa assessment. This result was somewhat expected given that the Iowa science assessment was not designed for the NGSS and thus less likely to be instructionally sensitive to the use of an NGSS-designed curriculum. Finally, we found no difference between conditions on the standardized Iowa reading assessment. This is an intriguing result. We believe the null effect result for the Iowa reading assessment may be evidence that teachers can teach considerably more science in the early grades using ISLC without concern that students' reading scores will be negatively impacted. We are currently investigating the differences in time spent in science instruction between conditions. None of the effects on learning varied by prior achievement, ethnicity, or FRPL, IEP, or EL status. Conclusions: The NGSS vision for learning requires changes in how science curriculum and instruction are conceptualized, supported, and implemented (Penuel et al., 2015). The results of this study shows promising evidence that curriculum materials designed for the early grades to support NGSS teaching and learning can improve student acquisition of ambitious science skills and science vocabulary usage. As other new-NGSS designed materials become more widely used across geographic regions and with varying student populations, additional studies at larger scale will be needed so that we can further build the evidence base for the uptake of science in the elementary grades.

AB  - There is a prevalent consensus among science education scholars that teaching socioscientific issues (SSI) has notable importance for promoting functional scientific literacy and raising responsible citizens. However, teachers encounter numerous problems when teaching SSI, so they may not prefer to teach them. Today, we still do not know many specific particulars about how teachers' own opinions, beliefs, or experiences influence the way in which they present controversies and which teacher's role is best suited for teaching SSI. This paper aims to review the empirical studies that include teachers' stances during teaching SSI and, if stated, their rationales about preferred stances. We employed the Web of Science and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) databases and Google Scholar to find the relevant literature. Then, we independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the selected studies for eligibility. Based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement checklist, eighteen empirical studies were included in this review. Three main profiles of teachers' positions while addressing SSI were identified: excluders, neutrals, and disclosers. Two subprofiles were identified for both neutrals and disclosers. Neutral teaching was found to be the most adopted and preferred teacher position for introducing SSI. It was followed by the avoidance of SSI teaching because the teachers viewed value-free education as important. Teachers' own opinions, beliefs, epistemological orientations, concerns of indoctrination, and external factors were reported as the main underlying reasons for their preferred positions. Obviously, the studies conducted with in-service teachers yielded different reasoning patterns for their neutrality. We concluded that, given the pedagogical and epistemological challenges of teaching SSI, more research on teachers' positions in addressing SSI in science classrooms is needed.

AB  - Background: Despite the increasing square footage of green buildings worldwide, green building expertise remains largely in the domain of building industry professionals. However, the performance of and advocacy for green buildings would benefit from a green building literate general public. Green building education is an expanding frontier for STEM education and can create opportunities to integrate science and environmental literacies into the study of everyday environments. Few resources exist, however, to help STEM educators incorporate green building themes into the science classroom. The work here developed educational tools for connecting green buildings and science education through a multi-step process. An interdisciplinary literature review yielded a series of frameworks that were improved through two focus groups with science and environmental educators and built environment professionals. Results: The result of this process is a toolbox of conceptual frameworks for educators interested in using a systems-based approach to teach about green buildings as sites for complex interactions between human activity and Earth systems. The work here first leverages the broad definition of environmental literacy (knowledge, skills, affect, and behavior) to advance a working definition for "green building literacy." Next, major domains of green building knowledge are developed and linked to the Next Generation Science Standards. Conclusions: Green building literacy has been an ill-defined term and green building themes have not been rigorously connected to science and environmental education. The work here provides a foundation for promoting green building literacy through K-12 STEM education. The educational tools developed through this process can be used as a starting point for lesson planning to catalyze green building education in a variety of formal and informal settings.

AB  - Programming is an essential part of the curriculum of computer science non-major students. The motivation for the various elements of interdisciplinary degrees is often very low in computer science, which faces a gender gap as well. Differences between study courses and gender in confidence, attitude, student numbers, and motivation in computer science are investigated. In addition, the influences of attitude, perception, and social background are considered. A questionnaire was designed based on an extensive research model for the purpose of this research. A survey was conducted with two cohorts of computer science non-major freshmen from two degrees in an introductory programming class at a university of applied sciences. The outcomes are compared against each other. First, an explorative factor analysis was performed. Afterwards, SmartPLS was used to test the developed model. The overall motivation of the participants is moderate and mostly influenced by their ability and effort beliefs. These constructs are different for men and women, but not for the degree programs, and have different impacts on motivation. In general, motivation is influenced by ability and effort beliefs, which in turn are mostly affected by perception and social background. While women show lower ability and higher effort beliefs, the males in the samples have opposite outcomes and thus a higher motivation in introductory programming classes.

AB  - In 2012, the National Research Council and the American Chemical Society criticized many graduate education programs in the chemical sciences for not adequately preparing graduate students for the interdisciplinary careers that they will likely occupy. These and other reports anecdotally suggest that soft skills, broad versus specific knowledge, and interdisciplinary skills will make graduate students more competitive and better prepared for careers. However, relatively few efforts have been made to empirically evaluate and assess what specific knowledge and skills doctoral chemists require to be successful in their future careers. The qualitative study here expands on the previous anecdotal data by empirically identifying the knowledge and skills required for chemistry careers and compares those required in the academic and nonacademic sectors. A total of 31 U.S.-trained doctoral chemists from academia, industry, and government were interviewed about the activities they conduct on a day-to-day basis and the knowledge and skills required to successfully complete these activities. Twelve distinct, nonduplicative knowledge and skills that enable these chemists to successfully perform their jobs in different chemical sectors have been identified by thematic analysis of the interviews. Three inter-rater reliability (IRR) metrics were used to evaluate coding and demonstrate the trustworthiness of data. The results provide evidence that technical knowledge, communication, management, and several other skills are required for chemists in both academic and nonacademic job sectors, but these skills could be fundamentally different across sectors. The results of this study imply that different skill sets are required for diverse career pathways, and graduate programs should consider tailoring their programs for students accordingly.

AB  - We present herein a module of pigment synthesis experiments that could be adapted and implemented in a variety of curricular settings. At the conclusion of each of the past two spring terms at our high school, we offered a 4 day short course on the chemical synthesis of pigments used in art. As part of the course, our students synthesized four pigments in the chemistry laboratory: Egyptian blue, madder lake (red), cobalt green, and cobalt yellow. These particular pigments were selected for several reasons: (1) they are historically significant in art and archaeology (their usage spans from antiquity into the 20th century), (2) they provide for a variety in the chemical reaction types explored and the chemical synthesis methods utilized, (3) they are relatively safe for students to handle, and (4) they afford a diverse color palette upon mixing. Our students then combined their pigments with gum arabic as a binder to make gouache watercolor paints and create a painting. In the second iteration of the short course, students also collected gravimetric data during their pigment synthesis reactions and were introduced to photoluminescence imaging of paints made from Egyptian blue and madder lake pigments synthesized the prior year. We also explored the quantitative colorimetry of the paints "via" fiber-optic reflectance spectroscopy. On the basis of positive student feedback from our short course and on our research into similar curricular offerings at the college and university level, we are actively working to expand and broaden the material into a new, year-long, interdisciplinary elective course for our upper-level high school students that describes the application of chemistry and materials science principles to enhance our understanding and appreciation of art and archaeology.

AB  - For several years, science and art have been viewed as separate entities in school education in Nepal. The dominant discourse on science was regulated by Western Modern Worldview (WMW), assuming that seeking universal truth should be the central aim of the exploration. In this article, science refers to the absolutist/rigid nature of different disciplines (such as Science and Mathematics) from the perspectives of Newtonian science, whereas art is viewed from three dimensions; literary arts (i. e. narratives, storing), visual arts (i.e., images, painting, sculpture) and performing arts (i.e., role play, drama). This paper argues that science and arts, as ways of knowing, should be taken as complements of each other. This literature-based argumentative paper also incorporates the lead author's experiences using art as/for pedagogical approaches in collaboration with schoolteachers. At the same time, the authors also argue the role of critical reflection to acknowledge both science and art as epistemology. The authors have used Dewey's perspectives on the roles of art for experiencing in education. Also, the notion of Mezirow's Transformative Learning is helpful as an influential lens to showcase the ever-changing thoughts in the transformation continuum. To set the context for the argumentation, the authors discussed the existing Nepali school education system, focused on curricula and pedagogical perspectives. The paper is helpful for teachers, teacher educators, and researchers to critically reflect on their own beliefs and practices in terms of viewing the different perspectives on STEM subjects and the inseparable relationship of science and art for knowledge generation and pedagogical application.

AB  - This paper respects the emergent interest in the link between family and consumer sciences (FCS) and the STEM and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) movements. The nature of our involvement with these movements has an impact on future proofing the profession; therefore, two lines of inquiry are proposed. Should the profession (a) serve as a lynchpin that strengthens STEM and STEAM, making them successful or (b) position itself as a collaborative partner with STEAM initiatives, acting on its own merits. Backgrounders for these two lines of inquiry included discussing the controversy over--and benefits of--bringing the Arts to STEM as well as explaining integrative curriculum, interdisciplinarity, collaborative teamwork, and STEM, STEAM, and home economics literacy.

AB  - This paper analyzes the introduction of fundamental physics in design education as a pedagogical method that trains designers to create with the un-known. It studies how three workshops offered design students to work on: superconductivity in 2011, quantum physics in 2013 and light and optics in 2014. The authors observe that introducing physics in a design curriculum was thought in terms of an "a fortiori" education program that would help practitioners to come up with pertinent questions and responses even if they cannot comprehend all aspects of the problem. The authors looked at how the workshops were handled and suggest that the educational framework had five goals that correspond to a model of design: affective (how to cope with uncertainty), reflexive learning (how to cope with processes rather than contents), cognitive (how to cope with non knowledge), economic (how to cope with the industrial society of innovation), and political (how to cope with the equality of disciplines and "indiscipline").

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to present a collaborative action research project conducted at the University of Southampton with the aim to promote curriculum and professional development in education for sustainable development (ESD) and learn from everyday practices of academics. Design/methodology/approach: An action research approach guided by participatory and emancipatory approaches was used. An interdisciplinary group of five academic staff members from different subject areas (education; archaeology; electronics and computer sciences; biology; and health sciences) was created with the aim to support the group's critical reflection and action towards embedding ESD in their teaching practice. Findings: The main outcomes of delivery of sustainability teaching achieved through the project and evidences of the impact of the facilitator role are outlined. The facilitator role has enabled reflection and action, together with the identification of specific needs of academics and the factors influencing their engagement and action. Originality/value: This research demonstrates the potential of using action research to rethink current practice in embedding ESD and to lead to new practices and actions of communities of practice. The facilitator role and second-order action research can contribute to better decision-making of sustainability as it questions practice, current assumptions and worldviews.

AB  - This article, which presents an interdisciplinary research agenda grounded in a constructivist institutional approach, begins by unpacking relevant terms. It explains the new institutional approach in political science that simultaneously narrows the focus and broadens the scope of political research by encouraging a return to the "political" in political science while also opening political research to a variety of other disciplinary approaches. It then explores the ontological and epistemological assumptions underlying a constructivist approach. Such assumptions are an integral if often unacknowledged part of any research effort, interdisciplinary or not. The main part of the article then offers an interdisciplinary research agenda describing how political science, sociology, and history can provide an integrated constructivist guide to the study of political institutions. The article suggests employing a feld of consciousness approach to integrate the work of these three disciplines in order to situate interdisciplinary research on political institutions on the common ground of institutional standard operating procedures.

AB  - This paper deals with an empirical study examining the effectiveness of interdisciplinary teaching in biology and physical education (PE) regarding the students' growth in knowledge. The study was conducted with 141 German sixth form students. In groups, they were taught three hours a week for a period of six weeks. In order to compare the effectiveness of regular lessons with the project, the study uses a test and control group design. This means a test group takes part in interdisciplinary teaching (IdT) lessons while a control group of peers receives subject-related lessons. After being exposed to the different kinds of lessons for a certain time, we then compared the effects on the students' skills in a pre-/post-test. The IdT lessons are designed to complement each other so that the biology lesson supplies explanations for processes occurring in PE, whereas the PE lesson provides a visualisation of the theoretical biology content. In this paper, first the current German curricula requirements as they relate to interdisciplinary teaching will be outlined. After this, the state of research concerning interdisciplinary teaching, methodical-didactic expectations and learning targets will be provided. Following on from this, the data investigated in the course of the study will be presented, such as the study design and measuring instruments. The results of the pre-/post-test will be described and then discussed in the conclusion. They indicate a significant growth in knowledge with the test group (IdT) when compared with the control group (F(1, 113.24) = 126, p<0.01, n[superscript 2][subscript p] =0.43).

AB  - An interdisciplinary group of faculty members from Tufts University developed an undergraduate civic science course designed to help students better understand and interpret the broad, sociocultural impacts of science. The course teaches principles of civic science and was designed around four facets of learning. These facets lay groundwork for students to fully explore, through dialogue and writing, connections between science, personal values, and civic life. We present an overview of the course structure, challenges and goals, and student feedback from surveys and focus groups about the impact of the course. Students developed an appreciation that science is accessible, personal, relevant, and indispensable to their civic lives--especially those with interests in the humanities and social sciences. Students also learned a "working language" of a science issue and an understanding of the personal relevance of an issue in ways that informed their personal and professional lives. The approach frames science learning around real-world issues of personal relevance that challenge students to find personal and civic solutions to society's most daunting problems that exist at the nexus of science, technology, and society.

AB  - In these Anthropocene times humans are vulnerable through the effects of socio-ecological crises and are responsible for attending to past, present and future socio-ecological injustices and challenges. The purpose of this article is to challenge discursive structures that infuence knowledge acquisition "about/of" the world through binary logics, acknowledging that we are never apart from the world we are seeking to understand, but that we are entangled through a mutual (re)confguring "with" the world. Through storytelling and entangled poetry from outdoor education and environmental science education contexts, this article explores discursive/material forces (socially meaningful statements/affective intensities) enacted through pedagogies 'attuning-with'. As pedagogies 'attuning-with' take up a relational ontology, in which sense-making is generated from the grounded, lived, embodied and embedded politics of location in relationship with broader ecologies of the world, they illuminate a transdisciplinary environmental education. A transdisciplinary environmental education is important for these Anthropocene times, because it not only promotes a multivocal approach to environmental education, but in acknowledging our inherent and intrinsic responsibility and accountability for the kinds of worlds that we are co-constituting, it provides opportunities to change the story of how we choose to live with/in/for these Anthropocene times.

AB  - How can we engage new engineering and computer science graduate students in meaningful conversations about research and publication ethics without establishing a common understanding of the issues and expectations? Most universities offer extensive responsible conduct of research (RCR) training programs, which are usually a semester-long. Absent a requirement, it is unlikely that engineering and computer graduate students and their advisors would prioritize a lengthy training during the student's first semester. Recognizing this, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas' Howard R. Hughes College of Engineering designed and implemented an introductory research ethics workshop for all graduate students entering engineering and computer science. We engaged an interdisciplinary team of faculty and staff in the workshop's design and implementation, and approached our design within the sensemaking framework for ethical decision-making. Each workshop included lecture content in four priority topic areas identified by the college faculty: research design and data ethics, publication ethics, computer coding ethics, and intellectual property. The workshops also included a face-to-face panel discussion with experts including engineering, computer science, and law professors; librarians; and technical writers. Our assessment showed that after completing the workshop, students demonstrated increased content knowledge, and their self-assessed expertise ratings were better aligned with their content knowledge.

AB  - Psychology has made, and continues to make, a significant contribution to the discipline area of education. Since one of the main aims of education concerns student learning -- which is an indisputably psychological phenomenon -- we argue that the emerging research agenda of embodied cognition has much to offer educational practitioners, researchers, and/or policy-makers. Although embodied cognition is still in its infancy, the multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary nature of the literature provides some thought-provoking recommendations to enhance educational practice or practices, which in turn can bring about student learning more effectively. Consequently, this article will be concerned with the discussion of two issues: first, we provide a brief historical overview that foregrounds embodied cognition, and, second, we outline the educational implications of embodied cognition through the use of some examples significant to education. We conclude with an argument for the importance of making findings in an area we call 'embodied education' available to teachers.

AB  - While a renewed national dialog promotes the importance of science education for future technological and economic viability, students must find science personally relevant to themselves and their communities if the goals set forth in recent reform movements are to be achieved. In this paper, we investigate how incorporating an ecological perspective to learning in teacher education, including opportunities to participate with science in connection to their everyday lives, influenced the ways in which elementary teacher candidates (TCs) envisioned learning and doing science and its potential role in their future classroom. We draw from data collected across three sections of a field-based elementary methods course focused on learning to teach science and social studies through inquiry. We argue that participating in an authentic interdisciplinary inquiry project impacted the ways in which TCs conceived of science, their identities as science learners and teachers and their commitments to bringing inquiry-based science instruction to their future classrooms. This paper addresses issues regarding access to quality science learning experiences in elementary classrooms through empowering TCs to build identities as science learners and teachers in order to impact conditions in their future classrooms.

AB  - The insufficiency of teachers who teach integrative science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses is a major challenge facing science education today. Many teachers lack adequate expertise to combine disciplines and choose effective instructional approaches. This study examines how and to what extent teachers might succeed in teaching an innovative STEM program about a sound, waves and communication systems course in an information and communication technology-based environment. This research adopted a qualitative method to understand better the experience of three teachers who taught the course for the first time. Data collection tools included documenting mentoring meetings, observing in the classrooms and interviewing the teachers. The data were transcribed and analyzed using the content analysis method. The findings show that the teachers had only partial knowledge and, initially, even misconceptions about sound. However, their technological pedagogic content knowledge improved significantly due to the researcher's gradual but continual guidance. Four major factors contributed to the teachers' professional development: (a) dealing with innovative contents, (b) using different (advanced) teaching methods, (c) predesigning the instructional course materials and (d) offering the researcher-mentor's developmental supervision.

AB  - Within the field of developmental science, there is a general agreement of the need to work together across academic disciplinary boundaries in order to advance the understandings of how to optimize child development and learning. However, experience also shows that such collaborations may be challenging. This paper reports on the experiences of bidirectional collaboration between researchers in a multidisciplinary research team and between researchers and stakeholders, in the first randomized controlled trial in Swedish preschool. The objective of the trial was to investigate the effects of two pedagogical learning strategies evaluating language, communication, attention, executive functions and early math. The interdisciplinary team includes researchers from early childhood education, linguistics, developmental psychology and cognitive neuro science. Educational researchers and theorists within the field of early childhood education in Sweden have during the last two decades mainly undertaken small-scale qualitative praxis-oriented and participative research. There is a widespread skepticism with regards to some of the core principles in controlled intervention methodologies, including a strong resistance towards individual testing of children. Consequently unanticipated disagreements and conflicts arose within the research team, as RCT methodology requires the measurement of effects pre and post the intervention. The aim of this article is to discuss the conditions for bidirectional collaboration both between researchers and stakeholders and between researchers in the research team. The findings illustrate strategies and negotiations that emerged in order to address ontological and epistemological controversies and disagreements. These include (a) the negotiation of research ethics, (b) making divergences visible and learning from each other, (c) using a multi-epistemological and methodological approach as a complement to the RCT design and (d) the negotiation of research problems that are shared between educators and researchers.

AB  - The primary purpose of conducting two interprofessional education (IPE) experiences during a multidisciplinary physiology graduate-level course was to provide basic science, physical therapy, and physician assistant graduate students opportunities to work as a team in the diagnosis, treatment, and collaborative care when presented with a patient case focused on acute kidney injury (first case) and female athlete triad (second case). The secondary purpose was to apply basic physiology principles to patient case presentations of pathophysiology. The overall purpose was to assess the longitudinal effects and the value of IPE integrated within a basic science course. The following Interprofessional Education Collaborative subcompetencies were targeted: roles/responsibilities (RR1, RR4). Students were given a pre- and postsurvey to assess their IPE perceptions and knowledge of professional roles. There were statistically significant increases from the presurvey renal IPE experience to the presurvey endocrine IPE experience for two perception questions regarding the ability to explain the roles and responsibilities of a physical therapist (PT) and physician assistant using a Likert scale. In addition, student knowledge of the role of a PT increased significantly when comparing the renal IPE presurvey to the endocrine IPE presurvey results to open-ended questions. Students' perceptions of their knowledge as well as their ability to express, in writing, their newly learned knowledge of the role of a PT was sustained over time. Incorporating multiple IPE experiences into multidisciplinary health science courses represents an appropriate venue to have students learn and apply interprofessional competencies.

AB  - What do different research methods and approaches "do" in practice? The article seeks to discuss this point by drawing upon socio-material research approaches and empirical examples taken from the early stages of an extensive case study on an interdisciplinary project between two multidisciplinary fields of study, education and computer sciences. The article examines how divergent disciplinary hinterlands influence the enactments of research methods, and how the choice of research approach affects the types of knowledge and realities produced in the research process.

AB  - This study focuses on post-induction mentoring as a vehicle for science teachers' training in implementing a nanotechnology teaching-learning sequence. Five mentors and 15 mentee-teachers participated in a 9-months long mentoring programme. Qualitative methods of analysis were used to examine the content of the mentoring conversations and the employed mentoring practices. Our findings indicate that the focus of the mentoring conversations was mainly set on the necessary strategies for teaching nanotechnology and secondarily on the resolution of organisational issues that arose. As regards the mentoring activities, mentors tended to address the arisen issues by giving advice, sharing their knowledge and teaching materials and by modelling the conduct of the lessons. The paper highlights the contribution of mentoring to the professional growth of post-induction teachers mainly in terms of broadening their teaching repertoire on nanotechnology issues.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is increasingly acknowledged as an essential skill to solve problems interdisciplinary. This paper describes the development and validation of the unplugged activity of CT in science (ACTS) module, which is specifically designed to integrate CT. The present study was conducted in five phases: Phase I was composed of needs analysis to elicit respondents' opinions regarding the knowledge of CT and appropriate topic to integrate CT within the year 5 science curriculum. Phase II was the development of the unplugged ACTS module, Phase III was content and face validation of the module, Phase IV was the implementation and Phase V was the evaluation of the effectiveness of the module. The needs assessment indicated that students have never known about CT. The module covered the "Matter" topic for year 5. A content validity index (CVI) was used to quantitatively assess content validity, finding a CVI of more than 0.79 as appropriate. The module was found to have a high mean of validity for content value (CVI=0.83). Expert members have made suggestions that will then be used to develop the module as required. This study concluded that the module has strong validity of the content and can be used to improve CT and science content knowledge among children in primary school.

AB  - This paper describes the 20-year evolution of an information studies program from one primarily focused on librarianship, to one that now encompasses a range of interdisciplinary topics including knowledge management, user-experience design, data science, and bioinformatics, among others. The program revisions, course development, and faculty renewal were guided by the School's strategic plan to centre its teaching and research on the focus of the interaction between people and information, supported by technology. Over twenty years, the proportion of interdisciplinary courses increased from less than 10% to almost half. There were a number of challenges throughout the process, including finding the right balance within the program, maintaining accreditation, and working with limited resources. Yet, the outcomes have been well worth the effort, and we suggest best practices based on our lessons learned.

AB  - Multiple reports highlight the increasingly quantitative nature of biological research and the need to innovate means to ensure that students acquire quantitative skills. We present a tool to support such innovation. The Biological Science Quantitative Reasoning Exam (BioSQuaRE) is an assessment instrument designed to measure the quantitative skills of undergraduate students within a biological context. The instrument was developed by an interdisciplinary team of educators and aligns with skills included in national reports such as "BIO2010, Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians," and "Vision and Change." Undergraduate biology educators also confirmed the importance of items included in the instrument. The current version of the BioSQuaRE was developed through an iterative process using data from students at 12 postsecondary institutions. A psychometric analysis of these data provides multiple lines of evidence for the validity of inferences made using the instrument. Our results suggest that the BioSQuaRE will prove useful to faculty and departments interested in helping students acquire the quantitative competencies they need to successfully pursue biology, and useful to biology students by communicating the importance of quantitative skills. We invite educators to use the BioSQuaRE at their own institutions.
