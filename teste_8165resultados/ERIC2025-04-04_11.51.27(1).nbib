AB  - This article examines how discussions around the new interdisciplinary research area combining neuroscience and education have brought into sharp relief differences in the philosophies of learning in these two areas. It considers the difficulties faced by those working at the interface between these two areas and, in particular, it focuses on the challenge of avoiding "non-sense" when attempting to include the brain in educational argument. The paper relates common transgressions in sense-making with dualist and monist notions of the mind-brain relationship. It then extends a brain-mind-behaviour model from cognitive neuroscience to include a greater emphasis on social interaction and construction. This creates a tool for examining the potentially complex interrelationships between the different learning philosophies in this emerging new field.

AB  - Past studies have shown positive correlations between the arts and academic achievement when the arts were integrated into the literature curriculum. Other studies have shown positive associations between the arts and other areas of the curriculum, such as mathematics and science. Considering the Theory of Change, which employs understandings in Critical Literacy, Multimodal Literacy, and Transmediation, this study employed a multi-stage cluster randomized design and conducted a series of comparison and treatment group statistical analyses among predominantly low income students in an urban school district, some of whom had participated in the Integrating Theater Arts Project (ITAP). The study assessed whether a relationship existed between the presence of a theater arts intervention and student achievement in language arts and mathematics. Results showed that students receiving intervention often outperformed their control group counterparts in both math and language arts. Furthermore, students in the theater arts program outperformed their control group counterparts in every case that showed statistical significance. These cases included math achievement among sixth grade students, both language arts and math achievement of sixth grade males, and math achievement of sixth grade Hispanics. The authors conclude that programs like ITAP and methods relative to the Theory of Change may in fact promote academic achievement among participating students. They also invite future studies to consider how achievement of other academic subjects--in this case, mathematics--may also relate to such interventions.

AB  - South African higher education institutions are increasingly under scrutiny to produce knowledge that is more relevant to South Africa's social and economic needs, more representative of the diversity of its knowledge producers, and more inclusive of the variety of the sites where knowledge is produced. Only a small percentage of South Africans are graduates of universities or technology institutes, and these graduates are not representative of the diversity of the South African population. As a result there is a shortage of skills to address the country's reconstruction and developmental needs. This places a burden on higher education institutions to expand access to their programmes, and to ensure that their programmes are relevant to the developmental context. Policy makers have found in the Gibbons [Gibbons, M., et al. (1994). "The New Production of Knowledge. The Dynamics of Science and Research in Contemporary Societies". London Sage Publishers] thesis on "Mode 2 knowledge production" a rationale for the transformation of higher education through the inclusion of practices which are less abstract, less discipline bound and closer to those processes which characterise the diversity and distribution of knowledge production in the wider society. Nowotny et al. [Nowtony et al. (2001). "Re-thinking Science. Knowledge and the Public in an Age of Uncertainty". Cambridge: Polity Press.] have taken Gibbons' thesis further and have described society itself as becoming increasingly "Mode 2". In a Mode 2 society, differentiation is replaced with integration, and networks of knowledge producers conduct their work in transdisciplinary teams across widely distributed sites. Such "transgressivity" both pushes knowledge production systems forward and distributes and diffuses knowledge more widely throughout society. In this paper, it is argued that there is a need for higher education practitioners to engage critically--and constructively--with the knowledge bases of policy directives to ensure that the new teaching and learning processes and systems adequately prepare students for the complexity and diversity of South African society, and enable them to contribute meaningfully to its reconstruction and development.

AB  - Constructed a longitudinal database to examine how basic science departments have been reorganized at U.S. medical schools. Found that there were fewer basic science departments in the traditional disciplines of anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, and physiology in 1999 than in 1980. But as biomedical science has developed in an interdisciplinary manner, new basic science departments have been added. The most frequent type of change was the renaming of existing departments. (EV)

AB  - This paper describes how a second grade science unit on penguins became the ideal content to integrate with the physical education curriculum. The movement experiences reinforced the information students learned about penguins and helped students to gain a deeper understanding of penguin behaviors. Together, the physical education teacher and the classroom teacher collaborated on what content about penguins could be physically experienced by the students while also increasing their motor skills, strength, and flexibility. The activities also required students to apply their knowledge of the different types of penguins, the predators, and penguin habitats through participating in problem solving tasks and by using teamwork. This interdisciplinary lesson is a great way to integrate movement and science concepts and provide an exciting kinesthetic learning experience for students.

AB  - There are two main claims in this article. First, that the classic pillars of engineering education, namely, traditional mathematics and differential equations, are merely a particular, if not old-fashioned, representation of a broader mathematical vision, which spans from Turing machine programming and symbolic productions sets to sub-symbolic orderings such as artificial neural nets. Second, that the paradigm of equivalence ought to be extended to those non-traditional engineering disciplines that require at least the same dedication, such as music and its science, musicology, because they broaden the search and identification of structures, one of the most important tasks of creative engineering. Furthermore, an example of contemporary advanced technology will be given that favours these very claims. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - The medical curriculum is vast, and students are expected to learn many subjects at the same time. Medical students are often stressed and find it difficult to cope with the curriculum. In addition, some first-year students find theory and practical classes to be monotonous. One of the difficulties faced by faculty members is, therefore, to maintain student interest in preclinical subjects, including physiology. In recent times, there has been a greater emphasis in medical curricula on aspects such as peer teaching, including working with interdisciplinary teams, on using evidence-based practice, on the integration of clinical medicine at the start of their course, and on the use of biomedical informatics. In their personal experience, the authors have noticed that student motivation to learn and reciprocate is increased to a greater extent when they have interactive sessions or bedside clinical demonstrations on patients or visits to laboratories that deal with new techniques. With this background, the authors decided to engage students in a program that dealt with eminent physiologists and their contribution to physiology. At the end of the program, they hoped to achieve the following objectives: (1) to expose students to experimental physiology; (2) to help students gain knowledge about various physiologists; and (3) to expose students to biomedical informatics.

AB  - Historically, teacher education in special education has focused on identifying characteristics of various disabilities and promoting best practices for intervention and remediation. This article introduces a disability studies approach to teacher education in special education. Disability studies is an interdisciplinary area of study that utilizes the lenses from social sciences and humanities to view disability from personal, social, cultural, historical, critical, and literary perspectives. Pre-service teachers who took such a course were interviewed with regard to their views on disability and inclusion. The results suggest: (1) the importance of providing a disability studies approach to future teachers; and (2) ways in which disability studies in teacher education can continue to be developed.

AB  - Background: Globalization, technological advancement, environmental problems, etc. challenge organizations not just to consider cost-effectiveness, but also to develop new ideas in order to build competitive advantages. Hence, methods to deliberately enhance creativity and facilitate its processes of development must also play a central role in engineering education. However, so far the engineering education literature provides little attention to the important discussion of how to develop knowledge intensive ideas based on creativity methods and concepts. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to investigate how to design creative camps from which knowledge intensive ideas can unfold. Design/method/sample: A framework on integration of creativity and knowledge intensity is first developed, and then tested through the planning, execution and evaluation of a specialized creativity camp with focus on supply chain management. Detailed documentation of the learning processes of the participating 49 engineering and business students is developed through repeated interviews  during the process as well as a survey. Results: The research illustrates the process of development of ideas, and how the participants through interdisciplinary collaboration, cognitive flexibility and joint ownership develop highly innovative and knowledge-intensive ideas, with direct relevance for the four companies whose problems they address. Conclusions: The article demonstrates how the creativity camp methodology holds the potential of combining advanced academic knowledge and creativity, to produce knowledge intensive ideas, when the design is based on ideas of experiential learning as well as creativity principles. This makes the method a highly relevant learning approach for engineering students in the search for skills to both develop and implement innovative ideas. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)

AB  - We use the 2003 National Survey of College Graduates to provide the first estimates of the effect on earnings of having a double major. Overall, double majoring increases earnings by 2.3% relative to having a single major among college graduates without graduate degrees. Most of the gains from having a double major come from choosing fields across two different major categories. Graduates who combine an arts, humanities or social science major with a major in business, engineering, science or math have returns 7-50% higher than graduates with a single major in arts, humanities or social science. But such double major combinations have returns no higher than single majors in business, engineering, science or math. Majors combining business and science or math have returns more than 50% greater than the returns to having a single major in these fields. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - Wikipedia is a well-known online encyclopedia, whose content is contributed and edited by volunteers. Its use by students for their research is, to be polite, controversial. Is Wikipedia really evil, or is it a teaching opportunity in disguise, a representation of some deeper cultural change? We present first-hand accounts from two different disciplines, computer science and anthropology, to illustrate how experiences with Wikipedia may be crossdisciplinary. We use these to reflect upon the nature of Wikipedia and its role in teaching.

AB  - This article describes a collaborative effort that included a botany professor, an art teacher, and a science teacher, called,"Plants, Pots, and Paints." This interdisciplinary project was successful in connecting content across disciplines (science to art) and for motivating fourth-and fifth-grade students to create something beautiful both they and the entire community could enjoy. Bulbs were chosen for this project because they are perennial, they bloom during the school year, and they can be "forced" to bloom in containers with proper cold treatment. Following instructions supplied with the bulbs, during October and November fourth-grade students planted an outdoor garden (an area of the schoolyard tilled by the district's building and grounds department) with crocus, iris, and daffodil bulbs purchased from a local garden center. Students were very motivated by their plant/art studies--and learning was enhanced in both subjects  because of the integration. Having learned more about plants' form and function in science class, students applied that knowledge to their drawings. Also, after dissecting plants in science class, their drawings were more informed and detailed.

AB  - For the past 23 years, students at California State Polytechnic University at Pomona have benefited from its Interdisciplinary General Education Program (IGE)--a sequential, interdisciplinary general education program that culminates in a capstone course. IGE's history and structure support a strong culture of assessment. The program, founded in 1983 with an emphasis on measuring student learning outcomes, was designed to provide an integrated liberal arts experience to students attending a comprehensive public polytechnic university. To accomplish this, student cohorts complete an eight-quarter sequence of interdisciplinary classes that satisfy humanities and social sciences general education requirements. Interdisciplinary General Education Program (IGE) promotes deep, integrative learning as advocated by Ernest Boyer: "As students see how the content of one course relates to that of others, they begin to make connections, and in so doing gain not only a more integrated view of knowledge, but also a more authentic view of life". The curriculum and instructional approach encourage students to become what the American Association of Colleges and Universities' Greater Expectations report calls "intentional learners"--individuals who are empowered, informed, and responsible. The article describes how a departmental culture focused on assessment that enabled IGE faculty members to examine this capstone experience and make changes that have substantially improved student learning.

AB  - Michel Serres is a provocative and unorthodox thinker, very little known in the English-speaking world, although he is one of the best-known contemporary French philosophers. Serres' interdisciplinary writing constructs themes that can be traced across literature, philosophy, science, mythology and painting, borrowing ideas and approaches from them and transforming those into original and synthetic voices in the world of knowledge. By grounding the sciences into everyday life, Serres wants to eliminate the distance that is perceived to exist between the two. Serres' mode of thinking and writing is undoubtedly inventive and provocative and his project truly admirable, if one considers the recent debates over the "science wars". As Maria Assad (1999) points out, Serres "brought a radical twist to the controversy over the degree to which scientific discourse and literary and philosophical theories can coincide without weakening the persuasive force of their respective models" (pp. 1-2). What is this radical twist brought by Serres? Simply put, his aim is to bridge the sciences with literature and philosophy. Serres' "will to synthesis", as he described his philosophy, is particularly important for education, culture and science in the new century. In this essay, the author undertakes the task of examining some major themes that organise Serres' philosophy about science, philosophy, and literature and he explores the implications of his ideas for science and education. His main argument is to show that Serres can promote refreshing ideas that will provoke educators to rethink some of the views they take for granted. (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - Most preservice teachers complete their social science requirements in isolation from their social studies methods course. This paper reports the unique co-mingling of one interdisciplinary social science course (emphasizing geographic and environmental education) with the social studies methods for a cohort of undergraduate preservice teachers. Integrating parts of their curricula, instruction, assignments, and assessments through a co-mentoring process and action research project connected professors and preservice teachers with children and their environments. A review of the professors' process accompanied by a summary of preservice teachers' projects and reactions describes the classroom experiences and pedagogical outcomes experience by each group.

AB  - This article provides a review of research on African American children's literature by synthesizing the growing body of textual and reader response research conducted across the past several decades. The literature presented in this article cuts across the disciplines of education as well as English and library science. Using the selective tradition as a theoretical underpinning, the authors review extant literature through a three-pronged thematic heuristic developed as a result of their analysis. These themes present research findings related to African American children's literature as (1) contested terrain, (2) cultural artifact, and (3) literary art. The three themes generated to delineate the findings derived from a four-stage iterative process of analysis. By considering collective findings, a more careful and continued institutionalization of this literature can take place in schools, libraries, bookstores, popular media, and within families. The authors also address future implications for educational practice and research related to African American children's literature. (Contains 3 tables and 2 notes.)

AB  - Connections between science and mathematics seem natural. First, mathematics can be used in science to organize and analyze data in tables and graphs. Second, mathematics can help represent scientific phenomena and understand scientific concepts. Student learning should benefit when teachers make the connections between science and mathematics explicit, because science provides concrete examples of abstract mathematical ideas, and mathematics helps students achieve deep understanding of science concepts (McBride and Silverman 1991). This article discusses the importance and the effect of integrating science and mathematics on student learning. It also offers tips on how to integrate science and mathematics in the classroom.

AB  - The so-called Greek Financial Crisis, which has been the object of close attention in the German media since the end of 2009, has caused a public debate on who should be held responsible for the decline of crisis-hit Greece, the common currency and the Eurozone. The media's enduring and controversial public discussion has lately been referred to as the "Greek bashing." When the crisis had spread much further in 2012 and also other countries suffered from high debt, economic stagnation and unemployment, the news coverage became more moderate. This project report highlights the role of medial discourses of difference and solidarity during the crisis. Therefore, we rely on an exemplary data-set that does not only take the development of the German media's tenor on the "Greek Crisis" into consideration, but also adds an international perspective in order to compare the medial treatment of different countries involved. The study methodologically focuses on the analysis of (metaphorical) language and grammatical structures in the news coverage of the German daily newspaper "BILD," the German magazine "SPIEGEL" as well as the international news magazines "Economist" (Great Britain) and "TIME" (USA). Therefore, the interdisciplinary approach of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) was used in order to produce insights into public discourses in sociopolitical contexts.

AB  - Engineering graduates are expected to possess various competencies categorised into hard and soft skills. The hard skills are acquired through specific coursework, but the soft skills are often treated perfunctorily. Global Engineering Teams (GET) is a programme that promotes project-oriented tasks in virtual student teams working in collaboration with industry partners. Teamwork is a major success factor for GET as students always work in groups of varying sizes. A questionnaire-based survey of the 2008 cohort of GET students was conducted to assess teamwork, communication and conflict resolution among group members. The results confirmed that deliverables are readily achieved in teams and communication was open. A challenge of using virtual teams is the availability of high-speed Internet access. The GET programme shows that it is possible to deliver engineering design and manufacturing via industry/university collaboration. The programme also facilitates multidisciplinary teamwork at an international level. (Contains 2 tables and 7 figures.)

AB  - Faculty at Columbia University's Earth Semester created the interdisciplinary Riparian Area Management Project to help students integrate information and skills from life sciences, geosciences, social sciences, and humanities focused coursework. Structured as a "consulting" contract, students were required to make a policy recommendation utilizing diverse data and struggling with the complexity inherent in a real situation with no single "right" answer. While Earth Semester was a unique program, the Riparian Project is adaptable to any educational system. (Contains 1 figure, 1 table and 1 footnote.)

AB  - After accepting the editor's invitation to write a response to Richard Machalek and Michael W. Martin's "Evolution, Biology, and Society: A Conversation for the 21st-Century Sociology Classroom," the author took up their recommendation to learn more about recent work on biology and social behavior. She considered seriously Machalek and Martin's observation that it might not be simple "biophobia" that had resulted in her distaste for biological explanations but her ignorance of recent developments in the field. Thus began her quest to overcome her ignorance, to understand the five concepts Machalek and Martin cite as central to sociobiology: epigenesis, the interaction principle, the norm of reaction, prepared learning, and emergence. Machalek and Martin seemed to be arguing that armed with such knowledge, she would conclude that the four criticisms of biological approaches often leveled by bioilliterate sociologists are based on stereotypes that result in misrepresentations of the "logic and substance of evolutionary theory." In other words, as Machalek and Martin put it in an earlier article, the author would see that much criticism of sociobiology "appears to target a "straw man"." The author points out that Machalek and Martin do not give any indication that they agree with biological and evolutionary approaches that make these kinds of arguments. After all of her study of these perspectives, the author remains troubled by Machalek and Martin's implication that her skepticism is a product of ignorance, that it cannot possibly represent an informed critique.

AB  - When a marketer teaches general ethics courses, widespread ontological shock can result on campus. A case for positive paradigm expansion of all involved persons in an interdisciplinary environment is made. Suggestions for specific interdisciplinary opportunities and applications are provided. A call for interdisciplinary efforts is made and supported. Teaching outside your field is always chancy but when your terminal degree is marketing and the courses outside the area of expertise you are asked to teach are general distribution courses in ethics, cross-listed as Philosophy, it might be more than chancy, it may be ridiculous according to the received view. Reactions from colleagues in the business school may (and did) range from puzzlement to high hilarity particularly if one has been successful in business "in the real world" as was the case in this instance. Other colleagues seem to experience ontological shock as if they have suddenly found themselves in an alternate universe where "up" is "down." This report is about doing the academically strange thing of teaching across the curriculum and enjoying it. But wait, there's more, and even greater heresy! This will urge others in professional schools, sciences and other disciplines to consider the idea; and then do it, for all-around "wins" for all involved.

AB  - With the dramatic growth of environmental science as an elective in high schools over the last decade, educators have the opportunity to realistically consider the possibility of incorporating environmental science into the core high school curriculum. Environmental science has several characteristics that make it a candidate for the core curriculum. It is: (1) important for students and society; (2) an opportunity for students to experience an applied science; and (3) a particularly engaging context for learning fundamental science. In this paper, the author considers the possibility of a reform with the goal of achieving widespread adoption of environmental science as a required subject for high school by arguing for the value of environmental science, examining the rationale for the status quo, exploring what a high school core curriculum that includes environmental science might look like, and considering which of the elements that would be required to implement this reform are in place. The author concludes that many of the elements to support broad adoption of this reform are in place, but several are not, so additional groundwork would need to be laid before a large-scale reform effort targeted at integrating environmental science into the core high school curriculum could be successful.

AB  - Students' perceptions of engineering have been documented through studies involving interviews, surveys, and word associations that take a direct approach to asking students about various aspects of their understanding of engineering. Research on perceptions of engineering rarely focuses on how students would portray engineering to others. First-year engineering student teams proposed a museum exhibit, targeted to middle school students, to explore the question "What is engineering?" The proposals took the form of a poster. The overarching research question focuses on how these students would portray engineering to middle school students as seen through their museum exhibit proposals. A preliminary analysis was done on 357 posters to determine the overall engineering themes for the proposed museum exhibits. Forty of these posters were selected and, using open coding, more thoroughly analyzed to learn what artifacts/objects, concepts, and skills student teams associate with engineering. These posters were also analyzed to determine if there were any differences by gender composition of the student teams. Building, designing, and teamwork are skills the first-year engineering students link to engineering. Regarding artifacts, students mentioned those related to transportation and structures most often. All-male teams were more likely to focus on the idea of space and to mention teamwork and designing as engineering skills; equal-gender teams were more likely to focus on the multidisciplinary aspect of engineering. This analysis of student teams' proposals provides baseline data, positioning instructors to develop and assess instructional interventions that stretch students' self-exploration of engineering.

AB  - Environmental education promotes the use of higher-order thinking skills, encourages informal experiences in school as well as outdoors and brings together children and adults in order to make a contribution to the environment. Its holistic nature, that encompasses various subject matters, learning environments and teaching methods and encourages cognitive, affective and behavioural outcomes, requires the implementation of an appropriate assessment framework. In this study the author introduced a complex assessment method that encompasses pre, in- and after-course assessments and incorporates instruments that assess knowledge, reasoning, decision-making and the active involvement of 27 senior pre-service science and technology teachers who participated in an environmental education course. Findings indicate that the multiple assessment modes employed expressed a wide range of learning in the course. The team investigation project was found to be most suitable for developing environmental awareness, as well as inquiry skills. Self and peer assessment enhanced critical thinking and continuous discussion. The students acknowledged the complex assessment method as a possible model for an assessment framework which corresponds to the unique nature of learning in environmental education. The assessment framework introduced included aspects of environmental knowledge as well as awareness, skills, attitudes, values and practical involvement and addressed most of the courses basic ideas and components.

AB  - This study explored and documented students' responses to opportunities for collective knowledge building and collaboration in a problem-solving process within complex environmental challenges and pressing issues with various dimensions of knowledge and skills. Middle-school students ("n" =?16; age 14) and high-school students ("n"?=?16; age 17) from two Singapore public institutions participated in an environmental science field study to experience knowledge integration and a decision-making process. Students worked on six research topics to understand the characteristics of an organic farm and plan for building an ecological village. Students collected and analysed data from the field and shared their findings. Their field work and discussions were video-recorded, and their reflective notes and final reports were collected for data coding and interpretation. The results revealed that throughout the study, students experienced the needs and development of integrated knowledge, encountered the challenges of knowledge sharing and communication during their collaboration, and learned how to cope with the difficulties. Based on research findings, this study further discusses students' learning through a collaborative problem-solving process, including the interdependence of knowledge and the development of mutual relationships such as respect and care for others' knowledge and learning.

AB  - Three views of literature as a bond between science and English are presented. First, the view that the sciences are contributing to the restructuring of literary forms is illustrated by quotations from Nigel Dennis, Northrop Frye, Stephen Spender, Ken Kesey, and Claude Mauriac. Second, historical precedence for viewing literature as rapprochement between English and science is drawn from observations of Kenneth Rothwell, Aristotle, Marjorie Nicholson, David Cornelius, and Edwin St. Vincent. Finally, a general trend toward interdisciplinary scholarship in all fields is presently taking place. Key scientific concepts are frequently related to literary examples. (RL)

AB  - C.P. Snow calls for communication between the "two cultures" of arts and humanities and science and mathematics so that, globally, humanity can survive and prosper. This paper suggests that when individuals begin to identify with both "cultures," they will be less tolerant of such polarity within education and society and will begin to foster and even expect a mending of this fractured societal persona. My thesis comes from the results of a questionnaire answered by 55 of my students--members of the "science and mathematics culture," for they attend a science, engineering, and technology research institution. The results of this survey strongly suggest that teaching non-dualism, non-oppositional or complementary dualism--meaning differences that work together for a whole, such as illustrated by the yin yang symbol--is validating for many students. Survey results also show that most students feel that the scientific and artistic aspects within their personalities are balanced or close to balanced; many answers suggest that students are seeking a resolution of this breach in their education and in society. Some surprising results emerged from the survey, such as revealing that an almost equal number of students considered themselves "predominantly artistic" as do those who consider themselves "predominantly scientific." Results also articulate further redefinition is needed in each of the "two cultures" for their equal validity in society. Specifically, most likely from educational and societal training that begins when young, students do not recognize the transformative value of the socio-political impact of art and do not understand that artists are often technicians of social change.

AB  - Abortion is a highly-charged, emotional topic which often appears in the news, particularly during the confirmation process for a Supreme Court nominee. Community College students continue to ask reference librarians for print resources dealing with this controversial issue. Often we turn to the reliable series "Current Controversies," "At Issue," or "Opposing Viewpoints" (all published by Greenhaven Press). Librarians should keep these valuable texts in mind, but also realize that a wealth of information also resides on the reference shelves. This article looks at reference resources from a variety of disciplines (Religion and Philosophy, History, Sociology, Political Science, and Medicine) and examines how they treat the topic of abortion.

AB  - The increasing complexity of the new breed of distributed intelligent systems, such as the Internet of Things, which require a diversity of languages and protocols, can only be tamed with design and programming best practices. Interest is also growing for including the human factor, as advocated by the "ambient intelligence" (AmI) research field, whose focus is on transparently and intelligently supporting people. These new design methodologies are increasingly needed in the toolbox of new electronic and computer engineers, and teaching strategies should be devised that allow students to acquire a systems-level view instead of getting lost in technology-oriented approaches. This paper describes a study carried out over two academic years, in a course in AmI at Politecnico di Torino, Italy. In the course, a project-based learning approach was adopted, in which students design and prototype an AmI system, and their progress is closely monitored throughout the semester. This paper presents the learning goals and teaching strategies, analyzes the learning outcomes from the qualitative and quantitative points of view, and highlights the lessons learned in the process.

The activities developed can be used in combination for a very wide range of audiences in both age and stage of education, as has been demonstrated with great success. Moreover, the project has developed cross-disciplinary activities designed to engage nonscientific audiences and has used entirely "nonscientific" venues, such as art galleries. The suite of activities, given the umbrella title "Chips for Everyone", includes: (1) "Chips for Everyone": drop-in activities for fairs, shows, shopping centers; (2) "Chips with Relish": interactive workshops for groups of school pupils; and (3) "Chips with Flair": an arts-science collaboration in music, art, video, and engineering to present a new perspective on semiconductor technology. To achieve this diverse mix of outreach activities, the Chips for Everyone team represents a very broad spectrum of skills, its members being engineering academics, musicians, artists, education academics, public engagement specialists, and student teachers in technology. The development process is quite generic and could be applied in other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) areas. The subject focus of the project is semiconductor technology, a technology that influences the daily lives of everyone and yet is largely invisible. The activities seek to engage, engender interest, and promote informed discussion about this technology and engineering in general. From modest beginnings as a filler during the setting up of another outreach program, Chips for Everyone has developed into a major program reaching over 25 000 young people and families in school workshops, shopping centers, and art exhibitions in Scotland and across the U.K. The development method for the activities is innovative and creative, using the complimentary skills of research academics and students in both electronic engineering and technology initial-teacher education (ITE).

AB  - This paper describes a series of laboratory exercises for upper level biology courses, independent research and/or honors programs. Students sampled fish from a local water body with the assistance of a local fish and wildlife agency. Tissue samples from collected fish were utilized to obtain estimates of the stable isotopes delta[superscript 13]C and delta[superscript 15]N. An open-source mass balance model was utilized to estimate fish diets from isotope values. Isotopes were also used to measure trophic position (TP) and evaluate dietary niche overlap between native and introduced species. It was found that delta[superscript 15]N concentrations increased with each trophic level starting with benthic algae (lowest) to omnivores, then primary carnivores and ultimately piscivores (highest). Estimates of delta[superscript 13]C suggested all collected taxa utilized littoral habitats for feeding purposes. Native chain pickerel ("Esox niger") had the highest delta[superscript 15]N and TP estimates at 14.4 and 4.11, respectively. Nonnative largemouth bass ("Micropterus salmoides") delta[superscript 15]N and TP estimates were 13.56 and 3.86, respectively. Model estimates suggested that chain pickerel and largemouth bass diets were partitioned: pickerel consumed only fish and bass consumed principally invertebrates with some intermittent fish contributions. This lab helped integrate multiple disciplines, provide practical experience, and encourage critical-thinking skills while educating students about trophic ecology. (Contains 4 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - Latent variable structural equation modeling has become the analytic method of choice in many domains of research in psychology and allied social sciences. One important aspect of a latent variable model concerns the relations hypothesized to hold between latent variables and their indicators. The most common specification of structural equation models includes latent variables with effect indicators, such that a given latent variable is presumed to influence each of its indicators; that is, a change in the level of the latent variable should occasion a change in each of its indicators. For example, if an individual's level of numerical facility increased across time, the expectation under the model is that each of the indicators of numerical facility would exhibit a corresponding increase. Bainter and Bollen (this issue) focused on a different category of latent variable, comprising latent variables that have causal indicators. Under this approach, the manifest variables "cause" the latent variable, so that the latent variable represents an emergent variable that arises due to the effects of its indicators. Although several of the arguments by Bainter and Bollen may be of interest, the ultimate utility of latent variables with causal indicators remains in question. In this commentary, Keith Widaman states that he agrees with Bainter and Bollen (this issue) on one central point: Certain manifest variable indicators can reasonably be considered effect indicators of their latent variables, and other manifest variables should not be specified in such a fashion. However, Widaman differs with Bainter and Bollen on what should be done with the latter class of indicators. Widaman asserts that Bainter and Bollen presented one view on the utility of causal indicator latent variables. Despite the clarity with which their position was presented, much remains to be understood before causal indicators are a solid basis for replicable scientific endeavors.

AB  - Leadership development, diversity, and collaboration are hallmarks of collaborative learning. The creation of learning communities requires everyone involved--students, faculty, and administration--to change how they think about teaching and learning. Everyone must value and work in an interdisciplinary manner and communicate effectively for these communities to be successful. Collaboration and teamwork paired with hard work and persistence lead to an extraordinary and unique learning opportunity for students and faculty. This article showcases a unique program for integrating courses from different university departments to enhance learning. FCS instructors and students are participating in the learning communities.

AB  - Marketing as a scientific discipline has a very long practice but relatively brief history, as opposed to Economics, crowned as the queen of social sciences in antiquity. Both disciplines share an interest in consumer behavior, on both micro and micro levels. However, taught at different schools and departments of universities, these disciplines developed own methodologies and research approaches, foregoing obvious synergies. This paper discusses several concepts and theories developed in one of the disciplines that ought to be taught in the other.

AB  - Integration of content in core disciplines is viewed as an important curricular component in promoting scientific literacy. This study characterized the current practices of a group of elementary teachers relative to their development of interdisciplinary links between science, mathematics, and literacy. A qualitative analysis of survey data showed that there were substantial differences in the use of a well-developed process for integrating instruction. Teachers also lacked a conceptual connection to integration, showed contradictions in the importance placed on hands-on experiences, used measurement as the primary interdisciplinary connection between mathematics and science, and did not use instructional strategies designed specifically for nonfiction/expository text. The findings underscore the need for professional development that assists teachers in changing their conceptual perspectives to integration while also building pedagogical knowledge related to integration of science, mathematics, and literacy.

AB  - One of the most direct approaches to addressing perceptions of a lack of disciplinary communication in higher education between the humanities/arts and the sciences, both social sciences and natural sciences, may be to encourage educators to construct pedagogies that extend beyond the traditional boundaries of their disciplines and that emphasize synthesis as both a methodology and an objective for student researchers. This essay models such a synthesis by drawing upon disciplines from within all three intellectual "cultures," as C.P. Snow referred to them, to examine the mystery of an unpublished work by English poet George Crabbe.

AB  - While some textbooks still teach students that there is one scientific process that must be rigidly followed, this stagnant portrayal of the process of science can lead students to think that science and scientists are quite boring. Through integrating visual art and microscopy, students learn about the creativity of scientists and begin to appreciate the role of intuition, creativity, and culture in the science field. This article presents the photomicrographic works of art of two marine scientists, Martina Doblin and Lisa Drake, from their microscopy work. It also discusses the things that science teachers should do in teaching integrated visual art and microscopy to their students and motivating them to learn more about their microworld. By sharing the photomicrographic images created by two research scientists, students experience a realistic portrayal of creative individuals who collect and interpret evidence, communicate findings, and collaborate with each other to create consensus. Teachers can reenergize their students' interest in studying the microworld while exposing them to the nature of science, the variety of ways science can be applied, and the diversity of scientists in the workplace.

AB  - This article argues that epistemological and theoretical issues surrounding time in relation to comparative and international education need further exploration in consideration of the new understandings of time that have emerged (or re-emerged) during the last century. By drawing on an interdisciplinary selection of ideas as well as various scholars' conceptualizations of time that range from antiquity to the present, the article suggests practical ways, supported by sociological and historical examples, to theorize time for application in comparative educational research. Appropriating a more nuanced understanding and abstraction of temporality is necessary and opens different time-worlds for comparison, resulting in knowledge informed and shaped by a time that transcends Newtonian linearity and discreteness. The article is written with the understanding that as technology continues to stimulate globalization and redraw the boundaries of space and time, the importance of reconsidering temporality in regard to educational research is clear.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this article is to describe the goals and structure of cross-cultural psychiatric training at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU). This training in core  knowledge, skills, and attitudes of cultural psychiatry over the past three decades has included medical students, residents, and fellows, along with allied mental health personnel. The curriculum includes both didactic sessions devoted to core topics in the field and varied clinical experiences in community settings and the Intercultural Psychiatric Program under the supervision of experienced academic faculty. Methods: The authors review the central elements of the training experiences and include a detailed description of the core clinical settings and experiences. Results: At the conclusion of their clinical experiences, trainees have specialized cross-cultural psychiatric knowledge and skills, including treatment of refugees and immigrants, sociocultural variables that influence the assessment and treatment of a wide range of psychiatric conditions, and comfort with cultural dynamics that influence both the doctor/patient relationship and collaboration with a wide range of mental health professionals. Conclusion: Because of rapid demographic changes in the U.S. population, providing cross-cultural training for students, residents, and fellows is an essential foundation for the education of the next generation of clinicians and health care leaders. OHSU has provided a long-term model for this training in a busy clinical and academic setting that places an emphasis on multidisciplinary and multicultural collaboration.

AB  - The article presents a brief historical account of the emergence of urban social sciences from 1900 to the 1930s in Chicago (centered at the University of Chicago) and assesses how these developments influenced contemporary social science research on urban social life. A major legacy of early Chicago social scientists is identified as interdisciplinary empiricism directed toward policies of reform. (DB)

AB  - One of the most important functions of a teacher is to help students make important connections between the subject matters they study. Too often, the different curricular subjects, such as social studies, language arts, math, and science, are presented to students in a vacuum. Accordingly, many students leave school without ever noticing the vital relationships among all areas of knowledge. Interdisciplinary planning is a great tool for confronting this challenge. There are well-known drawbacks to such planning, of course. These include the time it takes to plan across the curriculum, the need for faculty colleagues who are willing to cooperate, and the constant schedule interruptions for nonacademic activities such as pep rallies or assemblies. This article presents a lesson contributed by James A. Bryant, Jr., Assistant Professor at the University of New Orleans, which he did while team teaching 6th-grade social studies in North Carolina. With this lesson he had shown to his class how each subject was connected to the others.

AB  - Most educators have a love-hate relationship with field trips. On the one hand, field trips are a great way to get students out of the building, enhance learning, and have some fun. On the other hand, field trips are a lot of work and worry. Especially now, with the increased cost of transportation and the need for curricular ties, field trips must make the best possible use of time spent away from school. A photographic scavenger hunt as part of an interdisciplinary field trip provides curricular relevance, captures student interest, promotes critical-thinking, and capitalizes on the time spent outside the classroom.

AB  - Peer review of research programmes is changing. The problem is discussed through detailed study of a selection process to a call for collaborations in the energy sector for the European Institute of Innovation and Technology. The authors were involved in the application for a Knowledge Innovation Community. Through the analysis of the case the article discusses the role of researchers acting in their new role of reviewers in situations where a number of important decision-making dimensions are cut out from the formerly direct influence on the researcher's quality assessment. In connection with this discussion the article will provide input to a critical review of the use of quantified scaling developed to systematize a quality assessment on the top of the peer review-based assessments. In addition the article discusses the challenges to the peer review system in Mode 2 type science and in cross-disciplinary research collaborations. This is a contribution to the assessment of new roles of peer reviewers in large policy decision-making systems like research funding, and an input to further discussions.

AB  - Empirical psycho-aesthetics is approached in this two-part article from two directions. Part I, which appeared in the Winter 2012 issue of "JAE," addressed definitional and organizational issues, including the field's origins, its relation to "sister" disciplines (experimental philosophy, cognitive neuroscience of art, and neuroaesthetics), and its role in a number of current debates about the substantive, methodological, and science-practice problems of interest to these various disciplines--with philosophical aesthetics as a backdrop. On the other hand, the complementary part II of the article, in this issue, has an empirical emphasis. Five groups of research studies illustrate the topics discussed in part I and facilitate a constructive dialogue with philosophical aesthetics and neuroaesthetics. The work involves a variety of art domains and a broad range of psycho-aesthetic topics, methods, and techniques. The five groups of studies are (1) empirical tests of major claims made by aestheticians and artists; (2) using portraiture to obtain an empirical handle on the creative process; (3) the classical topic of the "golden section" as an exploratory ground for a variety of old and new psycho-aesthetic methods; (4) research on music-induced "thrills" (or "chills") using psycho-aesthetic and neuroimaging techniques; and (5) multifaceted research involving the concept of "aesthetic episode." (Contains 1 figure and 31 notes.) [For Part I, see EJ1002794.]

AB  - New career opportunities exist for family and consumer sciences (FCS)professionals as traditional formats for shopping service, and information transition to a virtual environment. The requisite competencies and skills necessary for effective online operations are identified. Interactions with industry personnel and supporting literature revealed six important concepts: e-merchandising strategies, consumer segmentation, design architecture, analytic aptitude, communication proficiency, and computer expertise. These competencies and related skills provided the framework for the development of an interdisciplinary undergraduate degree in e-merchandising. Recommendations for FCS program implementation are presented. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - In this short reflection on how research and policy can connect fruitfully, I briefly outline three key concepts that have arisen in my work on inter-professional collaboration in the caring professions: relational expertise, common knowledge and relational agency. I have argued that these concepts describe the work that is done at sites of intersecting practices to enable quick and meaningful collaboration on complex problems. I also, however, point to the dangers of omitting the intentions of citizens from these exchanges. Describing the research-policy interface as a site of intersecting practices, I draw on a recent study undertaken at a UK University to show how these concepts can explain successful relational engagements at the research-policy interface that benefit both research and policy and highlight the moral purposes of this kind of engagement in relation to environmental and sustainability education.

Now, instead of using educational software or spending lots of time on training, students are writing stories with word processors, illustrating science diagrams with paint utilities, creating interactive reports with hypermedia, and graphing data-using spreadsheets. Interdisciplinary teaming played a key role. (MLH)

AB  - As the authors stated early in their article (Machalek and Martin 2010), evolutionary ideas have been gaining traction in the work of a growing number of sociologists in recent years. Much of their thinking derives from work inspired by sociobiology. However, many sociologists are critical of and unreceptive to incorporating evolutionary biology in general and sociobiology in particular into sociological thought and research. Often (but not always), these criticisms are rooted in misconceptions about sociobiological reasoning. The authors identified a number of these misconceptions and five concepts which, when understood will help allay such misconceptions. This paper presents the authors' reply to Lucal's (2010) and Hanson's (2010) comments of their article.

AB  - The question of what students gain by engaging in socioscientific inquiry is addressed in two ways. First, relevant literature is surveyed to build the case that socioscientific issues (SSI) can serve as useful contexts for teaching and learning science content. Studies are reviewed which document student gains in discipline specific content knowledge as well as understandings of the nature of science. SSI are also positioned as vehicles for addressing citizenship education within science classrooms. Although the promotion of citizenship goals seems widely advocated, the specifics of how this may be accomplished remain underdeveloped. To address this issue, we introduce "socioscientific reasoning" as a construct which captures a suite of practices fundamental to the negotiation of SSI. In the second phase of the project, interviews with 24 middle school students from classes engaged in socioscientific inquiry serve as the basis for the development of an emergent rubric for socioscientific reasoning. Variation in practices demonstrated by this sample are explored and implications drawn for advancing socioscientific reasoning as an educationally meaningful and assessable construct.

AB  - Multimedia programs having a number of elements like Texts, spoken words, sound & music, graphics, animations and still pictures provide different stimuli in their presentations. Art is the field of education that provides a platform for rigorous investigation, representation, expression, and reflection of both scholastic content and the art form itself. The integration of art with other subjects of the school curriculum can open new pathways of learning for students. Vedic Mathematics is an approach to resolve the crisis in education especially in the field of mathematics. It is not simply a collection of new computational techniques; rather, it provides an entirely different approach to the mathematical computation based on pattern recognition. The present paper deals with the development of multimedia packages using techniques of art and Vedic aphorisms on some selected common topics of curriculum of UK and Indian elementary mathematics and the effectiveness of multimedia packages for the development of mathematical skills. The study was conducted using quasi experimental design for research in both countries. The quantitative analysis of data revealed that the multimedia packages developed by using techniques of art and Vedic Aphorisms have significantly improved the mathematical skills of UK elementary school students.

AB  - Increased attention to student engagement and active learning strategies have become particularly relevant in today's classroom environments. These approaches are also considered to be meaningful when teaching "net generation" students who have different styles and expectations. This study attempts to address these challenges through the development of an interdisciplinary, active learning experience that increases information technology literacy of business students through the use of Web 2.0 tools. The research questions under consideration are: Can information technology literacy skills be effectively developed in an interdisciplinary setting? How does the development of an experiential learning activity enhance student engagement and learning outcomes? A discussion of the active learning literature and the appropriateness of such strategies with net generation learners is provided. The study also details the implementation of this experience within the curriculum, and assesses the benefits and challenges related to enhanced student learning and engagement as well as literacy outcomes. Increased student engagement was noted in both instructor and student evaluations of the assignment. Furthermore, assignment design features such as opportunities for exploration, analysis and feedback contributed to the level of connectivity. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - This article describes an interdisciplinary unit of study on the inquiry process and experimental design that seamlessly integrates math, science, and reading using a rubber band cannon. This unit was conducted over an eight-day period in two sixth-grade classes (one math and one science with each class consisting of approximately 27 students and lasting 45 minutes). The authors begin by describing a series of interrelated curricular engagements that make up the unit. Throughout, they share samples of student work. Lastly, they describe some lessons learned and discuss both problems and pleasures of creating and implementing an interdisciplinary curriculum at the middle level. To get students started, the authors provided an overview of the interdisciplinary unit and displayed a rubber band cannon.

AB  - "Time to Act," a 2009 report of the Carnegie Corporation's Council on Advancing Adolescent Literacy, concludes that U.S. students are ill-prepared for the literacy challenges of 21st century higher education, employment, and citizenship. Word Generation (WG) is a research-based vocabulary program for middle school students designed to teach words through language arts, math, science, and social studies classes. The program consists of weekly units that introduce 5 high-utility target words through brief passages designed to spark active examination and discussion of contemporary issues. WG was designed with the understanding that promoting classroom discussion can result in particular kinds of academic benefits, such as improved word knowledge, reasoning, and expression. This paper presents new data from the first two years of the WG evaluation focusing on: (1) basic psychometric and descriptive information (including variance decomposition), by grade level, for measures of academic language and perspective taking as well as standardized assessments of student vocabulary and reading comprehension (e.g., Word Generation Academic Vocabulary Assessment and Global Integrated Scenario-based Assessments, GISA); relationships among these measures and the standardized assessments within and across time, and by grade level; and (2) results from impact analyses focusing on WG intent-to-treat effects on (a) standardized assessments of student vocabulary and reading comprehension, and (b) new measures of academic language and perspective taking after one and then two years for the first cohort of schools, and after one year for the second cohort of schools. Twenty four schools in total were randomized within the four districts, within pairs of schools matched on several characteristics such as enrollment, socio-demographics, and standardized test scores. The program was implemented and data were collected on all students in grades 4 through 7. Data were collected for three years (2011-2014) with the final wave of data collection completed in June 2014. For this paper the authors employ data collected in the first two years of the study focusing on 4th graders in cohort 1 in year 1, following those children into 5th grade in year 2 (with two data collection points, fall and spring, in each year), and on 4th and 5th graders in cohort 2 in year 2 (again with two data collection points, fall and spring). All students in the participating grades completed the following group-administered assessments: (1) WG Academic Vocabulary; (2) Global, Integrated Student Assessments (GISA); (3) Core Academic Language Skills Instrument (CALS-I); and (4) The Perspective Taking Survey (PTS). Preliminary data from the first year (cohort 1) of the WG evaluation indicate that, as expected, mean levels of the primary constructs of focus increase significantly over the course of one school year, and are significantly higher for older grades than for younger (e.g., 4th graders). In addition, the measures of academic language and perspective taking were correlated with standard assessments (e.g., with GISA, ~0.5-0.6), and the intercorrelations did not vary substantially by grade.

AB  - In the autumn of 2004, an interdisciplinary social science course entitled "Remembering, Forgetting and Forgiveness: Justice and Reconciliation from the National to the International" was offered to undergraduate students at the University of Tampere, Finland. The course had 49 students from 10 different countries on three continents. A large portion of the students were on international exchange through the European Community Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students (ERASMUS) programme. The objective of the course was to explore the role of social memory and justice in the process of reconciliation on many different levels. Learning activities aimed to initiate discussions on cross-cultural understandings of how to overcome violations and forgive or forget. Among the cases explored were child abuse, the massacres in Kosovo, the South African truth commissions and the Finnish civil war. A variety of teaching methods were utilised in the course. Cooperative learning methods were emphasised. Students engaged in group work activities and discussions and listened to a wide range of guest lecturers from diverse disciplines. The evaluation of students was based on individual learning portfolios constructed by students. This paper focuses on how a multicultural education was constructed through the pedagogy of the course, along with discussions with students who assessed their own learning process and perspectives. The theme of the course was judged by students to be very interesting and important, but the role of creative learning methods was viewed as equally significant. Exchange students, in particular, appeared willing to take greater risks in learning during their year abroad. The development of new approaches to learning could thus be an important element of internationalising efforts by universities. Finally, sensitive issues, such as contested collective social memory and complex reconciliation efforts, are best approached through cooperative learning methods that emphasise dialogue.

AB  - Objective: This article examines the positive and negative aspects of psychiatry encompassing sexual medicine within its purview. Methods: MEDLINE searches for the period between 1980 to the present were performed with the terms "psychiatry," "sexual medicine," and "sexual dysfunction." In addition, sexual medicine texts were reviewed for chapters relevant to this topic. Results: Psychiatry, the only medical discipline trained to integrate both biological and psychological factors in making treatment decisions, has been minimally involved in the evolution of the multidisciplinary field known as sexual medicine. Conclusion: If psychiatry is to maintain a role in the diagnosis and treatment of sexual disorders, it is critical that its training programs include training in sexual medicine.

AB  - The general public's responses to people with intellectual disabilities influence the likely success or failure of policies aimed at increasing their social inclusion. The present paper provides a review of general population based research into awareness, attitudes and beliefs regarding intellectual disability published in English between 1990 and mid-2011. An electronic search using PsycINFO and Web of Science plus a hand search of the literature was completed. Most of the 75 studies identified consisted of descriptive surveys of attitudes. They tend to conclude that age, educational attainment and prior contact with someone with an intellectual disability predict attitudes, while the effect of gender is inconsistent. Eight studies examined lay knowledge about intellectual disability and beliefs about its causation in a range of cultural contexts. The impact of interventions designed to improve attitudes or awareness was examined by 12 studies. The evidence is limited by the fact that it is mostly based on relatively small unrepresentative samples and cross-sectional designs. It is concluded that overall, high quality research into general population attitudes to intellectual disability is limited. Public knowledge of intellectual disability and causal beliefs are particularly under-researched areas. There is a notable absence of well designed evaluations of efforts to reduce misconceptions about intellectual disability and tackle negative attitudes. Areas for future research are noted, including the need for well designed studies that consider awareness, attitudes and beliefs in relation to stigma theory. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - The tongue of a tube-lipped nectar bat is 8.6 cm long and its body length is only 5.8 cm and its tongue has to be stored inside its ribcage because it is 150% longer than its whole body. Looking at the tube-lipped nectar bat alone, various areas of the mathematics curriculum can be covered, with multiple opportunities for investigations and using and applying mathematics, depending on what area of the curriculum is being covered. Another interesting science and mathematics based investigation could involve looking at the wandering albatross. It has the largest wingspan of any bird, with the largest recorded span being 3.63 m and on average adults have 3 m wingspan. These are just some examples of how animals can be linked to the mathematics curriculum to demonstrate some of the trickier concepts in mathematics through concrete, visual examples. They can also be great talking points to get children interested and engaged in the natural world. As these incredible feats of nature exist on Earth, educators can use them to show children how amazing the natural world is. (Contains 4 figures, 1 table, and 4 online resources.)

AB  - Purpose: To contribute for the ongoing discussion about associations between art education and citizenship education, presenting Augusto Boal's Theatre of the Oppressed, as a theatre method that exercises active democracy by means of promoting epistemological development merging Art, Citizenship and Education. Design: Drawing form a selected set of relevant concepts and data in the fields of psychology, education, arts and performance studies, amongst others, the advantages and limitations of the artistic practice of theatre are analyzed in terms of its impact in epistemological and socio-cognitive development. Findings: A literature review shows several studies that evidence the benefits of artistic practices, namely theatre, in several indicators. Despite these evidences formal educative contexts, rooted in traditional pedagogic paradigms, resist to the entrance of arts, such as the performative, in school curricula, as well as other interactive practices indispensable in the promotion of participative citizenship. Research implications: Present existing methods alternative to formal education, exemplified by the method of the theatre of the oppressed, that aim to develop art, education and citizenship in one same practice. Practical implications: Evidence the need to reconsider formal education curricula with the objective of enhancing epistemological development, empowerment, autonomy and active citizenship.

AB  - In the new ecohydrology major at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), students learn about the relationships between hydrologic mechanisms and ecological patterns and processes in watersheds and aquatic systems. The curriculum provides students with the option of meeting the requirements for federal positions as a hydrologist (GS 1315) and is designed to provide physical scientists with a strong secondary emphasis in ecology. This paper describes the development of this novel undergraduate degree in ecohydrology and some of the challenges involved in its development and implementation. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - In this article, the author presents a two-week evolution unit for his biology class. He uses Maria Sybilla Merian (1647-1717) as an example of an Enlightenment mind at work--in this case a woman recognized as one of the great artists and natural scientists of her time. Her representations of butterflies, caterpillars and their pupae, and the vegetation on which they are found are examples that show she was looking closely and intently at nature. Merian is a particularly good example of an Enlightenment individual because she not only rendered her subjects with great precision, she also included life cycle stages and food sources, linking insects and plants with ecological insight well over a century before the word "ecology" was first defined. The author uses Merian's work to inspire students to make careful drawings of anatomy, which raise questions that echo the evolutionary questions of the 19th century. Students learn that evolutionary science--whether based on old-fashioned natural history or modern ecology, genetics, and molecular biology--can be a profoundly rewarding aesthetic experience. A unit outline of this two-week interdisciplinary study of evolution is also included in this article. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - Numerous studies acknowledge that the well-being of our nation hinges on the health of its people. There is specific concern about children because they represent the future. Ignoring children's health needs can compromise their educational preparedness, occupational pursuits, productivity, and longevity. Current science demonstrates that developmental, emotional, or behavioral limitations experienced during the early years of life and over the life course are associated with poor adult health outcomes. Poverty, restricted access to health insurance and health care services, cultural and linguistic barriers, neighborhood conditions, and racial and class inequalities exacerbate poor health outcomes and contribute to child health inequality. To respond to the complexities and threats of child health inequality, social workers must be sensitized to the physical and material constraints that support them and join forces with other disciplines in comprehensive approaches to reduce and prevent them. This article focuses on current knowledge about child health inequality and recommends how social workers can effect change in this area through practice, policy, and research that adheres to the profession's ethical principles and standards and promotes the public health.

AB  - People make sense of the world by comparing and relating new information to their existing landmarks. Each individual may have different landmarks, developed through idiosyncratic experiences. Identifying specific events that constitute landmarks for a group of learners may help instructors in gauging students' prior knowledge and in planning instruction that helps students build additional landmarks events. This paper proposes an operationalized definition for collective landmarks based on importance, accuracy, and precision. Including precision in the definition allows landmarks to be characterized for a group rather than an individual. This study evaluated the ability of undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary course to estimate scales of time related to major cosmological, geological, and historical events. Individual students responded to replicate questions in different formats with the same answers, indicating the testing format was valid. The students' estimates were then used to determine collective landmarks. The number of collective landmarks increased between the pretest and posttest. Collective landmarks included extremely ancient events (Big Bang, formation of the solar system) or relatively recent ones (Cold War, the age of empires, emergence of nation states). Intermediate events had low accuracy, low precision, or both. These data indicate that lecture courses can teach students collective landmarks for time. Because landmarks can be learned, geoscience programs might consider coordinated planning of key landmarks to be introduced at different stages of their academic programs.

AB  - The need for a new literacy that will allow for meaningful participation in the rapidly evolving field of nanotechnology is very critical to national development. This need is important for nanotechnology to achieve its full potential. This paper describes and analyzes some contemporary philosophical interpretations of the concept of technological literacy. The paper then focuses on some of the metaphysical assumptions underpinning the techno-scientific literacy framework; and theories governing public understanding of science and technology, as the basis to propose a new technological literacy framework suitable in the era of nanotechnology. A case is made that the new technological literacy framework proposed is a suitable and essential pedagogic endeavour which should be seen as yielding a perspective through which meaning may be infused into the importance of nanotechnology development-a perspective as essential to the informed lay person as it is to the truly literate technologist. The paper concludes by analyzing the implications of the proposed epistemological framework on nanotechnology workforce development and makes recommendations based on this new framework to achieve a "nanoliterate" society.

AB  - The need for a borderless learning experience is apparent for many subjects, but is particularly important for the science major. We are living in an era when a strand of hair or piece of gum can identify a criminal, and the blueprint of our genes has been mapped out completely. Continuing to educate students merely in the "how to" of science technique--rather than the "what for" or "consequences of" the science--is not providing the whole picture. Instead of merely extending the content of each topic, science classes should incorporate any and all information needed to completely understand how each subject works in real-world terms. Support for the concept of an "integrated science" philosophy may be drawn from four main observations: (1) statistics show that most science graduates come from liberal arts institutions; (2) much of the subject matter of science is poorly understood without recourse to a discussion of social policy, economics, and cultural disparities; (3) the loss of many otherwise capable science majors may be linked to an inability to connect with the rigid practice of science; and (4) continuing to divide the curriculum sharply between science and non-science issues may help make students less civically minded in the long term. This article describes the inspiration behind the authors' teaching methods in upper-level science courses, and the strategies she has implemented to make her science courses borderless.

AB  - Incorporating nutrition topics in the primary school curricula should support the acquisition of nutrition knowledge in different ways and indirectly the development of healthy eating habits in children and teenagers. In Slovenia, nutrition education is part of all primary school education levels and may take the form of compulsory and/or elective school subjects. The main goal of the study was to find out the effectiveness of nutrition education of 6th graders where home economics is taught as a compulsory subject in nine-grade primary schools. The sample involved 630 pupils from 28 Slovenian primary schools. The nutrition knowledge was assessed by a knowledge test at the beginning and the end of the school year. The results show that the nutrition knowledge of students significantly improved. The students who scored lower on the test at the beginning of the school year made most improvement, and the students who scored best on the same test did not improve significantly. The results show that students' knowledge and understanding of the facts about energy and nutritive values of the foods is poor. Understanding a particular nutrient's role in human nutrition, or the energy value of the foods, requires certain abstract thinking ability, which the students, due to their cognitive developmental level, find difficult. Therefore, nutrition education should be adapted to the cognitive level of students and later, in the third triad of primary school, reinforced with interdisciplinary and constructivist approach.
