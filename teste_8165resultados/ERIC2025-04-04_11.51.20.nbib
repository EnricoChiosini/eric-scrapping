AB  - Wikipedia is a web-based, free-content encyclopedia that is openly editable and, thus, provides a unique platform for collaborations. Wikipedia projects are increasingly being integrated into upper-level courses across the country to explore advanced concepts, communicate science, and provide high-quality information to the public. Here we outline a project intended to reinforce and communicate concepts of risk assessment as it was implemented in a multidisciplinary graduate course and, based on observations from the instructors and results from a post-project reflection survey and exit-interview, we evaluated how to better enable student learning in future Wikipedia projects. A networked Wikipedia project was introduced to a graduate-level course in human and environmental safety as an alternative to traditional team projects. Students independently authored Wikipedia entries and then collaborated in editing the result prior to publication to the World Wide Web. Project outcomes indicated general success by the students in developing high quality content, but there is a need to improve the background and supporting materials provided to students to better enable their use of Wikipedia writing and editing tools. There was also opportunity to improve quality of the students' work product by emphasizing the major course concepts that should be applied in the project and by more clearly addressing common questions that relate to the Wikipedia "process." Student learning curves and computer literacy dictated the pace at which the project moved forward; so for the less computer literate students, effort tended to skew toward learning the tool rather than applying course concepts.

AB  - In this article, the author argues that it is more appropriate to teach citizenship through other subjects than to limit it to one statutory subject. The author's argument is based on three important issues. The first issue is that citizenship, being an aim of education rather than a means, deserves to be part of the whole curriculum. This is to say that citizenship is one of the most important purposes that education should serve, and thus this purpose of education should not just be limited to one way of achieving it, like an ordinary subject. The second argument is that citizenship should not be confined to the limits of one subject, as it is much more beneficial for the nature of the subject to be taught in collaboration with different subjects, such as history, English, science and geography. There are many different useful ways of teaching citizenship which would be at stake if it is limited to one particular subject. This leads to the third argument that citizenship should not be limited to a single subject as it involves many risks and problems that can be resolved through a cross-curricular thematic approach. It highlights issues such as the lack of resources, staff and training. The article concludes that there is a strong case for teaching citizenship through other subjects.

AB  - As a college biology instructor, I often see graphs in lab reports that do not meet my expectations. I also observe that many college students do not always adequately differentiate between good and poor (or misleading) graphs. The activity described in this paper is the result of my work with students to improve their graphing literacy. The process has benefited from my involvement in Summer Institutes and projects designed to help faculty integrate Mathematics Across the Curriculum (MAC), engage students in active learning in biology courses and develop student self-assessment strategies.

AB  - Situated in an elementary afterschool Engineering Literacies Club framed around multiliteracies and the engineering design process, this article explores engineering habits of mind and disciplinary literacies. Disciplinary literacies encourage students to read, write, think, and act like historians, mathematicians, scientists, or engineers by engaging in habits of mind. Drawing from the Royal Academy of Engineering's framework for engineering habits of mind (EHoM), this exploratory case study considers: What emergent EHoM do students demonstrate within the engineering design process (EDP)? What does this reveal about how EHoM can be used by teachers as a lens for teaching disciplinary literacies? Study findings demonstrated emergent EHoM are enacted synergistically and through multiple modes of communication (i.e. multimodality). EHoM were demonstrated by students in varying degrees reflecting the engineering design process and students' own proficiencies (or lack of proficiencies) regarding engineering. Enactment of EHoM was also influenced by teachers who scaffold learners' development of engineering literacies through problem scoping, problem-solving, collaboration, improving, and testing. The authors propose EHoM as a lens could provide an accessible way for teachers to integrate disciplinary literacies when teaching engineering with particular emphasis on how students can think and act like engineers.

AB  - Over the past 20 years, claims about how and why student writing can serve learning have changed markedly. This has been partly due to new technologies displacing writing as a predominant resource for learning, prompting new sense-making practices and shifts in how these changes are theorized. Learners now routinely collaborate to generate, manipulate, analyze, and share images in many subject areas, where multimodal and multimedia resources are expected to motivate learners, enact new learning processes and outcomes, and display this cross-modal learning. These new practices have prompted revisions to how writing is understood and used as a tool for learning in an increasingly multimodal, highly digitized world. In reviewing this literature, we claim that there are strong evidence-based reasons for viewing writing as a central but not sole resource for learning. Our case draws on both past and current research on writing as an epistemological tool. In presenting this case, we draw primarily on our professional background in science education research, acknowledging its distinctive take on the use of writing for learning. However, we think our general case also holds for other disciplinary areas.

AB  - The study of insects (entomology) can be used to stimulate students' interest in science and nature. It can develop students' understanding of fundamental science concepts, awareness of interdisciplinary connections, and mastery of science process skills. This teaching module provides opportunities for middle school students (Grades 5-8) to learn about insect communication. The unit includes a mix of collaborative, hands-on, and discussion activities informed by constructivism and shaped around the learning cycle and inquiry-based instruction. Assessment suggestions, extension options, and supplemental resources are also presented.

AB  - Advances in neuroscience have brought new insights to the development of cognitive functions. These data are of considerable interest to educators concerned with how students learn. This review documents some of the recent findings in neuroscience, which is richer in describing cognitive functions than affective aspects of learning. A brief overview is presented here of the techniques used to generate data from imaging and how these findings have the possibility to inform educators. There are implications for considering the impact of neuroscience at all levels of education--from the classroom teacher and practitioner to policy. This relatively new cross-disciplinary area of research implies a need for educators and scientists to engage with each other. What questions are emerging through such dialogues between educators and scientists are likely to shed light on, for example, reward, motivation, working memory, learning difficulties, bilingualism and child development. The sciences of learning are entering a new paradigm. (Contains 2 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - This study explores secondary history, literature, and science teachers' learning in cross-disciplinary professional development (PD) designed to support inquiry in disciplinary literacy instruction. As part of a larger design-based research project, teachers participated in a three-year Teacher Network designed to build knowledge and pedagogical practices for engaging students in high-level thinking and disciplinary argumentation. Sociocultural principles of PD served as the base for Teacher Network activities. We examine how teacher learning occurred within this context. Analysis of final teacher reflections revealed that teachers appropriated, transformed, and conventionalized disciplinary literacy practices when positioned as empowered agents of change through collaborative work.

AB  - For the last several years, the authors have implemented an integrated Mars Colony project for their third-grade classes. Students explored several considerations related to colonizing and inhabiting a new world, including food sources, types of citizens, transportation, and housing design. Nearly everything about the project was open-ended, full of student choice, authentic, and original. Making and launching model rockets was always a favorite part of the project. Building solid fuel rockets almost entirely from scratch was a valuable experience. However, despite a few artistic differences, students' designs were nearly identical and didn't fit the open-ended feel of the Mars project. They wanted to improve the rocketry project to better match their problem-based experience as well as find ways to better use equipment in their school's dedicated makerspace. This article describes how they developed an integrated set of lessons allowing students to design and make a specialized payload that would travel inside their rockets and return safely to solid ground. It became an authentic maker experience integrating science, math, literacy, and human-centered design principles over a period of several weeks.

AB  - There is, in Greece, an ongoing attempt to breach the boundaries established between the different teaching-learning subjects of compulsory education. In this context, we are interested in exploring to what degree the teaching and learning of ideas from the sciences' "internal life" (Hacking, in: Pickering (ed) "Science as practice and culture," 1992) benefits from creatively coming into contact with theatrical education as part of the corresponding curriculum subject. To this end, 57 students of the Early Childhood Education Department of the University of Athens were called to study extracts from Galileo's "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, Ptolemaic and Copernican," to focus on a subject that the "Dialogue's" "interlocutors" forcefully disagree about and to theatrically represent (using shadow theatre techniques) what they considered as being the central idea of this clash of opinions. The results indicate that this attempt leads to a satisfactory understanding of ideas relating to the content and methodology of the natural sciences. At the same time, theatrical education avails itself of the representation of scientific ideas and avoids the cliches and hackneyed techniques that the (often) simplistic choices available in the educational context of early childhood education tend towards. The basic reasons for both facets of this success are: (a) Genuine scientific texts force the students to approach them with seriousness, and all the more so if these recount the manner in which scientific ideas are produced and are embedded in the historical and social context of the age that created them; (b) The theatrical framework, which essentially guides the students' activities, allows (if not obliges) them to approach scientific issues creatively; in other words, it allows them to create something related to science and recognize it as "theirs"; and, (c) Both the narrative texts describing processes of "science making" (Bruner, "J Sci Educ Technol" 1:5-12, 1992) and theatrical expression constitute fields that are characterized by what, for the students, is a common and understandable manner of expression: the narrative.

AB  - Worldwide, science education reform movements are stressing the need to promote "scientific literacy" among young people. Increasingly, this is taken to include empowering students to engage critically with science-related news reporting. Despite this requirement now featuring in statutory curricula throughout the UK, there has, to date, been a dearth of research-informed advice to assist science teachers as they identify appropriate instructional objectives in this regard and design relevant learning activities through which these might be achieved. In this study, prominent science communication scholars, science journalists, science educators and media educators were interviewed to determine what knowledge, skills and habits of mind they judged valuable for individuals reading science-related news stories. Teachers of science and of English from nine secondary schools in Northern Ireland addressed the same issue. A striking--and significant--finding of the study was the very substantial number of statements of knowledge, skill and disposition offered by participants that relate to "media awareness", an issue largely overlooked in the science education literature. The school-focused phase of the research suggests that cross-curricular approaches involving teachers of science collaborating with those of English/media education or media studies may best serve to address this important curricular goal.

AB  - An authentic, challenging curriculum engaged middle school students from an urban district in exploratory work related to restoring a small prairie at the school. Integrated science-literacy-arts activities were coupled with a system of thinking skills that helped students view issues from different perspectives. Impassioned guest speakers and an enthusiastic teacher inspired students to build a relationship with the content, express their ideas creatively, interact with each other on student-designed projects, and to assume a leadership stance. Middle school students of all academic levels would benefit from teachers implementing similar subject-integrated, real-world-connected work in their classrooms.

AB  - This article reports a qualitative inquiry into school leaders' and teachers' rationales for teaching to develop students' "mathematical literacy." The study is rooted in an exploration of the meanings that the school leaders and teachers hold about the term mathematical literacy. Six leaders and three grade 9 mathematics teachers from three schools were interviewed. Analysis framed within cultural-historical activity theory indicates that mathematical literacy is perceived as a desired outcome of schooling, and that teaching for mathematical literacy is connected to school leaders' and teachers' contradictory rationales for teaching. The rationales are connected to use value, meaning, teaching practice, teacher competences and knowledge, and universality.

AB  - The aims of the present study are twofold: firstly, to explore dimensions in the regulation of teaching in a multidisciplinary sample of university teachers, and secondly, to analyse factors related to the regulation of university teaching. Seventy-three university teachers representing several disciplines participated in the study. These teachers volunteered to be interviewed. Before the interviews, teachers were asked to fill in the Approaches to Teaching Inventory (Trigwell and Prosser 2004). Then they were asked about their own study experiences, the teaching traditions of their disciplines and the teaching cultures of their departments and the effect these had on them as teachers. Three different groups emerged of almost equal size from the analyses of the transcripts, each reflecting qualitatively different ways to regulate teaching. The groups were labelled "External regulation," "Self-regulation as a reaction to own bad experiences" and "Self-regulation through constructing one's own approach to teaching through reflection." The factors related to variation in regulation included previous study experience, cultures of the discipline, teaching experience and approaches to teaching.

AB  - An interdisciplinary and engaging practical is detailed which offers great versatility in the study of a qualitative and quantitative metabolism of azo-dyes by "Staphylococcus aureus". This practical has broad scope for adaptation in the number and depth of variables to allow a focused practical experiment or small research project. Azo-dyes are an important group of dyes characterised by the presence of an azo-bond within the molecule. Many bacteria are able to produce azoreductases--enzymes which cleave the azo-bond of such dyes, decolourising them. This visual representation of metabolism offers a simple and inexpensive method to study bacterial metabolism and the variables which may affect this. The practical experiment combines basic microbiological and biochemical techniques whereby broth cultures are incubated with an azo-dye, and dye degradation is photometrically monitored. Microbiological methods may also be employed to monitor the resulting microbial growth. Example results are shown from student data to highlight the effects of differing broth media and how metabolism and growth may change over a 24-hour incubation period. The performance, analysis and interpretation of the findings may prove beneficial to test a variety of skills and aptitudes within both secondary and tertiary biological education.

AB  - We report on a two-year NSF-funded project to strengthen connections among science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. One component of this project was to produce some initial data on the effectiveness of Interdisciplinary Lively Applications Projects (ILAPs) in teaching science and engineering undergraduates. ILAPs are interdisciplinary group problem solving projects, co-written by mathematics faculty and science/technology/engineering faculty. These small group projects are designed to foster student interest by being lively, real world applications of mathematics in science and engineering. ILAPs are intended to assist students in learning to communicate across disciplines and in developing problem-solving skills. We summarize our development and use of ILAPs in the calculus courses and, in particular, describe our assessment data and results on the effectiveness of ILAPs in learning and related results.

AB  - The School for Science and Math at Vanderbilt (SSMV) is an innovative partnership program between a Research I private university and a large urban public school system. The SSMV was started in 2007 and currently has 101 students enrolled in the program, with a total of 60 students who have completed the 4-yr sequential program. Students attend the SSMV for one full day per week during the school year and 3-6 wk in the summers following their ninth-to 11th-grade years, with each grade of 26 students coming to the Vanderbilt campus on a separate day. The research-based curriculum focuses on guiding students through the process of learning to develop questions and hypotheses, designing projects and performing analyses, and communicating results of these projects. The SSMV program has elevated the learning outcomes of students as evidenced by increased achievement scores relative to a comparison group of students; has provided a rigorous research-based science, technology, engineering, and mathematics elective curriculum that culminates in a Summer research internship; has produced 27 Intel and Siemens semifinalists and regional finalists over the past 4 yr; and has supported the development of writing and communication skills resulting in regional and national oral presentations and publications in scientific journals.

AB  - This paper presents a comparative study of research performance of 11 East and Southeast Asian countries based upon the total number of peer-refereed international publications (PRIP) per one million people (research intensity), the mean citation, and the contribution of domestic authors in PRIP production. Large gaps are observed within the region in the three above dimensions reflecting the disparities among countries in the levels of socio-economic development. Vietnam is among countries of low research intensity in the region having 9.3 PRIPs per one million people in 2008. Other weaknesses includes the heavy reliance on foreign authors, the low numbers of PRIPs on applied and multidisciplinary fields, and the modest contribution from Vietnamese universities in PRIP production. The paper suggests approaches that should be taken for enhancing research capability and reshaping science and higher education system in Vietnam.

AB  - In the framework of a curriculum reform in the Netherlands, an interdisciplinary open inquiry assignment has been introduced as a part of the final secondary school examinations. We developed and evaluated a preparatory open inquiry assignment to be used in science and mathematics departments of schools, in collaboration with each other: the falling cones assignment. However, teachers encountered two content problems, that hindered the (guiding of) the open inquiry process. Physics educators solved the problems and showed how the solution can be used in guiding students for inquiry learning.

AB  - Recently there have been calls to study and apply critical theory and tools around social justice, and intersectional approaches of race, anti-racism, gender, sexuality, disability and accessibility, and class in Library and Information Studies (LIS). But applying lasting techniques in the LIS classroom require pedagogies that are intersectional, assessable, and apply lasting change for the student. This article argues for impactful approaches to intersectionality -- the inclusion of multiple identities and subjectivities such as race, gender, sexuality, and class -- to LIS in three parts: (1) Teaching critical theories alongside traditional LIS texts, (2) using systems of assessment for cultural competencies and analysis, and (3) classroom activities that implement metacognitive change. These approaches in the LIS classroom can demonstrably move LIS students into a deeper critical analysis of power in libraries that will be applied throughout their careers.

It summarizes how each area within the department (Interior Design, Apparel Design and Merchandising, Consumer Affairs, Family Studies, Nutrition, Dietetics, and Food Science) has been addressing sustainability concepts. It also explains how faculty came together to offer a co-taught seminar that combines sustainability concepts across the department. A brief description of this seminar, including learning objectives and outcome measures, is presented. This article offers an agenda for departmental curricular and research activities--some of which are student centered or collaborations among faculty--that incorporate sustainability knowledge and practices within the local and global communities.

AB  - The interdisciplinary approach that science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) projects inspire in both teachers and students "brings to light a larger picture that promotes real-world scientific applications, which has in turn been shown to increase undergraduate persistence in STEM." The high school students have been warned repeatedly that they must prepare themselves for jobs and career fields that may not yet even exist. These warnings have resulted in an increased emphasis on cooperative problem solving, innovative solution writing, and technological skill acquisition across the curricula of secondary schools. By pairing mathematics and technology classes together in unique ways, students can see firsthand what those futuristic jobs may demand. At Unionville High School in Kennett Square, PA, calculus teacher Dori Ray requires her advanced placement calculus students to build three-dimensional solids of known cross-section out of layers of hand-cut foam. The process is very similar to the process technology and engineering teachers have used for years to make 3-D models from sheet goods using laser cutters, vinyl sign cutters, CNC routers, and manual processes. These activities allowed the calculus students to be exposed to engineering applications of a classic calculus problem. (Contains 7 figures.)

AB  - In this creative and reflective inquiry, I explore the pedagogical significance of arts as a place-based praxis of social transformations in a Canadian teacher education program with a focus on my students' learning experience. The research features their "pedagogical becoming" (Gouzouasis, Irwin, Miles, & Gordon, 2013) which includes the aesthetic development of their self-concept as future teachers and the critical development of their authorial agency (Matusov, 2011; Matusov et al., 2016;). The research question was, in fact, posed by some of the students themselves, who did not understand or did not want to understand, why they were compelled to take this course by the program requirement and to consider themselves as artists. They asked, "What does it have to do with me as a teacher?" Then, they stated that education and art are two different domains of knowledge that should not be mixed at all. Hence, they did not want to do anything with art in any form or shape in their education. I explore their question through a constructionist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006, 2008) and conclude with the pedagogical recommendations and suggestions for future research.

AB  - We continue to increase our understanding of the experiences and settings that contribute to positive developmental outcomes in childhood, and those that confer greater risk. Although the mechanisms by which the risk and protective factors affect developmental outcomes need to be further elucidated through research, converging findings from the field of child health (spanning both physical and mental health) indicate that a biopsychosocial approach is useful. Here, we examine the evidence that early experiences confer both risk and protective processes on biopsychosocial development in childhood, and touch on some implications for the life course. Although this interdisciplinary field of research has already garnered substantial attention, here we aim to highlight the opportunity to use a strengths-based approach with the biopsychosocial model, with particular focus on children who experience prolonged stress. We close with consideration for future directions with an emphasis on policy and practice in clinical and educational settings to improve well-being in these early stages of the life course.

AB  - This article focuses on the important role of applications in teaching mathematics to students with career paths other than mathematics. These include the fields as diverse as education, engineering, business, and life sciences. Particular attention is given to instructional computing as a means for concept development in mathematics education courses and the role of interdisciplinary projects in teaching upper level calculus. Various problems and models that emphasize the geometric roots of mathematics, its connections to other disciplines, and relevance to the outside world have been presented as meaningful tools to stimulate students' intellectual curiosity and develop their self-confidence in the subject matter. Didactical significance of famous results is discussed. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - Online learning (e-learning) has a nascent but established history. Its application to interprofessional education (IPE), however, is relatively new. Over the past 2 decades the Internet has been used increasingly to mediate education. We have come past the point of ""should" we use the Internet for education" to ""how should" we use the Internet for education." Research has begun on the optimal development of online learning environments to support IPE. Developing online IPE should follow best practices in e-learning generally, though there are some special considerations for acknowledging the interprofessional context and clinical environments that online IPE is designed to support. The design, development, and deployment of effective online IPE must therefore pay special attention to the particular constraints of the health care worker educational matrix, both pre- and postlicensure. In this article we outline the design of online, interprofessional health sciences education. Our work has involved 4 educational and 4 clinical service institutions. We establish the context in which we situate our development activities that created learning modules designed to support IPE and its transfer into new interprofessional health care practices. We illustrate some best practices for the design of effective online IPE, and show how this design can create effective learning for IPE. Challenges exist regarding the full implementation of interprofessional clinical practice that are beginning to be met by coordinated efforts of multiple health care education silos.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: Research shows that students encounter difficulties in identifying the structure of argumentation texts and in understanding the main message of the argument. The research examined the effect that learning Logic Programming (LP), while applying logic inference, has on students' understanding of argumentation texts. Background: Understanding an argumentation text means exposure to its structure, which requires the ability to identify the argument presented and to distinguish between the argument and its justifications. Argumentation is an important cognitive capacity for handling conflicting information, viewpoints, and opinions. Students' lack of ability to identify the structure of argumentation texts, and to understand its' main message, affects the understanding of texts in general, the writing of texts, and the presentation of oral arguments. Since Logic Programming is based on inference that is similar to the way in which people commonly believe that human inferential thinking is performed, our research approach was to investigate how learning LP in Computer Science affects the understanding of argumentation texts in Linguistics. Methodology: The research population included 319 11th-grade students from five high schools, divided into a study group and a control group. Students' understanding was tested using knowledge questionnaires after completing their language studies, before (pre-study) and after (post-study) a year of learning LP. The knowledge questionnaires included argumentation paragraphs where students were asked to give each paragraph a title and to analyze the argument structure. In addition, an attitudes questionnaire was administered at the end of the school year in order to examine the students' attitudes towards the connection between the two disciplines. The research applied a mixed method approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative methods. Contribution: The research and its' findings contribute to the previous body of knowledge with relation to students difficulties in understanding argumentation texts in Linguistics studies. Moreover, it suggests a new approach of using argumentation in the framework of inference as apply in LP to scaffold students' conceptions. The use of an interactive computerized system (like the logic programming language Prolog) can scaffold students in constructing their knowledge, develop their computational thinking skills, and also enables to vary the teaching methods. Findings: Findings show that the students' understanding of argumentation texts improved after learning LP. The study group students' achievements were explicitly better compared with the control group students, who did not learn LP, though this was not always reflected with significant statistics. Students' attitudes questionnaire revealed that students did not identify on their own the connections between the two disciplines and so could not explicitly use it to promote their understanding. Recommendations for Practitioners: Creative educators, who value challenges, can greatly benefit their students if they collaborate in aim for applying interdisciplinary learning while combining those two disciplines. The research conclusions shows that it is possible to improve students' understanding if teachers explicitly mediate and guide students in drawing analogies. Recommendations for Researchers: The analysis tool we developed and apply can be used by educators and researchers to evaluate the understanding of argumentative texts by learners. It can be used in language classes at all levels as well as by educators in other disciplines in which the understanding of the argumentative structure is fundamental. Impact on Society: Developing argumentation skills and computational thinking skills. Future Research: Vary future possible research can follow the presented approach: examining how LP teachers expose the logical structure of an argumentation paragraph when they write logic programs that describe the inference represented in texts; examining how language teachers coupe with learning and using LP; examines the knowledge and skills of students that experienced a mediate learning process in the two disciplines in parallel.

AB  - Interest in curriculum integration (CI) has resurged recently as schools seek to bring together knowledge from separate curriculum areas to create a more holistic, integrated learning experience for students to address the demands of "twenty-first century" learning. As the educational sciences deliver new research on the role of the arts in cognitive development, educators are also refreshing their perspective on what is termed "arts integration". This study set out to investigate the introduction of a curriculum integration model in a secondary school setting, focusing on the arts. The findings indicate that collaborative learning became a powerful strategy for enhancing student's social and motivational skills, specifically that of compromise. For a Curriculum Integration model to succeed in secondary schools there needs to be a paradigm shift in the way that secondary schools structure their timetables and their learning environments.

AB  - For many years teachers have been planning cross-curricular lessons to develop children's knowledge and understanding in two or more subjects at the same time, with the aim of showing children how to transfer skills from one subject to another and give greater purpose to their learning. However, following the revisions to the National Curriculum in England (DfE, 2013a), with its significantly raised expectations in English and mathematics, much of teachers' time and energy has been spent ensuring coverage and depth in the planning of these two discrete subjects. In order to fit more science lessons into a limited number of hours, teachers need to teach truly cross-curricular lessons. In this article, Ruth Barber explains how teachers at Wallace Fields Infant School and Nursery in Surrey took initial inspiration in their cross-curricular planning from a Hamilton Trust lesson plan, which suggested that year 1 children (ages 5-6) rewrite the popular children's song "Heads, Shoulders, Knees and Toes" to include other parts of the human body.

AB  - The Whole School Success Partnership (TWSSP) worked to develop practices and cultures that emphasized student success in five middle and high schools. Because this project took place in secondary schools where teachers have disciplinary specializations, the whole school approach came with unique opportunities and challenges. Here we describe how three critical components of this project, whole-school vision; tools to translate vision into practice; and ongoing, collaborative teacher learning were enacted to meet these opportunities and challenges. We then detail outcomes revealed by the project evaluation. We found the whole-school approach provided a common ground for facilitating school-wide change and developing a shared perspective on teaching and learning. To do this, TWSSP integrated its activities with school goals and initiatives, placed teachers in high-functioning professional learning communities (PLCs), and frequently revisited a whole-school vision. The project helped teachers connect across subject-area silos, supporting and sustaining whole school reform.

AB  - Biochemistry and molecular biology occupy a unique place in the medical school curriculum. They are frequently studied prior to medical school and are fundamental to the teaching of biomedical sciences in undergraduate medical education. These two circumstances, and the trend toward increased integration among the disciplines, have led to reconsideration of biochemistry instruction in many medical schools. We conducted a survey to explore the evolving trends in biochemistry education. A broad diversity was evident in parameters including course content, faculty, governance, prerequisites, and teaching methods. Notably, sharp differences were apparent between freestanding biochemistry courses and those in which biochemistry is integrated with other subjects. Furthermore, the data imply a likely trend toward increased integration of biochemistry with other disciplines in the medical school curriculum. (Contains 1 box and 4 figures.)

AB  - The authors describe an interdisciplinary course team-taught by an economist and a sociologist. Historically mindful of the less than amicable relationship between these disciplines, these colleagues developed a course that attempted to illuminate the different perspectives of economics and sociology in relation to selected health themes. Such a course is either rare or unique. It served as a general social science (core) requirement and as a major elective for sociology majors. The article describes course mechanics, pedagogy and assessment, course content, and institutional barriers. In particular, the article highlights some of the unique problems that exist in offering such a course--problems that are either less severe or nonexistent in more traditional courses.

AB  - Designing investigative skills sessions for key stage 5 students based on field research in the Ghanaian savannah prompted reflection on the similarities and differences in the ways farmers and students learned about and applied scientific methodology. Circumstantial constraints mean that farmers' experiments were less controlled than those students were taught to do, and students' analysis of this was used to improve their A-level preparation. Experiential and networked learning styles were appropriate for teaching the methodological content to both groups of learners, especially in the interdisciplinary arena in which fieldwork is performed.

In the activity, students' research about a teacher-assigned weather phenomenon facilitates their study of the weather. When they have completed their research, students word process a paper summarizing their findings and generate graphical representations of a weather phenomenon using Microsoft Paint software. The paper and the computer-generated graphical representation measure learning and provide insight into the level of student understanding that other assessment tools, such as quizzes, tests, and questioning techniques, do not provide.

AB  - At Bentley College, a four-year private institution located in Waltham, Massachusetts, over 90 percent of students major in business disciplines. For decades, Bentley's strong arts and sciences departments have battled for a place within an overwhelmingly career-focused curriculum, and great strides have been made to change the traditional relationship between business and the arts and sciences. Recently, for example, students gained the opportunity to pursue a double major comprising a business discipline and an interdisciplinary liberal studies program. Over two recent summers, in an effort designed to facilitate the integration of liberal learning principles across the curriculum, the college has offered weeklong workshops to faculty in both business and the arts and sciences. Bentley's desire to integrate liberal learning principles across the curriculum is based on the belief that business and the arts and sciences are "complementary," rather than competitive, elements of a complete education. A genuinely rich education should be the basis for both professional success and a more meaningful life. This article describes how faculty in both business and the arts and sciences at Bentley College worked together, through a series of weeklong workshops, to integrate liberal learning principles across the college's overwhelmingly career-focused curriculum.

AB  - In the past, humanists and scientists have held very different views about the role of collaboration in scholarly research. From the point of view of a Principal Investigator in a scientific laboratory, this article examines the increasingly dominant role of collaboration in scientific research. In contrast to the "consensus research" model of the sciences, humanists have often viewed the role of collaboration in research with considerable skepticism and have placed greater value on the traditional model of the solitary scholar pursuing knowledge and truth. An examination of some of the distinctive cultural differences between the humanities and sciences suggests that the benefits of collaboration may come to play an increasingly significant role in the future of humanistic research.

AB  - This article identifies characteristics of enduring FCS higher education programs and explores organizational changes and the impact of these changes. From multiple sources, characteristics of sustained programs were identified and categorized as (a) resource-based: strong leadership, outstanding faculty, adequate resources; (b) program-related: robust academic and engagement efforts; interdisciplinarity; student body quality, size, and diversity; and (c) strategic vision-oriented: commitment to a culture of change and effective communications. Recent organizational changes in some higher education institutions have led to mergers with other units and dispersal of FCS faculty. Outcomes have included survival of some content areas, weakened ties to FCS, and new directions and collaborations. Other FCS units have sustained a strong identity and continuity.

AB  - In modern business environments, work and tasks have become more complex and require more interdisciplinary skills to complete, including collaborative and computing skills for website design. However, the computing education in Taiwan can hardly be recognised as effective in developing and transforming students into competitive employees. In this regard, the author adopted collaborative learning (CL) with initiation and self-regulated learning (SRL) with feedback to develop students' collaborative skills and regular learning habits and further contribute to practical computing skills for website design. This study comprised an experiment that included 279 second-year university students from five class sections, including four experimental groups (CISF group, n = 57; CIS group, n = 53; CI group, n = 68; C group, n = 68), and a control group (T group, n = 33). The results reveal that students who received the combined treatment of online CL with initiation and SRL with feedback attained the best grades for their computing skills for website design among the five groups. The author further discusses the implications for teachers, schools and educators who plan to design practical scenarios and online learning activities for their students.

AB  - Improving student achievement in math and science has become a priority in the United States. As instructional leaders, principals can influence instruction in these vital subjects by working with classroom teachers to improve their instruction. Surprisingly, the research about the principal's role in supporting instruction in these subjects is limited, as is research related to principal preparation for content-specific instructional leadership. In this article, we draw from existing research to present three programmatic alternatives to existing preparation programs. These alternatives aim to strengthen preparation for content-specific instructional leadership in math and science. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - During the last two years we have developed a precalculus course customized around biology by using the scientific method as a framework to engage and motivate biology students. Historically, the precalculus and calculus courses required for the Suffolk County Community College biology curriculum were designed using examples from the physical sciences with little direct relation to biology. The biology-related mathematics in the curriculum was limited to that presented in biology courses. Favorable results from the biology department spreadsheet and web page LICIL project to increase math awareness led us to our current NSF CCLI project to develop an alternative approach to teaching mathematics to biology students. We selected the scientific method because it is taught at the beginning of every introductory biology course and is also the first fundamental level at which mathematics and biology are connected. In this article, we describe the scientific method approach to introducing precalculus, the sequence of topics covered in precalculus and the introductory biology course, and the challenges and successes of implementing this new course where mathematics topics are presented from the standpoint of a scientific experiment. Examples of the computer lab component of the course where Excel is used for data organization and analysis are provided along with how the scientific method can be used in precalculus to make predictive models that have direct relevance to the biology curriculum.

AB  - The Thinking with Data project (TWD) expands on current notions of data literacy by (1) focusing on proportional reasoning as key to data literacy and (2) leveraging the non-mathematics disciplines to engage students in deep thinking about the context of data and the application of proportionality. A set of four 2-week, sequential modules for cross-disciplinary implementation in seventh-grade classrooms was designed and evaluated. Using a quasi-experimental approach, we found that student data literacy was increased through the focused integration of social studies, mathematics, science, and English language arts. In this article, we describe our theoretical approach to designing and implementing the modules, report on student learning gains in mathematics, and describe teacher reactions to the materials. In sum, our study provides evidence that the TWD approach has the potential to build data literacy while also allowing students to learn core discipline-based content standards.

AB  - Objectives: The authors aim to summarize the pedagogical approaches and curriculum used in the training of researchers in cultural psychiatry at the Division of Social and Transcultural  Psychiatry at McGill University. Method: We reviewed available published and unpublished reports on the history and development of the McGill cultural psychiatry programs to identify the main orientations (conceptual and methodological), teaching methods, curriculum and course content. Student evaluations of teaching were reviewed. Follow-up data on research  and other academic activities and employment of trainees who graduated from the program was obtained by e-mail questionnaire. Results: The McGill program includes a Master of Science program, an intensive summer school, annual Advanced Study Institutes, and the McGill-CIHR Strategic Training Program in Culture and Mental Health Services Research. The interdisciplinary training setting emphasizes the cultural history and embedding of psychiatric knowledge and practice; the social construction of ethnicity, race, and cultural identity; the impact of globalization, migration, and ideologies of citizenship on individual identity and  the configuration of cultural communities; and the integration of quantitative and qualitative ethnographic methods in basic and evaluative research. Conclusion: This critical transdisciplinary approach provides researchers with conceptual tools to address the impact of the changing meanings of culture and ethnicity difference in the contemporary world on mental health services.

AB  - Conformity--defined here by the fact that an individual displays a particular behavior because it is the most frequent the individual witnessed in others--has long been recognized by social psychologists as one of the main categories of social influence. Surprisingly, it is only recently that conformity has become an active topic in animal and comparative biology. As in any new and rapidly growing field, however, definitions, hypotheses, and protocols are diverse, not easy to organize in a coherent way, and sometimes seriously in conflict with one another. Here we pursue greater coherence by reviewing the newer literature on conformity in behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology in light of the foundational work in social psychology. We suggest that the knowledge accumulated in social psychology can be exploited by behavioral ecologists and evolutionary biologists to bring conceptual clarity to the field, avoid some experimental pitfalls, and help design new and challenging experiments. In particular, we propose that the notions of "informational" and "normative" conformity that, until now, have been little recognized in recent literature can resolve some important controversies. In turn, research on animal culture should be of great interest to social scientists, because understanding human culture and human uniqueness requires an evolutionary analysis of our cognitive capacities and their evolutionary origins. Our review suggests excellent opportunities for social and natural scientists to join forces in building an interdisciplinary and integrative approach to the pervasive phenomenon of conformity.

AB  - Research administration and leadership, above all, directly serve the needs of researchers, scientists, research programs, institutions and their leaders, and the public trust itself. Research administration is therefore an expansive and all encompassing profession. It  integrates all of the diverse arts and sciences that are foundational to leadership and service in the management and strategic development of research. Such areas include policy formulation, leadership science, organizational psychology, financial management and oversight, regulatory compliance, and critically needed tactical areas. However, the foundations of research administration also include other areas that are sometimes assumed. Research administrators need to develop an appreciation for and understanding of the actual academic or scholarly areas of the research being conducted. There is a need to understand the art of publication practices and scholarly writing. Communication arts are critical. For international research efforts, it is essential to understand the underpinnings of multiculturalism and the processes of paradigm shifting that occur in global partnerships. For the future advancement of the research portfolio of the individual program or institution, there is a need to gain some level of the arts and sciences of programmatic development. Of particular importance here is a need to understand the overwhelming power of ethics as it touches upon nearly every aspect of the act of research and its administration. This article explores dynamic interrelationship between research and ethics, as it is critical that research administrators understand the nature of research itself.  The article suggests that Education in the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) can assist greatly in this regard. To achieve successfully the goals of ethics and of regulatory compliance in research, the ongoing RCR education of researchers and research administrators requires an appreciation of the nature of research and its fundamental definition, regardless of the actual disciplines involved or the levels of programmatic research to be explored. What the author terms the four "iQualities" are explored: (1) Research as Integral to Human Development; (2) Research as Integrated within Institutional Mission; (3) Research as Interdisciplinary; and (4) Research and Internationalization. The article concludes by stating that it is the appreciation of the cultural nature of research and the role of scientific integrity that are central to avoiding problems related to research misconduct or any form of non-compliance that erodes the ethical nature of research and its importance for human respect, beneficence, and justice. All members of a research program or institution must reflect carefully on how individuals can understand, protect, and promote in an ongoing manner the culture that is research and the proper ends of research endeavors on behalf of the public trust.

AB  - Teaching ecosystem services provides an ideal opportunity to use inquiry-based learning to help students make connections between ecological, geological, and social systems. The idea of ecosystem services, or the benefits nature provides to society, has emerged as a key concept in a host of environmental fields and is just beginning to gain attention within the geosciences. Although the concept has the potential to positively affect policy decisions by quantifying the economic value of ecosystem services, it has been criticized for commodifying nature and having limited engagement with geoscience perspectives. To teach ecosystem services to the next generation of geoscientists, we developed two variations of an inquiry-based learning exercise in which students used the ecosystem services approach to assign a monetary value to eight different ecosystem services generated by four ecosystems. One version of the exercise had students make these valuations in the field, whereas one was completed solely in the classroom. In both cases, the students scored significantly better on a postexercise assessment, demonstrated a deeper understanding of the ecosystem services approach, and reported that the exercise was preferable to a traditional lecture. Our data and observations also suggest that this exercise offers a great deal of flexibility and can be used in many learning environments. Geoscientists should be especially interested in integrating the concept of ecosystem services into their courses so that the next generation of geoscientists is well positioned to contribute to the interdisciplinary field of ecosystem services.

AB  - The underlying assumption to this paper is that learners' ability to appreciate the relevance of school science and its importance to socio-economic development of their communities to a large extent depends on the quality of instruction they receive from their teachers. A popular conundrum is that no country is greater than the calibre of its teachers. However, a sort of Mathew's principle of the "haves" having more and the "have-nots" losing even what they do have tends to hold. Hence, learners of well-trained teachers tend to outperform those of poorly trained teachers on most tasks. A vivid example here in South Africa is the usual wide chasm between the matriculation results of learners from the former well-resourced Model C schools and those (with few exceptions due to massive support) from the previously disadvantaged schools. In pursuit of relevance many African political leaders and policy makers have called on teacher training institutions to produce teachers who are capable of making school science relevant to learners' home environment. This paper reports an attempt that has been made to equip teachers in such a way that makes science accessible, interesting and complementary to learners' indigenous knowledge and life worlds in general.

AB  - We explore teachers' efforts to implement problem-based learning (PBL) in an elementary school serving predominantly English learners. Teachers had an opportunity to implement the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) using PBL in a summer school setting with no test-pressures. To understand the challenges and benefits of PBL implementation, a case study method was used and a variety of data collected. Results suggest collaboration amongst teachers is essential to design and implement PBL units. A challenge was the tension between the contradictory accountability and curriculum coverage goals of the regular academic year versus letting go to promote inquiry. Both teachers and students valued working in collaborative teams. An important insight is the need to help teachers connect NGSS to students' lives and to consider their background knowledge in unit development and problem formulation.

AB  - Molecular modeling is pervasive in the pharmaceutical industry that employs many of our  students from Biology, Chemistry and the interdisciplinary majors. To expose our students to this important aspect of their education we have incorporated a set of tutorials in our Biochemistry class. The present article describes one of our tutorials where undergraduates use modeling experiments to explore the structure of an estrogen receptor. We have employed the Molecular Operating Environment, a powerful molecular visualization software, which can be implemented on a variety of operating platforms. This tutorial reinforces the concepts of ligand binding, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and the properties of side chains and secondary structure taught in a general biochemistry class utilizing a protein that has importance in human biology.

AB  - Cross-curriculum comparisons help open up new perspectives on old issues. The flight from physics by students is one such issue. Here a comparison is made with music education and language education. Where these comparisons provide useful insights they can also warn against knee-jerk panaceas. It is suggested we need to understand how and why young people make their career decisions before we take further action.

AB  - A challenge for new residents and senior residents preparing for board examinations is refreshing their knowledge of basic science disciplines, such as human gross anatomy. The Department of Orthopaedics at the University of Utah School of Medicine has for many years held an annual Orthopedic Resident Anatomy Review Course during the summer months for all of its residents. The primary purpose of the course is to renew competencies in basic science disciplines so that incoming residents more quickly reach a level of functional proficiency and to afford senior residents a platform to teach their junior colleagues. Before 2005, this course was conducted with minimal participation from anyone outside of the Department of Orthopaedics. Many of the residents voiced concerns that the educational benefits were not proportionate to the time invested. To improve the teaching of orthopedic-related anatomy, an educational collaboration between the Departments of Neurobiology and Anatomy and Orthopaedics was established in 2004 and continues to the present time. The major objectives of refining the course pedagogy, developing a "Course Manual and Dissection Guide," and evaluating the results by administering a course survey questionnaire are described in this article. Implementation of all facets of the revised course has resulted in better participation by orthopedic faculty and more favorable reviews by the participating residents. Based on current levels of interest and positive comments from course participants, the Anatomy and Orthopedic faculty course directors plan to continue to develop course materials and pedagogy.

AB  - The English Language Arts (ELA) Common Core State Standards ([CCSS], 2010) could have a transformational effect on American education. Though the process seems daunting, one can begin immediately integrating the essence of the ELA Common Core in every subject area. This article shows how one could implement the Common Core and create coherent, literacy-rich curriculum across such disciplines as English and language arts, science, math, art, music and other performance-oriented electives.

AB  - If we aim to enhance the interest of students in engineering and therefore produce the best engineers, it is essential to strengthen the pipeline to high school education. This paper discusses several outreach activities undertaken by the Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Education, University of Ottawa (UO), Ottawa, ON, Canada, to help the transition between high school and engineering education and to make students aware of the engineering profession. At the heart of these activities is mechatronics education, which demands an interdisciplinary approach, connects to fundamental math and science concepts, and promotes collaborative project-based learning (PBL). Connected to this focus, a multifaceted program of outreach activities has been initiated. The program includes creation of design-simulate-and-build projects by engineering and high school students, as well as an interactive presentation program whereby engineering students connect with high school students through the sharing of projects that they create in their engineering courses. The survey results indicate that for the high school students, these programs promote students' awareness of engineering and how the mathematics and science they take in school connects to engineering concepts. For the engineering students, they are provided with a meaningful context within which to share their projects and explain their own understanding of engineering principles. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - Integrated STEM education within North America has become a popular pedagogy; however, teachers identify challenges that arise when planning for and implementing integrated STEM education. These challenges may threaten STEM teachers' capacity to balance disciplinary and integrated learning, a core feature of effective STEM education. The purpose of this study was to investigate how exemplary STEM teachers navigate tensions of practice to balance disciplinary and integrated learning. Through an in-depth qualitative methodology, drawing on interview and artifact data from 14 purposefully selected exemplary secondary and elementary integrated STEM teachers, this study identified tensions that teachers faced as they navigated planning for and implementing integrated STEM education: (a) curriculum content versus skills; (b) guided instruction versus inquiry and play; (c) process versus task completion; and (d) collaboration versus individual needs. In line with a Worldly Perspective (Rennie et al., 2020), balancing these tensions leads to enhanced integration.

AB  - One of the goals for problem-based learning (PBL) is to promote self-regulation. Although self-regulation has been studied extensively, its interrelationships with ill-structured problem solving have been unclear. In order to clarify the interrelationships, this article proposes a conceptual framework illustrating the iterative processes among problem-solving stages (i.e., problem representation and solution generation) and self-regulation phases (i.e., planning, execution, and reflection). The dynamics of the interrelationships are further illustrated with three ill-structured problem-solving examples in different domains (i.e., information problem solving, historical inquiry, and science inquiry). The proposed framework contributes to research and practice by providing a new lens to examine self-regulation in ill-structured problem solving and offering guidelines to design effective tools and strategies to scaffold and assess PBL.

AB  - Employing student-driven project work in a higher education setting challenges not only the way in which we understand students' learning and how we define the expected learning outcomes, it also challenges our ways of assessing students' learning. This paper will address this question specifically and illustrate with a case that highlights some of the challenges that may arise in practice when assessing student-driven, problem-based projects. The case involved an assessment situation in which a discrepancy arose between the internal and external examiner in relation to what was valued. The discrepancy had consequences not only for the concrete assessment of students' work, but also for the validity of the problem-based university pedagogy in general, and it raised the question of how to assess students' work adequately. The research focus of this study was to explore the implications of assessing student-driven projects within a progressive approach to higher education teaching, along with the potential underlying issues. We found a need for clear assessment criteria while insisting on a space for students' creativity and reflexivity as essential parts of a learning process. The paper thus makes a case for the notion of reflexivity as an assessment criterion to be integrated into learning objectives.

AB  - Most plants are able to obtain all of the nutrients that they need from air, water, and soil; however, this is not true of carnivorous plants. Because they tend to live in boggy soils where there are small amounts of nitrogen, carnivorous plants have developed specialized structures that enable them to lure and capture insects and sometimes other small animals (ICPS 2015). Because Venus flytraps, pitcher plants, and sundews are all native to their state (North Carolina) and use different structures to capture their prey, the authors chose those as their focus. Studying the natural world can be fascinating for young learners and can provide an opportunity for teachers to incorporate multiple tools for science communication. In this article, the authors describe an integrated, multimodal unit around the theme of carnivorous plants (CPs) for two first-grade classrooms.

AB  - One of the major challenges facing accounting education is the creation of a learning environment that promotes high-quality learning. Comparative research across disciplines offers educators the opportunity to gain a better understanding of the influence of contextual and personal variables on students' learning approaches. Using the Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students (ASSIST), this study examines the learning approaches of 329 first-year accounting students and 275 first-year science students at an Irish university. The analysis reveals that the accounting students are more strategic than the science students, while the science students are more inclined to adopt a deep approach than the accounting students. There was no significant difference in the scores of the two groups on the surface scale. An examination of the variation in the learning environments of the accounting and science students identifies the teaching approach, the level of continuous assessment, students' motivations for choosing their degree programme, and their prior learning experiences as possible factors contributing to the differences in the approaches to learning adopted by both groups. The article concludes by considering the implications of these findings for educators, and suggests avenues for further research. (Contains 1 figure and 2 tables.)

AB  - This article describes a pilot project of the Morgridge Center for Public Service at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for a new structure for community-based learning and research. It is based on the European-derived science shop model for democratizing campus-community partnerships using shared values of mutual respect and validation of community knowledge. The objective was to find methods that serve both community and institutional goals equally in a streamlined fashion. The Community University Exchange, the official name of the unique brand of science shop described, has just completed its first pilot year. This article analyzes how the stakeholders have found meaning in the process of building an infrastructure to help create more authentic, reciprocal, and mutually beneficial campus-community partnerships. This narrative is a map of the journey and the direction for future development. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - In this paper, we analyze some aspects related to "Mathematics and Environmental Exploration" subject syllabus for preparatory grade approved by Minister of National Education of Romania. The analysis aim the place of the subject syllabus into the Framework Plan; the syllabus structure and the argumentation of studying this subject; the syllabus general and specific competences; the relationship between competences and contents. Regarding the place into the Framework Plan this subject is part of curricular area "Mathematics and Natural Sciences". The name of the subject integrates two scientific fields Mathematics and Environmental Science for which is allocated 4 hours per week. The analysis of the syllabus, showed that it was developed according to "a new curricular design, focused on competences" (2013, p. 2), model-based on outcomes learning (Spady, 1994 as cited in Catana, 2010) and associated with student-centered approach (Catana, 2010). The analysis of general and specific syllabus competences show several aspects: to be specific to the two integrated disciplines, they require some reformulations; not all specific competences have been correctly derivate from the associated general competence. By analyzing the proposed contents, we observe that there is no information indicating whether themes are chapters' titles, topics for lessons, if they are wider or narrower than a lesson. The paper, along with observations, presents suggestions for improving the "Mathematics and Environmental Exploration" subject syllabus for preparatory grade.

AB  - Various socioscientific issues (SSIs) are emerging in today's science--and technology--dominant society, e.g. genetically modified organisms and global warming. To achieve the goal of scientific literacy, more and more science educators have devoted their attention to enhancing students' understanding of the multidimensional aspects of SSIs as well as students' abilities to make informed arguments about SSIs. The purpose of this article is to introduce a cross-disciplinary teaching approach, "post it", to engage teachers from different disciplines in promoting students' understanding of the multidimensional aspects of SSIs and informal argumentation skills.

AB  - Specialized secondary schools in the United States focusing on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) are becoming commonplace in the United States. Such schools are generally referred to by U.S. teachers as Academies. In a purposeful effort to provide a resource to educators building new STEM Academies, this study provides both a review of scholarly literature and the interview results from five successful STEM Academy educators from across the United States. This research addresses two overarching questions, (a) what are the best practices of STEM Academies, and (b) what are the key learning objectives of STEM Academies? Subject integration, in-house engineering curriculum design, student cohorts, community involvement, and internships were all revealed as being consistently reflective of best practices used in successful STEM Academies. Key learning objectives consistent across the literature and in interview results were: problem solving/the engineering design process and soft skills, such as student collaboration, communication, presentation skills and time management.

AB  - A place-based learning community called "Klamath Connection" was designed to improve the academic performance of freshman in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) majors at Humboldt State University, a midsize public institution in a location geographically and culturally unfamiliar to the majority of its students. The program interweaves four high impact practices demonstrated to improve the success of students in STEM: a summer immersion, freshman year seminar, modified gateway courses, and peer mentoring. Each component is linked by an interdisciplinary theme unique to our geographic location and central to the communities that live within it, the Klamath River basin. This manuscript describes the local background and needs assessment that initiated the program, explains our hypothesized model that a place-based learning community can foster the sense of belonging, skills, and habits that favor academic success, and reviews the design and implementation of our pilot program that launched in 2015 for 63 first time students entering HSU. We conclude by describing lessons learned from informal and formal assessments of participating faculty, staff, and administrative personnel that have prompted modifications to the model, which is currently being expanded to serve all entering STEM majors by 2020. Analyses describing the effects of the program on student attitudes, academic performance, and retention in the university will be reviewed in a subsequent manuscript.

AB  - The popularity of forensic science in schools continues to grow alongside the proportion of prime time scheduling devoted to CSI television shows. Yet the understanding of how forensic tests are used in narrowing down a field of possible suspects to the point where just one can be arrested or taken to trial is far less well understood. Students fall for the imagined glamour and glory of mapping blood splatters with no awareness of the role of ICT and computing in the logging and analysis of the data generated in the laboratory. The CSI Schools Project has grown from the realisation that ICT specialists and science education practitioners have a lot to offer one another. By piggy-backing on the popularity of forensic science, databases can be made enticing enough to hold the attention of reluctant learners, and ICT can be thoroughly embedded within the curriculum as a tool that enables higher cognitive skills to develop. Practical activities give the opportunity for students to develop hypotheses and can help put knowledge into context to enhance the learning experience. In this article, the authors describe an engaging and inspiring STEM activity that showcases the power of databases and cloud computing.

AB  - The history of innovation is constructed by solo thinkers and collaborative makers. The word innovation here comprises changes on technology, art and science. This article aims to reflect the way successful inventors, artists and scientists followed to do whatever they succeeded so that the coming generations can learn from predecessors' positive and negative experiences. Thinking and observing as solo may be the first step of an entrepreneur dreamer. Thinking and observation allow her to understand the size and depth of the gap on her knowledge integrity. This understanding process is a kind of challenge annoying and disturbing the entrepreneur dreamer during days and nights and causing his/ her to focus on the subject including examining the existing knowledge and experiences. Successful entrepreneur dreamers are aware of the historical knowledge accumulation on the field they focus on. After an entrepreneur dreamer understands what to do, on the second step, she starts tinkering collaboratively with other people whom the dreamer needs because of their own knowledge, experiences, point of view etc. With the help of others, entrepreneur starts the attempts to fill gap on his/her knowledge. These attempts require series of trial and error. First thinking and focusing on a subject as solo and then taking action and tinkering to realize dreams and thoughts as collaborative may lead us to a new learning design approach. "Soloborative Learning" is a derivative word offering the schools a new way to design learning environments, interactions and learning materials so that learners can construct their own knowledge on an innovative and entrepreneurial ecosystem.

AB  - This paper explores one district's attempt to implement a blended science and English Language Development (ELD) elementary program, designed to provide English language learners opportunities to develop proficiency in English through participation in inquiry-based science. This process resulted in blended program that utilized a combined science/ELD lesson plan format to structure and guide teachers' efforts to use science as the context for language development. Data, collected throughout the first 2 years of the program, include teacher-generated lesson plans, observation notes, and interviews with teachers and principals. The process by which the blended program was developed, the initial implementation of the program, the resulting science/ELD lesson plan format, and teachers' perceptions about the program and its impact on their students are described.

AB  - The Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) believes that fundamental change is possible in the tradition-bound world of college and university science education and recently announced new grants to empower individual scientist-educators--the HHMI Professors--to develop innovative approaches for changing the way they teach biology to undergraduates. Central to the Professors program is the goal of connecting contemporary scientific research and teaching, particularly at large research universities. Another key objective for the Professors is to identify exceptional strategies for meeting the needs of students in the sciences. The HHMI also sought to support faculty who could organize and present the latest knowledge and approaches to modern science to undergraduates. In September 2002, the HHMI announced the appointment of 20 research-active university faculty members as HHMI Professors, who will each receive $1 million over 4 yr to undertake creative initiatives in undergraduate and, in some cases, precollege science education. Although the Professors' projects are each unique, and many address a range of objectives and approaches, aspects of their work can be summarized in five illustrative categories: (1) Student-faculty research groups; (2) Research courses; (3) Interdisciplinary science education; (4) New science teaching tools; and (5) Student mentoring and broadening access. The HHMI plans to encourage the Professors to become national resources and promote broad dissemination of their activities and results to the science education community.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is being recognized as a critical component of student success in the digital era. Many contend that integrating CT into core curricula is the surest method for providing all students with access to CT. However, the CT community lacks an agreed-upon conceptualization of CT that would facilitate this integration, and little effort has been made to critically analyze and synthesize research on CT/content integration (CTCI). Conflicting CT conceptualizations and little understanding of evidence-based strategies for CTCI could result in significant barriers to increasing students' access to CT. To address these concerns, we analyzed 80 studies on CT education, focusing on both the CT conceptualizations guiding current CT education research and evidence-based strategies for CTCI. Our review highlights the code-centric nature of CT education and reveals significant gaps in our understanding of CTCI and CT professional development for teachers. Based on these findings, we propose an approach to operationalizing CT that promotes students' participation in CT, present promising methods for infusing content with CT, and discuss future directions for CT education research.

AB  - Drawing on a research study of formative assessment practices in Irish schools, this paper traces the design, development and pilot of the Assessment for Learning Audit instrument (AfLAi)--a research tool for measuring teachers' understanding and deployment of formative teaching, learning and assessment practices. Underpinning the paper is an extensive body of international research connecting assessment for learning pedagogy with student self-regulation, mental health and well-being. Reflecting on the potential of the AfLAi as a research tool, an activity systems framework is advanced as a mechanism to engage researchers and teachers in meaningful site-based continuous professional development that supports teachers' interrogation of aggregated school data derived from their responses to the AfLAi. It is argued that by de-privatising classroom practice in this way and challenging teachers to examine self-reports of their understanding and use of assessment for learning pedagogy, the extent to which students are afforded opportunities to develop as self-regulating learners is laid bare. In turn, the teaching, learning and assessment conditions that serve to create and sustain self-regulation by students emerge. The paper is premised on a commitment to a biopsychosocial approach to mental health and to an inter-disciplinary, multi-lens, research agenda that will yield comprehensive, dynamic insights and understandings to inform future practice.

AB  - School instruction is critical for helping students use energy as a lens for making sense of phenomena, however, students often struggle to see the usefulness of energy analysis for interpreting the world around them. One reason for this may be an over-reliance on the idea of energy forms in introductory energy instruction, which may unintentionally suppress, rather than prompt, insights into how and why phenomena occur. We argue that an approach to energy instruction that emphasizes energy transfers between systems, and does not require the idea of energy forms, provides students with a more consistent and useful set of tools for interpreting phenomena. Such a perspective requires connecting the energy concept to the notion that fields, which mediate interaction-at-a-distance, are a real physical system that can transfer energy -- an idea that is rarely presented in middle school science. We outline an instructional approach in which middle school students learn to interpret phenomena by modelling energy transfers between systems of interacting objects and fields. We argue that this approach presents a more physically accurate picture of energy, helps align energy instruction across disciplines, and supports students in seeing the value of energy as a lens for making sense of phenomena.

AB  - Over the past three decades, U.S. science policy has shifted from decentralized support of small, investigator-initiated research projects to more centralized, block grant-based, multidisciplinary research centers. No matter one's take on the "revolutionary" nature of this shift, a major consequence is that university scientists, now more than ever, are subject to multiple and often conflicting demands. The purpose of this article is to examine the impact of having tenure on university scientists' consideration of these demands, particularly the demand for applied and commercially relevant research. For this study, the authors examine scientists who work in a particular type of university research center, one previously referred to as the "multidiscipline multipurpose university research center" (MMURC). MMURCs are interesting because they are required to be tenured or they are required to  occupy a tenure-track position in an academic department. In this study the authors tested the general hypothesis that junior-level scientists will, relative to their tenured counterparts, devalue applied and commercially relevant research in favor of basic research, which the authors feel is justified by (a) some basic microeconomic reasoning and (b) implications of the above-discussed literature.

AB  - This article discusses how the author has developed and managed a collection of exciting resources that aim to aid transition from primary to secondary school by tackling science topics through historical contexts. Working with teachers at both primary and secondary level, the Double Crossed project has designed two exciting cross-curricular resources that can be used in both the last year of primary (year 6, ages 10/11, in England and Wales) and the first year of secondary school (year 7, ages 11/12), either during formal lesson time or during a more informal off-timetable session. Double Crossed began by exploring an alternative approach to the primary-secondary transition period by focusing initially on the experience of secondary pupils as they arrive at their new school. The decision to use history in this project is rooted in the nature of historical endeavour. Double Crossed aimed to use historical methodology to make science learning more accessible, effective, and enjoyable. (Contains 2 figures and 3 boxes.)

AB  - Mathematics and science are natural partners. One of many examples of this partnership occurs when scientific observations are made, thus providing data that can be used for mathematical modeling. Developing mathematical relationships elucidates such scientific principles. This activity describes a data-collection activity in which students employ the scientific method to explore the relationship between the number of spaghetti strands making a "bridge" and the weight that the bridge can support. Students will make qualitative predictions about relationships between variables and write linear equations to represent their data. This lesson actively engages students in the collection and analysis of data. The opening demonstration creates a "hook" for students at the beginning of the lesson as well as modeling the method of data collection A bibliography and two activity sheets are included.

AB  - This article describes how Critical Communicative Methodology (CCM) has been used successfully to analyse educational inequalities in ways that generate real transformation towards social justice. We begin by arguing that educational research today should employ new methodological approaches that can ensure the inclusion of different voices in social science research and the production of knowledge that transforms social exclusion. We then analyse the main epistemological positions of CCM, based on Habermas' communicative action theory, and explain how it was implemented in the European Union-funded INCLUD-ED project. Finally, we illustrate how INCLUD-ED has had a social and political impact and we argue that research "with" vulnerable groups, based on the principles of CCM, can generate social and educational transformation.

AB  - Theories of rational choice often make the structural consistency assumption that every decision maker's binary strict preference among choice alternatives forms a "strict weak order". Likewise, the very concept of a "utility function" over lotteries in normative, prescriptive, and descriptive theory is mathematically equivalent to strict weak order preferences over those lotteries, while intransitive heuristic models violate such weak orders. Using new quantitative interdisciplinary methodologies, we dissociate the variability of choices from the structural inconsistency of preferences. We show that laboratory choice behavior among stimuli of a classical "intransitivity" paradigm is, in fact, consistent with variable strict weak order preferences. We find that decision makers act in accordance with a restrictive mathematical model that, for the behavioral sciences, is extraordinarily parsimonious. Our findings suggest that the best place to invest future behavioral decision research is not in the development of new "intransitive" decision models but rather in the specification of parsimonious models consistent with strict weak order(s), as well as heuristics and other process models that explain why preferences appear to be weakly ordered.

AB  - General education (GE) is a new fashion in Chinese university courses, as can be seen by the fact that a GE curriculum has been set in several high-ranking universities in China recently. These courses include knowledge of history, arts, science, society, law and medicine, etc., and require English as the bridge between Chinese cultures and English cultures. English departments (or schools) are responsible for introducing foreign civilization within the framework of GE, resulting in the increasingly crucial role of English teachers in China in helping students to develop their intercultural knowledge, skills and awareness. In this new curriculum, teachers and students must acquire the skills for English reading, news listening, academic writing, and conference presenting. This changing scenario means that intercultural competence will need to be a new goal for all English teachers and students in China. In this paper, the development of GE in China is discussed, along with the setting of core courses for GE, and the relationship of GE and Intercultural Communication based on a "news-listening" class analysis.

AB  - Purpose: Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and behavior analysts are key members of school-based teams that serve children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Behavior analysts approach assessment and intervention through the lens of applied behavior analysis (ABA). ABA-based interventions have been found effective for targeting skills across multiple domains for children with ASD. However, some SLPs may be unfamiliar with the breadth of ABA-based interventions. The intent of this tutorial is to briefly introduce key ABA principles, provide examples of ABA-based interventions used within schools, and identify strategies for successful collaboration between behavior analysts and SLPs. Method: This tutorial draws from empirical studies of ABA-based interventions for children with ASD within school settings, as well as discussions in the extant literature about the use of behavior principles by SLPs and strategies for interdisciplinary collaboration. Conclusion: Given the prevalence of ASD at 1 in 68 children (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014) and the high cost of serving these children within schools (an average cost of 286% over regular education; Chambers, Shkolnik, & Perez, 2003), the need for effective, comprehensive service provision and efficiency within interdisciplinary teams is paramount. Communication, mutual understanding, and recognition of common ground between SLPs and behavior analysts can lead to successful collaboration.

AB  - As the evidence of the benefits of multidisciplinary education accumulates many schools and instructors are finding ways of hybridizing courses to include substantial components of what are otherwise distinct sciences. Often, such course development is done with an eye toward industry, which requires a workforce capable of synthesizing varied fields of information. The biotech industry is on the forefront of this movement, and its requirements are pushing universities to educate students to be fluent in multiple sciences (Dahms 2001). In particular, the author states that a bridge is urgently needed between the biomedical/biotechnology and the mechanical engineering disciplines (Schrof 1999) to facilitate the development of improved medical devices and safer surgical procedures and for the characterization of biotissues and biotransport processes. In this article, a course integrating the fields of engineering and biology was developed to teach students to solve real-world problems that included aspects from both disciplines. Computer simulations were also developed and carried out, and findings were presented in a formal report format. Thus, the author states that such courses encourage interdepartmental cooperation between students and provide a broad view of the multidisciplinary nature of scientific exploration.

AB  - The imperative for all healthcare professionals to partake in quality improvement (QI) has resulted in the development of QI education programs with participants from different professional backgrounds. However, there is limited empirical and theoretical examination as to why, when and how interprofessional and multiprofessional education occurs in QI and the outcomes of these approaches. This paper reports on a qualitative collective case study of interprofessional and multiprofessional education in three longitudinal QI education programs. We conducted 58 interviews with learners, QI project coaches, program directors and institutional leads and 135 h of observations of in-class education sessions, and collected relevant documents such as course syllabi and handouts. We used an interpretive thematic analysis using a conventional and directed content analysis approach. In the directed content approach, we used sociology of professions theory with particular attention to professional socialization, hierarchies and boundaries in QI, to understand the ways in which individuals' professional backgrounds informed the planning and experiences of the QI education programs. Findings demonstrated that both interprofessional and multiprofessional education approaches were being used to achieve different education objectives. While each approach demonstrated positive learning and practice outcomes, tensions related to the different ways in which professional groups are engaging in QI, power dynamics between professional groups, and disconnects between curricula and practice existed. Further conceptual clarity is essential for a more informed discussion about interprofessional and multiprofessional education approaches in QI and explicit attention is needed to professional processes and tensions, to optimize the impact of education on practice.

AB  - As federal legislation requires that English language proficiency (ELP) standards are aligned with content standards, this article addresses issues and concerns in aligning ELP standards with content standards in English language arts, mathematics, and science. It starts with a brief description of federal legislation for alignment between ELP standards and content standards along with challenges of ensuring alignment. Then, it highlights how current efforts to ensure alignment center on the language used to engage in disciplinary practices of content standards. Next, taking a perspective on ELP standards from the vantage point of content areas, the article presents a critique of ELP standards developed by the two major consortia of states, WIDA and English Language Proficiency Assessment for the 21st Century (ELPA21). Specifically, the critique focuses on how each consortium addresses two aspects of alignment: (a) disciplinary practices across content areas and (b) cognitive expectations across proficiency levels. Both consortia fall short in accurately reflecting disciplinary practices and maintaining consistent cognitive expectations. Lessons learned from this critique offer recommendations for the field to move forward in ensuring English learners capitalize on the opportunities and meet the demands for both content and language learning presented by content standards. As the challenges in ELP standards development lie squarely at the intersection of content and language learning, the article ends with a call to action for closer collaboration between language and content educators.

AB  - Communicating climate information is challenging due to the interdisciplinary nature of the topic along with compounding cognitive and affective learning challenges. Graphs are a common representation used by scientists to communicate evidence of climate change. However, it is important to identify how and why individuals on the continuum of expertise navigate graphical data differently as this has implications for effective communication of this information. We collected and analyzed eye-tracking metrics of geoscience graduate students and novice undergraduate students while viewing graphs displaying climate information. Our findings indicate that during fact-extraction tasks, novice undergraduates focus proportionally more attention on the question, title and axes graph elements, whereas geoscience graduate students spend proportionally more time viewing and interpreting data. This same finding was enhanced during extrapolation tasks. Undergraduate novices were also more likely to describe general trends, while graduate students identified more specific patterns. Undergraduates who performed high on the pre-test measuring graphing skill, viewed graphs more similar to graduate students than their peers who performed lower on the pre-test.

AB  - The teaching of biochemistry within medical disciplines presents certain challenges; firstly to relay a large body of complex facts and abstract concepts, and secondly to motivate students that this relatively difficult topic is worth their time to study. Here, nutrient biochemistry was taught within a multidisciplinary module as part of an undergraduate veterinary curriculum. The teaching approach was initially focussed on a mixture of didactic lectures and student-centred activities such as directed group/self learning. In subsequent years the core didactic lectures were replaced with enhanced podcasts covering the same material, along with the introduction of student presentations delivered within groups with both peer and facilitator assessment. These changes were accompanied by an increase in the time dedicated to this topic to allow sufficient time for students to work through podcasts and prepare presentations. The combination of these changes resulted in significant improvements in student performance within an in-course biochemistry long essay. These changes in the teaching approach, and particularly the introduction of extensive podcasts, was well received by students who perceived the process of going through the podcasts as time consuming but allowing them flexibility in both the pace that they studied this topic as well as the location and times that they studied it.

AB  - In this article, the author discusses what life will be like in 2035, and what its implications will be for the way in which health education is practiced. He states that in the next 25 years health educators will have to leave their comfort zones and take a calculated risk with some radical and more creative approaches to health behavior change. More programs, more education and more of what has failed to move the needle in the past 25 years also is unlikely to move it much in the next 25. Health educators should be less enamored with their past "healthedcentrism". Instead, they must: (1) unite with persons from other social and behavioral science professions to perform collaborative research that focuses on the needs of vulnerable populations; (2) focus an interdisciplinary research effort on the graying of America and the world, and the challenges that this phenomenon presents; (3) celebrate the increasing diversity in this country and worldwide at school, at work, in places of worship, and in communities; and (4) note the reality that the world will improve best from policies that support and incentivize cooperation, and that come about as a result of partnerships with the consumers that they wish to reach in health behavior or just about any other task. Long before 2035, however, the health education profession is going to need to come to terms with a series of other issues. The author shares what he thinks his professional colleagues ought to be pondering.

AB  - The unity of knowledge represents an old idea with new manifestations. During the last decades integrated approaches in teaching and learning have become increasingly popular. Applications of integrative approaches between the arts and other school subjects exist in many countries around the world, offering insights into the problems and challenges that such efforts can result into. In this paper a short review of the relevant literature in support of integrative curricula, as well as problems and concerns caused by their application, will set the basis for the description of the practice-based research project that is reported. The project brought together a kindergarten teacher and two researchers, under a collaborative model of inquiry in a pre-primary school setting in Cyprus. An attempt was made to enrich the teaching of musical concepts through the use of activities and practices borrowed from other disciplines. More specifically, the study sought to investigate whether children's understanding of the music concepts taught was evident, what was the children's response to the designed units and what were the teacher's perceptions of the educational atmosphere before and after the application of the designed units. Six half-hour music lessons, comprising two different units--pitch and tempo--were taught and videotaped. The design of the different units and the organization and choice of activities, apart from drawing from the literature on integration, was heavily based on the theory of multiple intelligences by H. Gardner. A "follow-up" video stimulated recall interview was conducted at the end of each unit. The videotaped lessons, the observation field notes, the interviews with the teacher, the teacher's self reflection as well as the feedback by the researchers, provided both a wealth of data as well as interesting interpretations. The findings suggest that the pre-primary school children that participated in the study responded with enthusiasm to innovative activities that related music with other subjects. In addition, each child was given the opportunity to better understand the concepts taught through his/her own ways of learning. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - A pilot program was developed for middle school (grades 6-8) educators and students to apply NASA real-world problems to classroom concepts through the use of digital badges, as part of NASA Langley Research Center's (LaRC) Centennial Celebration. Three sets of digital badges were developed on three of NASA's main missions: Earth Science, Aeronautics, and Journey to Mars. Each digital badge offers a total of 5 hours of professional development for educators and 2 hours of activities for students. These digital badges have introduced educators to NASA Langley Research Center's missions and 100th anniversary. Online discussion sessions, a requirement for these badges, has attracted educators new to the digital badge concepts. The LaRC Centennial badges provide a forum through which educators can learn about this new format of professional development. Educators report that these badges are worth their time and effort as part of their professional development. LaRC looks forward to building new badges in the future to expand beyond middle school and reach across the K-12 continuum.

AB  - Previous correlational and quasi-experimental studies of arts integration--the pedagogical practice of "teaching through the arts"--suggest its value for enhancing cognitive, academic, and social skills. This study reports the results of a small, preliminary classroom-based experiment that tested effects of arts integration on long-term retention of content. We designed matched arts-integrated (AI) and conventional science units in astronomy and ecology. Four randomized groups of 5th graders in one school completed one unit in the treatment (AI) condition and the other in the control (conventional) condition. To control for teacher effects, four teachers taught the same subject to different groups in each condition. We administered curriculum-based assessments before, immediately after, and 2 months after each unit to measure initial learning and retention. Results showed no differences in initial learning, but significantly better retention in the AI condition. Increases in retention were greatest for students at the lowest levels of reading achievement.

AB  - Student retention is a consequential effort of all institutions of higher learning today. The survival of the institution is dependent upon the success of students in obtaining their degrees (Knox, 2005; Noel, 1978). In order to continue to grow a base of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) students and produce quality graduates, it is imperative that best practices in student success and retention be identified, documented and replicated. This study looked at the Tennessee Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Summer Bridge program results in STEM major retention and success in designated courses. Three years of the TLSAMP Summer Bridge were randomly chosen from the inception of the first joint TLSAMP Summer Bridge Program in 2004 and the last one in 2013. The years chosen for this study were 2008, 2012 and 2013. The following information was gathered for participants in the 2008, 2012, and 2013 TLSAMP Summer Bridge Programs: (1) Major; (2) If student returned to school after freshmen year; (3) If a change of major after freshman year; (4) First English course grade; and (5) First Math course grade. TLSAMP Summer Bridge showed an indication to be a best practice for student retention and success in those targeted courses addressed in the bridge program. From a broader perspective, it can be inferred that what works for STEM majors can also work for other majors when tailored for them and the culture of the institution. Further study on the effectiveness and implementation of summer bridge programs on student recruitment and student retention is recommended.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the study is to produce design guidelines based on insights from both practice and theory that will enable teachers and educational developers to execute the design, implementation and evaluation of their work-related learning arrangements with stakeholders involved. Design/methodology/approach: The first study reported in this paper can be characterised as an exploratory design study. The second and third study can be described as design-oriented research. Findings: The case studies showed that to realize work related learning arrangements mutual understanding between stakeholders is needed to decide what has to be learned by the students and to create learning situations that have a high similarity with real working situations. Research limitations/implications: The ultimate evaluation question whether students indeed show high levels of learning outcomes on the levels of the framework when they followed work-related learning arrangements that are arranged according to the design guidelines, fall out of the scope of this paper. Practical implications: Factors that influence the intended and implemented design of work related arrangements are derived from practical and theoretical insights. Design guidelines to influence these factors in a positive direction are formulated, based on these insights. For the expected learning outcomes a dynamic framework is developed. Social implications: Work related learning arrangements are still rare in higher education and practical experience is generally only gained during short periods of internships. So the finding that learning by experience and social interaction and learning by theory and reflection should be combined in joint work related learning arrangements to obtain the most impact on the ability to transfer, will not immediately become custom. Originality/value: Teachers, educational developers and stakeholders who are involved in developing the design, implementation and evaluation of their joint work-related learning arrangements will find evidence based design guidelines and a framework to assess learning outcomes. The theoretical insights are based on a multidisciplinary combination of workplace learning theories, educational science and innovation management theory. (Contains 3 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - Scientists are creating new and amazing materials by manipulating molecules at the ultra-small scale of 0.1 to 100 nanometers. Nanosize super particles demonstrate powerful and unprecedented electrical, chemical, and mechanical properties. This study examines how nanotechnology, as the multidisciplinary engineering of novel nanomaterials into atomically precise products, is expected to disrupt most industries. Past industrial revolutions, driven by water power, internal combustion power, electrical power, and computer power, have greatly affected our economy and forever changed the course of society. Nanotechnology represents more potential power than all previous technologies combined. The primary methodology of this study involved comparing the current literature on developments in nanotechnology to the historical development of electricity to assess if the nanotech revolution is reaching a true "critical mass," based on acceleration of technological change today and at other times in history. Data was collected from technical and business books on nanotechnology, testimonies from scientists before Congress, policy letters from the President's Office of Science and Technology, presentations at major nanotech conferences, perspective surveys from the international to the local level, studies on the dangers and regulation of nanotechnology, and studies on the general and scientific educational landscape of America. Although nanotechnology is growing in national academic intensity, is gathering public recognition, and is based on patentable science, Oklahoma and the West South-Central Region received only 9.6 percent of nanotech funding (NSF Award DMI-0450666, 2005). This study establishes recommendations for business and academic planning with specific strategies, goals, and objectives for community college workforce education in Oklahoma.

AB  - With the rising popularity of digital games, a growing number of universities are developing programmes in various areas of digital design and interactive media to meet the needs for game-related courses. Faculty of this emerging field are grappling with the complexity of developing curricula which integrate art, design and technology and of finding methods of integrating students from these diverse fields. The purpose of this article is to present a case study of an interdisciplinary undergraduate course in game design and to highlight some of the unforeseen challenges and issues that arose when attempting to integrate diverse students from various art, design and media fields with students from computer science. Specifically, this article addresses issues of (a) power, (b) conflict and (c) gender that arose among students during the development of a student-created game.

AB  - This article presents a report entitled "Bio2010: Transforming Undergraduate Education for Future Research Biologists." The report is the product of an 18-month study by a committee of 11 eminent scientists. It examines ways to integrate mathematics and physical and information sciences into the education of undergraduate biology students. The study's sponsors, the National Institutes of Health and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, asked the committee to focus on students who intend to become researchers, especially in the biomedical sciences. The report concludes that significant advances in biological knowledge could result if interdisciplinary thinking and work become second nature to researchers and that connections between biology and the other scientific disciplines need to be developed and reinforced at the undergraduate level for this to happen. (Contains 1 figure, 2 footnotes, and a list of the membership of the Bio2010 Committee.)

AB  - Previous research has shown that questioning is a key strategy that facilitators use to promote discussion in Problem-Based Learning (PBL). Yet, there is a lack of detailed understanding on what questions facilitators ask and how those questions affect discussion. In this study we examined different types of questions that experienced facilitators asked to promote discussion of teaching problems in professional development for science teachers. We videotaped six PBL sessions facilitated by three pairs of experienced facilitators. Data analysis showed that facilitators asked a set of questions to initiate and advance PBL discourse, including questions to solicit ideas, to reframe ideas, to clarify ideas, to push for elaboration, to check for interpretation, and to connect to teachers' classroom practice. This study has implications for the development of PBL facilitators.

AB  - Eight years ago, a new senior interdisciplinary science course called "Oceans: Past and Present" for the McCallie School in Tennessee was designed. The idea stemmed from the combination of a physics teacher's desire for a course based on a summer program at sea and a writing center director/teacher's longing for the ocean from the mountains of Tennessee. Through the design and team teaching processes of this Oceans class, students were included in the collaboration. The result, sometimes unexpected, enriched the experience.

AB  - Researchers can be reluctant to work with fellow academics outside their disciplines or to engage the public in their research. Some will even hesitate to work with departmental colleagues or their own students if they perceive a disciplinary gap. Many of today's pressing social concerns, however, demand interdisciplinary solutions and benefit from the involvement of diverse stakeholders. In "Why and How to Be Interdisciplinary," published in the May-June 2006 issue of "Academe", Anne Dalke, Paul Grobstein, and Elizabeth McCormack wrote about the engagement of faculty members in interdisciplinary ventures. In this article, the author encourages consideration of the next step: facilitating interaction between academics and the public. Her current position as a professor of environmental education explicitly draws this connection, and she has had many discussions with colleagues about how scientists might communicate about their work outside exclusively professional channels. She hopes academics could welcome within the faculty truly interdisciplinary individuals and those interested in issues involving education and the public.

AB  - The technique of "group-averaging" produces colorings of a sphere that have the symmetries of various polyhedra. The concepts are accessible at the undergraduate level, without being well-known in typical courses on algebra or geometry. The material makes an excellent discovery project, especially for students with some background in computer science; indeed, this is where the authors first worked through the material, as teacher and student, producing a previously unseen type of artistic image. The process uses a photograph as a palette, whose colors and textures appear in kaleidoscopic form on the surface of a sphere. We depict tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral symmetries, with and without mirrors, along with the source photograph for comparison. We also describe a method to make images with color-reversing symmetry.

AB  - The College of Health, Psychology, and Social Care at the University of Derby has transformed its Interprofessional Education (IPE) offer from a top-down standalone event into a five-year strategy designed and delivered in genuine collaboration with students. Across the higher education sector, IPE has been a struggle, tokenistic at best, with limited buy-in from students. When academic-led it prevents deep learning; however, by utilising an informal education approach students bring their life, programme, and practice learning together to genuinely break down barriers between professional disciplines. This paper will use an autoethnographic case study to explore the challenges and opportunities of genuine collaboration based on youth work principles in the creation of a 'value-added curriculum', not aligned to modules or assessments. It found that buy-in from academics and students comes when students are empowered to take the lead. This is based on youth work pedagogical principles of group work, relationships with shrinking professional distance, critical pedagogy, genuine agency, and an emotional connection made between the professionals and service users. It suggests the potential is considerable as youth workers bring their pedagogical practice to a broader range of spaces within and beyond higher education.

AB  - This article describes a laboratory experience utilizing videos to engage students in hypothesis-driven experimentation in behavioral neuroscience. It provides students with an opportunity to investigate the effects of chronic methamphetamine exposure on aggression in adult mice using a resident-intruder paradigm. Instructors and students only need Internet access to run this lab, which makes it accessible to most institutions, regardless of their facilities or resources necessary to conduct behavioral neuropsychopharmacology experiments. The laboratory experience described here provides instruction and hands-on experience with: 1) developing hypotheses and methodology to test these hypotheses; 2) operationalizing constructs and developing behavioral coding criteria; 3) collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and graphically displaying primary, behavioral data; and 4) working with complex, interdisciplinary ideas. Students who engaged in this laboratory experience demonstrated self-reported learning gains in course-specific outcomes, general and conceptual science learning, and the use of animal models in scientific experimentation.

AB  - Teaching object-oriented programming to students in an in-classroom environment demands well-thought didactic and pedagogical strategies in order to guarantee a good level of apprenticeship. To teach it on a completely distance learning environment (e-learning) imposes possibly other strategies, besides those that the e-learning model of Open University of Portugal dictates. This article analyses the behavior of the students of the 1st cycle in Computer Science while interacting with the object-oriented programming (OOP) discipline available to them on the Moodle platform. Through the evaluation of the level of interaction achieved in a group of relevant selected actions by the students, it is possible to identify their relevancy to the success of the programming learning process. Data was extracted from Moodle, numerically analyzed, and, with the use of some charts, behavior patterns of students were identified. This paper points out potential new approaches to be considered in e-learning in order to enhance programming learning results, besides confirming a high level of drop-out and a low level of interaction, thus finding no clear correlation between students' success and the number of online actions (especially in forums), which reveals a possible failure of the main pillar on which the e-learning model relies.

AB  - The rich, interdisciplinary tradition of learning styles is markedly absent in information systems-related research. The current study applies the framework of learning styles to a common educational component of many of today's information systems curricula--object-oriented systems development--in an effort to answer the question as to whether one's learning style, when matched with a specific complementary instructional methodology, results in increased domain-specific performance. The data collected from 196 information systems majors enrolled in object-oriented systems development courses suggest that task performances increases significantly when the instructional methodology closely mirrors the student's learning style inclination.

AB  - Geometry and culture are interrelated, making school geometry closely connected to the environment as well as culture in which it is taught. With regard to this connectedness, the Zimbabwean mathematics syllabus indicates that geometry should be connected to the learners' environment and culture. This article explores teacher-related challenges to the integration of ethnomathematics approaches into the teaching of geometry. Findings are based on feedback received from questionnaires and focus-group discussions in which 40 in-service mathematics teachers expressed their views on the challenges that affect the integration of ethnomathematics approaches into the teaching of geometry. Major challenges included lack of knowledge on ethnomathematics approaches and how to integrate these approaches into the teaching of geometry; teachers' lack of geometry content knowledge, teachers' views of geometry taught in schools, teachers' competence in teaching geometry, teaching and professional experience as well as resistance to change by teachers. The study recommends that teacher training institutions need to redesign their curricula to include ethnomathematics approaches and that there is need for in-service training on ethnomathematics approaches.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to present the twenty-five-year evolving pathway of the European dimension in education in Croatia. Furthermore, the paper critically problematises the lack of a theoretical framework that has marked this concept's research and partly contributed to its conceptual dispersion and scholarly ambiguity. Design: The paper design is based on chronological and content analysis of the European dimension in education development, primarily focusing on the Croatian context. The period analysed is from 1996, when the first paper on the European dimension in education in Croatia was published until 2020. Findings: The development frame of the European dimension in education is proposed, with an overview of appurtenant phases, followed by chronological and detailed elaborated thematic groups. As an answer to detected theoretical deficiencies, the political praxiology of education is introduced as a direction of its future theoretical development and a partly new shift in the conceptual definition of the European dimension in education is proposed.

AB  - Background: Participation is one of the most important interdisciplinary outcome variables in biopsychosocial conceptions of health and disability. While the literature surrounding social and community participation in persons with disabilities indicates that participation is a highly subjective construct, there are few known psychometrically validated instruments designed to measure participation in a way that captures the subjective nature of the concept. The present study aimed to develop and test a measure of participation in a way that prioritizes roles that are subjectively meaningful to the individual. Objective: To establish the psychometric properties of the "Meaningful Role Functioning Questionnaire" (MRFQ) a new life role participation scale intended to measure life role functioning in a way that weighs life roles that are more important to the individual more heavily than those that are less important to the individual. Methods: 229 women with fibromyalgia took an online survey measuring the following biopsychosocial constructs: meaningful role functioning, participation in society, perceived social support, core self-evaluations, fibromyalgia severity, and life satisfaction. Findings: The 4-week test-retest reliability coefficient for the MRFQ was 0.74, indicating acceptable reliability for this measure of life role functioning. The MRFQ was significantly correlated in the expected directions with several external correlates, establishing its construct validity. Conclusions: The MRFQ is a reliable and valid subjective measure of life role functioning in women with fibromyalgia. Future research should seek to validate the scale in a wider range of disability populations and the general public.

AB  - It is a controversial issue that magnetism is an interesting topic for children but also the concept is too abstract for the preschoolers. In this study, an action research is conducted that examines whether the designed intervention program based on STEM can be beneficial for 5-6 years old children to learn more about the specific features of the magnets. The program consists of several activities including reading story, playing a tablet game and designing a product from different shaped magnets. Findings underline the importance of STEM activities, as an interdisciplined approach, can foster the children to engage more actively in learning, inquiring, designing and reflecting processes. Besides, this study confirms the claim that preschool children are capable of developing conceptual understanding in 'magnetism'.

AB  - A revision of the Northern Ireland Primary Curriculum took place in 2007. It promotes strongly a cross-curricular or thematic approach to planning and teaching and has an "Area of Learning" structure which includes geography alongside history and science and technology in an area called "The World Around Us". Responses from teacher questionnaires and interviews with teachers and "stakeholders" reveal wide-ranging opinions, mostly positive, about the effectiveness of this approach in improving pupil learning. A significant number of teachers have adopted a pragmatic, balanced and reflective approach to their planning, something which requires a high skill level in "curriculum-making" which, in turn, can be enhanced by effective in-service training.

AB  - In philosophical use, "ethics" and "moral philosophy" are more closely synonymous--one deriving from Greek, "ethike" and the other from Latin "moralis." In typical social science paradigms, there generally prevails a consensual sense of contemporary everyday use of "ethics," except where earlier usage sustains discourse in terms of "morals"--as with "moral psychology." This article takes a recent publication in this journal by Patrick Welch to propose a "conversation" between theoretic and empirical approaches to ethics and morals. This is illustrated using works by Joseph Ratzinger to suggest a natural law approach that brings together premises and empirics in ethical and moral discourse and action. This kind of integration helps the discovery and owning of truth that is "not of one's own making". Such a synthetic approach is especially relevant to raising student identity with ethical/moral issues and in assisting their building of psychological structures and processes that support education in ethical/moral reasoning and action.

AB  - Studies (for example, Dellaportas in Making a difference with a discrete course on accounting ethics. "J Bus Ethics" 65(4):391-404, 2006; Saat in "An investigation of the effects of a moral education program on the ethical development of Malaysian future accountants," 2010) on final year accounting students show that industrial training has a positive impact on the ethical development in a way that students improved in their ethical judgement after attending a 6-month training. Thus, this research aims to evaluate the influence of industrial training in the development of ethical awareness among final year students from a Malaysian public university. These students were from multiple academic backgrounds--engineering, science and social science. A pre and post study was adopted in order to achieve the objectives. A set of survey was distributed to students before and after they have attended industrial training. In assessing students' ethical awareness, 15 business-related and workplace ethical situations were given and students had to rate their acceptance on these situations from not acceptable (1) to most acceptable (7). From the findings, it can be observed that although the level of ethical awareness among students is fairly good, industrial training has minimal impact in improving or developing students' ethical awareness. The impact is such because students who undergone industrial training may have observed certain behaviour that they thought are acceptable in a workplace; this may have changed the way students perceived their acceptance on the situations.

AB  - The polygraph (lie detector) may be an ideal vehicle for converting aspects of a physiology course into an interdisciplinary course, enabling discussion of interrelationships between science, technology and society (STS) and social dilemmas arising from technological developments. The authors present a way of incorporating the polygraph into a pre-service teacher education physiology course. They briefly present the scientific, technological and social aspects of the polygraph as well as a suggested sequence of suitable lessons and activities. Some of the activities presented here are laboratory experiments using "hands on" approach and ICT. (Contains 4 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - Two linked courses examining conservation science and art history of 17th-century Dutch painting are described. The two courses have been taught on campus and, most recently, as study-abroad courses in collaboration with the Center for European Studies, Universiteit Maastricht, The Netherlands. The highly interdisciplinary courses are intense, yet presuppose that students have no background in either science or art history. The courses have successfully drawn students who are science majors as well as nonmajors into the same classroom with productive outcomes. Strengths and limitations of the approaches taken are discussed and key resources from the courses are cited. (Contains 6 figures.)

These ecosystems are intended to be realistic virtual representations of environments that may be costly or difficult to access in person. They can be constructed as 3D worlds rendered from stereo video data, augmented with scientific data, and then deployed online for use. The application of virtual ecosystems stretches from interdisciplinary scientific research that may not occur otherwise to providing science students with an environment to conduct studies and virtual field trips in that they would otherwise not have access to.

AB  - This study considered outcomes when 27 academics explicitly developed and assessed student research skills in 28 regular (non-research methods) semester-length courses. These courses ranged from small (n = 17) to medium-large (n = 222) and included those from first year to masters in business, engineering, health science, humanities and science, across five universities in three Australian cities. The two-year study used three data sets to determine the outcomes of development and assessment initiatives: student pre- (n = 779) and post-questionnaires (n = 601), interviews with students (n = 46) one year after completing a course that developed research skills and interviews with academics (n = 17) involved in developing and assessing student research skills. These multiple sources provided evidence that students developed a variety of discipline-specific research skills and that these skills were useful for subsequent studies and especially for employment. Academics indicated that the process of making explicit the development of student research skills led to enhancement of their teaching, helping the academics to clarify major course purposes as well as enabling them to provide more substantial feedback to students than in the past. Academics also indicated that this teaching process changed their understanding of disciplinary research and, for some, even suggested new directions in their research.

AB  - Background: Under the view of dynamical system theory, expertise in sports emerges from the interaction of multiple constraints. At an individual level, important interactions amongst constraints could include the relationships that evolve between one's family, playmates/coaches, and specific training activities. Or more broadly, other environmental constraints can be the strong socio-cultural-historical contexts that influence expertise development in sports around the world, such as rugby (e.g. New Zealand) and football (e.g. Brazil). An increasing number of studies have demonstrated the influence of environmental constraints on the development of sport expertise. Whilst making important contributions to knowledge, such studies have been limited in scope and fail to consider in depth how informal and even aversive learning environment constraints affect skills development. Objective: The objective of this paper is to outline a new contextualised approach to studying socio-cultural constraints on individuals, proposing an interpretive, multi-method approach to holistically investigate the interacting constraints on an athlete's development pathway. Aims: We explain a rationale for adopting an interpretive research paradigm (in contrast to traditional positivist approaches) for exploring socio-cultural constraints. The epistemological and methodological assumptions of Bronfenbrenner's Bioecological Model of Human Development are proposed as an underpinning framework for data collection and organisation of material. We advocate for ethnographic strategies of inquiry, followed by a discussion of potential methods for generating and analysing data: contextual analysis, participant-observation, and open-ended interviews. Finally, we discuss evaluation criteria for this contextualised approach viewed from a coherence theory of truth. Purpose: This position statement seeks to: (1) promote methodological possibilities to investigate the effect of socio-cultural constraints on expertise acquisition in sport and (2) offer significant new theoretical and epistemological insights from the constraints-led approach to expertise and to integrate some of the interdisciplinary differences that exist in the body of sciences. Final thoughts: Our tentative contribution to the development of the proposed contextualised skill acquisition research framework is to build bridges across the methodological boundaries between sociology and motor learning in the first instance, rather than offering a unifying approach for the whole field. We hope that this position statement will provide a foundation for future related empirical papers and to stimulate other researchers to consider the framework for their own investigations of motor learning in the field.

AB  - For many educators, working with students who were deaf or hard of hearing was the need to have "access." Access to technology was the tool of choice for providing integration that has come to be so much more than gadgets. It is intercurricular--math software incorporates reading, science websites support language skills. It is multimodal--requiring not just clicking and reading but filled with visual, kinetic, and interactive information. It requires students to think more critically, not only to connect to content but to get more from the content than they would if they didn't have technology. In this article, the author notes that the key to "powering up technology" is integrating technology that supports and enhances learning goals and follows four key components of learning: active engagement, participation in groups, frequent interaction and feedback, and real-world connections. All students, regardless of hearing ability, should have full access to the technology available today--just like they have access to pencils and paper. Integrating educational technology allows students to construct their own learning from where they are and with what they have. Moving beyond technology incorporation to technology integration ensures deaf and hard of hearing students are getting every opportunity to flourish as young people in the 21st century.

AB  - The paper describes a graduate course deploying innovative instructional materials (e.g., the use of novels to provide context for theoretical constructs) and learning activities (e.g., community asset mapping) to engage issues of leadership in rural settings. Prior to describing the course itself, the paper develops a rationale for the importance of leadership approaches that emphasize cultural responsiveness and attentiveness to place and context (Johnson, 2007; Johnson, Thompson, & Naugle, 2009). In addition to a review of relevant literature from various academic disciplines (e.g., sociology, anthropology, economics, political science) to provide background and develop a shared vocabulary and conceptual frameworks, the course combines academic texts engaging salient issues of policy and practice in rural education with appropriately positioned fictional representations of rural contexts to provide a common foundation for discussing the interrelationships between rural communities and rural schools.

AB  - Incorporating engineering instruction into the elementary curriculum is not without challenges. Traditionally, researchers investigated using engineering design to promote students learning science concepts. More recently, researchers have conducted qualitative investigations to measure students' learning of engineering concepts after engaging in engineering design. In this study, we extended work on elementary engineering instruction by implementing an integrated engineering and writing unit with 58 third-grade students. Using stratified random assignment based on pre-intervention engineering vocabulary assessment scores, we assigned students to treatment (n = 28) or comparison (n = 30). During a 10-day unit, all students participated in design challenges, emulated the practices of actual engineers, and used writing to support and document their learning, as they designed and authored their own five-page pop-up books. Students in the treatment condition participated in additional writing during 8 of the 10 unit lessons. During this time, they responded to journal prompts related to lesson objectives. At the same time, students in the comparison condition participated in small-group discussions during which they discussed journal prompts orally. We found that all students made statistically significant gains from pre- to posttest on an engineering vocabulary assessment; total words written, number of different engineering concepts used, and depth of understanding of engineering concepts in a written essay response; and number of different engineering concepts used in an oral interview response, regardless of their incoming writing skills and regardless of whether they participated in additional writing or small-group discussion of lesson objectives. This study is the first to quantitatively document the effectiveness of a combined elementary engineering and writing intervention for promoting students' learning of engineering concepts in multiple ways (rote recall, written representation, and oral representation). We argue that literacy, particularly writing, provides an effective and feasible method for incorporating engineering instruction into the elementary curriculum.

AB  - It has been suggested that the field of Mind, Brain, and Education (MBE) requires a stable infrastructure for translating research into practice. Hinton and Fischer (2008) point to the academic medical center as a model for similar translational work and suggest a similar approach for linking scientists to research schools. We propose expanding their model to include a formal role for clinicians. Including clinicians who work with children with learning problems brings an important perspective to the translational work. For example, the integration of the concept of "differential diagnosis," a core precept in clinical medicine, would bring needed diagnostic specificity to the field of MBE. We describe a virtual infrastructure for collaboration, or "collaboratory," consisting of research scientists, educators, and clinicians, linked to an academic institution. We anticipate that MBE graduates can play a critical role in the collaboratory model. With additional training, they can become "neuroeducators" capable of moving comfortably among the disciplines, building linkages, fostering communication, and facilitating collaboration.

AB  - This inquiry-based activity designed for the fifth through 12th grade allows students to engage in an outdoor, place-based experience, working collaboratively both in groups and as a class to accomplish the class goal of creating a local tree map linked to student-collected data about each tree. During Local Tree Mapping, students explore the local trees in the yard or neighborhood of the school, while learning basic skills in geographical information systems and Microsoft Excel. Through this activity, students gain a deeper understanding of and appreciation for the role of trees within the Earth's ecosystems, as they collect data on tree type, height, diameter, age, and the longitude and latitude of the trees. An extension activity is described in which students can enter their tree data into a carbon dioxide (CO[subscript 2]) emissions reduction calculator to determine how much CO[subscript 2] is sequestered by the trees in their research site. Local Tree Mapping provides an opportunity for students to gain inquiry skills in science, mathematics, and geography as they participate firsthand in the collection, analysis, and presentation of real-world data that can be utilized by the local community.

AB  - There is a need to establish and nurture a relationship between urban and suburban students and the natural world. This relationship needs to be personal and immediate. They need to see the wilder life that survives and sometimes flourishes in "their" world--not miles away in the hills and mountains or hidden beneath the sea, but outside their windows, on their sidewalks and streets, perched on their telephone poles. To build a relationship between students and the natural world that transcends boundaries, teachers need to establish a kinship with their colleagues in the natural and social sciences. In this article, an English teacher, a biology teacher, and a social studies teacher walk the overlapping terrain of their disciplines, searching for places where a shift in activity or perception might restore the ecological balance of authentic learning. In the cross-pollination that occurs, they find lost connections, mutually sustaining relationships, and hope. (Contains 2 figures and 1 note.)

AB  - We report on the experience of creating a socially networked system, the Research-oriented Social Environment (RoSE), for representing knowledge in the form of relationships between people, documents, and groups. Developed as an intercampus, interdisciplinary project of the University of California, this work reflects on a collaboration between scholars in the humanities, software engineering, and information studies by providing an opportunity not only to synthesize different disciplinary perspectives, but also to interrogate and challenge the assumptions each brings to team-based design projects in the digital humanities. This work examines socially networked knowledge as both content and methodology for collaboration, calling for further critique and future investigation of epistemological questions in models of social networks.

AB  - Understanding how the arts can enhance learning has long been discussed and debated among educators, students, parents, artists, art historians, and philosophers. Many anecdotal examples reference the value and benefits of the arts in a range of fields and learning domains. Emerging methodologies in the brain sciences have added new perspectives and research-based approaches to better understand the role the arts might play in learning. Psychologists, cognitive scientists, and now neuroscientists are approaching this topic by exploring memory, sensory systems, and other biological measures. The interdisciplinary and potentially interdependence of these fields to work together to identify the neurological mechanisms involved in the arts may offer educators, parents, and child care providers with important information about how we learning takes place. By bringing together uncommon and divergent thinking from a wide range of disciplines, there is an opportunity to change the way we teach, parent, and serve children using the arts to help enhance learning. This issue of "Mind, Brain, and Education" celebrates the range of approaches that are emerging to shed light and insight in this field.

AB  - The laboratory component of a first-semester general chemistry course for science majors is described. The laboratory involves a semester-long project undertaken in a small-group format. Students are asked to examine whether plants grown in soil contaminated with lead take up more lead than those grown in uncontaminated soil. They are also asked to examine whether the acidity of the rainwater affects the amount of lead taken up by the plants. Groups are then given considerable independence in the design and implementation of the experiment. Once the seeds are planted, which takes about 4 wk into the term, several shorter experiments are integrated in before it is time to harvest and analyze the plants. The use of a project and small working groups allows for the development of a broader range of learning outcomes than occurs in a "traditional" general chemistry laboratory. The nature of these outcomes and some of the student responses to the laboratory experience are described. This particular project also works well at demonstrating the connections among chemistry, biology, geology, and environmental studies. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)

AB  - We propose that a targeted and structured explication of empathy is a useful, if not essential, foundation for social work theory and practice. We outline a social work framework for empathy, one that is rooted in an interdisciplinary context, emphasizes recent findings in the field of social cognitive neuroscience, and yet is embedded in a social work context. The framework lends itself to identifiable education components that social work educators can implement across the curriculum. We can help students understand the basic process of neural path-way development that determines their affective empathic responses and develop and maintain cognitive empathic abilities. In addition, students can learn to use their knowledge, values, and skills, informed by empathy, to take empathic action consciously. (Contains 2 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most important and powerful methods in chemometrics as well as in a wealth of other areas. Running a PCA results in two main elements, the score plot and the loading plot; the score plot provides the location of the samples, and the loading plot indicates correlations among variables, the trends in the grouping of samples, and the most important variables. In the past 10 years teaching chemometrics, we have struggled with not having free software with an easy to use graphical user interface for data handling and calculations. In this paper, we provide a series of examples that students used to carry PCA in R-Project, a free and open source software program. In the first example, students used PCA to find correlations among chemical properties of chemical elements and relate these properties with the periodic distribution of the elements. In the second example, meat samples were grouped using 14 variables, and students could observe how outlier samples might influence the PCA model; in this case, they were also taught how to use the t test to choose the variables that were significant to the PCA model. In the third example, healthy patients were differentiated from diabetic patients using 163 lipid concentrations. In the fourth example, Atlantic salmon samples were differentiated from catfish samples. In the fifth and sixth examples, students were able to observe how data treatment affects the classification of natural products and edible oils, respectively.

AB  - This paper reports on the design and development of an empirical cross-boundary, collaborative open learning framework for cross-institutional academic development. The framework is one of the key outputs of a phenomenographic study into the lived experience of open learners in two open cross-institutional courses. Data was collected through individual interviews from 22 study participants from two courses that made up a collective case study. These courses were offered by UK higher education institutions in collaboration with informal partners nationally and internationally and were selected as these had different collaborative learning features built-in that could be explored. Course participants in these two courses include academic staff who teach or support learning and further open learners. The empirical design framework is proposed to support the development and implementation of cross-boundary collaborative open learning approaches within cross-institutional academic development and may also be useful in further learning and teaching settings in higher education.

AB  - Teaching about Native artworks as part of school arts curriculum can serve to pass on traditional ecological knowledge while also contextualizing colonialism's influence on traditional and contemporary Native arts practices. This article explores how schools can actively engage in community arts partnerships with American Indians who have traditional cultural knowledge and can construct standards-based multidisciplinary curricula true to both art and science disciplines. An example from my recent study of a culturally relevant arts program highlights the work in classrooms of a Native basketmaker who did just that. (Contains 2 footnotes.)

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of a mixed format, experiential course on changes in Honors students' attitudes about various issues of inequality. Methodology: Students enrolled in the course (N = 75), taught during the 2016 Presidential election, were asked about their opinions on a variety of inequality topics using a pre- and post-test survey, with the post-test survey including questions on how perceptions of inequality had changed over the course of the semester. Findings and implications: Results indicate that some students became more self-aware of their position in society and were less sure that people in general, and they themselves in particular, would be responsible for their own success. Importantly, students were less likely to believe that people faced fair and equal opportunities in the labor market and their overall level of support for unions increased during the semester. Most students agreed that the outside speakers, a key component of the course, provided new information on various aspects of inequality and impacted their overall perceptions of inequality. However, students were much less agreed on how they felt both about the future of the country and the future of inequality.

AB  - Scientific expertise and outcomes often give rise to controversy. An educational response that equips students to take part in such discussions is the teaching of socially acute questions (SAQs). With SAQs, the understanding of uncertainty, risk and how knowledge is developed is central. This study explores the way in which students from different disciplines and different continents are brought together via a digital platform to explore SAQs about environmental issues (a green algae outbreak linked to release of fertilisers along the coast of Brittany; the construction of a desalination plant near Melbourne to produce freshwater; and changes in meat consumption on a global scale, with regard to population projections in 2050). We have developed frameworks for looking at the quality of the collective reasoning and at the nature of students' interactions, so that we can analyse the organisation of the learning communities and the building of collegial expertise. The results show that interdisciplinary discussions, especially on an international scale, foster the understanding of complex situations. In this paper, we discuss the modalities of one didactic scenario to enhance critical thinking and collaborative work, and to provide space for learners to support argumentation.

AB  - Yuan Ze University targeted Biomaterials Science and developed a curriculum related to Biotechnology, Biochemical Engineering, and Biomaterials for engineering students to cultivate talents for both engineering and biotechnology. After several years of operation, recruiting students has succeeded, and students are satisfied with the course design of the curriculum. The majority of professors advising students' special topic studies have evaluated student performance commendably, and most of the first-year graduates have chosen to pursue a higher degree or work in relevant field. Thus the interdisciplinary program shows the potential to foster and extend engineering students' vision while enabling them to consider different options for post-graduate study or work.

AB  - The nature of nanoscience and nanotechnology (collectively, nano) are discussed as important examples of the modern sciences and technologies that are having an increasing impact on all aspects of life. In this Position paper, general proposals are made for the levels of understanding of nano that might be attained by whole populations. The ideas that should be addressed in those levels of understanding are reviewed. The scope and limitations of formal and informal avenues to the attainment of such understanding are outlined. Proposals are made for the aspects of nano that are best conveyed by the different media available for informal provision and illustrated from the scant documentation of contemporary practice. Last, some substantial issues for further research and development are identified.

AB  - The author presents a content integration that focuses on social studies and science knowledge and skills. The idea of using folk crafts to help elementary students learn social studies extends from John Dewey's laboratory school to the twenty-first century. Meaningful content is applied to skills, such as blacksmithing, found in the community, and students make connections between school knowledge and their lives outside of school. In this activity, blacksmithing helped students integrate ideas from multiple academic subjects, incorporating content from the social sciences and humanities. The guest content expert with a specialized knowledge base played a large role in making this experience occur for the students and teachers. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - Academic misconduct by students in higher education is a fact and is a challenge to the integrity of higher education and its reputation. Furthermore such misconduct is counterproductive to the ethics component of higher education. The purpose of this research is to explore, investigate and compile the anecdotal accounts of academic misconduct conducted by students in classes in higher education across disciplines. This research is a result of the combined efforts of faculty members representing the disciplines of humanities, arts, social sciences, business, languages, music, and various engineering fields. The goal is to bring to light the various methods and strategies that students use to cheat during exams, quizzes, term papers, etc. As a collaborative effort, the authors also investigate techniques faculty can use to prevent academic misconduct in both face-to-face and virtual classrooms. Student viewpoints are also presented as part of this study and are collected through an anonymous survey. Students get a chance to reveal what motivates them to cheat in exams, quizzes and other assessments. They also indicate some of the techniques their peers use in supervised (e.g. tests, quizzes, exams etc.) and un-supervised (e.g. homework, projects, lab reports, online environment etc.) assessments. The survey also reveals whether students are more likely to cheat in the major required courses or non-major elective courses etc. Some of the techniques that deter students from cheating are also discussed.

AB  - As the result of an extensive self-study for the purpose of reaccreditation, the Department of Theology at The University of Portland began offering a new series of courses called Theological Perspective Courses (THEP). THEP courses are upper division and offered by theology faculty in conjunction with another department that has required core courses in the College of Arts and Sciences. They are intended to be interdisciplinary, with two faculty members from different disciplines collaborating on new course design and implementation. THEP 482, Theology in Ecological Perspective, was one of the first two THEP courses taught. This article describes and reflects on the nature of this religion and science course in terms of subject matter, learning theory, and development of community. Several additional appendices to this article appear online at: http://www.wabashcenter.wabash.edu/journal/article2.aspx?id=12397.

AB  - María Oliveri, and Saad Khan write that the article: "How Task Features Impact Evidence from Assessments Embedded in Simulations and Games" provided helpful illustrations regarding the implementation of evidence-centered assessment design (Mislevy & Haertel, 2006; Mislevy, Steinberg, & Almond, 1999) with games and simulations. Oliveri and Khan found the use of contrasting running examples, "Newton's Playground" (Shute & Ventura, 2013) and "Mathematics Word Problem" (Hiebert & Wearne, 1993), to be very useful in illustrating several key ideas of embedding assessments in games and simulations. For instance, they found the explanation of how to use games and construct maps useful particularly toward achieving the goal of measuring noncognitive constructs such as creativity and conscientiousness. Oliveri and Khan believe that the use of games is an interesting approach toward the assessment of such constructs. Primarily, they have been measured through the use of self- and peer-ratings; these have been criticized, among other reasons, for low reliability (Kyllonen, 2012). They suggest that an alternative approach toward measuring them by collecting data and responses directly from the test taker is important as it may help counteract some of the difficulties associated with using ratings. Further elaborations in relation to how to measure these constructs in games and simulations would have been helpful. One way in which this could have been done is by presenting contrasting examples that not only focused on a mathematics word problem but also drew upon examples of measures used to assess students' noncognitive traits. In other words, although the use of a mathematics word problem provides a contrast to the assessment of physics knowledge, it does not set the context for the assessment of noncognitive constructs. Despite the challenges in game design and validation, Oliveri and Khan believe the article provides a thorough account of various aspects of task design, which are important not only in understanding "Newton's Playground," but also toward the development of other games and simulations.

AB  - Validation research for educational achievement tests is often limited to an examination of intended test score interpretations. This article calls for an expansion of validation research in three dimensions. First, validation must attend to actual test use and its consequences, not just score meaning. Second, validation must attend to unintended as well as intended testing consequences. Third, validation must attend to indirect as well as direct testing effects. Indirect effects include the effects of score-based incentives in prompting actions intended to raise test scores (directing student effort or focusing the system) as well as messaging effects associated with a testing program per se but not dependent on specific scores (shaping perceptions). This expanded program of test validation can best be accomplished by measurement professionals working in collaboration with scholars from other social science disciplines.

AB  - Laboratory experiments that focus on protein folding provide excellent opportunities for undergraduate students to learn important topics in the expanding interdisciplinary field of biophysics. Here, we describe the use of Stern-Volmer plots to determine the extent of solvent accessibility of the single tryptophan residue (trp-59) in unfolded and partially unfolded states of the well-studied protein cytochrome "c" (cyt "c"). Comparison of quenching efficiencies for free tryptophan in solution and partially buried in cyt "c" highlights the persistence of residual structure in unfolded proteins and deepens students' understanding of protein structures and dynamics. The experiment builds on our previous laboratory module that probed thermodynamics and structures of cyt "c"; collectively, these protein-folding experiments and related topics provide physical chemistry students with opportunities to explore a comprehensive set of spectroscopy and biophysics tools.

AB  - In this article, the author describes how one high school chemistry teacher, Sharon (pseudonym), implemented a literacy-based unit that appealed to her students by capitalizing on their out-of-school interests in forensics and how her students responded to that unit. The author also describes how two colleagues at her school joined her in teaching forensics during the following academic year. In doing so, she explores the range of related literacy activities that students employed both in school and on their own outside of school and shared with her in interviews or through questionnaires. She also provides examples of how individuals related the knowledge and skills that they learned from their interactions with everyday texts in informal settings to the science concepts that they learned in class. Finally, she identifies the appealing features of alternative texts and textual practices that could be re-created in designing instruction in classroom settings. Although these activities were science related, their appealing features could be incorporated into instruction in other content areas as well.

AB  - Creation of physical models can help students learn science by enabling them to be more involved in the scientific process of discovery and to use multiple senses during investigations. This activity achieves these goals by having students model ocean currents in the Gulf of Mexico. In general, oceans play a key role in influencing weather patterns and climate. Water movement also affects fisheries through transport of various fish and invertebrate species as well as their predators and prey. Currents also impact the dispersion of pollutants, as in after an oil spill such as the catastrophe of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in 2010. Currents exist deep in the ocean, and they do not always travel in the same direction as currents at the surface. This concept of the existence of ocean currents below the surface can be hard to explain, but we provide methodology for sharing this information in a way that is accessible to K-12 students, including the visually impaired. In addition to the NGSS standards and Ocean Literacy principles addressed, this activity has larger implications related to socioeconomics and international law.

AB  - I begin by examining the natures of science and religion before looking at the ways in which they relate to one another. I then look at a number of case studies that centre on the relationships between science and religion, including attempts to find mechanisms for divine action in quantum theory and chaos theory, creationism, genetic engineering and the writings of Richard Dawkins. Finally, I consider some of the pedagogical issues that would need to be considered if the science/religion issue is to be addressed in the classroom. I conclude that there are increasing arguments in favour of science educators teaching about the science/religion issue. The principal reason for this is to help students better to learn science. However, such teaching makes greater demands on science educators than has generally been the case. Certain of these demands are identified and some specific suggestions are made as to how a science educator might deal with the science/religion issue. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - A wide range of biotechnological and biomedical processes and products involves the design, synthesis, and analysis of biological interfaces. Such biointerfaces mediate interactions between living cells or intracellular species and designed materials or biologics. Incorporating the experiences of a NSF-­sponsored IGERT (Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship) program at Rutgers University (www.igert.rutgers.edu), this paper reviews the foundations and implementation of a graduate curriculum focused on biointerfaces. The curriculum is designed to build laterally beyond the current core curriculum of graduate engineering programs in chemical and biomolecular engineering or bioengineering, while accommodating cross-disciplinary graduate students from allied engineering programs as well as physical sciences and life sciences. The biointerfacial curriculum comprises three core courses: (1) Integrative Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, (2) Microscale and Nanoscale Biointerfacial Systems, and (3) Biointerfacial Characterization. By virtue of integrating principles based on phenomena that span multiple scales, compositions/components, and biological properties, this curriculum could impact graduate educational opportunities for researchers studying biomaterials, biomolecular science and engineering, tissue engineering, and nano­- and microsystems bioengineering.

AB  - Coherent curricula are needed to help students develop deep understanding of important ideas in science. Too often students experience curriculum that is piecemeal and lacks coordination and consistency across time, topics, and disciplines. Investigating and Questioning our World through Science and Technology (IQWST) is a middle school science curriculum project that attempts to address these problems. IQWST units are built on 5 key aspects of coherence: (1) learning goal coherence; (2) intraunit coherence between content learning goals, scientific practices, and curricular activities; (3) interunit coherence supporting multidisciplinary connections and dependencies; (4) coherence between professional development and curriculum materials to support classroom enactment; and (5) coherence between science literacy expectations and general literacy skills. Dealing with these aspects of coherence involves trade-offs and challenges. This article illustrates some of the challenges related to the first 3 aspects of coherence and the way we have chosen to deal with them. Preliminary results regarding the effectiveness of IQWST's approach to these challenges are presented. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - The use of computer software to facilitate learning in political science courses is well established. However, the statistical software packages used in many political science courses can be difficult to use and counter-intuitive. We describe the results of a preliminary user study suggesting that visually-oriented analysis software can help students query a political data set faster and more accurately than by using traditional non-visual software tools. We hope that our experience will encourage future collaboration between educators in computing and in other academic disciplines.

AB  - Recently, the author found himself going through some old documents and he came upon a mimeographed volume: "The Conference on Creativity: A Report the Rockefeller Foundation," edited by Manuel Barkan and Ross L. Mooney, The Ohio State University, 1953. It is over 55 years since this conference and although some references related to this gathering can be found in the art education literature, for the most part the papers included in this report have gone unnoticed. This article talks about the groundbreaking interdisciplinary conference at The Ohio State University which set a new direction for examining creativity's impact on the arts, human behavior, and the social sciences. The author discusses three major directions for an understanding of creativity which were identified as (1) social; (2) behavioral; and (3) conceptual fields.

AB  - We will present a case study result from a cross-disciplinary education called Medialogy, which is taught in the Technical and Science Faculty at Aalborg University. The aim of Medialogy is to facilitate creativity within technical solutions. The intention of this paper is to answer the following: how do the Medialogy teachers perceive creativity and how do they facilitate it? Many of the answers point to the pedagogical approach used in problem-based learning, which are perceived as an important element for the creative process. In this paper we will also argue the importance of including the social context (both at a macro and at a micro level) in the definition and use of creativity in engineering education.

AB  - This study examines the use of narrative and paradigmatic modes of explanation in large group discussions about science in preschool classrooms. Participants comprised students and teachers in 29 preschool classrooms, 19 of which used the ScienceStart! curriculum, a hands-on, inquiry approach to teaching science with young children. Analyses of videotaped large group activities address two major research questions: (a) Does the use of a structured preschool science curriculum promote the use of paradigmatic explanations around science topics?, and (b) Where the narrative and paradigmatic modes are present, how are students socialized to understand and appropriately use these modes in science discourse? Results indicate that students in the science curriculum classrooms were exposed to a higher frequency of paradigmatic explanations than those in the comparison group. Children in this group also produced a higher relative frequency of paradigmatic explanations. Results of qualitative analysis reveal ways in which teachers socialized children to mix the narrative and paradigmatic modes, linking general principles with experienced events. Discussion of findings suggests that teaching scientific thinking with young children should involve a dialogue between abstract and experiential ways of thinking.

AB  - In this paper, the authors argue that chemical knowledge in the classroom will be enriched by the application of characterizations of models drawn from a range of disciplinary backgrounds. This discussion highlights two important issues relating to chemical knowledge in the classroom: (1) the status of chemical knowledge in the classroom, particularly in the  context of models; and (2) chemistry learners' engagement in the modelling of the structure and function of matter, which is a central feature of chemistry. This discussion draws on evidence from several bodies of literature. First, the authors review the literature on the applications of history and philosophy of science in science education. This review illustrates the broader context for the study of chemical knowledge for educational purposes and highlights the weaknesses in the literature in respect of philosophical considerations of chemical knowledge in general. Second, they examine the role of models and modelling in philosophy of science, cognitive psychology, chemistry and chemistry education, and the  interdisciplinary characterisations that provide a context for the reconceptualization of the nature of chemical knowledge in the classroom. The interdisciplinary approach includes perspectives on philosophical accounts of models that begin to address a significant aspect of the nature of chemical knowledge. The discussion concludes with some implications for theory of learning, curriculum design, and teacher education. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - Art and science are intrinsically linked; the essence of art and science is discovery. Both artists and scientists work in a systematic but creative way--knowledge and understanding are built up through pieces of art or a series of labs. In the classroom, integrating science and visual art can provide students with the latitude to think, discover, and make connections. Located in Washington, DC, The Lab School of Washington is a school for grades 1-12 who have students with language-based learning disabilities. In the reading, writing and math classes of the junior high school, students are grouped by their skill levels. In the science classes, the students represent many different skill levels. There are many ways to employ visual art in the science classroom. Art-based activities can help students comprehend abstract scientific theories and improve their critical thinking skills. This article offers examples of art-based projects which can be done in science classes.

AB  - The diversity and interdisciplinarity of computer science and the multiplicity of its uses in other sciences make it hard to define computer science and to prescribe how computer science should be carried out. The diversity of computer science also causes friction between computer scientists from different branches. Computer science curricula, as they stand, have been criticized for being unable to offer computer scientists proper methodological training or a deep understanding of different research traditions. At the Department of Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Joensuu we decided to include in our curriculum a course that offers our students an awareness of epistemological and methodological issues in computer science, and we wanted to design the course to be meaningful for practicing computer scientists. In this article the needs and aims of our course on the philosophy of computer science are discussed, and the structure and arrangements--the whys, whats, and hows--of that course are explained. The course, which is given entirely on-line, was designed for advanced graduate or postgraduate computer science students from two Finnish universities: the University of Joensuu and the University of Kuopio. The course has four relatively broad themes, and all those themes are tied to the students' everyday work or their own research topics. I have prepared course readings about each of those four themes. The course readings describe, in a compact and simple form, the cruces of the topics that are discussed in the course. The electronic version of the course readings includes hyperlinks to a large number of articles that are available on-line. The course readings are publicly available on the course home page, and they are licensed under the creative commons license. The first theme in the course is centered around a fundamental question--What is computer science? Students are introduced to the disciplinary history of computer science, to a number of characterizations of computer science made by the pioneers of the discipline, and to some methodological and epistemological viewpoints on computer science. The second theme is centered around the question--What is science? Students are introduced to, for instance, the concepts of pure and applied science, "hard" and "soft" sciences, the aims of science, the scientific method, scientific reasoning, the formation of scientific concepts and theories, and the Science Wars. The third theme concerns the division of computer science into its theoretical, engineering, and empirical traditions. The lecture notes introduce the students to descriptions of computer science that emphasize the mathematical tradition over other traditions and to descriptions that emphasize engineering or empirical traditions. The fourth theme is the philosophy of science. Throughout the course terminology of the philosophy of science is used, and the students are introduced to a number of central issues in the philosophy of science, to some of the most notable schools in the philosophy of science, and to some critical views of science. This course is aimed at providing a broad understanding of the different traditions of computer science, of the methodological differences between the branches of computer science, of the strengths and limitations of the different traditions in computer science, and of how the philosophy of science can be of help to computer scientists. In the course, critical reading and well-argumented writing are encouraged. The students learn that there are many problems that do not have clear-cut answers; they learn that there are many open problems where multiple incompatible, yet credible viewpoints can be defended. The students also learn to articulate their own positions, to defend those positions, to comment and criticize other positions, and to reflect and rethink their positions according to criticism. The students also get the chance to think about the intellectual foundations of their own work and their own research studies. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - Science teachers' competencies are analyzed in this paper. The importance of teachers' competencies is underlined and also the importance of competencies in so called "good practices" obtaining, is studied. The definition of science teachers competencies and their taxonomy are very important in understanding the educational reform in European context. The recent literature and many reforms in the field of science teacher education suggest that teacher preparation has a "threefold structure" with the anchoring pillars being Subject Matter Knowledge (SMK), Pedagogical Knowledge (PK) and Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK). Science education programs should pay more attention into the learning of science in social and technological context. The reform in the educational field has to pay a special attention on science teachers' competencies.

AB  - Stimulated by social scientists' and especially social psychologists' contributions during World War II, as well as by America's post-war economic and population growth, the period from 1945 to 1970 was widely viewed as a "Golden Age" for American social science. Interdisciplinary social psychology arguably was in the vanguard of these developments. Progress since then have been variable and in some ways negative for social psychology, not only as an interdisciplinary field, but also within its parent disciplines of psychology and especially sociology, where social psychology could plausibly become extinct within twenty-five years. The decline of social psychology as a field and a broad influence on the social sciences, society, and public policy has coincided with a rise of economics to an analogous vanguard position. Understanding the reasons for and implications of these trends has been limited, with a focus on analyses of developments within particular disciplines. However, developments across the social sciences, and society more broadly, are equally or more important to understanding these trends. Future prospects also depend heavily on these broader societal forces, but the inertial tendencies of trajectories since 1970 within and between social science disciplines and fields will necessarily play a major role. The twenty-first century offers the prospect of renewed importance of social psychology in a more interdisciplinary and integrated set of social and policy sciences, if social psychologists and the parent disciplines of sociology and psychology are prepared to capitalize on and take leadership of emerging opportunities.

AB  - Public and professional concern about health care quality, safety and efficiency is growing. Continuing education, knowledge translation, patient safety and quality improvement have made concerted efforts to address these issues. However, a coordinated and integrated effort across these domains is lacking. This article explores and discusses the similarities and differences amongst the four domains in relation to their missions, stakeholders, methods, and limitations. This paper highlights the potential for a more integrated and collaborative partnership to promote networking and information sharing amongst the four domains. This potential rests on the premise that an integrated approach may result in the development and implementation of more holistic and effective interdisciplinary interventions. In conclusion, an outline of current research that is informed by the preliminary findings in this paper is also briefly discussed. The research concerns a comprehensive mapping of the relationships between the domains to gain an understanding of potential dissonances between how the domains represent themselves, their work and the work of their "partner" domains.

AB  - At the start of an integrated Algebra I and Environmental Science class, students were presented with the following challenge: "How much carbon is stored in the Normanskill Preserve?" They were told they had one month to investigate and present their results, and asked, "What do you need to begin?" This hook served to introduce the next project in the author's 100% project-based curriculum. It addresses both the New York State Learning Standards and the National Science Education Standards. This article describes the project in more detail and what students learned along the way. (Contains 1 figure and 7 online resources.)

AB  - Cross-curricularity, literacy and critical literacy are currently promoted as components of a curriculum appropriate for the twenty-first century. The first two, in particular, are prescribed elements of classroom experience in Northern Ireland, which is the immediate context of this article, but also more widely in the UK. Teachers are implementing cross-curricular and interdisciplinary initiatives, but rhetorical imperatives can translate into superficial realities. The reasons for this are explored, as are the reasons why interdisciplinary studies, literacy across the curriculum and critical literacy are deemed to be of significance for education at the present time. The "Making Science: Making News" project is described, in which Key Stage 3 science and English classes worked together, with input from a research scientist and a journalist, to produce articles on space science which were published in local newspapers. The outcomes of the project are discussed from the perspectives of both teachers and learners. It is argued that this project is an example of genuine interdisciplinary activity; that it went beyond literacy skills to a deeper development of scientific discourse; and that, through its media connection, there was potential for building an ongoing awareness in pupils of critical literacy and scientific literacy.

AB  - Recent research in fields as diverse as educational philosophy and psychology, as well as in the neurobiological sciences, has underlined the need to reassess many of the assumptions that underpin the role of the school, the teacher and education in general. The work of the philosophers such as Carr and Kristjansson could be interpreted as important re-statements of the moral pragmatism of Dewey (1930), himself reliant on Aristotle (Pagan, 2008; Pamental, 2010) in arguing for the inherent moral basis of education. Their renewed interest in Aristotle is to be found amidst a rekindled interest by philosophy in the interaction between reason and emotion and the consequent need for the education of those emotions. This article explores the research findings of values pedagogy, both Australian and international, and makes application to the need to re-conceive many of the assumptions and foundational theories that underpin teacher education, based on the new insights into learning, human development and student well-being that have resulted from these research findings.

AB  - In an attempt to move, if not balance, the scales of activity toward increasing scientific capability across a diverse national population, U.S. federal funding agencies are purposefully linking research funding to broad national impact. Among United States federal agencies, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has led the way in the integration of research, teaching, and learning. Since 1997, the NSF's proposal review process has had two major criteria: intellectual merit and broader impacts. Centers such as the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL) view the NSF broader-impacts criterion as an opportunity to develop capacity for effectively integrating research, teaching, and learning. CIRTL (www.cirtlcafe.net) is an NSF Center for Learning and Teaching. The CIRTL Network comprises six research universities: Howard University, Michigan State University, Texas A&M University, the University of Colorado at Boulder, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Vanderbilt University. This national network is developing model professional-development programs in teaching and learning for graduate students, post-doctoral scholars, and faculty in the STEM disciplines. The prototype CIRTL program was implemented at the University of Wisconsin-Madison as the Delta Program in Research, Teaching and Learning (www.delta.wisc.edu). The Delta Program is a curriculum of graduate courses, intergenerational small-group programs, and internships embedded within an interdisciplinary learning community. In this article, the authors describe the approach the Delta Program takes to help STEM researchers develop, implement, and evaluate broader-impacts initiatives. (Contains 1 table and 5 resources.)

AB  - "Dolphin Tale" is a movie about a dolphin that loses its tail after being entangled in a crab trap line and obtains a prosthetic tail. The movie was presented to support environmental education classes at the University of Brasilia. Over a period of five years, 210 Brazilian undergraduate and graduate students answered questionnaires after watching it. The results demonstrate that the movie helped to accomplish environmental education goals: the comprehension of the role of scientific knowledge in solving socio-environmental problems, the impact of human activities on biodiversity, the novelty of the integrative interplay of different disciplines, and the importance of values in awareness.

AB  - It can be a challenge to introduce students to a world region with the cultural diversity and rich history of Latin America. In this article, the author suggests four thematic units that enable teachers to identify both general trends and important differences in the region: (1) race/ethnicity; (2) progress and civilization; (3) conflict and violence; and (4) migrations. She recommends readings, music, or art that can assist with lessons based on each of these themes. (Contains 19 notes.)
