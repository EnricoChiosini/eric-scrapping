AB  - The challenge of better reconciling individual and collective aspects of innovative problem-solving can be productively addressed to enhance the role of PBL as a key focus of the creative process in future higher education. This should involve "active learning" approaches supported by related processes of teaching, assessment and curriculum. As Biggs & Tan (2011) have suggested, an integrated or systemic approach is needed for the most effective practice of outcomes-based education also especially relevant for addressing relatively simple as well as more complex problems. Such a model will be discussed in relation to the practical example of a Masters subject conceived with interdisciplinary implications, applications, and transferability: "sustainable policy studies in science, technology and innovation". Different modes of PBL might be encouraged in terms of the authentic kinds of "complex problem-solving" issues and challenges which increasingly confront an interdependent and changing world. PBL can be further optimized when projects or cases also involve contexts and examples of research and inquiry. However, perhaps the most crucial pillar is a model of portfolio assessment for linking and encouraging as well as distinguishing individual contributions to collaborative projects and activities.

AB  - To meet the research, teaching, and learning needs of their users, academic librarians, particularly those functioning as subject liaisons, are expected to know the institution's curriculum and research areas so that they can help shape library strategies to meet those needs and to connect users to the library's resources and services. The present study investigated the use of Refinitiv's free web demo, Open Calais, as a text mining tool to help learn about the research areas in the University of Tennessee's Tickle College of Engineering. We investigated the following research questions: What interdisciplinary research areas in the College does Open Calais reveal? What are the differences in Open Calais' tagging of Scopus and web pages? What terms were uncovered by Open Calais that were unexpected by the subject librarian? The results showed a mixed picture of the usefulness of Open Calais for learning the research areas of the College of Engineering.

AB  - This theoretical paper explores the need for enhanced, intersectional computing identity theory for the purpose of developing a diverse group of computer scientists for the future. Greater theoretical understanding of the identity formation process specifically for computing is needed in order to understand how students come to understand themselves as computer scientists. To ensure that the next generation of computer scientists is diverse, this paper presents a case for examining identity development intersectionally, understanding the ways in which women and underrepresented students may have difficulty identifying as computer scientists and be systematically oppressed in their pursuit of computer science careers. Through a review of the available scholarship, this paper suggests that creating greater theoretical understanding of the computing identity development process will inform the way in which educational stakeholders consider computer science practices and policies.

AB  - The importance of reducing the gender gap in engineering programs by recruiting and retaining female students is well recognized. Although women hold roughly half of all jobs in the United States, only 24% of STEM jobs are occupied by women. The problem is even more pronounced for engineering, where women held about 12% of jobs as of 2013 (Corbett & Hill, 2015). Consequently, interactive, hands-on outreach programs are a common tool used by universities to encourage interest in engineering from K-12 students. Engineering--Get Into Real Learning (E-GIRL) is a week-long, residential summer program offered by Texas Tech University for female high school students. The primary goal of the program is to help participants make informed decisions about engineering majors and careers. To this aim, the purposes of the program are: (1) to offer a platform for female high school students to learn about the various disciplines of engineering offered at Texas Tech University and other universities; (2) to provide a realistic university experience, including coursework, social, and professional development opportunities; and (3) to provide hands-on exposure to a real-world engineering problem. E-GIRL ran for the second time in the summer of 2016, based on the favorable support it received in 2015. Primary components of this year's program were a multidisciplinary group project focused on the theme of CO2 capture and storage, as well as a series of two-hour classes taught by university faculty and graduate students in the following six engineering disciplines: chemical engineering, civil engineering, environmental engineering, industrial engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science. This paper presents the multidisciplinary structure of the program and its connection to the project that was assigned to program participants. The curriculum structure, the in-class activities, and the method of delivery for each discipline are explained in depth. The assessment of the program's second year, including comparisons to the results from the first year and modifications to the program based on feedback from previous program participants, are discussed. Assessment was conducted through engineering skills assessment questionnaires, which required students to self-evaluate their competence in 18 skill sets before and after the program. These skill sets are qualities often identified to be important for engineers, and encompass traits associated with problem solving, project management, teamwork, and communication skills. Key results show improved self-assessment for most of the engineering skills after the program. Additionally, the skills that did not show improved self-assessment ratings after the program were consistent throughout both years. Qualitative results show a more matured and complete understanding of engineering and the individual engineering disciplines upon completion of the program. Through oral presentations, participants demonstrated in-depth engagement with the environmental conservation theme of the project. The environmental conservation theme is consistent with the participants' aspirations for considering an engineering career and championing sustainability, which was highlighted by program participants in 2015 as a desired additional focus of the program. Overall, the program provided an opportunity for participants to experience the multidisciplinary nature of engineering, aided participants' understanding of the roles of individual engineering disciplines, and furnished a realistic preview of student life in a university.

AB  - This paper describes a one-year introductory robotics course sequence focusing on computational aspects of robotics for third- and fourth-year students. The key challenges this curriculum addresses are "scalability," i.e., how to teach a robotics class with a limited amount of hardware to a large audience, "student assessment," i.e., how to assess the students' success on robotic design and programming assignments, and "depth versus breadth," i.e., how to down-select content from the interdisciplinary field of robotics to computer science students. This is achieved by combining simulation-based laboratory assignments, which can be conducted anywhere and anytime, with compatible hardware devices that allow a seamless transition from simulation to real hardware, and a focus on performance-based assessment with an open-ended final project/competition. Content learning and retention is assessed for a subset of students who successfully went through the proposed curriculum. All class materials as well as hardware-in particular, a low-cost, highly articulated robotic arm developed for teaching advanced robotics concepts-are open-source and available online.

AB  - Honors education at Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences (RUAS) focuses on students who are willing to invest more in their study than the average student. Selection criteria are the students' willingness to develop beyond what is offered in the regular curriculum and are not based on previous accomplishments. The additional challenge of the honors program lies in its multidisciplinary teamwork. Students say that the program teaches them to appreciate different perspectives on issues and to integrate these with their own perspectives (Lappia, Weerheijm, Pilot, and Van Eijl). Honors students are stimulated to get the best out of themselves and to develop themselves as junior innovative professionals. The desired learning outcomes of the RUAS honors programs are five competencies included in their profile, "Learning to Innovate," which describe an excellent professional as one who can: (1) focus on innovation (innovation-driven); (2) focus on the context in which (s)he works (demand-driven); (3) work closely with important disciplines in this context (cooperatively multidisciplinary); (4) arrive jointly at a solution to an issue, provide arguments in favor of the solution, and share ideas (co-creative in knowledge generation); and (5) manage his or her own development (capable of interactive learning). These competencies focus on the student's individual development as an innovative professional and provide emphasis on the student's intended profession. This article provides a first-hand perspective from Boo Van Der Vlist, offering one student's views on her honors experience and demonstrating how the RUAS program is on the right path.

AB  - Nearly 10% of American students are identified as "Limited English Proficient" (NCELA 2011). To serve this diverse population of English Language Learners (ELLs), teachers need proven instructional strategies. One prevalent approach is sheltered instruction, defined as "teaching content to English learners in strategic ways that make the subject matter concepts comprehensible while promoting the students' English language development" (Echevarria, Vogt, and Short 2008, p. 5). With sheltered instruction, ELL students can develop their language skills in a regular classroom setting while learning standard subject content along with everyone else. For example, in a science class using sheltered instruction, ELL students are interspersed with native English speakers and are expected to learn science content as well as hone their English language comprehension. This parallel path of learning does not occur automatically: teachers must plan and teach to promote both avenues of education. Yet adding language instruction to a science class does not necessarily require a massive overhaul in teaching methods, either. This article addresses how science inquiry and sheltered instruction strategies can work together.

AB  - In this article, the authors discuss how they redesigned an educational psychology course for preservice teachers using insights from the burgeoning, interdisciplinary field of the Learning Sciences. Research on the situated nature of learning and the value of out-of-school contexts for supporting children s development informed their decisions to require preservice teachers to work with children in community-based settings, frame their interactions with children as "service" rather than as explicit preparation for teaching, and conduct research on the social, cultural, and cognitive nature of these experiences. Two case studies illuminate preservice teachers' learning trajectories in relation to course practices. Analyses suggest that the course created opportunities for preservice teachers to develop views of learning as inherently cultural and not limited to the acquisition of academic content. Emerging findings point to the potential of using Learning Sciences research as a touchstone for reorganizing educational psychology courses for preservice teachers. (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - Due to the increased interest in ecology, global warming and numerous environmental problems, ecological issues are becoming extremely important in education. Many researchers and thinkers believe that solutions to environmental problems are affected by the environmental ethics adopted. This article identifies which of the three branches of environmental ethics (anthropocentric, biocentric and holistic ethics) are present in formal environmental education in Poland. This has been achieved by analysing the content of textbooks used by science teachers in the fourth grade of elementary schools (Stage II of education). The results show that (moderate) anthropocentric ethics is dominant in the content of formal environmental education, while biocentric ethics is less frequent and there is also some focus on holistic ethics and the declaration that man is part of nature.

AB  - Rural schools are in a precarious time currently facing funding issues, decreasing resources, dwindling populations, and difficulties hiring candidates for existing vacancies. As a result, a Midwestern university's College of Education sought to help alleviate some of those issues by exposing its pre-service teachers to the benefits of teaching in the college's extensive rural footprint, while emphasizing a connection between school and community. Rural Arts Day (RAD) was designed to address the critical issues facing rural schools by making pre-service teachers more aware of what rural schools can offer, through an alternative field experience in a K-12 school building. With positive results, this pilot project has become the impetus for an ongoing program to be implemented on a regular basis at sites across the state. This university/school partnership, while integrating music, writing and painting across STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) topics, focuses on school and community spirit, with an overall message of the value of teaching in a rural school.

AB  - Partnership is not a new phenomenon in the university environment. It embraces strategies used by people with common interest to harvest knowledge in terms of sharing or collaboration. However, the case differs with collaborations in Library and Information Science (LIS) research in Africa, especially LIS scholars in African universities in Nigeria and Zimbabwe. Paucity of empirical literature is available on research collaboration among LIS scholars in Nigerian and Zimbabwean universities. The purpose of the study was to examine partnership among librarians, with reflection on observation and interview research reports in three universities in Nigeria and Zimbabwe. The study adopted a qualitative approach using interview to gather data from librarians drawn from three Nigerian and Zimbabwean universities. The qualitative research approach grounded on content analysis of documents/literature, observation and interview method was use for the study. The observation focus on the authors' exposition in the sampled universities environment, while the interview were key informants from each of the three countries universities sampled. The study consider the collaborative theory through grounded method. The findings of the study revealed lack of trust in the individual or groups collaborator; team members have the feeling that the project they are collaborating on is of little benefit, due to poor relationship. Team members see themselves as contender or challenger; which has affected leadership issue and involvement of long meetings and inability to address the truth. In terms of the influence of collaboration on professional growth of librarians, result demonstrated enhancement of teaching aspect of librarianship, learning and research quality; promote cooperation, coordination, which in turn increased level of intensity, tenacity and interaction among members. Linkage among LIS professional ranges from networking, cooperation, alliances, coordination and partnership, coalition and eventually collaboration. Challenges reported include catastrophic consequent on negative effect of work, culture and stylistic parameters including concept, attitude and professional hindrances. dominance impact of policies and procedures of collaboration, exploitation of the weak members, lack of clarity and rationale behind the collaboration, unwillingness to change by members in collaboration, lack of socialisation, largeness of the group, wrong membership and jettisoning of members ideas which eventually make some members take the decision of quitting the team. The study recommends inter-disciplinary, intra-institutional and inter-institutional collaboration among various stakeholders in LIS education and training.

AB  - An uncertain world characterised by the complexity associated with 'Wicked' problems presents formidable challenges for the preparation of teachers. This paper reports on one cycle in a larger action research project in which subject specialist trainee teachers worked in inter-disciplinary groups to design and run classroom-based workshops on climate change for pupils aged 12-14. While the project sought to explore interdisciplinary working, subject specialisms and their values were not abandoned, recognising that diversity can lead to more powerful, collective knowledge being generated. The Wicked problem of climate change was initially examined from different subject perspectives, identifying the opportunities that the work afforded in each subject, along with the challenges that accompanied them. The findings suggest that trainee teachers valued the collaboration and the opportunity to develop different pedagogical approaches used by different subjects. The framing of the project around a Wicked problem supported trainee teachers in understanding that no one subject had an authoritative prerogative over the topic while the disquiet that the interdisciplinary project provoked, in some cases, served to instigate new transformative learning which stretched beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries.

AB  - This study, based on case study analyses of two interdisciplinary programmes in a research-intensive university in the UK, focuses on the challenges involved in designing, coordinating, and leading interdisciplinary postgraduate curricula, including workload, student heterogeneity, and difficulties in achieving coherence. Solutions and approaches developed within these case study programmes are also highlighted. This study raises awareness of the complex nature of interdisciplinary curricula so that it may help academics proactively develop better strategies and approaches to address common challenges. It also synthesises disparate literature into a framework for investigating curricular coherence.

AB  - Social work as a human services profession has been distinctive for its inclusion of research as a required element of practice and instrument in instigating reform. At the present time, the relationship of social work to science and a redefinition of social work as a science have reentered our national dialogue with new force. This expansion of perspective has, however, failed to explicitly attend to a closely related intellectual and practical domain, the world of social innovation. Innovation as an end itself, a synonym for progress, has largely been owned by the professions of business, engineering, and the biosciences. This essay presents a discussion of how social work may engage with social innovation and the tensions inherent to such an engagement. A place for social innovation within the recognized domains of scientific investigation and social work is essential. Social work would make a unique contribution to the enhancement of this conception through the weight given to values, social purpose, and context that is endemic to the social work perspective. The result of combining science and social innovation perspectives in the same academic home might be a flowering of new social configurations, networks, organizations, and relationships disciplined by repeated appraisals through the scientific method.

AB  - Professional Development in the field of education has undergone several shifts in focus. Currently, teacher content knowledge and the ability to disseminate this knowledge is the focus in professional learning communities. The importance of creating a thriving STEM workforce in the United States has been promoted for the last decade. Studies have shown that capturing students' interest must occur before they enter high school, ideally in the middle school years (Blotnicky, Franz-Odendaal, French, & Phillip, 2018). Teachers are the conduits for encouraging students to explore STEM-related career options. Student engagement is piqued when there is a strong real-world connection to the content being presented. Students find relevance through actual experience with the concepts and skills incorporated in projects that are community-based. The Curriculum and Community Enterprise for Restoration Science STEM + C Project is the marriage of these two components. The professional development of the New York City middle school teachers involved in the CCERS STEM +C Project furnishes these educators with the tools to stimulate students' interest by tackling a problem in their local community using STEM-related content and computational thinking. The hope is that authenticity of the learning experience will entice all students, especially those under-represented populations in the STEM workforce, to consider this as a viable career pathway. The analysis of this project is intended to highlight the significant inroads made and the value of self-reflection and re-design in strengthening the work as it continues.

AB  - The article discusses the importance of introducing training programs for preschool children that allow them to master basic knowledge in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM subjects) as an academic basis for the technological transition that is currently taking place in the modern world. It is shown that when preschool students study STEM subjects, it gives them a great advantage later in elementary, middle, and high school. As a result of our investigation of STEM subjects for preschoolers and the gender considerations that should be incorporated into successful teaching strategies, we have concluded that together with the preparation and institutionalization of such training programs it is necessary to teach the designers of educational programs as well as educators about the specific features that characterize how boys and girls learn. A curriculum that takes gender differences into account is one that does not allow the development of a gender dichotomy in education. Rather, it should ensure that both boys and girls have equal motivation and a positive attitude about STEM subjects. [This article was translated by Kenneth Cargill.]

AB  - Research evidence for the benefits of arts integration is mounting. The purpose of this study was to determine if integration of the arts was an effective strategy for teaching the water cycle to kindergarten students. The study included lessons that supported both a science and an engineering standard of the Next Generation Science Standards and national arts standards. The phenomenological study examined the lived experiences of children as they learned and demonstrated understanding through drawings, watercolor paintings, dramatization of a water cycle poem, and the invention and testing of a waterproof boot. Participants were 12 kindergarten students (7 male, 5 female) aged 5-6 years, attending a public elementary school in the Midwestern United States. The three major themes that emerged from the phenomenological study were: 1) aspects of typical lessons, 2) art-enhanced learning, and 3) art-enhanced teacher understanding of student ideas. Findings revealed arts integration was motivating, engaging for the students, and an effective strategy for teaching about the water cycle. The art-based activities provided deeper insights about student understanding and misconceptions than traditional forms of assessment.

AB  - The well-being of modern economies and societies is increasingly requiring citizens to possess capabilities in integrating knowledge and skills in science, technology, engineering and science to solve problems. However, by the end of schooling, the majority of Australian students show little interest in these discipline areas and have no plans to continue study or work in them; many refer to these disciplines as boring. Further, they typically have little experience in integrating knowledge and skills from these disciplines and/or in applying this to solve relevant problems. Therefore, there is a need to engage students with such learning experiences to develop their interest and capabilities, particularly during the early years of secondary schooling. This is not easy for teachers to respond to, but with the support of modern digital technologies and the new Australian curriculum, the potential is expanded and the challenge is more readily achievable. However, appropriate pedagogies need to be supported that include more authentic approaches to assessment. Learning activities need to support students to integrate knowledge and skills across discipline areas in tackling real problems, and this also needs to be reflected in how students are assessed. In this paper, I will draw on personal experience as a teacher, a review of recent literature, components of the Australian Curriculum, and findings from research projects associated with my University research centre, to argue for, and illustrate how, teachers can orchestrate powerful learning activities to promote an interdisciplinary approach to STEM.

AB  - A laboratory course on the theory, fabrication, and characterization of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices for a multidisciplinary audience of graduate students at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, has been developed. Hands-on experience in the cleanroom has attracted graduate students from across the university's engineering and science campuses, including students from the Nano-Science and Micro Systems program, itself an interdisciplinary program. This course has been offered yearly for the last four years (since 2007) at the University of New Mexico. In one project from the class, a MEMS actuator is fabricated. This paper details the theory, fabrication steps, and characterization of a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) comb drive actuator that relies on fixed-fixed beams for its restoring force. Discussions include force generation by comb drives and a linear and nonlinear description of the restoring force applied by the fixed-fixed beams. Course assessment data is given from 79 students from three semesters, based on which the effectiveness of the laboratory project is evaluated. (Contains 4 tables and 11 figures.)

AB  - This article describes one aspect of an 2 year inquiry project (August 2016-July 2018) which brought together 18 experienced teachers from four Christchurch secondary schools as well as teachers in the University of Canterbury's transition programme (Student Transitions and Engagement) to collaborate and share ideas about discipline-specific literacy as a means of preparing students for successful tertiary transitions. The teachers came from a range of disciplines including mathematics, social sciences, art, PE/health, the sciences, English, and English language learning. Although the project showed improved transition outcomes for students and changes to teacher practice, this article's focus is limited to the gains in teacher knowledge and changes in teacher practice.

AB  - Combining the interdisciplinary studies (primarily humanities) literature with the content analysis of 129 successful National Science Foundation proposals written predominantly by science and engineering faculty members, the authors identify five categories of learning outcomes for interdisciplinary graduate education: disciplinary grounding, integration, teamwork, communication, and critical awareness. They identify important parallels between humanities-based descriptions of interdisciplinary integration and implicit graduate learning outcomes hinted at by engineering and science faculty who more frequently work in teams. Applying the lens of interdisciplinary studies (humanities) to science and engineering provides important depth and focus to engineering and science interdisciplinary learning outcomes, particularly in detailing integration processes.

AB  - In this article, we analyse how and if participation affects the learning experiences of pupils. Our research questions are: (1) What constituted positive learning experiences for pupils in a multidisciplinary learning module? (2) How do the methods used in this study give pupils an opportunity to express negative emotions and participate in developing learning experiences?. The data of this practitioner research consists of 80 photographs, 23 picture books and 23 interviews. The positive experiences of the project were social interaction, autonomy of peer groups and sense of capability and competence which relate to social participation. The picture book-interview method revealed pupils' negative experiences that related to learning how to work in a group and perform the tasks at hand.

AB  - The development of experiential learning methodologies is gaining attention, due to its contributions to enhancing education quality. It focuses on developing competencies, and build-up added values, such as creative and critical thinking skills, with the aim of improving the quality of learning. The interdisciplinary mechatronics field accommodates a coherent interactive concurrent design process that facilitates innovation and develops the desired skills by adopting experiential learning approaches. This educational learning process is motivated by implementation, assessment, and reflections. This requires synergizing cognition, perception, and behavior with experience sharing and evaluation. Furthermore, it is supported by knowledge accumulation. The learning process with active student's engagement (participation and investigation) is integrated with experimental systems that are developed to facilitate experiential learning supported by properly designed lectures, laboratory experiments, and integrated with course projects. This paper aims to enhance education, learning quality, and contribute to the learning process, while stimulating creative and critical thinking skills. The paper has adopted a student-centered learning approach and focuses on developing training tools to improve the hands-on experience and integrate it with project-based learning. The developed experimental systems have their learning indicators where students acquire knowledge and learn the target skills through involvement in the process. This is inspired by collaborative knowledge sharing, brainstorming, and interactive discussions. The learning outcomes from lectures and laboratory experiments are synergized with the project-based learning approach to yield the desired promising results and exhibit the value of learning. The effectiveness of the developed experimental systems along with the adopted project-based learning approach is demonstrated and evaluated during laboratory sessions supporting different courses at Sanyo-Onoda City University, Yamaguchi, Japan, and at the American University in Cairo.

AB  - This paper describes the further development of the "Epidemiology of Eyam" project at Winchester College since the publication of our previous paper (French "et al" 2019 Phys. Educ. 54 045008). A much wider cadre of students have been involved with this recent phase of the study, and we have also benefitted from a sabbatical collaboration with Oxford University Mathematical Institute. It is hoped that the research presented here can be used as a case study for an Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) or equivalent in a range of schools around the UK and worldwide. We feel that a project such as this, with a strong humanities and public health rooted context, could incentivise students of mathematics and sciences to participate in interdisciplinary teams over an educationally significant period, and offer an opportunity to develop vital independent research skills that are required at University, but are often difficult to experience in a School context. The main educational goal of our previous paper was to provide an suitable context to incentivise the introduction of Calculus ideas. In this paper we assume a slightly higher level of mathematical skill, and aim to present a more comprehensive analysis of the epidemiological model that we will refer to as the 'Eyam Equations.' We describe a 'semi-analytic' solution, and make the connection to the approximation of Kermack and McKendrick (Kermack and McKendrick 1927 "Proc. R. Soc. Lond". A 115 700-21) which held sway for much of the early twentieth century. We revisit the Eyam 1660s plague data of William Mompesson, and also apply the model to Ebola data collected in Liberia during the 2014-16 epidemic in West Africa. Motivated by uncertainty in the size of the 'at-risk' Susceptible population, we re-parameterize the model in terms of alternative inputs which enable a curve-fitting mechanism to be conducted more efficiently, with a much more tightly bounded range of possible parameter values. In addition to a spreadsheet model, we have created a software application in the MATLAB environment which has dynamic tools that could potentially enable a sensible curve fit to be calculated very rapidly in response to new data. From a time series describing the Infective population of the 2014-16 Liberia Ebola epidemic, we can predict Infective I(t), Susceptible S(t) and Dead D(t) populations, calculate the associated total population size N, calculate the Kendall Susceptible threshold "?", and hence the Basic Reproduction Number R[subscript 0] = N/"?". For the Liberia Ebola data, these are: N = 2542, "?" = 1373, R[subscript 0] = 1.85. Note this suggests that out of an 'at risk' population of N = 2542, about 75% may ultimately have been infected by the Ebola virus. In the WHO Ebola Response Team report (WHO Ebola Response Roadmap Situation Report), R[subscript 0] = 1.83 plus or minus 0.11 for the 2014-16 Liberia outbreak.

AB  - Through the reading, study, and performance of "Copenhagen", a play by Michael Frayn, chemistry students see the application of nuclear chemistry content, acquire a better understanding of the continuum from scientific research to technology design, and also become aware of the many and varied interrelationships of science with history and humanity. This article describes a method to use the play in a high school chemistry classroom as a vehicle for cross-disciplinary integration of chemistry content through the context of history and the development of scientists as people. Students experience the lives of two scientists, Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, as they negotiate their academic and personal relationships surrounding
basic atomic research during the historical time period surrounding World War II and the creation of the atom bomb. In student group discussions, tangents of discourse move from the various scientists' personalities and the iterative nature of scientific research, to questions of politics, ethics, and morality in a historic context as they discuss, debate, and decide upon ways to present the play so their peers will understand and appreciate the experience.

AB  - Mechanobiology is an interdisciplinary field that aims to understand how physical forces impact biological systems. Enhancing our knowledge of mechanobiology has become increasingly important for understanding human disease and developing novel therapeutics. There is a societal need to teach diverse students principles of mechanobiology so that we may collectively expand our knowledge of this subject and apply new principles to improving human health. Toward this goal, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a hands-on, inquiry-based learning (IBL) module to teach students principles of cell--biomaterial interactions. This module was designed to be hosted in two 3-h sessions, over two consecutive days. During this time, students learned how to synthesize and mechanically test biomaterials, culture bacteria cells, and assess effects of matrix stiffness on bacteria cell proliferation. Among the 73 students who registered to participate in our IBL mechanobiology module, 40 students completed both days and participated in this study. A vast majority of the participants were considered underrepresented minority (URM) students based on race/ethnicity. Using pre/post-tests, we found that students experienced significant learning gains of 33 percentage points from completing our IBL mechanobiology module. In addition to gaining knowledge of mechanobiology, validated pre/post-surveys showed that students also experienced significant improvements in scientific literacy. Instructors may use this module as described, increase the complexity for an undergraduate classroom assignment, or make the module less complex for K-12 outreach. As presented, this IBL mechanobiology module effectively teaches diverse students principles of mechanobiology and scientific inquiry. Deploying this module, and similar IBL modules, may help advance the next generation of mechanobiologists.

AB  - The problems that we face in our ever-changing, increasingly global society are multidisciplinary, and many require the integration of multiple science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) concepts to solve them. National calls for improvement of STEM education in the United States are driving changes in policy, particularly in academic standards. Research on STEM integration in K-12 classrooms has not kept pace with the sweeping policy changes in STEM education. This study addresses the need for research to explore the translation of broad, national-level policy statements regarding STEM education and integration to state-level policies and implementation in K-12 classrooms. An interpretive multicase study design was employed to conduct an in-depth investigation of secondary STEM teachers' implementation of STEM integration in their classrooms during a yearlong professional development program. The interpretive approach was used because it provides holistic descriptions and explanations for the particular phenomenon, in this case STEM integration. The results of this study demonstrate the possibilities of policies that use state standards documents as a mechanism to integrate engineering into science standards. Our cases suggest that STEM integration can be implemented most successfully when mathematics and science teachers work together both in a single classroom (co-teaching) and in multiple classrooms (content teaching--common theme).

AB  - The Anthropocene is a geo-stratigraphic unit of the upper Earth's layers, impacted by human disturbances, but also humankind's historical record, and children's place to live on. It is an unfinished narrative. This study explores how garden and soil-related activities with kindergarten children, guided by well-informed teachers, may have the potential to overcome some gaps of understanding of complex, interrelated concepts related to the Anthropocene and regenerative gardening. Within a framework of environmental citizenship, this qualitative study uses interdisciplinary, interactive and participatory approaches to explore inquiry-based activities based on observations, conversations, photos and videos. As participants in related processes, children may gradually develop garden skills, ecological knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts. The study may empower children and their teachers to contribute actively and positively to the ongoing narrative of the Anthropocene; to a more sustainable formation of the Earth's upper layer; and to countering climate change.

AB  - Preservice teachers in six sections (n = 87) of a sequenced, methodological and process-integrated elementary mathematics/science methods course were able to reconcile an issue centered on a similar area of epistemology. Preservice teachers participated in a science inquiry lesson on biological classification and a mathematics problem-solving lesson on polyhedra. Preservice teachers were asked why it was possible to derive a mathematical formula for polyhedra and not organisms and what this implies about the similarities and differences between the epistemologies of mathematics and science. An area of epistemology known as simplicity was triangulated as "simple versus complex" emerged from the constant comparative method (28%) and "justification and simplicity" (96%) was coded with a content analysis. Implications include how methods course instructors can create other appropriate activities which incorporate and reconcile other areas of epistemology.

AB  - The low interest of the U.S. students in sciences is an ongoing issue. One approach to promote the sciences is outreach activities, often targeted at grades K-12. Yet, a limiting factor in these outreach initiatives is their long-term feasibility, especially from an economic perspective. Another challenge is how to introduce scientific information during brief periods of exposure. Furthermore, different problems may be encountered based on the geographic location of students. In populated urban communities, there are typically greater resources available than in low-density rural populations. With these challenges in mind, we describe an outreach initiative targeted to rural high school students. The workshop has been used for four years, and the network of participants is growing as interest spreads. This article can serve as a model for workshop development across various content areas. Such workshops can provide a useful recruiting tool while exposing students to the sciences. (Contains 2 tables and 1 box.)

AB  - Background: Given the continued need to educate the public on both the meteorological and engineering hazards posed by the severe winds of a tornado, an interdisciplinary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) module designed by the faculty from the Oceanography and Mechanical Engineering Departments at the United States Naval Academy (USNA) was developed to engage students ages 12 to 16 in the fields of meteorology and engineering. Interdisciplinary educational modules such as this one are becoming increasingly common components of academic outreach programs, but to our knowledge, this is one of the first to combine the fields of meteorology and engineering. While many studies have examined changes in student engagement and interest in the STEM fields as a result of participating in interdisciplinary activities such as this one, relatively fewer have focused on quantifying changes in student content knowledge. The primary purposes of this paper are to (1) describe our interdisciplinary STEM module in detail and (2) report immediate changes in students' knowledge on basic meteorological and engineering content as a result of their participation in the module. Results: Results from a quick, easy-to-administer assessment instrument given to students immediately before and after their participation in the 1-h module indicated that they learned basic content in both meteorology and engineering. Mean improvement of scores on the assessment questions was 40.2%, a change that was statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Other studies that focus on quantifying student learning may wish to lengthen the time between student participation in the module and the administration of the post-module assessment. Conclusions: Our interdisciplinary module integrated material from meteorology and engineering and was successful at promoting student learning. We recommend that other institutions consider developing similar interdisciplinary STEM activities, and we particularly encourage the development of activities that relate to current events. Finally, we recommend assessing content learning as another way to measure the success of interdisciplinary STEM activities.

AB  - With the increasing demand for STEM professionals, together with many of the current STEM professionals approaching or already gone over retiring age, there is a current shortfall which is now an urgent requirement to be addressed by Western countries as so much of activities and life in general is increasingly technology dependent. Actions that are currently being taken to address this shortfall in the UK by academic establishments, organizations and professional bodies are considered in this paper. Some of these include those actions that are directed at encouraging a better gender balance in the future as well as those involving actions to attract students to be aware of STEM from an early age to supporting women returning to the STEM profession. Parts of our research examines the learning and studying approaches adopted by some of the learners, their levels of attainment and attitude to learning to use technology and using technology to improve their learning. The paper reports on the developments and improvements from some of these initiatives and activities implemented. Some of these actions include details of competitions from primary to postgraduate students, women only training sessions, online support groups for STEM women, ranging from technical to career and social issues, and details of CAS (Computing At School) support for teachers, both face to face and online, currently with over 30,000 CAS participants. In conclusion the paper reflects on a roll out of some of these activities and potential impact on enhancing interest and uptake of STEM subjects by both the young and older learners and across diverse levels of education.

AB  - Modern level of informational technologies development allows the authors of educational courses to decrease their dependence from technical specialists and to independently develop distance-learning courses and their separate online components, which require special methodical learning. The aim of present study is to develop a distance-learning course in linguistics with regard to the specifics of the course that uses modern informational technologies. Scientific and methodic significance of the study consists in the fact that the developed online course is an innovative representation of the results of methodic and scientific research work of teachers and students. Therefore, it expands their opportunities to participate in the university's innovative activity, along with the educational and research activities. Within the presented project we plan to transfer the communicative-activity paradigm of learning into practice of distance forms of organizing students' independent work and to model a new educational product (online component of the course) on the basis of these results with consequent integration in educational process.

AB  - Centres of Excellence (CoE) have become a common research policy instrument in several OECD countries the last two decades. The CoE schemes are in general modelled on the organisational and research practices in the natural and life sciences. Compared to 'Big science', the humanities have been characterised by more individual research, flat structures, and usually less integration and coordination of research activities. In this article we ask: How does the introduction of CoEs affect the organisation of research and research practices in the humanities? By comparing Norwegian CoEs in different fields of research and studying the specific challenges of the humanities, we find that CoEs increase collaboration between different fields and make disciplinary and organisational boundaries more permeable, but so far they do not substantially alter individual collaboration patterns in the humanities CoEs. They further seem to generate more tensions in their adjacent environments compared to CoEs in other fields.

AB  - The world is overcoming an unprecedented challenge with the COVID-19 pandemic's worldwide spread. Epidemics and pandemics are part of history. The oldest records are related to the plague of Athens in 430 BC and throughout times numerous other diseases affected humankind, devastating societies. Nowadays, the global world allows rapid communication and potential spread of new pandemics. The Anthropocene epoch, in which humans significantly interfere in the Earth system, can also accelerate their emergence, forcing us to be innovative and proactive. Our enormous scientific and technological development is a huge advantage, providing us with knowledge and various tools to defeat the new incoming threats. Nevertheless, knowing the historical scientific facts is fundamental to understand the present and anticipating the future. Geoethics reflects on the values underlying behaviours and practices that interfere with the way human beings relate to the Earth system. It conceptualises an interdisciplinary approach within geosciences, history, philosophy and sociology and additionally it is closely related to sustainable development. Enhancing awareness of our role as responsible citizens and improving scientific knowledge are essential goals to achieve quality in education and the preservation of life on Earth. Historical scientific events must be harnessed to provide a more holistic and geoethical education.

AB  - Purpose: As scholars, educators and policymakers recognize the impact of partnership-based research, there is a growing need for more in-depth understanding of how to conduct this work, especially with and in diverse project teams. The purpose of this paper is to provide a critical examination of adopting a culturally disruptive approach in a research-practice partnership (RPP) that includes Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers, designers and educators who worked together to collaboratively design culturally situated experiences for sixth graders. Design/methodology/approach: Following a design-based implementation research methodology, data from design and implementation are presented as two case studies to illustrate key findings. Findings: Leveraging the frame of culturally disruptive pedagogy, key tensions, disruptions, self-discoveries and resulting pedagogical innovations are outlined. While the authors experienced multiple forms of disruptions as researchers, designers and educators, they focused on tracing two powerful cases of how culturally disruptive research directly and immediately resulted in pedagogical innovations. Together the cases illustrate a broader shift toward interdependence that the team experienced over the course of the school year. Research limitations/implications: A new frame for conducting culturally disruptive research is presented. Both the theoretical application and practical implementation of this frame demonstrate its usefulness in conceptualizing culturally situated research through cultivating an uncomfortable yet generative interdependence. Practical implications: Findings include examples and strategies for how to practically conduct multi-sector, interdisciplinary research and teaching. Scholars and educators share their stories which illustrate the practical impact of this work. Originality/value: Critical insights presented in this paper build on and contribute to the growing body of work around RPPs, community-based research and other critical partnership methods.

AB  - We describe the Science Semester, a semester-long course block that integrates three science courses and a science education methods course for elementary teacher education majors, and examine prospective elementary teachers' developing conceptions about inquiry, science teaching efficacy, and reflections on learning through inquiry. The Science Semester was designed to provide inquiry-oriented and problem-based learning experiences, opportunities to examine socially relevant issues through cross-disciplinary perspectives, and align with content found in elementary curricula and standards. By the end of the semester, prospective elementary teachers moved from naïve to intermediate understandings of inquiry and significantly increased self-efficacy for science teaching as measured on one subscore of the STEBI-B. Reflecting on the semester, prospective teachers understood and appreciated the goals of the course and the PBL format, but struggled with the open-ended and student-directed elements of the course.

AB  - Recent national media surveys point to relatively high levels of public trust in local political reporting. The problem, however, is that challenges with reporter training and experience mean that local television is not as equipped as it might be to provide quality political coverage. We assess how professional journalists and college students majoring in political science or journalism view their reporting competences. We find mixed results, including lower confidence across all groups in performing data and statistical analysis. These results drive our recommended collaboration strategies for local television newsrooms and university departments to improve training and experiential opportunities.

AB  - The importance of the topic of this study is determined by several factors: increased interest of linguists to the problem of interaction between language and culture; the need to study the onomastic units as body language. The purpose of this article is to identify the types of motivational nick names of famous American and English public figures, describing their positive and negative connotations. The leading approach to the study of this problem is multidisciplinary, which requires the use of such sciences as sociology, psychology, cultural studies, ethnography, etc. This article presents the findings of linguistic and cultural research aimed at identifying the semantic features of public nicknames as the key characters in the conceptual spheres of contemporary British and American societies. The materials of this paper may be useful in studying linguocultural language aspects, as well as for contemporary public debates about the place of nicknames in the English language.

Specifically, they use screencast videos to study the work of a dozen undergraduates who had taken first-year writing and were now enrolled in an interdisciplinary biology class. The authors argue that students were able to adapt to the writing requirements in the biology class because they implicitly understood themselves to be engaged in Carter's metagenre of "research from sources." Because students in this study had been asked to engage in that metagenre at least since high school, they believed their writing habits were established well before first-year writing, and consequently they have trouble recognizing the influence of such a course on their subsequent work. The study also revealed that students coordinated multiple texts simultaneously in order to engage in processes akin to what Howard has called "patchwriting" but also similar to the habits of professional writers. Whereas professional writers have well established networks for seeking information, the students in this study worked in relative isolation, using a few sources found haphazardly through library or Google searches. The authors suggest that instructors spend more time helping students develop effective networks of information, including experts and organizations in addition to published sources.

AB  - A liberal arts environment invites the expansion of one's understanding of himself/herself and the world by exposing him/her to multiple disciplines across the humanities and social sciences. For its part, the topic of "narrative" is intrinsically interdisciplinary and, as such, can be explored to particular advantage within a liberal arts setting. This article focuses on how one can exploit this coincidence of interdisciplinary topic and multidisciplinary environment to best assist students in developing "a good, strong story" by which to live their lives. As well, it is on how the cross-disciplinary collaborations such an environment enables can help in expanding one's understanding of narrative itself. The author will begin with narrative itself and then consider the concepts of narrative identity and narrative development, particularly the role of the liberal arts in fostering the latter. Toward the end, he will talk about the merits of the liberal arts for deepening one's appreciation of the narrative complexity of life as a whole. He will conclude with a postscript on the link among narrative, aging, and wisdom.

AB  - This article addresses multi-disciplinary writing groups in supporting writing for publication for higher degree by research candidates in the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences. Drawing on focus group discussions with postgraduate research students from the Faculty of Arts at Monash University in Australia who participated in the writing groups, it investigates the participants' perceptions of the multi-disciplinary nature of the groups and some of the benefits of sharing writing with fellow postgraduate research students from different fields of study. Discussing both the strengths and weaknesses of the multi-disciplinarity of the groups as identified by participants, the authors suggest that such groups can provide a forum for postgraduates to develop their "professional" academic identity and develop their writing beyond the context of their theses and can have some unexpected benefits to participants' sense of themselves as disciplinary proponents. The multi-disciplinary context is thus considered as providing a level playing field in which postgraduates may approach the writing process as a shared methodology, encompassing a suite of specialised but generic skills that cross-disciplinary boundaries.

AB  - Socio-scientific issues should be considered in the course of students' formal education in science as one of the ways in which science education ought to be connected to the goals of sustainable development. Approaches to education in science still perpetuate a way of thinking that is incommensurable with preparing learners to develop the understandings and skills requisite for active participation in an uncertain and complex world. In addition, uptake of science is declining worldwide, poverty is deepening, and environmental degradation is worsening. We argue herein that finding ways to link science education to issues of sustainable development could provide the basis for making science more relevant to learners, as well as better prepare learners for active participation in society. We raise the question: How can science education be more relevant, thereby enabling learners to deal with complex everyday issues and participate in decision-making oriented toward the goals of sustainable development? Drawing on experiences of interdisciplinary dialogue, we illustrate how reformulating the agenda in science education, such that it is oriented toward sustainable development, offers the basis for relevant teaching and learning vis-à-vis the engagement of learners in active learning processes.

AB  - Art and science are sometimes viewed as opposing subjects, but are united in many ways. With an increased awareness of the benefits of interdisciplinary studies in education, it is desirable to show students how different subjects impact one another. Visual arts are greatly connected to chemistry in several ways. Pigments are usually synthetically produced to conjure all the colors of the rainbow for creating many great masterpieces. However, these hues were originally derived from naturally occurring minerals and plants. Students can still paint a "green" or environmentally friendly picture, using colors obtained without synthesis. The fun procedure outlined here illustrates how red cabbage juice, along with other types of produce, can be used to prepare an inexpensive canvas that can be transformed into works of art while using acids and bases to modify the chemical structure of the anthocyanin pigment within the produce. Using this hands-on classroom activity, students will understand the benefits of using natural pigments, investigate how colors can be manipulated, make color gradients, and explore how using different media can affect an individual's artwork. Importantly, students will also develop understanding of the interconnection between science and art. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - In education, mathematics and science are often taught in a manner that lacks opportunities for students to engage in creativity, and the arts are allotted less time with fewer resources. This study focused on integrating STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) lessons with arts-themed activities to create interdisciplinary STEAM education in order to simultaneously address these two contemporary challenges. Teams of pre-service elementary teachers used multimedia production technologies to develop original STEAM lessons. Participants (n = 124) completed a total of 2,436 peer-evaluation surveys designed to measure the extent to which the STEAM lessons met specific creativity-related objectives. Participants also answered open-ended questions regarding similarities and differences between their own STEAM lessons and those of the other teams. The results showed general overall similarities among the three participating groups of bilingual generalist (BG), regular generalist (RG), and undecided generalist (UG) pre-service elementary teachers in regard to their peer evaluation scores for achievement of creativity-related objectives in the STEAM lessons. In addition, a substantial portion of participants from each group recognized the two highest and two lowest scoring achievement categories in their discussions of similarities and differences, and this qualitative data assisted in confirmatory triangulation of the quantitative findings.

AB  - It is noted that the "Canadian Journal of Science, Mathematics and Technology Education" (CJSMTE) was founded with the support of a donation of $1.0 million from the Imperial Oil Charitable Foundation. Four goals were uppermost in the thinking behind the journal: first, it should be bilingual; second, it should be cross-disciplinary; third, it should project a distinctive and independent voice for Canadian educators; fourth, it should celebrate diversity of views and perspectives while upholding values of excellence and equity. Some early teething problems are discussed and questions are raised about what constitutes a successful international journal, including the originality and rigour of published papers and the richness of interactions among authors, editors, and manuscript reviewers.

AB  - User Experience Design (UXD) is an often-neglected area of the information systems (IS) curriculum. UXD classes specifically designed for IS students are still uncommon in IS programs and this study aims to add to the body of knowledge to prepare a more well-rounded future generation of IS professionals. With this goal in mind, this study describes the redesign of an introductory UXD course following Kolb's learning cycle and constructivist instructional models. This paper describes the implementation of the supporting pedagogy and the opportunity for students to better master core UXD concepts. UXD, a multi-disciplinary area is built on skills learned in systems analysis and design class while students learn to apply relevant concepts through a hands-on, instructor-led, individual, in-class sample project. The skills are then applied by engaging students in active learning in a team setting to deliver value to a local organization by solving related, real-life challenges. Students work on community-engaged team projects to enhance their appreciation of the impact and relevance of their semester-long project deliverable. Constructivism guides the instructional models of the framework, in which problem-based learning is used to help students build and apply relevant skills. The instructional models and implications for instructional design are discussed along with a proposed pedagogical approach, course setting and structure, tools and techniques engaged, student feedback analyzed, and lessons learned.

AB  - A meaningful research experience with a strong mentor early in a student's educational career is formative. Many institutions recognize this and would like to have such an experience available to their best students, but it can be difficult to involve first-year students in a laboratory-based research because of their lack of background knowledge. However, it can be just as transformative for students to conduct a meaningful literature research project under the direction of an advisor. Such an experience can expose students to the culture of science and to the excitement of scientific research and can motivate them to pursue science majors and careers. This article describes a first-year, seminar-style class in which, under the direction of an advisor, students engage in a semester-long research project. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - One reason we have difficulty finding sustainable solutions is in part because we are unable to see the bigger picture. Capra (2000) argues, "To become ecologically literate we must learn to think systemically--in terms of connectedness, context and processes" (p. 270). We have attempted to structure connected learning experiences through our transdisciplinary approach to teaching for learning science, mathematics and ecological aspects of society and environment. We support Jucker's (2002) view that we must have lateral rigor across disciplines and vertical rigor within disciplines in order to best prepare students for teaching. This paper explores the theoretical underpinning of this complex approach to undergraduate teaching and reports on how our teaching team has worked collaboratively to structure a sequence of three, one semester integrated, core courses that explicitly uses an educating for ecological sustainability theme as the basis for each course and associated assessment.

AB  - This paper examines a collaborative partnership between discipline lecturers and an academic literacy practitioner in the context of undergraduate physics. Gee's sociocultural construct of Discourse is used as a framework for the design of an introductory physics course, explicitly framed around helping students access the disciplinary discourse and social practices of physics. Jacobs' model for integrating academic literacies into disciplines is used as a basis to evaluate the effectiveness of this collaboration, drawing on data from students and staff. The study reveals that an important aspect of the collaboration between the physics lecturers and the academic literacy practitioner was a common, shared understanding of themselves as Discourse teachers. The study also points to wider institutional arrangements that may enable or constrain such collaborations, for example, institutional approaches to academic literacy, departmental cultures and the nature of different disciplinary knowledge structures.

AB  - Primary sources are original artifacts from the past that can used to understand an event or time period. They are customarily only thought of in the realm of historical thinking. That is unfortunate because they can also be considered in terms of scientific, economic, cultural, and mathematical thinking. While primary sources are increasingly taking more prominent roles in the social studies and history classrooms, they are still very rare in other disciplines. This paper describes how primary sources gathered from the Library of Congress were situated in a larger STEM lesson focusing on the challenges faced by WWI veteran amputees. Lesson reflection found that with sufficient scaffolding and other support, primary sources make an excellent resource for STEM teachers. Further, STEM and primary sources make natural partners in teaching and learning because they both have an interdisciplinary nature and tend be applied to real world situations.

AB  - Students need to be aware of plants in order to learn about, appreciate, care for, and protect them. However, research has found that many children are not aware of the plants in their environment. A way to address this issue might be integration of plants with various disciplines. I investigated the effectiveness of an instructional approach based on integration of botany with chemistry and art for increasing students' awareness of plants. The study was carried out in a science summer school for 10- to 12-year-old students (n = 25). A plant awareness questionnaire and a plant blindness test were used as pretests and posttests to assess the effects of the instruction on the students' plant awareness. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with the students after instruction. The results indicated that integrating plants with various disciplines might overcome the learning problem of students associated with their "plant blindness." Moreover, this instructional approach can provide students opportunities to learn the names of plants and some concepts in the botanical discipline, as well as help them understand the relationship between plants and other disciplines.

AB  - The importance of including concepts, examples, and techniques from mathematics and the physical and information sciences in biology courses to fulfill the need of today's undergraduates has been the principle motivation for developing interdisciplinary biology-focused courses. Although this movement started many years ago, developing and offering courses like biophysics is still new in many liberal arts colleges. Taking advantage of the experiences gained by introducing an interdisciplinary course, simply titled Biophysics, this paper was developed to present the adapted structure, challenges, and useful factors to further develop such a course in order to heighten students' retention of the material.

AB  - St. Olaf College recently added a Mathematical Biology concentration to its curriculum. The core course, Mathematics of Biology, was redesigned to include a wet laboratory. The lab classes required students to collect data and implement the essential modeling techniques of formulation, implementation, validation, and analysis. The four labs investigated population growth, enzyme kinetics, glucose-insulin feedback, and random walks/diffusion. Based on assessment data, having the labs and class juxtaposed was an effective way to reinforce mathematical concepts and encourage collaboration among students with different majors. We discuss key factors that permitted this course's development, the continuing challenges, and how this model might be adapted to other venues.

AB  - Basic phylogenetics and associated "tree thinking" are often minimized or excluded in formal school curricula. Informal settings provide an opportunity to extend the K-12 school curriculum, introducing learners to new ideas, piquing interest in science, and fostering scientific literacy. Similarly, university researchers participating in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) outreach activities increase awareness of college and career options and highlight interdisciplinary fields of science research and augment the science curriculum. To aid in this effort, we designed a 6-h module in which students utilized 12 flowering plant species to generate morphological and molecular phylogenies using biological techniques and bioinformatics tools. The phylogenetics module was implemented with 83 high school students during a weeklong university STEM immersion program and aimed to increase student understanding of phylogenetics and coevolution of plants and pollinators. Student response reflected positive engagement and learning gains as evidenced through content assessments, program evaluation surveys, and program artifacts. We present the results of the first year of implementation and discuss modifications for future use in our immersion programs as well as in multiple course settings at the high school and undergraduate levels.

AB  - The recent trend to unite mathematically related disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) under the broader umbrella of STEM education has advantages. In this new educational context of integration, however, STEM teachers need to be able to distinguish between sufficient proof and reasoning across different disciplines, particularly between the status of inductive and deductive modes of reasoning in mathematics. Through a specific set of mathematical conjectures, researchers explored differences between mathematics (n = 24) and science (n = 23) teachers' reasoning schemes, as well as the confidence they had in their justifications. Results from the study indicate differences between the two groups in terms of their levels of mathematical proof, as well as correlational trends that inform their confidence across these levels. Implications particularly for teacher training and preparation within the context of an integrated STEM education model are discussed.

AB  - Biological flight mechanics is typically taught in graduate level college classes rather than in secondary school classes. We developed an interdisciplinary unit for advanced upper-level secondary school students (ages 15-18) to teach the principles of flight and applications to biological systems. This unit capitalised on the tremendous biological diversity seen in powered flight (the rock pigeon, "Columba livia"), gliding (the colugo, "Galeopterus variegatus" and the flying snake, "Chrysopelea paradisi") and passive transport (the wheat rust fungus, "Puccinia graminis"). These biological systems were translated through the construction and operation of remote-controlled gliders. The unit was conducted in three parts: a 20-minute recorded video on aerodynamic principles (Part 1), a 2.5-hour session including the aerodynamic applications to biological systems and the construction of the remote-controlled gliders (Part 2), and a two-hour session for testing, calibration and operation (flying) of the gliders (Part 3). Following this lesson, students will be able to take elements from multiple disciplines and synthesise them in new ways to give original insights in answering critical-thinking questions inspired by biological flight. Introducing students to interdisciplinary approaches early in their academic careers not only enhances their present learning, but also prepares them for future interdisciplinary environments. This unit could easily be adapted by other educators to fit the needs of specific secondary school and/or college classes.

AB  - Longitudinal data analysis has received widespread interest throughout educational, behavioral, and social science research, with latent growth curve modeling currently being one of the most popular methods of analysis. Despite the popularity of latent growth curve modeling, limited attention has been directed toward understanding the issues of reliability of measurement change in the context of this method. The purpose of this article is to outline the common difficulties that arise when estimating reliability within the context of growth models and extend the notion of reliability to a more general modeling framework that takes into account the specifics of longitudinal data. To highlight the importance of focusing on reliability of measurement change in the context of latent growth curve modeling, empirical data are examined.

AB  - This interdisciplinary study sketches the ways in which proportional reasoning is involved in the solution of chemistry problems, more specifically, problems involving quantities in chemical reactions (commonly referred to as stoichiometry problems). By building on the expertise of both mathematics and chemistry education research, the present paper shows how the theoretical constructs in proportional reasoning in mathematics education offer rich explanatory accounts of the complexities involved in solving stoichiometry problems. Using Vergnaud's concept of measure spaces, the theoretical analysis shows that proportionality situations are relatively more intricate, involving various layers of complexity in chemistry as compared to those in the mathematics curriculum. Knowledge of proportionality and chemistry are simultaneously required to provide solutions to chemical reactions. Our analysis of a range of stoichiometry situations led us to propose a problem analysis framework involving five levels of difficulty. Further, the specificity of proportionality in stoichiometry is that it can only be established when quantities are interpreted in the unit "mole," a unit which does not have any physical embodiment in terms of a measure of quantity unlike mass and volume. Our analysis of student-teachers' solution to the stoichiometry problems, shows that they tend to incorrectly (probably intuitively) set proportional relationships when two quantities in a reaction are expressed in non-molar quantities such as mass. The data also bring to the fore the primarily formulaic approach that student-teachers use in setting inherent proportionality relationships. An important finding is the interpretation of a chemical equation as a mathematical equation, rather than a statement of proportionality.

AB  - Engineering design activities offer the promise of enhanced learning and teaching in pre-college science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) settings. The wide variation and lack of coherence in research and practice concerning pre-college engineering design challenges necessitates an investigation of the literature. The overarching research question guiding this search and review of literature was, ''How are engineering design challenges conceptualized in pre-college environments?'' A search and review coupled with iterative thematic analysis was employed to understand and conceptualize the current body of literature on pre-college engineering design challenges. It is anticipated that this review will provide a general picture of the salient features surrounding engineering design challenges, including: authenticity to the learner and to engineering practices, open-ended problems, modeling, optimization to continuously improve, and the promotion of engineering habits of mind such as balancing trade-offs and satisficing. It is also expected that the results will contribute toward ongoing discussions of the role of design challenges in STEM educational settings, future research directions, and implications for practice.

AB  - Transformative learning aims to awaken students to issues of injustice, and to promote their critical analysis of assumptions, beliefs and values that lead to and sustain social inequities, so that they may become agents of social change. This paper introduces the Sensitise Take Action and Reflection (STAR) framework, which encapsulates transformative learning principles, as a tool for educators to enhance student health professionals' capacity and preparedness to address health inequities they are likely to encounter in their future practice. Using an action research methodology within a three-cycle process, STAR was trialled and evaluated by an interdisciplinary team of health educators (n = 25) in an Australian university. Disciplines included: nursing, nutrition and dietetics, public health, occupational therapy and paramedic science. Data were gathered via individual interviews, focus group discussions and field notes, and were analysed inductively, with member-checking of emerging themes to ensure interpretive rigour. The results of this research suggest that STAR is easily understood by users, has relevance for health professional education, and holds promise for producing desired educational outcomes within and across health disciplines. Furthermore, this project could be considered a model for fostering inter-professional collaboration in health education, research and practice. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - Purpose: The 'globalisation backlash' poses a challenge to society and civic education. This article develops future approaches to teaching globalisation by drawing on past concepts of economic education. Approach: An in-depth literature review on the contemporary challenges of globalisation is given and compared to the conventional approaches of teaching globalisation. Past concepts of economic education are introduced and examined for their applicability in this context. Findings: Since the 'globalisation backlash' is rooted in subjective experiences of the local environment, approaches such as lifeworld-orientation are useful to activated students' understandings. Socio-economic approaches can complement this with sociological, economic, and political theories that reveal the mechanisms behind personal experiences. Practical implications: Diagnostic teaching becomes necessary to link the students' realm of experience and globalised reality. [Note: The page numbers (93-95) shown following page 124 are incorrect.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research is frequently viewed as an important component of the research landscape through its innovative ability to integrate knowledge from different areas. However, support for interdisciplinary research is often strategic rhetoric, with policy-makers and universities frequently adopting practices that favour disciplinary performance. We argue that disciplinary and interdisciplinary research are complementary, and we develop a simple framework that demonstrates this for a semi-permanent interdisciplinary research field. We argue that the presence of communicating infrastructures fosters communication and integration between disciplines and the interdisciplinary research field to generate innovative knowledge. We apply this to the experience of economic history in Australia in the second half of the twentieth century to demonstrate the life cycle of a semi-permanent field.

AB  - In this paper, we examine a first-year torque and angular acceleration problem to address a possible use of the forelimbs of "Tyrannosaurus rex." A 1/40th-scale model (see Fig. 1) is brought to the classroom to introduce the students to the quandary: given that the forelimbs of "T. rex" were too short to reach its mouth, what function did the forelimbs serve? This issue crosses several scientific disciplines including paleontology, ecology, and physics, making it a great starting point for thinking "outside the box." Noted paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter has suggested that the forelimbs of "T. rex" were an integral part of its predatory behavior. Given the large teeth of "T. rex," it is assumed that they killed with their teeth. Lipkin and Carpenter have suggested that the forelimbs were used to hold a struggling victim (which had not been dispatched with the first bite) while the final, lethal bite was applied. If that is the case, then the forelimbs must be capable of large angular accelerations a in order to grab the animal attempting to escape. The concepts of the typical first-year physics course are sufficient to test this hypothesis by solving a = t/I. Naturally, students love solving any problem related to "Tyrannosaurus rex"!

AB  - The emphasis on STEM education should not be interpreted as an omen of the death of humanities; art, literature, history, and philosophy can inform and enlighten STEM studies if the walls of academic silos are broken down and taught in combination. Where the physical universe collides with the fanciful and flawed human experience of life, there is creative energy, be it in scientific research or creative writing. Both are meant to birth new knowledge, rouse questions, explore one's relationship with the world, employ the senses, test ideas, and better one's understanding of life and the human experience. The humanities can easily combine with other disciplines through applied speculation. A strategy to combine might be, for instance, to adapt the writing core to an interdisciplinary, experiential course that uses science as the lens through which students analyze and apply literary devices. Creating short stories based on scientific articles, they practice reading and understanding articles, conveying complex ideas, building conclusions in a way similar to a literature review, and extrapolating information to imagine implications. Just as young humanists can benefit from developing a greater understanding of science, so too can young scientists benefit from applying communications to science. One of the goals of an undergraduate education is to learn a discipline well enough to develop an educated worldview. A student should graduate with a way of understanding and analyzing the phenomena in their life and greater, global habitat. Different disciplines emphasize different ways of looking at the world: as an organism of power relationships, a set of outcomes dependent on historical precedence, a complex of interdependent systems, or the control of information through presentation.

AB  - This empirical study uses content and frequency analysis to investigate how the Big History Project (BHP) online curriculum represents different racial and cultural groups within its units fusing science and history. The prevalence of a Western Civilizations perspective in curricula offers a challenging irony: that world history could be culturally irrelevant, or inaccurate, for non-Europeans. Drawing on Indigenous, postcolonial and critical social studies scholarship, this study offers a new framework identifying five attributes of a Eurocentric World History curriculum and uses it to analyze BHP. Findings reveal that BHP materials promote Eurocentrism through its content and source selections, across all five attributes of the framework. Implications for curriculum and pedagogy in the social and natural sciences are discussed.

AB  - Advocates of more connected approaches to teaching the STEM subjects argue that such integration, especially in the context of real-world issues, can make these fields more relevant to students and ultimately increase their motivation and achievement. However, there is little research on how best to integrate the STEM disciplines or on what factors make integration more likely to produce positive outcomes. This article summarizes the results of a recent study of STEM integration in K-12 education by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The study reviewed evidence on student outcomes, developed a descriptive framework for practitioners, suggested key elements for the design of integrated STEM initiatives, and identified research priorities. The report from the study provides a useful foundation for future efforts to implement effective integrated STEM education.

AB  - Providing students with opportunities to build, and test and revise ideas, can help them develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In this article, the authors describe how core measurement and geometry concepts were embedded within a "Model It!" task. They replicate an industry-based, interdisciplinary problem, but only focus on the mathematical ideas here. Twenty-six Algebra 1 students worked on organizing gingerbread houses within a community and designing the path and operation of a mini-trolley tour. Starting work on these tasks required that students keep the task specifications in mind. With guidance from their teacher, the students sub-divided their modeling work into creating three designs: (1) trolley path design, (2) gingerbread community design, and (3) a two-dimensional (2D) model of the gingerbread community to fit the resort ballroom.

AB  - We offer insights for using design-based research (DBR) as a model for constructing professional development that supports curriculum and instructional knowledge regarding science and literacy integration. We spotlight experiences in the DBR process from data collected from a sample of four elementary teachers. Findings from interviews, focus groups and researcher field notes elucidated: the value in establishing a collaborative foundation for professional discourse, the teacher participants developing nascent knowledge of curricular integration in science and literacy, and their apprehensions about using digital technology to support their professional development. Implications are presented for professional development facilitators and researchers using DBR as an innovative approach for teacher development.

AB  - This book presents original, empirical data from quantitative and qualitative research studies in the field of language learning aptitude, ability, and individual differences. It does so from the perspectives of Second Language Acquisition, psychology, neuroscience and sociolinguistics. All studies included in the book use a similar and uniform layout and methodology. Each chapter contains a study examining factors such as memory, personality, self-concept, bilingualism and multilingualism, education, musicality or gender. The chapters investigate the influence of these concepts on language learning aptitude and ability. Several of these chapters analyse hypotheses which have never been tested before and therefore provide novel research results. The book contributes to the field both by verifying and contesting existent findings and by exploring novel approaches to devising research in the subject area.

AB  - Plants are an integral part of nature. Many plant species in almost any part of the world are under serious threats due to various reasons such as deforestation, pollution--of air, water and soil--caused by industrialisation, overgrazing and rapid population growth. It is likely that people have strong positive attitudes towards conservation of plants. This study investigated the effectiveness of an instructional approach based on integration of botany with chemistry and art on students' attitude towards plants. This study was carried out in a science summer school for 10-12-years-old students (N = 49) in Turkey. The Plant Attitude Questionnaire was used as pre-test and post-test to assess the effects of the instruction on the students' attitudes towards plants. Moreover, the participating children were asked to keep journals throughout the instruction. The children's journals served as a data collection tool. The findings of the study indicated that integration of botany with chemistry and art is a good way to support children's positive attitudes towards plants, particularly for an instructional approach based on the integration of plants with various disciplines to support children's interest and enjoyment of plants. Also, this approach could offer children opportunities to understand the importance of plants in the living environments of humans and other organisms, and material benefits from plants in industry.

AB  - To bridge the gap between science and policy, future scientists should receive training that incorporates policy implications into the design, analysis, and communication of research. We present a student Science and Policy course for undergraduate science majors piloted at the University of California, Berkeley in the summer of 2011. During this program, pairs of students undertake research projects while receiving instruction in both research methods and science translation. In addition to completing short-term research projects, the students produce materials designed to communicate their results to decision makers and the public. This article provides a detailed description of this course's organization and structure and a preliminary evaluation. Suggestions for others interested in designing (and conducting educational research on) a similar interdisciplinary program are provided. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)

AB  - This paper examines historical and contemporary racializations of Asian(Americans) within the STEM system. The prevailing perception of Asian(Americans) as model minorities masks how their multiple and contradictory positionings in the STEM system perpetuate the neoliberal racial project and reproduce systems of racism and oppression. Through a multidisciplinary analysis of STEM education and industry, we demonstrate that the shifting racialization of Asian(Americans) secures advantages for White Americans by promoting meritocracy and producerism and justifies White supremacy. By serving these functions, the racialization of Asian(Americans) within the STEM system is central to the neoliberal racial project. This paper also suggests how STEM education researchers can reveal and resist, rather than veil and support, the neoliberal racial project in STEM.

AB  - In the United States, the occupation of law librarianship has existed longer than the American Library Association, and law librarians have their own professional organization that is now more than 100 years old. Throughout this history, however, the related issues of degree requirements and education standards for law librarians have been repeatedly discussed, but never resolved. While some of this inertia may arise from each organization hoping that the other would settle the issue, the largest challenges appear to stem from a lack of communication between law librarians and other parts of the field and a near-complete neglect of the education of law librarians--along with law libraries as an entity--in overall library pedagogical and research discourse. This article explores the roots of the long-running concerns about the educational preparation of and the professional standards for law librarians in the United States and offers ways in which library and information science educators can contribute to addressing these concerns.

AB  - Pupils' perception of any science subject significantly influences their achievement. Identification of perception of some subject is essential part of educational research. This study is focused on finding out differences in the four dimensions of geography perception (1. Geography as a school subject; 2. Geography and environment; 3 Importance of geography; 4. Relevance of geography lessons to pupils life) between gender and grade level of lower secondary school pupils. The research tool was questionnaire with 27 Likert type items; the data were obtained from 540 lower secondary pupils from Czech Republic. The data were analyzed by the method of descriptive (mean score, standard deviation) and inductive (analysis of variance) statistics. The gender had got significant influence in the first dimension and grade level in the fourth dimension. Results are discussed in the conclusion part and there is information about the possibility of future research.

AB  - The objective of this piece of research is to interpret and investigate systematically an observed brain functional phenomenon which is associated with proceeding of e-learning processes. More specifically, this work addresses an interesting and challenging educational issue concerned with dynamical evaluation of elearning performance considering convergence (response) time. It is based on an interdisciplinary recent approach named as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) modeling. Which incorporate Neurophysiology, educational psychology, cognitive, and learning sciences. Herein, adopted application of neural modeling results in realistic dynamical measurements of e-learners' response time performance parameter. Initially, it considers time evolution of learners' experienced acquired intelligence level during proceeding of learning/training process. In the context of neurobiological details, the state of synaptic connectivity pattern (weight vector) inside e-learner's brain-at any time instant-supposed to be presented as timely varying dependent parameter. The varying modified synaptic state expected to lead to obtain stored experience spontaneously as learner's output (answer). Obviously, obtained responsive learner's output is a resulting action to any arbitrary external input stimulus (question). So, as the initial brain state of synaptic connectivity pattern (vector) considered as pre-intelligence level measured parameter. Actually, obtained elearner's answer is compatibly consistent with modified state of internal/stored experienced level of intelligence. In other words, dynamical changes of brain synaptic pattern (weight vector) modify adaptively convergence time of learning processes, so as to reach desired answer. Additionally, introduced research work is motivated by some obtained results for performance evaluation of some neural system models concerned with convergence time of learning process. Moreover, this paper considers interpretation of interrelations among some other interesting results obtained by a set of previously published educational models. The interpretational evaluation and analysis for introduced models results in some applicable studies at educational field as well as medically promising treatment of learning disabilities. Finally, an interesting comparative analogy between performances of ANNs modeling versus Ant Colony System (ACS) optimization is presented at the end of this paper.

AB  - Mixed Reality learning environments can provide opportunities to educationally enhance previously isolated scientific concepts by using art and technology as mediums for understanding the world. Participatory experiences provide a kinetic means of comprehending often-abstract knowledge, creating the conditions for sensory learning that is inclusive and accessible. The O-Tu-Kapua (what clouds see) Mixed Reality experience provides an inverted view of the environment. Rather than us looking up towards the sky, the clouds look down upon us. Atmospheric science is personified through an intertwined narrative that begins with creative action. Participatory learning embedded within technology-enhanced education creates opportunities to question how as educators we can create opportunities for integrating art, science and technology, enhancing our ability to capture young people in conversations about the socio-ecological Anthropocene.

AB  - In its 10th anniversary issue, "The Chronicle Review" asked a number of scholars to identify the "Defining Idea of the Next Decade." One nominee: the movement to abandon the disciplines in order "to meet the scholarly and public challenges educators face" (Ecklund, 2010). In Elaine Ecklund's perspective, it is only through interdisciplinary research that people will find answers to pressing questions such as how to battle cancer, combat environmental devastation, and understand religion. The authors conducted a study of this five-year, $20 million interdisciplinary research collaboration, which incorporated more than 25 disciplines across the natural sciences, social sciences, engineering, humanities, and professional fields. In the process, they learned that there are five key questions that administrators, faculty, and students should ask before embarking on such collaborations: Do you have the time, the people, the resources, the structures, and the supportive departments that are needed to enable interdisciplinary work? These are the essential conditions for such work to succeed.

AB  - Family and consumer sciences (FCS) education has traditionally attracted a large percentage of female students (Vincenti, 1997; Werhan, 2013). Werhan (2013) reported that slightly less than 3.5 million students are engaged in FCS courses, and at the high school level, approximately 65% of them are female. This skewed representation of female students in FCS generally has been attributed to the impression that the fields of study typically encompassed under the FCS curricular umbrella have been female-dominated, because "home" historically was considered the woman's realm (Davis, 2008). To meet the needs for a STEM-capable citizenry, a STEM-proficient workforce, and future STEM experts, the Nation must focus on two complementary goals: We must prepare all students, including girls and minorities who are underrepresented in these fields, to be proficient in STEM subjects. We must also inspire all students to learn STEM and, in the process, motivate many of them to pursue STEM careers. Due to the high representation of females in FCS, aligning STEM with FCS more deliberately, even at an early age in schools, may contribute to an increase of women in STEM education and in the national STEM workforce.

AB  - This is a process article for weaving indigenous and mainstream knowledges within science educational curricula and other science arenas, assuming participants include recognized holders of traditional ecological knowledge (we prefer "Indigenous Knowledge" or "Traditional Knowledge") and others with expertise in mainstream science. It is based on the "Integrative Science" undergraduate program created at Cape Breton University to bring together indigenous and mainstream sciences and ways of knowing, as well as related Integrative Science endeavors in science research, application, and outreach. A brief historical outline for that experiential journey is provided and eight "Lessons Learned" listed. The first, namely "acknowledge that we need each other and must engage in a co-learning journey" is explained as key for the success of weaving efforts. The second, namely "be guided by Two-Eyed Seeing" is considered the most profound because it is central to the whole of a co-learning journey and the article's discussion is focussed through it. The eighth lesson, "develop an advisory council of willing, knowledgeable stakeholders" is considered critical for sustaining success over the long-term given that institutional and community politics profoundly influence the resourcing and recruitment of any academic program and thus can help foster success, or sabotage it. The scope of relevance for Two-Eyed Seeing is broad and its uptake across Canada is sketched; the article also places it in the context of emerging theory for transdisciplinary research. The article concludes with thoughts on why "Two-Eyed Seeing" may seem to be desired or resisted as a label in different settings. "Traditional Indian education is an expression of environmental education par excellence." It is an environmental education process that can have a profound meaning for the kind of modern education required to face the challenges of living in the world of the twenty-first century (Cajete (2010), p. 1128, emphasis as in original). As two-eyed seeing implies, people familiar with both knowledge systems can uniquely combine the two in various ways to meet a challenge or task at hand. In the context of environmental crises alone, a combination of both seems essential (Aikenhead and Michell (2011), p. 114).

AB  - A national movement is underway to establish elementary school gardens, which can serve both academic and social purposes. These gardens can positively impact students' science achievement and provide the thematic and hands-on approach especially conducive to learning for students with disabilities. Garden-based learning (GBL) broadens the scope of school gardening to include tools and processes such as indoor seed germination and vermicomposting. Teachers at a suburban elementary school leveraged community resources and the assistance of parents to initiate GBL. They employed this strategy to provide standards-based science and cross-disciplinary instruction, as well as to facilitate inquiry and the development of related process skills. A collaborative fourth grade classroom engaged all learners in investigations about the decomposition of vegetable matter, worm populations, and the impact of fertilizer on plant growth. The experiential and interdisciplinary nature of GBL may make it one key to unlocking learning potential in students with disabilities. (Contains 1 table and 4 figures.)

AB  - Low enrollment of Latino, African American, Native American, and Southeast Asian American students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) classes, via advanced placement (AP) courses, remains a problem for high schools, and education leaders across the United States. More than just examining the factors behind this enrollment issue, we wanted to understand the focal factors underpinning success in AP courses of those few who do enroll. For that purpose, we grounded this case study on social cognitive theory's central variable of self-efficacy. We found that teacher facilitated experience plays a pivotal function in students' success in STEM education, more specifically, AP math.

AB  - This chapter presents how I integrated Virtual Exchange (VE) programmes delivered by Soliya in two courses at an international undergraduate liberal arts and sciences college. In both cases the VE programme was fully integrated in the courses as a graded element. The students of beginner Italian participated in the four-week long Connect Express. While liking the experience, they found that the VE was still too disconnected from their aim of learning a language. The students of Intercultural Communication (IC) participated in the eight-week long Connect Global. For them, the success of the experience was linked to the group composition and the English proficiency level of participants.

AB  - MOOCs (massive open online courses) have attracted considerable attention from researchers. Fueled by constant change and developments in educational technology, the trends of MOOCs have varied greatly over the years. To detect and visualize the developments and changes in MOOC research, 4,652 articles published between 2009 and 2021 were retrieved from Web of Science and Scopus with the aid of CiteSpace. This study sought to explore the number of publications, co-citation network, cluster analysis, timeline analysis, burstness analysis, and dual-map overlays based on co-citation relationships. The first finding was that the number of publications on MOOCs had increased consistently, and grew especially quickly between 2013 and 2015. Second, the main topic of the top 10 co-cited studies revolved around the problem of learner continuance. Third, blended programs, task-technology fit, and comparative analysis have emerged as popular subjects. Fourth, the development of MOOC research has followed distinct phases, with 2009 to 2012 the starting phase, 2013 to 2015 the high growth phase, 2016 to 2018 the plateau phase, and 2019 to 2021 another peak phase. Lastly, both cluster analysis and dual-map overlays provided empirical evidence of cross-disciplinary research. Our findings provided an in-depth and dynamic understanding of the development and evolution of MOOC research and also proposed novel ideas for future studies.

AB  - Sustainability is becoming a key component of many HE curricula. However, questions as to what sustainability is and how it can be embedded within subject specific curriculum are difficult to answer. Focussing on existing pedagogic scholarship in this area and by drawing on experiences from my own institution, this article discusses how the GEES subjects are addressing sustainability in the curriculum. It provides both conceptual framing on the evolution of the GEES subjects in relation to sustainability and offers some practical examples of how different approaches to sustainability might be used in teaching, including challenging disciplinary perspectives and introducing interdisciplinary working around global challenges. It concludes with recommendations for how sustainability might be embedded in the curriculum in practice.

AB  - This study examines the inputs (processes and strategies) and outputs (perceptions, skill development, classroom transfer, disciplinary integration, social networking, and community development) of a yearlong, interdisciplinary teacher learning and development experience. Eleven secondary math and science teachers partnered with an interdisciplinary team of university engineering mentors in a yearlong engineering education and project implementation program. It consisted of a 6-week on-site resident professional development and collaboration experience, with an ongoing support and follow-up including digital systems. Mixed-method, multisource data indicate that teachers engaged with motivations combining personal, intrinsic interest and classroom integration goals. They formed and sustained an active community of learning and practice that supported their success, on-site and through classroom integration, thereby promoting innovations. Teachers reported positive perceptions throughout the program and demonstrated significant, productive trajectories of change-over-time. Teachers learned and transferred task-specific engineering and scientific skills, as well as more general inquiry-based pedagogical strategies to their secondary classrooms.

AB  - Increasing demand for chemicals worldwide, depleting resources, consumer pressure, stricter legislation, and the rising cost of waste disposal are placing increasing pressure on chemical and related industries. For any organization to survive in the current arena of growing climate change laws and regulations, and increasing public influence, the issue of sustainability must be fundamental to the way it operates. A sustainable manufacturing approach will enable economic growth to be combined with environmental and social sustainability and will be realized via collaboration between a multidisciplinary community including chemists, biologists, engineers, environmental scientists, economists, experts in management, and policy makers. Hence, employees with new skills, knowledge, and experience are essential. To realize this approach, the design and development of a series of workshops encompassing systems thinking are presented here. After close consultation with industry, an annual program of interactive workshops has been designed for graduate students to go beyond examining the "greening" of chemical reactions, processes, and products, and instead embed a systems thinking approach to learning. The workshops provide a valuable insight into the issues surrounding sustainable manufacturing covering change management, commercialization, environmental impact, circular economy, legislation, and bioresources incorporating the conversion of waste into valuable products. The multidisciplinary course content incorporates industrial case studies, providing access to real business issues, and is delivered by experts from academic departments across campus and industry.

AB  - This article presents a series of activities that not only help learners discover the waggle dance--a behavior performed by scout bees to communicate the location of a flower patch--and its purpose but also introduce circuitry, engineering, and energy transfer using hands-on, inquiry-based strategies. These activities were conducted in a second-grade STEM enrichment setting with 20 students over approximately 90 minutes. The assessments were primarily formative, given the nature of the program. These interdisciplinary standards-aligned activities can be easily adapted to traditional elementary-level classrooms.

AB  - This paper reports on research from a network of high school and museum partnerships designed to explore techniques for integrating mathematics and physics learning experiences during the first year of high school. The foundation of the curriculum is a problem-based, museum-based, and hands-on approach to mathematics and physics. In this paper, we ask: How does the materiality of this curriculum allow students to think about mathematics in different ways? We first discuss advantages associated with museum-integrated curriculum, and point to how these are related to materialist and embodied theories of learning. We then focus on video data collected during a wing-design lesson, and discuss patterns in students' participation. We show how (1) integrated curriculum creates opportunities for embodied learning experiences in mathematics, (2) gesture and touch are important facets of learning abstract concepts in mathematics and physics, and (3) museum-situated activities contest philosophical assumptions about the nature of mathematics.

AB  - When the journal "Minerva" was founded in 1962, science and higher educational issues were high on the agenda, lending impetus to the interdisciplinary field of "Science Studies" "qua" "Science Policy Studies." As government expenditures for promoting various branches of science increased dramatically on both sides of the East-West Cold War divide, some common issues regarding research management also emerged and with it an interest in closer academic interaction in the areas of history and policy of science. Through a close reading of many early issues of "Minerva" but also of its later competitor journal "Science Studies" (now called "Social Studies of Science") the paper traces the initial optimism of an academically based Science Studies dialogue across the Cold War divide and the creation in 1971 of the International Commission for Science Policy Studies as a bridging forum, one that "Minerva" strangely chose to ignore. In this light, attention is drawn to aspects of the often forgotten history of Science Studies in the former Soviet Union and the Eastern European block. Reviewed also are several early discussions that are still relevant today: e.g., regarding differing concepts of Big Science, science and democracy, autonomy in higher education and what conditions are necessary to sustain academic freedom and scientific integrity (some of Edward Shils' primary concerns). Finally, it is noted how the question of quantitative methods to measure scientific productivity lay at the heart of a "Science of Science" movement of the 1960s has re-emerged in a new form integral to the notion of a "Science of Science Policy."

AB  - Land-grant colleges and universities play a crucial role in addressing the complex challenges facing the U.S. agricultural system and global food security. Multidisciplinary collaboration involving a diversity of land-grant institutions has the potential to accelerate scientific progress on those challenges. However, historical and current funding disparities have prevented Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Tribal Colleges and Universities from being full partners in multi-institutional collaborations. This report, produced by request of the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture acting on a congressional directive, examines how enhanced cooperation across the land-grant system could deepen and expand the impact of its agricultural work, which is critical to address evolving industry and environmental challenges, as well as demands from consumers. The report concludes that many investigators are unaware of potential partners with complementary expertise across the system. The report states that adopting a culture of collaboration could improve the coordination in the land-grant system. Key report recommendations include improving systems and incentives for facilitating academic partnerships, providing dedicated support for collaboration across the land-grant system, and enhancing outreach strategies for communicating about the beneficial outcomes of collaborative research. [Contributors to the report include Committee on Enhancing Coordination Between Land-Grant Universities and Colleges; Board on Agriculture and Natural Resources; Board on Higher Education and Workforce; Division on Earth and Life Studies; and Policy and Global Affairs.]

AB  - Across the globe, women are struggling to overcome social and cultural confines, while creating new opportunities for their gender, by becoming leaders in research and career fields from which they have been historically excluded. This afterword responds to and builds upon contributors' trenchant articles that highlight social, economic, and technological changes that women are making across cultures. Many women are still battling to gain basic human rights. Accordingly, researchers featured in this special issue bring attention to the inequalities that still exist for women worldwide while raising questions about how new shifts toward extreme conservatism and nationalism may impact women's rights in the near future. As puzzled over by post-development scholars such as Ong, Hoogvelt and Sassen, in this era of neoliberalism it is now often difficult to decipher programs and organizations that are truly working toward positive changes for women in the developing world from those that are focused on their own self-interests. Throughout history, governmental and social structures have been designed to favor men, but women are now finding ways to make their voices heard through innovatively taking advantage of new communication technologies in both the developing and developed world. We join with contributors in highlighting women's tremendous investment in change, discussing issues of gender and technology, as well as the work being done by women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. The contributors maintain that in order to create more opportunities for women, progressive researchers, policy-makers and activists must continue to collaborate connecting substantively to the struggles of women for a better life while working toward interdisciplinary solutions that address the ongoing inequalities that constrain their present and future circumstances.

AB  - Global perspectives instruction often focuses on current news events, neglecting deeper human connections between local and global issues. This paper proposes "ecopedagogy" as a solution. Ecopedagogy is a critical approach that emphasizes the interconnectedness of people and the environment. By integrating ecopedagogy into interdisciplinary units, teachers can engage students in meaningful activities that develop critical thinking, cultural competence, and a sense of responsibility for the planet. Examples of ecopedagogical strategies include collaborative projects addressing local environmental challenges, journal prompts reflecting on personal connections to nature, and outdoor learning experiences. By fostering social-environmental awareness, ecopedagogy empowers students to become stewards of the earth and active agents of change who contribute to a more sustainable future. Exploring environmental issues through a global lens exposes students to diverse cultural perspectives and worldviews. This exposure fosters respect for environmental and social values, laying the foundation for meaningful cross-cultural dialogue and collaboration.

AB  - Tertiary-level English medium instruction (EMI) presents an opportunity for both EMI and science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) pedagogies: tertiary STEM needs student-centred strategies familiar to EFL, whereas tertiary EFL can harness the innate complexity of STEM towards complex language production. With the aim of achieving coequal EFL-STEM collaborations, this article presents: (1) neuroscience findings demonstrating the shortcomings of teacher-centred lecturing common in tertiary STEM instruction, and thus the need for EFL expertise; (2) a schema which, by logically delineating the 'language dilemma of content instruction', positions language instruction within STEM education; (3) two grids for guiding instructional design--a two-dimensional grid that disentangles content from language, delineating the cognitive demands imposed by each and helping experts optimize the trajectory of instructional-tasks, and a three-dimensional translanguaging grid delineating all linguistic codes within the EMI space, allowing each EFL-STEM team member to participate in designing student-centred translanguaging tasks without leaving their respective comfort zones; (4) examples of EMI-STEM translanguaging tasks informed by the grids and which guarantee level-appropriate content instruction while supporting the mastery of disciplinary discourses, in both English and the L1.

AB  - The concept of new university reduces the depth of disciplinary understanding at the undergraduate level. Instead, interdisciplinary understanding has been put forward, where room is provided for the broader development of student. Receiving training from multiple perspectives will provide students with the skills necessary in an era of present competitive society. People with critical thinking and decision making skills are needed in the complex modern world. This study presents a model for faculties of arts and sciences. Graduates of Arts and Sciences Faculties experience employment problems. This could be overcome through providing students with opportunities to study minor subjects. In most developed countries, higher education institutions appear to implement a model in which students take general courses in their freshman year. They tailor a program of their own with the mentorship of their supervisors.

AB  - Research has shown the highest level of understanding in the geosciences to be the ability to think about the Earth as a dynamic system. The Earth system contains four spheres: the geosphere, the hydrosphere, the biosphere, and the atmosphere. These spheres are linked through the biogeochemical cycles that move matter and energy through the various parts of the Earth system. This study aims to fill a gap in the literature by examining how undergraduate students perceive fluxes and reservoirs of important elements within the Earth system: namely carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Through interviews, concept drawings, and surveys, undergraduate students' conceptions and alternate conceptions about the Earth System and biogeochemical cycles were collected. This study revealed that undergraduate students in both STEM and non-STEM fields tend to hold a "bio-centric" view of the carbon cycle and have more limited conceptions in terms of detail and breadth of the nitrogen and phosphorous cycles. Students who took more STEM courses and were in more interdisciplinary fields tended to have more nuanced (though not necessarily complete) conceptions of these cycles. Implications for this study involve the improvement of teaching biogeochemical concepts across disciplines, but also inform our knowledge about using these cycles in the context of systems thinking. This work also provides a baseline for future work on developing learning progressions for biogeochemical cycles and complex Earth systems and in assessing systems thinking abilities through student knowledge of biogeochemical cycles.

AB  - It is common in environmental education literature to read about 'transforming' mindsets; for example, moving from humanist to post-humanist viewpoints, or adopting Indigenous Knowledge perspectives. To illustrate how complicated such conceptual shifts are, both philosophically and pedagogically, the paper explores how we come to see and regard trees, using the evergreen oak tree in the cloister at New College, Oxford. Philosophically, the case builds upon Stephen Mulhall's work on seeing aspects, drawing on Heidegger and Wittgenstein. Pedagogically, the author illustrates what place-based environmental education can offer by narrating a session conducted with participants at the Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britain conference. Discursive interventions are described in order to demonstrate the philosophical, aesthetic and cross-disciplinary work needed to alter (even slightly) perspectives that have become second-nature ways of seeing beings such as oak trees. These vignettes are genealogical, juxtaposing past/present landscapes and bringing participants to examine conceptual/emotional binaries like inside/outside, human/animal, enculturation/education, and environmental science/poetics of being. Wittgenstein's anthropological parable of how oak trees came to be venerated illustrates the way concepts, perceptions and practices are interwoven in the rituals and second-nature reactions of people sharing a form of life, changing gradually throughout their cultural and natural history.

AB  - This article examines the affordances and limitations of textbooks for promoting action competence for sustainable development. Based on a content analysis of Swedish lower secondary level textbooks in geography and biology, we investigated how content about sustainable development is organised and formulated, the ways its multidimensional character is described, and how conflicts relating to achieving sustainability are addressed. We found that for both subjects, textbooks provided a fair amount of content about sustainable development, but that relations between its ecological, economic and social dimensions and between different subjects are routinely underdeveloped. We also found that the content about sustainable development obscures complexities and conflicts that are crucial for understanding the challenges involved with achieving sustainability, and taking action. In conclusion, we argue that such textbooks substantially limit the potential for promoting action competence for sustainable development, i.e. through cross-curricular approaches and critically assessing problem-oriented actions at collective and individual levels.

AB  - The AgShare Phase I Program, conducted at Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda, was formed to create open education resources for teaching and community development through action research. The study was conducted by an interdisciplinary team of investigators from fields of veterinary medicine and agri-business. Two master of science students conducted dairy value chain action research that produced  ase materials used to create open education resources (OER) course modules (milk hygiene and marketing modules) and design interventions that would improve milk production, quality, and safety; reduce milk spoilage; increase price per liter of milk received by farmers; and support on-farm processing of yogurt and other dairy products. This research was used in partial fulfillment of the requirement for the master's degree in Livestock Development, Planning, and Management (MLD) and the master's degree in Agri-business Management (M Agbus Mgt) by these students. The conceptual design, implementation, monitoring, and impacts of action research on teaching, students learning, and the dairy industry are discussed in detail.

AB  - Over the last few years research funding has increasingly moved in favour of large, multi-partner, interdisciplinary and multi-site research projects. This article explores the benefits and challenges of employing a full-time research fellow to work across multiple field sites, with all the local research teams, on an international, interdisciplinary project. The article shows how such a "floating" research fellow can play a valuable role in facilitating communication between research teams and project leaders, as well as in building capacity and introducing disciplinary specific skills. It also highlights some key challenges, including problems of language and translation, and the complex power relations within which such a researcher is inevitably embedded. This article contributes to the development of strategies for collaborative projects to facilitate coordination between research teams. It is based on a five-site, cross-cultural project, involving nine partners with a mixture of natural and social science backgrounds, researching aquatic resource use, rural livelihoods, work and education in China, Vietnam and India.

AB  - Science Created by You (SCY) is a project on learning in science and technology domains. SCY uses a pedagogical approach that centres around products, called "emerging learning objects" (ELOs) that are created by students. Students work individually and collaboratively in SCY-Lab (the general SCY learning environment) on "missions" that are guided by socio-scientific questions (for example "How can we design a CO[subscript 2]-friendly house?"). Fulfilling SCY missions requires a combination of knowledge from different content areas (eg, physics, mathematics, biology, as well as social sciences). While on a SCY mission, students perform several types of learning activities that can be characterised as productive processes (experiment, game, share, explain, design, etc), they encounter multiple resources, collaborate with varying coalitions of peers and use changing constellations of tools and scaffolds. The configuration of SCY-Lab is adaptive to the actual learning situation and may provide advice to students on appropriate learning activities, resources, tools and scaffolds, or peer students who can support the learning process. The SCY project aims at students between 12 and 18 years old. In the course of the project, a total of four SCY missions will be developed, of which one is currently available.

AB  - From its inception, the field of Mind, Brain, and Education (MBE) has been conceived as an interdisciplinary science, and with good reason: The phenomena the field aims to understand often arise from interactions among multiple factors, span levels of analysis, and are context dependent. In this article, we argue that to reach its potential as an interdisciplinary science--and in order to explain such complex phenomena--MBE must be fundamentally organized around meaningful, discipline-spanning questions, and the questions must determine tools and research methods (not the other way around). Using examples from three central questions in MBE--"who," "when," and "how"--we highlight the limits of single disciplines, and the value of a question-driven interdisciplinary approach in MBE, with respect to questions that can be asked, the perspectives that can be considered, and the array of methods, tools, and models that can be made available. We believe that the future is bright for MBE, and that the field has a unique opportunity to provide meaningful answers to some of the most difficult questions in education today. However, realizing this potential depends on, as a first step, allowing the questions themselves to drive the field's work moving forward.

AB  - For several years we have included discussions about insect vision in the optics units of our introductory physics courses. This topic is a natural extension of demonstrations involving Brewster's reflection and Rayleigh scattering of polarized light because many insects heavily rely on optical polarization for navigation and communication. Students, especially those majoring in the life sciences, tend to find the conversation intriguing because of its interdisciplinary context. To make it even more appealing, we recently created a laboratory component that allows students to use digital cameras and polarizing filters to create polarization maps of environmental scenes and insect bodies. In this paper we describe how to do so with ImageJ, a widely used and freely available image processing program that is suitable for students with no programming experience.

AB  - This paper describes the development of a taught Master's course in biomedical diagnostics using a novel multi-disciplinary approach. This course, the first of its kind in Ireland, covers the science and technology underlying the development of medical diagnostic devices that detect early markers of diseases such as cancer. The ethical impact of these devices on society, the importance of scientific communication, relevant aspects of business entrepreneurial studies and the commercialisation of medical devices are also covered. The course consists of a mixture of theory, intensive laboratory practicals and independent research. The challenges faced in setting up and running the course are described, as well as some of the novel aspects and may provide valuable insight to those involved in the development of high-level Master's courses.

AB  - This work describes an experience conducted by a group of professors from different departments at the University of Girona (Catalonia, Spain) which arose from the need for interdisciplinary work in university classrooms in order to promote competences relevant to the professional sector. As part of this experience, students from different degree programs were challenged to work collaboratively and in an interdisciplinary manner on a project related to the management of a school cafeteria designed for a real educational center. The work promoted the development of competences that are otherwise difficult to attain through activities that lack an interdisciplinary approach, which are key in today's professional world, such as multi-professional teamwork. Based on this experience, the feasibility of students from different areas of study carrying out a final degree project (FDP) that meets real, contextualized needs and requires the contribution of knowledge from different disciplines is considered.

AB  - This case study examined the development and evaluation of an interdisciplinary first-year learning community designed to stimulate scientific reasoning and critical thinking. Designed to serve the needs of scholarship students majoring in mathematics and natural sciences, the six-credit learning community course was writing-intensive and emphasized general scientific reasoning and critical thinking skills. Success of the course was measured using a pre-test/post-test design that assessed students' paranormal beliefs. Outcomes of the study indicated students' paranormal beliefs were significantly lower at the end of the semester than at the beginning, which was used as a surrogate measure of scientific reasoning that was directly relevant to course content. Supplementary analyses demonstrated that their (a) paranormal beliefs were significantly lower than other students and (b) students self-identified the importance of the scientific reasoning skills learned in the course without being prompted on their teacher course evaluations. The results of this study can inform the design of interdisciplinary, scientific reasoning courses.

AB  - In the 21st century the acquirement and transmission useful knowledge has a key role not only in Hungary but in the whole world as well. In my opinion, the interdisciplinary integration helps teaching efficiently more things than teaching each subject separately. The meaning of integration is approximately that we put together and combine different items and processes. Secondary school students usually get acquainted with the use of table manager programme e.g. Excel. Even with this programme they are able to solve such tasks in which they have to define/estimate the quality of physical amounts, delineate functions so we can hide physics in table manager programmes. I have chosen some physical problems in terms of mechanics: firstly I describe the physical process's basic features, the pertinent laws, formulas (both maths and physics play an important role) then we model this physical process with this table manager program. The use of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) at school is one of the basic ideas of modern education; besides providing information, it brings the development of skills in the foreground. In the middle of the teaching process there is such activities which are related to the subject or field in question. So in pursuance of it, the main aim of school education is to provide knowledge that is flexible and can be used later in different fields of life and prepare students to be able to learn and apply this newly acquainted knowledge through their lives.

AB  - Modern biological sciences require practitioners to have increasing levels of knowledge, competence, and skills in mathematics and programming. A recent review of the science curriculum at the University of Queensland, a large, research-intensive institution in Australia, resulted in the development of a more quantitatively rigorous undergraduate program. Inspired by the National Research Council's "BIO2010" report, a new interdisciplinary first-year course (SCIE1000) was created, incorporating mathematics and computer programming in the context of modern science. In this study, the perceptions of biological science students enrolled in SCIE1000 in 2008 and 2009 are measured. Analysis indicates that, as a result of taking SCIE1000, biological science students gained a positive appreciation of the importance of mathematics in their discipline. However, the data revealed that SCIE1000 did not contribute positively to gains in appreciation for computing and only slightly influenced students' motivation to enroll in upper-level quantitative-based courses. Further comparisons between 2008 and 2009 demonstrated the positive effect of using genuine, real-world contexts to enhance student perceptions toward the relevance of mathematics. The results support the recommendation from "BIO2010" that mathematics should be introduced to biology students in first-year courses using real-world examples, while challenging the benefits of introducing programming in first-year courses.

AB  - Global efforts to prepare young developing minds for solving current and future challenges of climate change have advocated interdisciplinary, issues-based instructional approaches in order to transform traditional models of science education as delivering conceptual facts (UNESCO, 2014). This study is an exploration of the online interactions in an international social network of high school students residing in Norway, China, New Zealand and the United States (N=141). Students participated in classroom-based and asynchronous online discussions about adapted versions of seminal scientific studies with facilitative support from seven scientists across various fields. Grounded in a language-in-use frame for investigating facilitation and demonstrations of problem-based and evidence-based reasoning (Kelly & Chen, 1999), we traced the varied questions, assertions, and evidentiary sources within student-led online discussions. We found that questions from scientific experts in the form of unconstrained, open-ended invitations for exploration were followed by students' acknowledgement and consideration of complex and, at times, conflicting sociopolitical and economic positions about climate change issues. These findings suggest that broadening science classroom discussions to include socially relevant, unsolved issues like climate change could open potential entry points for a dialogic approach that fosters a scientific community in the classroom.

AB  - Establishing a process for identifying evidence-based practices (EBPs) in special education has been a significant advance for the field because it has the potential for generating more effective educational programs and producing more positive outcomes for students with disabilities. However, the potential benefit of EBPs is bounded by the quality, reach, and maintenance of implementation. The cross-disciplinary field of implementation science has great relevance for translating the promise of EBPs into positive outcomes for children and youth with disabilities. This article examines the history, extent, and limitations of EBPs and describes the emergence and current state of implementation science as applied in special education. Subsequent articles in this special issue of "Exceptional Children" address a range of issues related to implementation science in special education: the research-to-practice gap, dissemination and diffusion, adherence and sustainability, scaling up, a model for state-level implementation, and fostering implementation through professional development.

AB  - In this article, the author suggests that children's natural inclination to explore nature, or biophilia, can be explored as a factor that encourages both cognitive engagement and language development. The author summarizes the types of scientific inquiries that bilingual elementary students and their university partners engaged in when guided to design their own projects at a predominantly Mexican-American school. Children inquiries took place at a "La Clase Mágica" site, an after school program in which university undergraduates, faculty, bilingual children, and the community come together with the purpose of learning and exploring technology through interdisciplinary methodologies. The findings indicate that children overwhelmingly chose living organisms and life-like processes as the focus of their inquiries. The author presents the work of an exemplary dyad to illustrate how children engaged in scientific inquiry while developing language and complex thinking.

AB  - Each January from 2010 to 2014, an undergraduate workshop on modeling biological systems was held at Lehman College of the City University of New York. The workshops were funded by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Expedition in Computing, "Computational Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems (CMACS)." The primary goal was to encourage students, especially women and under represented minorities, to persist in a science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) career. A secondary goal was for the students to develop habits supporting collaborative, interdisciplinary work. To these ends, the workshop staff engaged the students in "active learning," using discussions, teaming exercises, and research projects. The student research projects were small, carefully delimited parts of the NSF project's investigation of how to use computational modeling and analysis to improve understanding of pancreatic cancer and atrial fibrillation. Post-workshop surveys show that the students who participated were enthusiastic about the workshops and about working in STEM fields; long-term follow-up of the students' careers found that 55 of the 61 college graduates (90%) had STEM jobs. The goal of this paper is to provide enough information, in conjunction with the workshop Web page, for other researchers to organize similar workshops. With this in mind, it describes the pedagogy, lists the lecture and exercise materials, and details the student research projects for 2014.

AB  - Interprofessional learning improves students' clinical and interprofessional competencies. COVID-19 prevented delivering in-person education and motivated the development of a virtual interprofessional cadaveric dissection (ICD) course. This study reports on the effects of a virtual ICD course compared to a previously delivered in-person course, on students' readiness for, and perceptions about, interprofessional learning. Students attending the ICD course in-person (2019-2020) or virtually (2020-2021) completed the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) and the Interdisciplinary Education Perception Scale (IEPS). Students in the virtual course also provided written feedback. Thirty-two (24 women; Median: 24 [Q1-Q3: 22-25] years) and 23 students (18 women; 22 [21-23] years) attended the in-person and virtual courses, respectively. In the virtual cohort, the RIPLS total score (82 [76-87] vs. 85 [78-90]; p = 0.034) and the roles and responsibilities sub-score (11 [9-12] vs. 12 [11-13]; p = 0.001) improved significantly. In the in-person cohort, the roles and responsibilities sub-score improved significantly (12 [10-14] vs. 13 [11-14]; p = 0.017). No significant differences were observed between cohorts (p < 0.05). Themes identified in the qualitative analysis were advantages and positive experiences, competencies acquired, disadvantages and challenges, and preferences and suggestions. In-person and virtual ICD courses seem to have similar effects on students' interprofessional learning. However, students reported preferring the in-person setting for learning anatomy-dissection skills.

AB  - Each year, physical educators are asked to incorporate even more math, language arts, science and social studies into their curriculum. The challenge is how to do this without sacrificing the essential health and life skills provided by a quality physical education program. One program, Math & Movement, is a great aid for physical educators to accomplish both goals. Math & Movement is a kinesthetic, multi-sensory approach to teaching and practicing math concepts that incorporates physical exercise, stretching, cross-body movements and colorful, engaging floor mats. While originally designed for use in regular classrooms, many Math & Movement program components can easily fit into the PE curriculum, allowing physical educators to provide students with both a quality physical education program, and math practice.

AB  - In the present STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)-driven society, socioscientific issues (SSI) have become a focus globally and SSI research has grown into an important area of study in science education. Since students attending the social and science programs have a different focus in their studies and research has shown that students attending a science program are less familiar with argumentation practice, we make a comparison of the supporting reasons social science and science majors use in arguing different SSI with the goal to provide important information for pedagogical decisions about curriculum and instruction. As an analytical framework, a model termed SEE-SEP covering three aspects (of knowledge, value, and experiences) and six subject areas (of sociology/culture, economy, environment/ecology, science, ethics/morality, and policy) was adopted to analyze students' justifications. A total of 208 upper secondary students (105 social science majors and 103 science majors) from Sweden were invited to justify and expound their arguments on four SSI including global warming, genetically modified organisms (GMO), nuclear power, and consumer consumption. The results showed that the social science majors generated more justifications than the science majors, the aspect of value was used most in students' argumentation regardless of students' discipline background, and justifications from the subject area of science were most often presented in nuclear power and GMO issues. We conclude by arguing that engaging teachers from different subjects to cooperate when teaching argumentation on SSI could be of great value and provide students from both social science and science programs the best possible conditions in which to develop argumentation skills.

AB  - This qualitative study examines the change in a preserve program as our faculty members systematically work together to change the culture of our college to one in which everyone assists future teachers to work with ELLs. The iTeach ELL Systems Framework has promoted understanding of the interconnected nature of student learning, which includes: university/school partnerships designed to impact that learning through more effectively prepared teacher candidates, school and university organizational features, and state statutes and policy regulations. One focus of this work is to infuse problem-based learning (PBL) and ELL strategies into science methods courses. This qualitative study of efforts and approaches to reform science methods courses has identified three themes: a) Value of Agreeing on Terms (b) Value of Integrating Content and Language Learning (c) Value of Presenting a Unified Message. Successes and challenges for supporting pre-service teachers to develop knowledge of both PBL and ELL strategies are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: In the previous analysis of key informant perspectives on minority research leaders' career development factors, we identified individual and sociocultural, institutional, and federal research agency (i.e., National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research; National Institutes of Health; Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research; Office of Disability, Aging, and Long-Term Care Policy) policy and systems-induced challenges. An analysis of their viewpoints about what policy and systems-induced facilitators can be considered as actionable for increasing the pool of seasoned minority researchers was not undertaken. Here in this companion study, data collected on 15 key informants' perspectives regarding policy initiatives and strategies that can be considered by these agencies to diversify the behavioral, social science, clinical, and biomedical scientific workforce were analyzed. Methods: This companion analysis employed the same methods as reflected in the previous study. Results: Select federal research agency policy and systems-induced factors (i.e., research career pathways, social justice context, designated funding streams, and interprofessional multidisciplinary collaborations) emerged as important. Conclusions: The findings can inform the development of new or modified federal research agency sponsored field initiated strategies and internal policy and systems that could lead to an increased supply of seasoned minority investigators.

AB  - Whether celebratory or critical, STS research on science-industry relations has focused on the blurring of boundaries and hybridization of codes and practices. However, the vocabulary of boundary and hybrid tends to reify science and industry as separate in the attempt to map their relation. Drawing on interviews with the head of a research center in plant biology, this article argues that biology and biotech are "symbionts". In order to be viable and productive, symbiosis needs to be carefully managed and given room for divergence within mutual dependence. This process does not take place as the negotiation of a preexisting science-industry boundary. Rather, viability is obtained through a strategy of "circumventing" the science-industry food chain and "sequestering" biotech components within the research center. Symbiosis allows academic scientists to do biology while at the same time demonstrating entrepreneurial spirit. (Contains 2 figures and 7 notes.)

AB  - The academy is widely reported to be going through a period of transformation: not just changes to what is taught, but threats to tenure and internal funding, perhaps balanced by new possibilities for external funding and interdisciplinary projects. This article discusses a recently conducted survey of US and Canadian Philosophy departments, in an effort to understand one discipline's perspective on and reaction to these changes. The survey found that, for the majority of departments, Philosophy has largely not changed over the last decade in terms of shifts in subfields, tenure and tenure criteria, internal funding and external grant awards. However, a minority of departments are demonstrating potentially transformative possibilities, especially as related to interdisciplinarity.

AB  - The article explains how to use a project-based method as an effective means of interdisciplinary interaction when teaching a foreign language on the example of The Institute of service, tourism and design (branch) of the North Caucasus Federal University (Pyatigorsk, Stavropol Territory Russia). The article holds the main objectives of the project-based method, forming their classification. The authors point out the need to conduct pre-project work by mindfully selecting the appropriate linguistic material, developing a definite system of tasks and exercises. Another important step is the selection of general or profile topics that could be of interest to students in terms of their future profession. In addition, the article describes several out-of-class projects as well as it provides basic requirements for using the project-based method while teaching a foreign language.

AB  - The first semester Tax I student seems to be interested in the ethical issue of why citizens should report their income and only take legitimate tax deductions when it is unlikely that anyone will ever know. This paper addresses this issue from an interdisciplinary approach of accounting, philosophy, and political science. The accounting perspective discusses the issue from the expectations of the tax preparer and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The philosophical perspectives provides background of a citizen who might want to "do the right thing" for the sake of the common good. The political science perspective explores the political nature of the individual and corporate citizen and their approach to civic virtue.

AB  - Research studies using discourse analysis approaches make claims about phenomena or issues based on interpretation of written or spoken text, which includes images and gestures. How are findings/interpretations from discourse analysis validated? This paper proposes transdisciplinary convergence as a way to validate discourse analysis approaches to research. The argument is made that discourse analysis explicitly grounded in semiotics, systemic functional linguistics, and critical theory, offers a credible research methodology. The underlying assumptions, constructs, and techniques of analysis of these three theoretical disciplines can be drawn on to show convergence of data at multiple levels, validating interpretations from text analysis.

AB  - A small group of faculty at Salem State University representing the disciplines of Chemistry, Finance, Geography, Political Science, and Social Work implemented a Team-Based Learning (TBL) model in their courses to explore its efficacy for increasing student engagement. Surveys were used to collect pre- and post-data from students to determine the extent of change in their perceptions of TBL. The data showed that TBL not only heightened students' self-awareness of their learning capabilities but also revealed that students had an affinity for TBL, often preferring TBL courses over traditionally structured courses.

AB  - There is more to science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM) education than simply "participating" in the arts. True STEAM means "integrating" the arts into STEM. In recent years, some educators have been reevaluating their STEM curricula and redesigning it to incorporate the arts. Others, such as the Rhode Island School of Design, are championing initiatives, such as Stem to Steam, where teachers, researchers, policymakers, and students are spearheading a grassroots movement to integrate art and science research. Supporters contend that an integrated STEAM curriculum promotes critical thinking, and that STEAM is an important pathway to increase U.S. economic competitiveness. Whether or not a gifted child's school has yet to embrace STEAM, there are many ways parents can expose their children to STEAM principles, both at home and through outside enrichment opportunities. Patterns are a good place to start. Opportunities to explore patterns exist in the everyday environment. "Tessellations" are shapes that can fill a surface without gaps or overlaps. Origami abounds with math. Every fold can be described in mathematical terms. "Line design" allows students to use straight lines to achieve beautiful parabolas. The integration of art into math and science is a mindset, a thinking-outside-of-the-box openness, and an acknowledgement that there is creativity in every aspect of math and science if you look for it.

AB  - The characteristics of successful MOOCs were explored in this study. Thousands of student reviews regarding five xMOOCs (Massive Open Online Course) in the fields of software, science, and management were extracted from the Coursetalk website and analyzed by quantitative and qualitative methods using the Garrison, Anderson, and Archer (2000) Community of Inquiry (CoI) model. The 14 characteristics found to contribute to the success of MOOCs (e.g., teacher, atmosphere, exercise) were partitioned into the teaching, social, and cognitive presence elements. In addition, cluster analysis revealed five types of learners, based on the characteristics they mentioned for course success: atmosphere, exercise, teacher, exam, and unspecified. This divides learners into groups that may prefer social, cognitive, or teaching presence. The findings of this study negate the perception that xMOOCs mostly contain teaching presence elements. This research contributes to the understanding of characteristics that contribute to successful MOOCs and sheds light on the students, too. Listening to the voices of the students and the types of characteristics that they chose to mention, enables further exploration of their preferences and expectations regarding MOOCs and, accordingly, to future adaptation between students' preferences and MOOC characteristics.

AB  - The necessity for the development and restructuring of pharmacists' training programs to correspond their increased practical role in society has been substantiated. It has been determined that Canada for the last decade has introduced a lot of changes concerning enhancement of pharmacists' training, among which the following are of special interest: fulfillment of the training with a strict accordance with the accreditation standards, selective admission to colleges of pharmacists, assessment of students' critical thinking and teaching methods, improvement of courses content delivery, interprofessional cooperation, development of practical experimental education, clinical rotations programs, mentoring programs etc. It has been defined that accreditation standards for pharmacists' training in Canada reflect professional and educational attributes that intend to develop practicing, clinical, patient-focused pharmacists. They outline that pharmacy education of high quality depends on multiple components, including general knowledge, basic and professional sciences, and professional practice experience. The pharmacy curriculum is expected to embrace the scope of contemporary practice responsibilities as well as emerging roles that ensure the rational and safe use of drugs in the individualized care of patients. In the research it has been found out that admission of students to pharmacy colleges is organized so that to select students possessing inborn leadership skills and those of decision making. A number of techniques and tests for admission have been analyzed. Teaching strategies of theory in practice, critical thinking, clinical reasoning, inference and decision-making, which are widely used in Canadian pharmacy education, have been characterized. It has been stated that professional cooperation between medical and pharmacy students in Canada is an approach to health protection aimed at the patient and is team-based. It underlines one's strengths and skills related to health care provision and should be taken into account. Clinical experimental rotations are one more approach that should be taken into consideration by Ukrainian educators and legislators (early involvement of students to establishments for taking care of patients and rotations of both senior and junior students when the former mentor the latter).

AB  - Modeling inter-disciplinary teaching and learning practices within a critical pedagogical framework has produced powerful learning outcomes for graduates of the Primary/Middle Bachelor of Education degree at the University of South Australia. This paper explores the notion of how best to prepare beginning teachers to work with students in their middle years of schooling in Studies of Society and Environment. Of particular focus are teacher education courses that model interdisciplinary ways of working. The inquiry found that interdisciplinary course work was replicated and built upon by beginning teachers and where schools encouraged the notion of interdisciplinarity beginning teachers flourished as designers of curriculum. The authors argue that Studies of Society and Environment is currently well placed to be incorporated into interdisciplinary curriculum frameworks and assist in meeting the goals of middle schooling philosophy.

AB  - Current approaches to science-technology-society (STS) education focus primarily on the controversial socio-scientific issues that arise from the application of science in modern technology. This paper argues for an interdisciplinary approach to STS education that embraces science, technology, history, and social and cultural studies. By employing a case study of traditional papermaking technology, it investigates how the interactions between technology and science can be explored in an authentic societal and cultural context across a historical time span. The term technology-society-science (TSS) is used to represent an alternative approach to linking technology, society, and science that aims to redress the imbalance between science and technology, and to resolve the tension between two diverging goals of STS education. The educational implications of this alternative approach to STS education are discussed. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems in business environments demand multidisciplinary understanding and collaboration between functional departments. The traditional educational paradigm isolates the learning of each functional discipline as if business people operated in functional isolation. ERP system value can only be realized by collaborating across business functions. Integral to the success of ERP use is the tacit or unconscious understanding of the concepts underlying business processes and the dynamic interplay of collaborating business functions. Resistance to ERP systems often occur due to the high complexity of these business processes. This study describes an experiment in ERP based on an immersive experiential learning environment using the leading commercial ERP system to create a realistic and dynamic business situation. Multidisciplinary knowledge is measured by multiple methods of self-reported and knowledge structure assessment. Survey measures of both declarative and tacit knowledge are used to assess student learning, and standard measures assess perceived resistance to ERP use. Results show perceived complexity to be a parsimonious predictor of resistance to ERP use. Findings further support the importance of assessing tacit knowledge (gained from conceptual experiential learning), and demonstrates avenues to create a highly effective multidisciplinary learning program.

AB  - This article investigates the relationship between disciplinarity and feminist knowledge-making in Australia's humanities and social sciences. To identify the conditions of possibility for successful feminist knowledge projects, we interpret career trajectories of senior feminist and gender researchers within five disciplines: economics, history, philosophy, politics and sociology. Feminist knowledge-making about gender occurs in every field, but it has uneven impact and status in relation to different disciplinary practices. Career trajectories are analysed to understand how feminist research is practiced within, or perhaps against or beyond, conventional disciplinarity. Strategies for feminist knowledge-making vary across and within fields. Epistemic pluralism is a key possibility condition necessary for feminist knowledge-making. In fields characterized by conceptual openness (sociology, history), feminist knowledge-making can most easily be practiced as 'core' disciplinary work. In disciplines characterized by epistemic closure, feminists are carving out new subfields within (economics, politics) and beyond (philosophy) their mainstream disciplinarities.

AB  - Digital badges are graphical representations of an accomplishment. Open badges are a subset of digital badges that allow the badge owner to demonstrate achievement and the viewer to see the criteria for the badge. Open badges offer the opportunity to evidence and reward skill development, and to learn that existing formal qualifications do not. In this, the first of three articles discussing open badges in science education, the reader is introduced to the scope for using these technologies to benefit pupils, teachers and schools. Part 2 proposes a badge framework for the 'Working Scientifically' strand of the National Curriculum in England. Part 3 details a case study involving pupils aged 7-11 years in an informal education setting in which practical skills were taught overtly, using language and processes detailed in the badging framework, to facilitate the transition into secondary school science. Open badges offer the scope for explicit learning trajectories and a personalised record of skills, experience and interests to the benefit of an array of stakeholders. [For "Open Badges Part 2: The 'Working Scientifically' Framework," see EJ1248925. For "Open Badges Part 3: Framework and Strategies in Action," see EJ1248945.]

AB  - The integration of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) serves to develop creative thinking and twenty-first-century skills in the classroom (Maeda 2012). Learning through STEAM promotes novelty, innovation, ingenuity, and task-specific purposefulness to solve real-world problems--all aspects that define creativity. Lisa Fanning is a fifth-grade teacher at a public elementary school with school-wide arts integration at the core of its vision. Fanning participated in a district-wide professional development project through which she partnered with a dance teaching artist. Together with her partner, she engaged in a 12-hour workshop to develop common understandings about curricular intersections, practiced co-teaching structures, and devised essential questions to guide their lesson planning. They subsequently engaged in 24 hours of additional professional development during a summer institute to learn specific methodology in dance integration, including elements, strategies, and facilitation techniques. During the summer institute, Jamie Simpson Steele (a performing arts specialist) and Lori Fulton (a science educator) provided a framework for thinking about STEAM intersections and examples of art and science integrated experiences for teachers and teaching artists. Next, Fanning and her teaching artist partner co-planned and co-taught a semester-long inquiry to investigate this question: How does energy transform? This inquiry engaged students in hands-on activities, field-based experiences, interviews with experts, science notebooks, creative movement improvisation, dance choreography, and a call for social activism. The collaborations consisted of ten sessions of planning time and ten co-taught lessons in the classroom. Fanning's unit focused on the properties of wind and how its energy could be stored, transformed, and transferred for use. The science objective required students to describe how later when they engineered turbines). To explore the relationship among the earth, sea, and sky, students connected to their personal experiences at the beach and did further observation and research. Students converted these ideas into a model by expanding, rising, and pushing their bodies through space. Finally, students responded to the work of their peers, practicing artistic thinking by observing, describing, and interpreting each other's movements (Harris 2013). The unit culminated in a public performance with invited parents and community members. During this sharing, students performed original choreography, exhibited wind turbines, led station activities to inform their guests about the wind as a source of energy, and engaged in a mock demonstration advocating for renewable energy.

AB  - Leading scientific organizations, like the American Association for the Advancement of Science, have called for innovative approaches to student learning that incorporate "real-world examples". Drawing on writing-to-learn theory, innovative writing projects can be used when they build upon writing skills acquired from other disciplines and use creative writing in order to improve content comprehension. This paper draws on the use of narrative writing in a college-level, human physiology course to show the benefits of alternative types of writing assignments. The paper provides the creative narrative assignment learning objectives, rubrics, and examples of student work. This paper also demonstrates how to transform a conventional physiology writing project into an innovative multidisciplinary writing across the curriculum (WAC) project. Specific student writing examples are provided in the paper to show how the students interacted with the course content in a playful way as they drew from writing skills learned in other classes.

AB  - Individuals with autism spectrum disorder face significant challenges entering the workforce; yet research in this area is limited and the issues are poorly understood. In this systematic review, empirical peer-reviewed studies on employment programmes, interventions and employment-related outcomes in individuals with autism spectrum disorder over 18 years with and without intellectual disability were identified and evaluated. The review was prefaced by a summary of previous systematic reviews in the area. Web of Science, Medline, PsychINFO, ERIC and Scopus databases were systematically searched through to October 2015. From 32,829 records identified in the initial search, 10 review and 50 empirical articles, comprising N = 58,134 individuals with autism spectrum disorder, were included in the review. Selected articles were organised into the following themes: employment experiences, employment as a primary outcome, development of workplace skills, non-employment-related outcomes, assessment instruments, employer-focused and economic impact. Empirical studies were limited by poor participant characterisation, small sample size and/or a lack of randomisation and use of appropriate controls. Poor conceptualisation and measurement of outcomes significantly limited study quality and interpretation. Future research will require a multidisciplinary and multifaceted approach to explore employment outcomes on the individual, the family system, co-workers and the employer, along with the impact of individual differences on outcome.

AB  - At first glance, implementing the new Common Core Standards, with their dramatically higher learning expectations for early elementary students, may seem like a daunting task. The authors of this article think there has never been a better time for K-2 teachers to begin developing lessons that integrate all disciplines, promote higher order thinking, and make purposeful use of new technologies. Interdisciplinary instruction challenges students to think critically. It requires teachers and students to collaborate with peers and experts, both inside and outside of the school setting. Higher-level instruction also lends itself to the type of student inquiry inspired by project-based and place-based education. Both approaches are based on student inquiry into real-life questions and lead to long-term, multifaceted projects. This article explores the ongoing work of Amanda, a first grade teacher, and her efforts to integrate these ideas into a technology-based, integrated unit of study focused on school gardening. In what began as a journey to find thoughtful applications of technology in her classroom, Amanda was able to bring social studies, language arts, mathematics, and science together in a hands-on, inquiry-based unit. This article invites early elementary teachers to adapt some of these activities for their students, or to use them as inspiration for wholly new teaching activities.

AB  - The breadth of knowledge required for the multidisciplinary field of nanotechnology challenges and extends traditional concepts of multidisciplinary graduate education. There is a paucity of information, both general reporting and peer-reviewed studies, on the challenges for graduate students working in this multidisciplinary paradigm, from the students' perspectives. We report two graduate-student perspectives from different instructional models: (i) the core academic department that has expanded student choice by allowing additional classes to be taken from outside the core department and (ii) multiple departments working together to provide choice and diversity across the curriculum. We find, even after many years of multidisciplinary research, that traditional university organizational structure does not easily accommodate multidisciplinary research. In addition, administrative autonomy of academic departments and colleges, competition among various departments for contracts and grant submission, and a disconnect between research and teaching challenge multidisciplinary research endeavors. The students recommend that (i) university administrators support multidisciplinary departments and develop mechanisms to promote faculty participation; (ii) institutions and departments provide more multidisciplinary groups, centers, and institutes and encourage networking through broad collaboration; (iii) more graduate and postdoctoral fellowships for multidisciplinary research be created; and (iv) departments create more flexible curricula allowing their students to participate in more courses outside the department, necessary for a multidisciplinary thesis. Progress in multidisciplinary science will rely both on deep, specialized knowledge and, increasingly, on scientists who can speak a number of scientific languages and take advantage of synergistic connections. As new and more effective approaches to multidisciplinary training are developed, perhaps it is time to listen more to those with the most intimate experience of the system's successes and failures--the students who are training now to be the next generation of research leaders.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: This paper investigates the factors contributing to student IT self-leadership in online education using an exploratory study. Specifically, our goal was to understand whether the instructors' transformational IT leadership and the students' personal innovativeness with IT contributed to student IT self-leadership. Background: The study was conducted in an online course. While today's students are expected to be IT natives, they still lack the skills to find and learn technologies on their own. This is problematic for both online education and students' future careers. Directed-teaching methods are not appropriate to solve this kind of problem, a more constructivist teaching method is appropriate. We recommend that instructors adopt transformational IT leadership to set norms around technology use, to be role models in using online course technologies with utmost knowledge, and to encourage and support the students in their use of IT. Methodology: An exploratory research is conducted with 46 students in an online management information systems course at a public university. The data were analyzed using PLS structural equation modeling technique. Contribution: This paper introduces the unique concepts of student IT self-leadership and instructors' transformational IT leadership by adapting concepts from the self-leadership and transformational leadership theories. IT self-leadership refers to the ability to intentionally influence one's own thinking, feeling, and actions toward the use of IT to reach one's work and life goals. To increase IT self-leadership, students should try new technologies as much as possible. Instructors should set up norms about trying new technologies, troubleshooting one's own issues, and play a supportive and encouraging role, rather than employing directed-teaching methods. Findings: IT self-leadership skills are the ability to intentionally influence one's own thinking, feeling and actions towards the use of IT to reach one's work and life goals. The findings show that instructors' transformational IT leadership as well as students' innovativeness with IT contributes to students' IT self-leadership. Recommendations for Practitioners: Practitioners may consider exhibiting transformational IT leadership skills including: (1) giving encouragement about IT use; (2) fostering trust; (3) encouraging thinking about IT problems in new ways; (4) being clear about their values about IT by practicing what they preach in their IT use; and (5) inspiring students by being highly competent in IT. Potential ways that the instructors can exhibit these skills are discussed in the paper. Recommendation for Researchers: Researchers are recommended to include IT-self leadership of both students and instructors in their investigations on learning success. Furthermore, the inclusion of transformational IT leadership in new studies of teaching and learning success is recommended. Impact on Society: This paper includes students as part of the solution to challenges students face in online courses rather than treating them like passive recipients of educational changes. Thereby, it helps teachers and students to work together for a better solution to educational disruptions. Future Research: Studies should be conducted to determine other antecedents and outcomes of IT self-leadership. Research is needed on specific ways practitioners can increase their IT transformational leadership. While this paper introduced how the instructor of the exploratory study provided transformational IT leadership, more than one way of reaching each goal was practiced. Future research should test the connection between each transformational IT leadership behavior presented here and its outcome.

AB  - This paper sets up a scenario about Rebecca, a jobseeker, who is a fictitious composite, a "typical" candidate who wants a position at a college/university. A job description is provided. She interviews for the advertised position, and while doing so, she also interviews the university, school/department, and working environment to see if there is a match with her goals. She goes about her own interviewing using observational, interactive, and analytic approaches, which are described. Rebecca had to clarify her goals in terms of interdisciplinarity, collegiality, and the kind of community that she ideally wants. She found shortfalls between what was advertised and the actual program and also the setting in which she ideally would like to work. This is problematic for her, but she is pragmatic and knows she needs a job. The scenario ends with Rebecca exploring her options. This paper will be of interest to anyone seeking an environmental job in academia.

AB  - The contents of the Greek magazine "Physicos Cosmos" include science popularization, teaching proposals, and issues of educational concern. The magazine is addressed to teachers of physics and, consequently, to grammar-school pupils/students. Its articles ranged, in general, from short texts taken from physical sciences to more specialized articles. During the period under consideration (1975-1977), i.e., after the fall (1974) of the military government (1967-1974) and the outset of the educational reform, the magazine's subjects changed, comprising interdisciplinary proposals in relation to the philosophy of physical and natural sciences, their history, their social usefulness, and their connections with non-scientific culture. Some new approaches concerned particularly school geography as a multidisciplinary field.

AB  - The background for my research project is to look closer at how social sciences such as history, geography and civic life can be taught outside the classroom by using tablets as a tool. This paper looks closer into how tablets can be used as a learning recourse in an interdisciplinary project outside the classroom. I will follow a group of pupils that are used to using iPad in all subjects to see how they, in small groups, use their tablets outside the classroom. I will see how they use their tablets for orientation, collecting information and documentation. The methods used is observation, interview, and video documentation. The project spans from work inside the classroom to prepare for the task outside, and after the project has come to an end I will document how they work with it inside the classroom. The aim of the analyses will be to describe how the pupils use the tablets, from a socio cultural perspective, as a tool for learning. [For the complete proceedings, see ED579190.]

AB  - This research aimed to explore the effect of problem-based STEM activities on middle school students' perceptions related to problem-solving skills and their critical thinking tendencies. The sample consisted of 81 students. A mixed method was employed in the research. The quantitative data collection tools were the "Critical Thinking Tendency Scale" and "The Perception Scale for Problem Solving Skill." The qualitative tools were a Semi-structured Interview Form and Experience diaries developed by the researcher considering the quantitative scales. While the quantitative data, obtained in the research, were analyzed with one-way ANOVA, the statistical method; and the qualitative data were analyzed with the content analysis. At the end of the research, a significant difference was detected in favor of experimental groups in the students' perceptions of their problem-solving skills and critical thinking tendencies. On the other hand, in the qualitative results, it was reported that the problem-based STEM education created a positive effect as cognitive maturity and innovativeness in the students' feelings, thought, and behaviors. It was concluded that the students used the inter-disciplinary knowledge with the problem-based STEM activities; found the problem solving, understanding the problem and working with their friends favorably. According to these results, it can be claimed that STEM education is highly effective in developing the skills that are expected from individuals in the 21st century such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and social interaction.

AB  - Core concepts can be integrated throughout lower-division science and engineering courses by using a series of related, cross-referenced laboratory experiments. Starting with butane combustion in chemistry, the authors expanded the underlying core concepts of energy transfer into laboratories designed for biology, physics, and engineering. This integrative approach can lead to a better understanding of why energy-transfer steps are involved in metabolism, along with the acquisition of better laboratory skills.

AB  - This bibliometric study used citation analysis to uncover citing characteristics in the burgeoning academic field of emergency management. Of the 281 degree programs listed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency nationwide, those at community colleges accounted for 17% of the total. Using the interdisciplinary database of Academic Search Complete, a sample of 5,099 citations was collected from 146 articles published between 2002 and 2012. The most strongly represented disciplines revealed by the analysis were Social Science, Science/Technology, and Medicine. A majority of citations (45%) came from academic journals, with nearly half (44%) of those from Social Science. When citing outside of their discipline, medical and science/technology journals cited most often from Social Science, 70% and 12%, respectively. This study also finds the 20 most frequently cited journals, which will be of help to collection development and subject librarians.

AB  - Charles Wheatstone was a British scientist who is most often remembered for his association with the Wheatstone bridge for measuring electrical resistance. A painfully shy man in public, Wheatstone, in reality, possessed a vibrant personality and a wide array of personal interests from acoustics to electricity to optics and parlour tricks. In this paper, I look to the lifetime of Charles Wheatstone as a major influence in the blending of science, art, and culture. Most assuredly, Wheatstone's influences were wildly extensive, yet poorly known. I'd like to pull back the curtain of some of the unique achievements of Charles Wheatstone and suggest that many of these accomplishments can be used in the teaching of science, especially in terms of the blending of science, art, and culture. As part of this illustration, I will uncover a unique connection of Wheatstone to surrealism.

AB  - Quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) experiences during the early years provide young learners with a critical foundation for future learning and development. Engineering design is a context that can be used to facilitate connections and learning across STEM, however there is limited research examining the use of engineering design-based STEM integration within the early childhood classroom. This study examines how an engineering design-based STEM integration unit was enacted across three kindergarten classrooms. Classroom observation and video data were collected and a coding scheme was used to document the ways that engineering and engineering design were enacted as well as the role of the teacher and students within the lessons. Results suggest that kindergarten students were able to meaningfully engage in and with multiple stages of an engineering design process while also building understanding of scientists and engineers related to teacher and student interactions, there were multiple instances of student-initiated talk, student to student response, the use of explicit engineering language and of students making connections to prior learning. This suggests that the enactment of engineering design in early childhood should incorporate multiple aspects of engineering and engineering design, include interdisciplinary content and provide a context for STEM integration.

AB  - Engineering design has been suggested as a viable instructional approach for Technology Education (TE) to intentionally provide students the opportunity to apply multidisciplinary concepts to solve ill-defined design challenges (Wells & Ernst, 2012; Sanders & Wells, 2010; Wicklein, 2006). Currently, the context for design challenges in TE typically relate to modern technology (Grubbs, 2013) or societal needs (Love & Strimel, 2012). However, as technology advances exponentially, one issue for technology educators is consistently conceptualizing design challenges that prepare students to use new technologies while providing relevance and interest. Three-dimensional (3D) printing provides an entry point for teaching engineering concepts, such as design and optimization, while also affording opportunities for learning science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) concepts (Bull, 2014). Fused deposition modeling (FDM) printers, in particular, allow TE students to turn virtual models of innovative products into physical prototypes. Thus, students can produce and evaluate their model, make modifications to their existing digital concept, and rapidly reprint a refined prototype. This technological advancement, alongside the inclusion of design within other STEM disciplines, presents a strong rationale and vehicle for addressing design in TE.

AB  - The 1970s witnessed the deepening of marketization because of the introduction of reform and opening up in China. Profound changes were observed in the ties among Chinese industry-featured universities, government competent authorities and the market. Faced with ever-evolving environment, China University of Geosciences (CUG) managed to transform itself from a single-discipline-group geological college to a multidisciplinary university with geological disciplines as its major feature, with integrated development of multiple disciplines. Drawing on the Second Curve Theory, this research presents a case study on CUG, with the strategic change concepts, practices, accomplishment and effects in various stages of its transformative development comprehensively covered and analyzed, making an attempt at summarizing features and implications of its strategic change. Findings of this research reveal that being adept at grasping well the timing for university change, establishing clearly-defined shared vision, developing the system of school running concepts and strategic planning, stressing management on strategic process and clearly identifying roles among leaders at all level, prove to be pivotal to the strategic change of CUG. The strategic change analysis framework of university transformative development could further add insights to theoretic discoveries in this field, and experience could be provided to transformative development of Chinese universities, and even those in other countries in the world.

AB  - Early mobility in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) can improve a multitude of patient outcomes, and occupational therapists (OTs) play a valuable role as part of the interprofessional team, with the ability to address activities of daily living, functional cognition, psychological and communication needs, and more. In 2022, the first iteration of an ICU interprofessional education simulation (Sim-IPE) yielded poor outcomes for OT students. This study aimed to modify existing pre-learning activities in the Sim-IPE's second iteration to improve OT students' perceptions and professional role awareness in interprofessional ICU care. Students from Doctor of OT, Bachelor of Science Nursing, Doctor of Physical Therapy (PT), and Associate Program Respiratory Therapy programs from one university participated in an ICU Early Mobility Sim-IPE with enhanced pre-learning activities and environmental modifications targeting OT student outcomes. Investigators employed a mixed methods approach, including pre/post quantitative analysis through the SPICE-R2 instrument and qualitative analysis of OT students' written reflections. Quantitatively, OT students (n = 12) demonstrated significant improvement in SPICE-R2 scores from pre- to post-Sim-IPE, as well as significant improvements when compared to OT student scores from the first iteration. Qualitatively, OT students reflected improved role awareness when compared to OT students from the first Sim-IPE, however, continue to struggle with role assertion and ambiguity, particularly with PT students. This study improved the OT students' Sim-IPE experience; specifically, role awareness and perceptions of interprofessional practice. Residual challenges in role assertion and ambiguity offer opportunities for future intervention and research.

AB  - While the collaborative trend among professional social workers and librarians gains traction and attention, literature about the utilization of student social workers partnering with libraries is non-existent. Over 64,000 students are currently enrolled in master-level social work (MSW) programs throughout the United States and nearly all are required to complete at least 900 hours of fieldwork. Such students provide untapped skills, knowledge, and values that can help address the broader--and very real--needs of patrons. By reaching out to MSW programs, public librarians play a critical role in helping advance tolerance for a diversity of people and much-needed services. While the professional values and ethics of both librarianship and social work have strong overlap, librarians can invite social work students to partner with them; particularly as libraries are still considered nontraditional service points. MSW students can work with libraries to expand programing, strengthen outreach, and enhance the professional development of both social workers and librarians to the benefit of marginalized patrons.

AB  - This article critically analyzes under-acknowledged influences on the recent turn toward emotions, happiness, and well-being in higher education generally and in writing studies specifically: positive psychology (the science of happiness) and positive education (teaching well-being). I provide an overview of their primary features and complicate their assumptions, values, and goals. I also highlight their overlap with and implications for writing studies, including connections and shared concepts between writing and well-being, the central role of writing in positive psychology and positive education pedagogies, and the potential for writing studies to critique and influence well-being education. I argue that embracing emotion as a key component of our pedagogy and scholarship introduces ideological commitments that may challenge and even undermine our personal and professional beliefs. Positive psychology and positive education deserve our sustained attention, and any consideration about emotions in composition will need to confront these movements' influential version of teaching well-being.

AB  - Learned societies play a number of roles in countries around the world, including national representation of the research community; recognising and rewarding research achievement; and as funding agents for fellowships, research grants or research institutes. They have a networking role both within national research communities and in linking with international networks, and can provide a national and neutral forum for academia, government and industry. The roles learned societies play reflect their national context and history, and this article outlines the context, history and approach of the Royal Society of New Zealand, as a multidisciplinary national academy, encompassing science, social science, technology and the humanities.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformative potential to support the education of students with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities (M/SID) and their teachers. Although research and evidence-based practices (EBPs) are integral to fostering positive student learning outcomes, educators face challenges in effectively implementing these strategies. In this article, we discuss how higher education faculty can prepare educators to harness the use of AI as a powerful tool to support the implementation of EBPs in the classroom, addressing teacher fluency and maintenance of application.

AB  - Discipline-based education research (DBER) conducted by faculty within geoscience departments can address identified needs in undergraduate geoscience education. This study explores the evolution of undergraduate geoscience education research (GER) from 1985 to 2016, primarily in terms of the types of published research and secondarily in terms of the insights this literature offers on the evolution of GER as a scholarly discipline. Stokes' (1997) quadrant model of research types is used as a theoretical framework for the former and Kuhn's (1970) model of disciplinary paradigm for the latter. An exploratory sequential mixed-methods approach to a systematic literature review of 1,760 articles is utilized. The period 1985-2000 is characterized by proto-research as evidenced by the abundance of instructive and informational education articles rather than research articles. From 2000 to 2011, GER underwent a growth period characterized by the presence of applied, use-inspired, and pure basic research. The period 2011-2016 appears to be a period of relative steady-state conditions in the normalized number of GER publications per year. Existing gaps in knowledge about geoscience education, the evident unfamiliarity with education and social science research methodologies among authors of GER articles, and efforts to build consensus about what GER is and how to conduct it suggest that GER is preparadigmatic or at a low paradigm state. That is, GER is an immature discipline as far as the evolution of a discipline goes. A path forward is proposed for the continued evolutionary growth of GER. This study provides new perspectives on the emergence of GER as a discipline that can be used as a basis for studies on cross-disciplinary DBER comparisons.

AB  - Imaging techniques provide ways of knowing structure and function in biology at different scales. The multidisciplinary nature and rapid advancement of imaging sciences requires imaging education to begin early in the biology curriculum. Guided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap initiatives, we incorporated a nanoimaging, molecular imaging, and medical imaging teaching unit into three 1-h class periods of an introductory course on ways of knowing biology. Activities were derived from NIH Roadmap initiatives in nanomedicine, regenerative medicine, and nuclear medicine. The course materials we describe contributed positively to student learning gains in quantifying and interpreting images, in characterizing imaging methods that provide ways of knowing biological structure and function, and in understanding scale in biology and imaging. The NIH Roadmap provides a useful context to educate students about the multidisciplinary imaging continuum. (Contains 3 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - The last two decades have seen unprecedented interest in science curricula, with many governments seeing improvements in the performance of their school students in science as key to future economic prosperity. We present the results of an analysis of the curriculum documents for primary and secondary science in Australia (New South Wales and Queensland), Canada (Alberta and Ontario), Finland, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai and the United States (Florida and Massachusetts). Beyond our specific findings, we note a degree of convergence across these 11 very different jurisdictions. The Asian ones have made and are making changes to encourage students to be more creative and better able to apply their science knowledge and develop their scientific literacy; the "Western" ones are becoming more knowledge focused.

AB  - New technologies and data science are transforming a wide range of organizations into analytics-intensive enterprises. Despite the resulting demand for graduates with experience in the application of analytics, though, undergraduate education has been slow to change. The academic and policy communities have engaged in a decade-long conversation about the need for and more effective ways to boost the number of college graduates with degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (the STEM fields). But this broader transformation will require many more college graduates, including those with non-STEM degrees, to be proficient in the application of analytics in their fields. This need provides higher education with an opportunity to take a fresh look at the skills of liberal arts graduates and the value of liberal arts degrees. This article highlights the following points: (1) Employers from all sectors seek "data-enabled" professionals who possess a deep understanding of--and are current on analytical methods relevant to--their disciplines; are familiar with technology; and can interact, analyze, communicate, and work with people from other disciplines and cultures; (2) By confining data science to graduate and upper-level undergraduate courses in engineering or computer science, colleges and universities are inadvertently reducing the diversity of the pool of data-science-enabled professionals; (3) Liberal-arts programs need to include the development of STEM skills in non-STEM graduates. Some institutions have accordingly created majors, minors, concentrations, and digital-infused curricula in disciplines such as library science, media, and the arts; and (4) Graduate programs aimed at individuals with data-science expertise gained through work experience and with skills in both STEM and non-STEM fields are rapidly expanding, particularly in business and health care. The Business-Higher Education Forum has helped develop both graduate and undergraduate programs in cybersecurity that can serve as models.

AB  - The aim of this study is to provide theoretical and practical knowledge about strategies and techniques for training primary school education pre-service teachers (PSTs) for Pedagogical Improvisation (PI). Data was collected during two iterations of cross-disciplinary art/science school interventions in Norwegian 3rd-grade classes, which provided a framework for a process based on Educational Design Research theory. Data included interviews with PSTs (n = 11), and their reflection notes, following their participation as practicum educators in the interventions as well as in separate PI rehearsal sessions in a controlled classroom environment. PSTs' experiences and perceptions were coded and analysed, leading to the development of a theoretical model on which future trainings for classroom improvisation may be based. Implications for improvisation as an integral part of teacher education, its professionalization, and areas for further research are described as conclusions.

AB  - Large systems of statistical physics often display properties that are independent of particulars that characterize their microscopic components. Universal dynamical patterns are manifested by the presence of scaling laws, which provides a common insight into governing physics of processes as vastly diverse as, e.g., growth of geological formations and processes underlying social patterns. Here, the author provides highlights from this vibrant arena of interdisciplinary research and suggests that times call for augmenting undergraduate physics curriculum. (Contains 10 figures.)

AB  - Music can be defined as the art (or science) of blending vocal and/or instrumental sounds to produce form and harmony. This paper is about the mathematics which underlies both music theory and how different instruments create sounds/notes. Consideration will be given to scales, intervals, and harmonics but not rhythm although it is a fundamental component of all music. The mathematics of rhythm is often obvious, as in the time signature that closely resembles a fraction, but not always so simplistic. David Watkins uses this presentation to his mathematics students who have an interest in music.

AB  - "BIO2010" put forth the goal of improving the mathematical educational background of biology students. The analysis and interpretation of microarray high-dimensional data can be very challenging and is best done by a statistician and a biologist working and teaching in a collaborative manner. We set up such a collaboration and designed a course on microarray data analysis. We started using Genome Consortium for Active Teaching (GCAT) materials and Microarray Genome and Clustering Tool software and added R statistical software along with Bioconductor packages. In response to student feedback, one microarray data set was fully analyzed in class, starting from preprocessing to gene discovery to pathway analysis using the latter software. A class project was to conduct a similar analysis where students analyzed their own data or data from a published journal paper. This exercise showed the impact that filtering, preprocessing, and different normalization methods had on gene inclusion in the final data set. We conclude that this course achieved its goals to equip students with skills to analyze data from a microarray experiment. We offer our insight about collaborative teaching as well as how other faculty might design and implement a similar interdisciplinary course. (Contains 5 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify critical components for service science curricula that address the unique competency needs of the service sector. Design/methodology/approach: The method for this investigation included a comprehensive review, analysis, and synthesis of service science, as well as service science management and engineering (SSME) related literature. As human capital is of unique importance in this business sector, particular emphasis was placed on examining the need for human resource development-related content in service science curricula. Findings: Expansion of the services sector globally has been unprecedented. "Some analysts predict that by 2020, services will account for 50 percent of world trade" (Downe et al.). Yet a global shortage of graduates with the skills needed for success in service sector jobs has been forecast. Compounding this talent shortage is the relatively small number of degree programs available to prepare professionals for service sector jobs. Because the growth in the service sector has outpaced improvements in productivity, quality, and innovation, and there is a lack of skilled talent to address these challenges, increasing attention is being placed on service science curricula. Originality/value: Given the economic importance of, and current deficiencies in, the service sector it is poised to make a significant impact by improving service science education.

AB  - Live-in college residential life positions often involve extensive and diverse responsibilities including the support of residential students experiencing traumatic life events. While live-in staff undergo extensive training in regard to supporting these students, they are often ill-equipped to understand and prevent potential negative consequences associated with trauma support work including burnout, compassion fatigue, and secondary traumatic stress. Given the increase in students reporting traumatic life events including sexual violence, severe economic hardships, and severe mental health disabilities, it follows that live-in residential life staff are being called on more frequently to serve as first responders and support personnel for these students. Current literature highlights the potentially deleterious impact of trauma support work on helping professionals, but few publications exist that highlight ways to prevent these effects within a residential life context. This article looks outside of the higher education literature to explore how a related helping profession, social work, provides training and education to social work practitioners in order to mitigate potential negative outcomes stemming from their work with individuals experiencing trauma.

AB  - This examination of early gerontology journals identifies the multidisciplinary backgrounds of contributors, methods of investigation, nascent theory development, and formative themes and controversies. Through use of content, thematic, and critical analyses of second year issues of "The Gerontologist," "Educational Gerontology," "Research on Aging," "Journal of Applied Gerontology," and "Canadian Journal on Aging," this study highlights the influence of these journals on the formation of the discipline of gerontology. The analyses indicate that education and awareness of ageism, policy planning to address changing demographic patterns, cultural diversity, and disciplinary development were key themes in these early publications. The study also reveals that researchers and scholars in the social sciences and health sciences established the foundations of the discipline. Controversies were evident in various debates about knowledge formation and dissemination. The early journals further included diverse perspectives, theories, research methods, directions, and critiques of issues of age, aging, and the aged. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Despite calls for investigations that explore the efficacy of integrating literacy into science instruction, few researchers have conducted this cross-disciplinary research. Therefore, this study focused on determining the impact of a literacy-based approach to teaching science on secondary students' attitudes toward science and their achievement and engagement in physical science. This inquiry also focused on determining any differential effects for girls since females are often marginalized in science instruction and discouraged in choosing science careers. This mixed-methods study used quantitative measures and methods to determine the efficacy of integrating science and literacy and qualitative methods to describe the instructional activity in three experimental teachers' chemistry classes. Findings demonstrated the positive impact of integrating literacy into science on students' inquiry skills and improved attitudes toward science for girls. Appealing elements of the instructional activities are identified and described. Implications are provided for instruction and recommendations are offered for future research. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - This study investigated graduate students' perceptions of their graduate college experiences. Participants were 1704 masters and doctoral students across colleges and disciplines at a research university. They completed questionnaires reporting their perceptions of their teaching and advising faculty, academic programs, centralised services, social experiences, career preparation, self-efficacy and identity development. Results are reported for the whole group as well as for subgroups by degree type (masters, doctoral), by point-in-program towards degree (entrance, mid-point, exit) and by disciplinary clusters (hard sciences, social sciences, arts, interdisciplinary). An overall pattern in trajectory of perceptions was highest at entrance, a drop at mid-point, and some recovery at end-of-program. Three characteristics were significantly different by degree type, all higher for doctoral than masters students: satisfaction with program of study, satisfaction with academic advisor; and perceptions of professional competence and identity development. Additionally, three characteristics were significantly different by point-in-program, all lowest at midpoint: satisfaction with overall graduate experience; satisfaction with program of study; and perception of career preparation. Significant interactions were demonstrated between degree type and point-in-program for: satisfaction with academic advisor and interaction in the academic community. Significant disciplinary differences were demonstrated for all perceptual characteristics "except" satisfaction with program faculty and satisfaction with career preparation. All students reported lower levels of interaction and involvement in the academic community than for any other variable.

AB  - In this nascent age of massive online education, it is important to recognize that the goals and successes of a liberal arts education have been to provide an intellectual array of ideas that build critical thinking skills and to engage a new generation of students with society's great challenges and vast opportunities. Nowhere are these opportunities richer than in the basic research questions being posed every day at a research university. In this paper, we argue that the goals of a liberal arts education and undergraduate research are remarkably similar and that by incorporating an undergraduate research focus with a liberal arts approach in the classroom, instructors can more effectively achieve the goals of both. We present the example of ORDER (On Recent Discoveries by Emory Researchers), a series of multidisciplinary, team-taught seminar courses for freshmen and seniors. We argue that ORDER's unique structure provides students with effective opportunities to achieve the core goals of a liberal arts education and a research education, namely to enhance the ability to think critically and draw connections, engage in research as a process, pursue authentic investigation of real-world problems, develop interdisciplinary and collaborative skills, and present ideas creatively.

AB  - This article explores the role of the Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC) in facilitating and encouraging a collaborative community of junior and senior scholars on issues of technology and humanistic learning. As a result of its emphasis on collaboration and discussion, HASTAC encourages a form of collective intelligence that can serve as a model for future iterations of online communities formed to address problems and highlight advances in teaching and technology. Written from the perspective of a graduate student who also is a HASTAC scholar, the article discusses the positive impact HASTAC can have in terms of opportunities for professional advancement for junior scholars, as well as encouraging collaboration across disciplinary boundaries on issues relating to teaching methodologies, the humanities, and technology.

AB  - The American University of Beirut's Interfaculty Graduate Environmental Sciences Program was launched in 1997 as a means of addressing salient issues on the environment and development in Lebanon and the Arab World using an interdisciplinary approach. The programme adopts a student-centred learning approach and aims to develop critical and systems thinking skills to produce socially and environmentally conscious leaders and agents of change in the Arab World. In this paper, we provide an evaluation of the programme's ESD dimensions using the criteria of interdisciplinarity, local relevance and competence-based learning. This is followed by a critical analysis of the programme's potential for use as a model in the Arab World. We find that, while the model may be useful in providing inspiration and a good practice case, its transfer "as is" to institutions of higher education in the Arab World or even in Lebanon is unlikely, and perhaps undesirable, in view of the inherently diverse nature of Arab universities.

AB  - While interest and activity in health informatics continues to increase worldwide, concerns about the most appropriate educational preparation for practice also arise. Health informatics is an interdisciplinary field that pursues effective use of data, information and knowledge to support effective decision making; in the health field, those efforts are directed toward improving healthcare. Recent trends suggest that there is now sufficient activity in health informatics for it to emerge as a field in its own right distinct from its parent disciplines. Several professional associations are pursuing accreditation processes that will exert control over health informatics education, but currently no similar moves have been made by the information professions. Although some educational programs for health informatics are located in health sciences schools, schools of information science have an important role to play, particularly in educating health informationists. The authors urge information science educators to engage in dialogue with other health informatics stakeholders to ensure that the core principles and values of the information sciences are retained in health informatics, and that no one field exerts professional control to the exclusion of others.

AB  - Fluid mechanics (FM) is a core course of the chemical, mechanical, civil, and aerospace engineering programs. Students have both theory and practical classes in FM. The general expectation is that students should be able to demonstrate the fundamentals learnt in theory and get hands-on experience during the lab course. In this regard, students were asked to make a video of application of FM in day-to-day life based on the fundamentals learnt in the classroom and to post it on the Facebook (FB) page entitled "Fluid Mechanics Videos." For the first time, FB is used as a teaching-learning-assessment tool in the FM undergraduate course. The primary objective was to create interest and passion about chemical engineering among students. Students made videos on different topics of FM, including fluid statics, properties of fluid, applications of mass/momentum/energy equation, and flow through a porous medium. Students opined that they felt confident in designing a storage tank, pipe, and unit operations equipment (e.g., packed bed, fluidized bed, and agitator) after taking this assignment. Through this assignment, students were able to design and conduct experiments. In addition, it gave them a chance to assess their communication ability, work with multidisciplinary teams, and understand contemporary issues. The author was involved right from ideation to preparation of video to its final upload on FB. Based on this pilot study, it can be hypothesized that social networking sites (SNSs) can only supplement, enhance, and strengthen the traditional classroom process, but can never replace it. SNSs can be best used innovatively for assignment, homework, group project, preparatory class, and team activities.

AB  - The work of artists as naturalists, scientists, documentarians, and explorers has long been part of an interdisciplinary approach to scientific studies. As museum educators, this group of authors has gained inspiration from the exhibition Vanishing Ice: Alpine and Polar Landscapes in Art, 1775-2012 (Matilsky, 2013) and discovered how historical and contemporary artists document and communicate the stunning landscapes of alpine and polar regions, portraying dramatic alterations resulting from climate change. Here, they present projects to introduce upper elementary students to the important role that artist-naturalists play in science, while exploring three themes: relationships of people to the land, art as a pedagogical tool in exploratory and scientific expeditions, and art as activism.

AB  - A STEAM curriculum integrated with science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics would help gifted students actively explore and integrate knowledges across the fields. In this study, a program "the Chant of Joy Dadaocheng" was designed by five teachers from various fields for students to explore historical culture, produce creative artworks, and present their performances. 15 students identified through the Identification Committee Board for gifted and talented students in Taipei City participated the program. After 5 days enrichment activities, a semi-structured interview, behavior observations, script, and artworks were collected to assess the learning outcomes. The data collected were coded, classified, and interpreted. The results indicated the participated students could derive new ideas from the historical and cultural context through artworks, props, music, choreography, stories, and sentiment; they were able to transform inspirations from learning experience into creative presentation; and exhibited cross-disciplinary literacy, creativity and problem-solving ability.

AB  - This research investigated the potential for curricula at the intersection of the arts and the sciences to develop creative productivity of students. The purpose of this research was to develop a series of rubric assessments to evaluate the content and creative and higher order thinking on a variety of teacher-made lesson plans and student-made products. The research used an iterative process to identify the criteria for the rubrics. The content validity process involved the use of experts in the domains of art and science education, assessment, and creativity to identify important themes from the research base of each domain. Then the process continued to teachers of cross-curricular lesson plans, to provide insights into usefulness of the constructs in practical contexts. The final instrument was used to evaluate cross-disciplinary student products. These works of art were evaluated by a sample of art teachers with over 5 years of experience. The art teachers had attended professional development offered by the Innovation Collaborative evaluator on arts integration and the rubric. The resulting inter-rater reliability estimates ranged from moderate to excellent, for each of the four rubrics. The resulting rubrics can be used to assess work in research or classroom environments.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this country report is to offer an overview of civic and citizenship education in Spain. Approach: The report analyses the Spanish curriculum and the current legislative framework, examining the way social and civic competences are integrated in both primary and secondary education. Additionally, the paper also examines the latest educational reform, establishing a comparison between how citizenship education was addressed in the curriculum until 2013 and the way a cross-curricular approach has been adopted since then. Findings: The paper has been able to establish a clear difference between two political and educational conceptions. On one hand, from 2006 to 2013, the Spanish government introduced "Citizenship and Human Rights Education" as a core subject linked to a broader approach to traditional civic education. After the 2013 reform, the new government favoured instead a cross-curricular orientation that avoided references to the idea of citizenship and limited the scope of civic education. A discussion is provided regarding what policy reforms can be expected in the near future in Spain.

AB  - Continued agricultural productivity hinges on understanding how to manage soil resources. A 2-week undergraduate introductory-level module: "A Growing Concern: Sustaining Soil Resources Through Local Decision Making" was collaboratively developed through the InTeGrate Project. InTeGrate modules and courses engage students in grand challenges of sustainability (e.g., agriculture, water, and climate) using active learning strategies. In "A Growing Concern", students examine physical and chemical distinctions between intensively managed agricultural landscapes (e.g., conventional tillage) and natural vegetative types. They analyze geospatial and soil profile data to identify how intensive land management threatens soil sustainability. After exploring land practice and climate impacts on soil, they create extension-style fact sheets that provide recommended practices to reduce soil erosion. To maximize accessibility, we piloted the module in three settings: (1) an interdisciplinary Ecological Agriculture course at a Land Grant Institution, (2) a Geology of the Critical Zone course at a 4-y college, and (3) an Introduction to Environmental Science course at a 2-y community college. Classroom observations using the reformed teaching observation protocol revealed that the instructors used reformed teaching practices. Students also commented favorably on the hands-on nature of the module within focus group sessions. All students passed the culminating fact sheet, which was aligned with the rubric used in module development. Students had some difficulty interpreting site-specific geologic data and applying systems thinking. Revisions to instructional materials emphasized local data and greater systems diagramming.

AB  - Asia today is the center of tremendous growth. With the continued rise of China and the influential roles of Japan and South Korea in international affairs, it is no wonder that the 21st century has been dubbed the Asian century. Outside of these influential political actors, one also see the growing political significance of Southeast Asia in world affairs, led by the city-state of Singapore and by Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim state. While there is much to be hopeful for across the region, potential conflicts are also latent, from disputed islands off the eastern shores of the Asian continent to the unresolved strategic challenge on the Korean Peninsula. Asia, truly, is a central region of international affairs today, politically and militarily. California State University, San Bernardino offers three major courses related to Asian cultures and one elective, "East Asian Politics" (PSCI 305). The course is one of the elective political science courses within the subfield of comparative politics. It has been taught three times at CSUSB, with approximately 35 students per course. Approached from a multidisciplinary perspective, including history, geography, and politics, the seminar offers an introductory overview of East Asian politics, focusing on significant countries in the region, analyzing domestic and foreign politics, and examining the policies and actions of nation-states within the region. Countries of study include Japan, Indonesia, China, Taiwan, Singapore, North Korea, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam. This article provides an overview of the course.

AB  - Published evaluations of career preparation of alumni from long-standing postdoctoral fellowship programs in the biomedical sciences are limited and often focus on quantitative analysis of data from extant publicly available sources. Qualitative methods provide the opportunity to gather robust information about specific program elements from structured postdoctoral training programs and the influence of this training on subsequent career paths of alumni. In-depth interviews with a subset of the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Prevention Fellowship Program (CPFP) alumni (n = 27), representing more than 25 years of the program's history and multiple career sectors, were conducted to assess alumni reflections on the training environment and career preparation during their time in the CPFP. NVivo software was used to analyze data and identify major themes. Four main themes emerged from these interviews, including: the value of structured training curriculum, mentorship, transdisciplinary environment, and professional identity. Even when reflecting on training that occurred one to two decades earlier, alumni were able to highlight specific components of a structured postdoctoral training program as influencing their research and career trajectories. These results may have relevance for those interested in assessing how postdoctoral training can influence fellows throughout their careers and understanding salient features of structured programs.

AB  - In this commentary on this issue's focus article by Baird et al., Pellegrino focuses first on the fundamental nature of educational assessment and its connection to theories, models, and data on learning. He then discusses the contemporary views of learning in the form of learning progressions as they relate to assessment development. In the third part of his commentary, he considers the continuum spanned by the classroom to international large-scale assessments in the context of levels and timescales of assessment. Lastly, he considers some implications of a focus on learning for the design and use of assessments at the two levels discussed and contrasted by Baird et al.--the classroom and the level of large-scale international programs. He concludes with a discussion of the "Two Disciplines Problem," address by Lee Cronbach in 1957 and considers why it has been so hard to achieve progress in bringing together the science of learning with the science of assessment. [This article is a commentary on Jo-Anne Baird, et al.'s "Assessment and Learning: Fields Apart" (EJ1149539).]

AB  - Current debates around the concept of boundary crossing stress the importance of boundary objects in bringing people together to share understandings. We argue that the boundary object is of secondary importance, and that what is important for the transformational potential of interdisciplinary understanding is opportunities for "boundary experiences". We present three examples of interdisciplinary boundary experiences: the first describes a collaboration between an education academic and speech and language therapists; the second presents a research opportunity experienced by a group of education, architecture, and sociology academics, alongside practising architects and educators; and the third reflects on the process of co-production involving academics from education, medical education, cultural and heritage studies, sociology, music, and social computing. We argue that engaging in shared landscapes of practice, when accompanied by opportunities for dialogue and for developing relationships, creates meaningful moments of service, and thus has transformational potential. However, we believe that this necessitates a new way of thinking about research methodology. We advocate a co-production approach that is grounded in developing and maintaining relationships, and routinely provides opportunities for boundary experiences. This requires a more open and flexible approach to research design than is currently usually promoted within academic research infrastructures.

AB  - Within the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education community there are repeated calls for the reform of undergraduate teaching. Resulting change efforts often focus on developing and disseminating specific instructional ideas and practices to individual faculty. However, in this paper, the authors argue that these efforts need to be expanded to include more emphasis on faculty involvement in the change process, as well as on the environments and structures within which faculty work. They present four core change strategies that frame a broad span of considerations for enacting and sustaining new educational programs: (1) disseminating curriculum and pedagogy, (2) developing reflective teachers, (3) developing policy, and (4) developing shared vision. These strategies emerged from an interdisciplinary literature review of hundreds of articles in faculty development, STEM education research, and studies of higher education.

AB  - The number of students who learn English as a second language (ESL) in U.S. schools has grown significantly in the past decade. This segment of the student population increased by 56% between the 1994-95 and 2004-05 school years (NCLR 2007). As the ESL student population increases, many science teachers struggle to tailor instructional materials, resources, and teaching strategies to facilitate ESL student learning. With this issue in mind, the authors examine the challenges ESL students experience in learning science and provide a lesson plan and assessment to overcome the obstacles ESL students face in the science classroom. The authors then summarize teaching strategies effective for ESL students' science learning based on research findings and their teaching experiences. (Contains 1 figure and 2 activity worksheets.)

AB  - The broad question that interests this article is how does one read and compare the negotiations public and private universities are making with the neo-liberal paradigm of knowledge production with reference to their social science curricula. Michael Apple's (1993, "Teachers College Records," 95(2), 222-241; 2001, "Currículo Sem Fronteiras," 1(1), i-xxvi) argument that curriculum is not a 'neutral assemblage of knowledge' but a crafted vision of 'legitimate knowledge' produced by hegemonic powers within society forms the theoretical foundation for this article. To understand the changes within a university's academic practice, this article analyses and compares the undergraduate and postgraduate sociology curricula of two public universities (Delhi University and Ambedkar University), an international university (South Asian University) and one private university (Shiv Nadar University), as well as engages with its practitioners to assess the everyday within these universities. The undergraduate and postgraduate sociology curricula across public and private universities indicate certain convergences in their academic approaches. The universities in question encouraged foreign university collaborations, reframed the course structure to strengthen the university-industry linkages and increased the employability of the students. Interdisciplinary and contemporary papers are offered through new modes of pedagogy. The mode of assessment also focus on writing research papers/dissertations and frequent visits to the field to develop an application-based approach to learning. The neoliberal paradigm of knowledge production affected the convergence of academic practices of public and private universities despite difference in governance structure. This convergence problematises the meaning of 'public' in a liberalised, privatised and globalised society.

AB  - The themes discussed in this study relate to how students reason about the information encoded in rate constants, which is important for developing a deep understanding of chemical kinetics at the molecular level. This study is part of a larger project centered more generally on students' understanding and use of mathematics in chemical kinetics. During semistructured interviews, students--36 general chemistry students, five physical chemistry students, and three chemical engineering students--worked through chemical kinetics problems and were asked to discuss equations used in chemical kinetics, yielding rich data that provided insight regarding students' understanding of rate constants. Analysis revealed that students often conflated ideas from chemical kinetics and equilibrium, such as rate constants and equilibrium constants. Furthermore, students demonstrated varying levels of sophistication regarding the distinction and relationship between rate and rate constants. Finally, students conveyed different ideas about the mathematical nature of the rate constant quantity. These findings suggest students need more support in order to develop a more sophisticated understanding of rate constants.

AB  - The study aimed to develop a cross-disciplinary integrative STEM (i-STEM) robotics curriculum by the thematic integration approaches of webbed and threaded models, and to understand high school students' cognitions, attitudes, and interests in robotics STEM after the instruction. The concurrent mixed methods including quantitative experimental design and embedded qualitative design were adopted in the present study. Participants were 42 students, with 17 females and 25 males in a high school class. The students were grouped with 2 members in each group, and there were totally 21 groups. The results revealed that cognition for seven fields were significantly improved. Among the seven fields, sailboat design improved the most, while mathematics and computer programming improved the least. The students' attitudes and interests in robotics STEM were significantly enhanced. The students' interests in engineering design were significantly enhanced the most, programming was the second; continuous study of engineering, science, or technology was the third; jobs related to engineering or programming was the fourth; and robotics was the least enhanced. Finally, the implications for teacher teaching and student learning practices were proposed.

AB  - Developmental disorders are a complex concept relevant to the multidisciplinary approach of children with special educational needs. The person with a developmental disorder is affected both by integrity -- the complete somatic and psychological structure and functionality -- and the ability to be a psycho-biological wholeness, the two aspects being in close interdependence. Developmental disorders are inherent in children with disabilities, but can also occur under the conditions of a normal intellect, for example, in the form of learning disabilities. In both situations, developmental disorders lead to increased learning and adapting to school requirements difficulties, imposing the implementation of a system of services appropriate to the individual needs of children with developmental disabilities that satisfactorily support the global integration effort.

AB  - The study investigates the relationship between pre-service teachers' scientific literacy (SL) and their environmental literacy (EL). It also seeks significant differences in SL at different levels of a tendency towards life-long learning (LLT). With the world facing critical environmental problems, an interdisciplinary approach to teaching science and environmental issues may help students to regulate their learning, foster curiosity, and stimulate their motivation to learn, all of which would influence their overall SL. For this pre-service teachers' understanding of SL with respect to the environment is important. The scores from tests that assessed pre-service teachers' SL and EL were analysed for correlation. Findings from the study show that pre-service teachers' SL is correlated with four dimensions of EL, environmental knowledge, environmental attitudes, perception of environmental uses, and environmental concern. Analysis of the data also reveals a significant difference between the SL of participants in the first and third levels of four levels of LLT, while there is no significant difference between the SL of participants at other levels. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Land Acknowledgements have become a ubiquitous part of universities. They purport to remember, honor, and bear witness to the future of Indigenous nations and to recognize the land and honor local Indigenous communities. While acknowledging the Indigenous peoples upon whose lands we work is an essential gesture, the authors join other scholars who argue that we must go beyond a mere statement. The Land Acknowledgement must also propel the learning community of the institution to take action, to embrace relationships with the environment (land), and to take responsibility for its care for Indigenous generations to come. Our attempts to recognize the importance of Indigenous epistemologies and commitments to the land have enriched the whole learning environment of the University. This report describes the interdisciplinary, collaborative approach we have been taking as we attempt to go beyond the mere performance of acknowledgement towards making substantive change. At the time of writing, the authors live on the traditional territories of the Hasinal and Wichita, Caddo, Comanche, and Cherokee Nations.

AB  - Team projects are a way to expose students to conflicting project objectives, and "[t]here should be a strong real-world element...to ensure that the experience is realistic" [ACM/IEEE-CS 2015b]. Team projects provide an opportunity for students to put their education into practice and prepare them for their professional careers. The aim of this special issue, and the previous one, is to collect and share evidence about the state of practice of team projects in computing education and to help educators in designing and running team projects. The articles presented in the present issue cover the following topics: real projects for real clients, open source projects, multidisciplinary team projects, student and team assessment, and cognitive and psychological aspects of team projects.

AB  - Although vacuum technology is essential to many aspects of modern physical and analytical chemistry, vacuum experiments are rarely the focus of undergraduate laboratories. We describe an experiment that introduces students to vacuum science and mass spectrometry. The students first assemble a vacuum system, including a mass spectrometer. While assembling the vacuum system students learn about the components and the conditions necessary to operate a mass spectrometer. Then students use their assembled system to explore mass spectrometry; they use the mass spectrometer to diagnose vacuum conditions, then collect the mass spectrum of an unknown organic molecule, and propose the identity of the molecule.

AB  - Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) is a term seen almost daily in the news. In 2009, President Obama launched the Educate to Innovate initiative to move American students from the middle to the top of the pack in science and math achievement over the next decade (The White House, n.d.). Learning about the attributes of STEM and how they are connected can help promote innovation (Holt, Colburn, & Leverty, n.d.). Teachers involved in STEM education must take the challenge of learning more about the STEM areas and begin showing students how they are connected. To begin this transformation, the author asserts that teachers must become STEM Thinkers who can show their students how STEM is involved in most of the products and systems they use in their daily lives. STEM Thinking can be defined as "purposely thinking about how STEM concepts, principles, and practices are connected to most of the products and systems we use in our daily lives." At the collegiate level, STEM education encourages students to pursue STEM careers in order to meet the growing need for trained professionals in these areas. The focus of this article is on teachers at the primary and secondary levels (i.e., P-12) who are involved in teaching about one or more of the STEM areas in their classrooms. These teachers, who come from a variety of STEM education areas, are typically involved in using hands-on and inquiry-based learning strategies that challenge students to solve real-world problems and explore their curiosities of the natural and human-made worlds. In today's schools, teaching about STEM can take place in many general education and career and technical education subject areas such as agriculture, science, health, technology and engineering, and family and consumer science. This article begins by explaining why it is important for teachers to become STEM Thinkers. It goes on to provide background on the term STEM and STEM education. Next, becoming a STEM Thinking teacher and the components of STEM are discussed. This is followed by a discussion of inquiry-based learning strategies used by STEM Thinking teachers and how STEM Thinking teachers can put STEM Thinking into action in the classroom.
