AB  - Practice-led research in art and design has now come of age and can take its place alongside other forms of research at the academic "high table". It no longer needs to be treated with "special consideration" as a new form of intellectual enquiry. The research craft developed by those involved in practice-led research admits them to a broader community of practice engaged in questioning the conceptual basis of how we perceive and make sense of the world around us. The objective/subjective divide that preoccupied an earlier generation of academics has eventually been replaced by a more nuanced epistemological framework able to embrace PhDs that include non-textual artefacts as part of their exposition. An increasing number of academic institutions around the world have taken up the debate and now participate in practice-led research programmes. However, for early-career researchers in these fields there are still many hurdles to overcome, some of which are unique to this form of endeavour, as we outline. This article has been developed from a series of seminars and workshops presented by the authors to early-career practice-led researchers as part of their Project Dialogue programme which seeks greater engagement between the arts and sciences.

AB  - Students need to achieve automaticity in learning mathematics without sacrificing conceptual understanding of the algorithms that are essential in being successful in algebra and problem solving, as well as in science. This research investigated the relationship between science-contextualized problems and computational fluency by testing an instructional method that was implemented as a non-traditional drill exercise. The study employed a quantitative analysis of pre- and post-test scores of Turkish middle and high school students after two interventions. The questions addressed were: Do the science-contextualized drill practices (SCP) improve students' computational fluency better than traditional drill practices (TP)? Is there any statistical significance between middle and high school students in terms of their benefit from SCP? This study showed that science-contextualized drill exercises produced higher gains for both middle and high school students' computational fluencies than the traditional context-free drill exercises.

AB  - This paper describes a new severe weather laboratory exercise for an Introductory Weather and Climate class, appropriate for first and second year college students (including nonscience majors), that incorporates inquiry-based learning techniques. In the lab, students play the role of meteorologists making forecasts for severe weather. The exercise is designed to teach students how to identify the atmospheric conditions that promote severe weather and how to prepare a severe weather forecast. We utilize collaborative learning in the lab exercise where students are encouraged to work in teams to accomplish the class assignment. Working in teams teaches students about how modern interdisciplinary science is conducted, as well as creates accountability for students to learn the material and complete their share of the work. Our results show that important content knowledge is maintained in comparison with a traditional lab and that students found the new lab more engaging.

AB  - In this paper, we recommend mathematical teaching through dual treatments. The dual treatments notion, classified in dual interpretations, dual analyses, dual solutions, and dual formulations, is explained through concrete examples taken from mathematical textbooks of elementary education. Dual treatments provide opportunities for creating different points of view on a mathematical situation and thus developing the integrative perceptions of the students. Teaching through dual treatments for integrative perceptions formation was evaluated during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 academic school year periods. Data were evaluated using ANOVA and t test analyses. The study, involving 205 students in the first grade of the elementary education, demonstrated that mathematical teaching through dual treatments (1) influences the integrative perceptions formation; (2) there is no significant difference between girls and boys after the implementation of teaching through dual treatments in integrative perceptions formation.

AB  - Metabolism is a dynamic, simultaneous, and integrative science that cuts across nutrition, biochemistry, and physiology. Teaching this science can be a challenge. The use of a scenario-based, visually appealing, interactive, computer-animated CD may overcome the limitations of learning "one pathway at a time" and engage two- and four-year college students in a deep understanding of integrative metabolism.

To this interdisciplinary task I turn to Delphi for help, in which we can program a digital video as a multimedia element. I show an example from the programming of plain multimedia elements until we get to the first efficient step in the processing of the video. High-school students who are learning programming in Delphi are able to understand the presented source code because it is not too complicated. A bibliography is included.

AB  - The College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Framework for Social Studies State Standards calls upon social studies teachers to enhance the rigor of civics, economics, geography, history and the other social studies disciplines while building the critical thinking, problem solving, and participatory skills of students to help them become actively engaged citizens in the twenty-first century. Like the Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards, the C3 Framework emphasizes the acquisition and application of deep content knowledge through an inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning. The Four Dimensions of the C3 Framework center on the use of questions to spark curiosity, guide instruction, deepen investigations, acquire rigorous social studies content, and apply knowledge and ideas in real world settings. This article suggests ways in which teachers can chart a course toward implementation of C3, review the progress that is made, and identify obstacles to accomplishing the objectives. For teachers, the process of implementation can be a journey of examination and reflection on their own teaching practices. The results of success can be dramatic: to enliven the study of civics, economics, geography, and history so that these subjects are exciting, engaging, rigorous, and meaningful to students. Two accompanying reproducible handouts focus on initiatives that schools can take to implement the C3 Framework by identifying instructional shifts that will need to be made, and developing a plan of action.

AB  - To meet the ever-changing needs of students in the modern world, forward-thinking educators are crossing the traditional borders of their own disciplines to work with colleagues from other fields to develop novel approaches to teaching. Examples of cross-disciplinary efforts illustrate both the creativity of their participants and the promise and excitement that they hold for students: Biochemists are working with business faculty (Keller and Cox 2004), philosophy teachers are collaborating with physicists (Jordan 1989), and mathematics instructors are teaming up with music teachers (Bamberger 2000). Similarly, English language teaching (ELT) professionals are reaching out to colleagues from other disciplines (including health, history, humanities, math, psychology, science, social studies, and sociology) at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels to develop innovative courses, materials, and instructional approaches. This article shares insights gained from the authors' interdisciplinary work in the hopes that other ELT professionals might benefit from them. The authors discuss specific steps that can be taken to ensure successful partnerships as they focus on three key areas: (1) initiating an interdisciplinary project; (2) establishing an interdisciplinary team; and (3) working successfully with other disciplines. The discussion is organized around nine ELT scenarios and numerous English idioms that illustrate many issues that could arise in the course of interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - Questionnaires in educational research assessing students' attitudes and beliefs are low-stakes for the students. As a consequence, students might not always consistently respond to a questionnaire scale but instead provide more random response patterns with no clear link to items' contents. We study inter-individual differences in students' intra-individual random responding profile across 19 questionnaire scales in the TIMSS 2015 eighth-grade student questionnaire in seven countries. A mixture IRT approach was used to assess students' random responder status on a questionnaire scale. A follow-up latent class analysis across the questionnaire revealed four random responding profiles that generalized across countries: A majority of consistent nonrandom responders, intermittent moderate random responders, frequent random responders, and students that were exclusively triggered to respond randomly on the confidence scales in the questionnaire. We discuss the implications of our findings in light of general data-quality concerns and the potential ineffectiveness of early-warning monitoring systems in computer-based surveys.

AB  - We describe an eight-week summer Young Scientist in Training (YSIT) internship program involving middle and high school students. This program exposed students to current basic research in molecular genetics, while introducing or reinforcing principles of the scientific method and demonstrating the uses of mathematics and chemistry in biology. For the laboratory-based program, selected students from Baltimore City Schools working in groups of three were teamed with undergraduate research assistants at Morgan State University. Teams were assigned a project that was indirectly related to our laboratory research on the characterization of gene expression in "Caenorhabditis elegans". At the end of the program, teams prepared posters detailing their accomplishments, and presented their findings to parents and faculty members during a mini-symposium. The posters were also submitted to the respective schools and the interns were offered a presentation of their research at local high school science fairs.

AB  - This article describes protocological rhetoric as a conceptual tool for exploring and changing institutions. Protocological rhetoric is an extension of two lines of thought: Porter, Sullivan, Blythe, Grabill, and Miles's institutional critique and Science & Technology Studies's (STS) concept of information infrastructure. As a result, protocological rhetoric imagines institutions as networked information infrastructures. This article describes the method and provides an example through historical case study. I suggest that the approach provides methods for actively transforming institutions.

A literature review on the diverse forms of assessment currently used for community service types of experiential learning in higher education is presented in this paper to review their appropriateness in assessing experiential learning. The paper also describes the assessment framework of the University of Hong Kong Sichuan Reconstruction Community Service Project, which is incorporated into a multidisciplinary community service learning project. Feedback from students and teachers are reviewed to gauge their preferences towards these assessments, as well as their opinions on assigning academic credits to experiential learning projects.

AB  - Biotechnology is an innovative field that is consistently growing in popularity. It is important that students are taught about this technology at an early age, so they are motivated to join the field, or at least motivated to become informed citizens and consumers (Gonzalez, et al, 2013). An increase in biotechnology knowledge can result in an increase in scientific and technological literacy, which benefits society as a whole. Standard 15 of "Standards for Technological Literacy" (ITEA/ITEEA, 2000/2002/2007) states that, if society is going to "answer [questions about biotechnology] responsibly, its members must have a basic understanding of biotechnology and the resulting products and systems involved" (p. 151). This article discusses the reasons why biotechnology is not being taught, ways to deal with these problems, why it should be taught in schools, and the best ways to teach it.

AB  - As we rapidly approach the 50th year of the much-celebrated "cognitive revolution", it is worth reflecting on its widespread impact on individual disciplines and areas of multidisciplinary endeavour. Of specific concern in this paper is the example of the influence of cognitivism's equation of mind and computer in education. Within education, this paper focuses on a particular area of concern to which both mind and computer are simultaneously central: educational technology. It examines the profound and lasting effect of cognitive science on our understandings of the educational potential of information and communication technologies, and further argues that recent and multiple "signs of discontent", "crises" and even "failures" in cognitive science and psychology should result in changes in these understandings. It concludes by suggesting new directions that educational technology research might take in the light of this crisis of cognitivism.

AB  - In the United States, culturally responsive computing is a framework that aims to support broadening the participation of racially and linguistically diverse children in computing and technology education through bottom-up interventions that are community-oriented, technology rich, and culturally dynamic. Despite the important role that youth sports play in many local neighborhoods and communities across demographic groups there is only a small amount of research on developing culturally responsive computing education that incorporates these activities. We report findings from a culturally responsive computing collaboration between computing education researchers and coaches, mentors, and academic staff who ran a youth boxing program that predominantly served African American children. The purpose of the collaboration was to learn about and represent the adults' expertise and knowledge in the co-development of culturally responsive computing activities. Using an emergent mixed methods research design, we collected qualitative data (i.e., interviews and group discussions) and quantitative data (i.e., pre- and post-surveys) throughout the collaboration. We analyzed these data to study how coaches, mentors, and staff members brought their knowledge and expertise to bear on the co-development of culturally responsive computing activities for the youth boxing program. Our findings show how the coaches, mentors, and academic staff used their expertise and knowledge in ways that leveraged boxing culture to go beyond boxing itself in the co-development of the activities. In addition, even when connections between computing and boxing did not appear authentically motivated this did not negate the adults' engagement with the culturally responsive computing project. These findings have implications for anti-deficit theorizing about authenticity and inauthenticity in the co-development of culturally responsive computing in youth sports contexts. The construction of authenticity in culturally responsive computing might be less understood as a direct translation from community into education and more so as a negotiation between locally defined demarcations of what is considered authentic and inauthentic.

AB  - The integrative learning ethos pervades modern higher education. Broadly speaking, this aims to produce well-rounded, adaptable graduates suited to a range of working environments. In a more narrow sense it should produce students that are able to make connections across learning experiences and achieve learning at the highest cognitive level. Our study made use of field courses, which are uniquely placed to offer students integrative learning experiences. Although cognitive gains for students on field courses have been demonstrated previously, this study investigated whether students appreciate the integrative learning gains that students may achieve and applied these findings to the design of a new field course. This course specifically targeted integrative learning outcomes that we subsequently assessed. We found undergraduate students surveyed across three departments at the University of Nottingham recognised that field courses facilitated integrative learning in both the narrow and broad sense. Importantly, students themselves realised the integrative learning gains associated with attending a field course. We found this was also true for the newly designed field course. Overall, we found that field courses offer valuable integrative learning gains, and that these are recognised and appreciated by students. These findings provide strong support for continued offering and increased provision of field course modules in the sciences.

AB  - Recent advances involving high-throughput techniques for data generation and analysis have made familiarity with basic bioinformatics concepts and programs a necessity in the biological sciences. Undergraduate students increasingly need training in methods related to finding and retrieving information stored in vast databases. The rapid rise of bioinformatics as a new discipline has challenged many colleges and universities to keep current with their curricula, often in the face of static or dwindling resources. On the plus side, many bioinformatics modules and related databases and software programs are free and accessible online, and interdisciplinary partnerships between existing faculty members and their support staff have proved advantageous in such efforts. We present examples of strategies and methods that have been successfully used to incorporate bioinformatics content into undergraduate curricula.

AB  - The integration of career and technical education (CTE) and academic curricular content that capitalizes on natural and inherent connections represents a challenge for CTE professionals. The purpose of this study was to employ Bloom's revised taxonomy (Anderson, Krathwohl, Airasian, Cruiskshank, Mayer, Pintrich, Raths, & Wittrock, 2001) to describe the learning objectives CTE programs operationalized in order to integrate science concepts into classroom and laboratory instructions. The findings illustrate that while 66% of the participating CTE programs were integrating CTE and science curricular content, 88% of the specific integrating learning objectives utilized were characterized as addressing only lower order cognitive processes. It was found that higher order CTE and science integrating learning objectives that addressed procedures or techniques were virtually nonexistent and none of the objectives reviewed addressed metacognitive knowledge. Overall, the findings indicate that the integrating learning objectives that were reviewed tended to be concrete, simple, and have prescribed outcomes.

AB  - This paper examines the meta-theoretical status, basic determinants, interests, conditions and directives of theory development in contemporary intercultural education (IE). It identifies functions and main objectives of IE at the macro-, mezzo- and micro-levels of society, interdisciplinary approaches associated with the discipline, as well as its relations with other sub-disciplines of the educational sciences (i.e. international and comparative education, peace and civic education, as well as its contribution to global, European and regional education). Special attention is devoted to the analysis of national, racial-compensatory, civic and cultural borderland-oriented paradigms, as well as political and historical conditions determining the direction of IE development in particular countries. There are also distinct under-represented areas of interest in IE. In the conclusions of the paper, suggestions are offered for re-constructing IE due to the unique changes and challenges we face in today's world.

AB  - Nanotechnology refers to the research and technology development at the atomic, molecular, or macromolecular levels, in the length scale of approximately 1-100 nanometer range, that provides a fundamental understanding of phenomena and materials at the nanoscale and creates and use structures, devices, and systems that have novel properties and functions because of their small and/or intermediate size. Nanotechnology research and development includes manipulation under control of the nanoscale structures and their integration into larger material components, systems, and architectures. This article presents the various developments made in the field of nanotechnology. One such endeavor is the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), a top science and technology priority established by the National Science and Technology Council. The NNI supports a broad range of scientific disciplines, including physics, chemistry, biology, materials science, and engineering. With the creation of the NNI, nine "grand challenges," or fields, were identified to provide a framework for advancing nanotechnology: (1) Nanostructural materials by design; (2) Nano-electronics, optoelectronics, and magnetics; (3) Advanced health care, therapeutics, and diagnostics; (4) Nanoscale processes for improving the environment; (5) Efficient energy conversion and storage; (6) Microcraft and robotics; (7) Bio-nanosensors; (8) Applications in economical and safe transportation; and (9) National security.

AB  - Healthcare information technology is at a crossroads today. As legacy data systems converge with bleeding edge technologies, the technology environments of today's hospitals and clinics are evolving rapidly, producing new care delivery models. As a result, we need to reassess how information technology education is meeting the needs of healthcare practitioners and institutions. The recent push to adopt Health Information Technology (HIT) with financial incentives and penalties attached was a bold move, but establishing policies is easier to pen than implement. The challenge faced by many healthcare organizations is the lack of technical and organizational infrastructure, as well as skilled man power. This special issue seeks to bring new approaches to the IT classroom, particularly with HIT curriculum, training, and education. Students entering the workforce or completing professional programs will have more career options with an understanding of how to leverage enabling technologies. Those in a healthcare management and leadership capacities will also benefit from this special edition as each of the articles presented address strategic level issues and the need for IT leadership in the planning and implementation of enterprise level systems, to ensure the safety, privacy and security off all patients are protected. The authors of this special issue offer interdisciplinary perspectives on key topics shaping HIT around the world. As members of academia, curriculum is at the heart of the matter and our authors offer justification and case studies on areas where academia needs to continue its growth to serve the healthcare industry.

AB  - Many educational researchers across the United States have found that inquiry-based learning (IBL) supports the development of deep, meaningful content knowledge. However, integrating IBL into classroom practice has been challenging, in part because of contrasting conceptualizations and practices across educational fields. In this article, we (a) describe differing conceptions of IBL, (b) summarize our own studies of IBL in three fields of education, (c) compare and contrast the processes and purposes of IBL in our studies and fields, and (d) suggest numerous opportunities for cross-disciplinary collaborations on IBL curriculum, teaching, and research that could bolster its inclusion in K-12 education. We ground our exploration in knowledge-generating conceptualizations and practices in these fields.

AB  - We describe a workshop in which 10 teachers from 10 schools, located in central Israel, participated in the development of alternative assessment tools in the context of implementing a new science curriculum for senior high-school students, namely "Science for All" (an STS type curriculum). In order to assist a group of teachers (who began teaching the "Science for All" program) in both teaching and assessment strategies, it was decided that the Department of Science Teaching at the Weizmann Institute of Science would sponsor a workshop for them. An evaluation study was conducted during the workshop and at its completion. The main goal of the study was to evaluate the outcomes of the workshop and to determine whether its objectives were attained. The research tools consisted of (a) an attitude questionnaire administered to participating teachers, (b) structured interviews with the teachers, (c) structured interviews with students, and (d) an attitude questionnaire  administered to the students. Based on the results of the questionnaires and the interviews, it seems that all the teachers who participated in the workshop gained self-confidence in using the teaching strategies and assessment methods of this new interdisciplinary curriculum. The interviews with students revealed that their active involvement in their own assessment improved their sense of responsibility for their achievements. The variety of assignments enabled them to be at their best with certain assignments and to succeed less with others. In conclusion, we found that running a new interdisciplinary curriculum requires a professional development program that will stimulate teachers' creativity and diversify the instructional strategies that they use in the classroom. Such skills should improve their ability to understand the goals, strategies, and rationale of the curriculum, as well as their students' learning difficulties.

AB  - Previous research on capstones in sociology and psychology has suggested that there is a typical capstone experience required by three quarters of all four-year colleges and universities in the United States. This article reports results from a national survey that confirm that sociology and psychology capstone courses conform generally to a common format. The findings further indicate that factors related to student limits and time limits predominate with respect to those variables that produce less successful course outcomes. A review of the social science capstone literature and the pedagogical best practices literature suggests that student limitations and time limitations can be attenuated by curricular, structural, and resource-allocation changes.

AB  - Nanotechnology is an emerging science that involved in different fields. This research inquired elementary school students' learning effect by using quasi-experiment, expositive-teaching and experiential-teaching methods for nanotechnology in the microcosmic world. By utilized the pretest "Nanotechnology Situational Questionnaire (NSQ)", we have selected 110 fifth grade students with similar academic performance in nanotechnology knowledge from Northern Taiwan. This research designed 2 teaching steps. The first step had 4 class sessions, and then implemented the expositive-teaching to all the students. The main learning context was related to understand nanometer definitions, characters and fundamental concepts. The second step divided 110 students into treatment and comparison groups, each group had 3 class sessions. The treatment group implemented experiential-teaching, on the other hand, the comparison group implemented expositive-teaching by PowerPoints, animations and movies. After the experiment, the 2 groups completed posttest NSQ. The results showed: 1. Two groups were no difference in posttest NSQ score after the first step teaching, but after the second step teaching, the treatment group had significant higher scores than comparison group. It meant that experiential-teaching method was more effective than the expositive-teaching. 2. In expositive-teaching: (a) Used actual objects, students held more complete concepts and had significant learning effect. (b) The simulated model teaching facilitates learning, but students somewhat still had vague concepts. (c) Applied a simulated model to explain another simulated model, students can hardly understood difficult concept, so they still had misconceptions. Therefore, before teaching, teacher must considering cognitive development and selecting teaching methods carefully. For extensive nanotechnology education and foster talents, educators must adopting nanotechnology into formal elementary curriculum and designing a series of complete teaching plan.

AB  - Current opinion holds that school science has not been producing the expected outcomes. Highlighted by a considerable body of research, one of the concerns is that young people still mobilize a naive conception of science. Consequently, we must pursue the reflection process concerning ways of renewing the school conception of science so as to propose ways of representing and doing that are a greater source of participation among students. In this article, we argue for the importance of enriching school discourses by mobilizing a socialized conception of science. Our perspective seeks to highlight the major theoretical contributions of ethnomethodology put forward by Bruno Latour. Hence, we propose an operational definition of the social construction of science based on actor-network theory as an attempt to produce a more focused conceptualization of science as a social enterprise. This theoretical work enables us to bring out various facets of the social construction of science that, in our view, should be accounted for in classes to renew the school image of science in line with the characteristics of contemporary technosciences "in the making." Finally, we illustrate how we can mobilize this understanding of science for secondary students. (Contains 5 footnotes.)

This case study discusses how a departmental curriculum committee in Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering at Iowa State University adapted the collaborative assessment protocol used in Washington Center's national project on Assessing Learning in Learning Communities to meet curriculum committee goals. These goals included developing a strategy for examining engineering students' interdisciplinary understanding across the curriculum and for ensuring that assessment efforts would support program improvements designed to give engineering graduates the specialized knowledge and abilities named by the National Academy of Engineering. As a means to help students achieve critical learning outcomes by aligning curriculum, instruction, and assessment, the curriculum committee undertook a comprehensive review of student work at different levels by posing the question, "what suggestions might we offer to this student to deepen or develop the work?"

AB  - As technology and science advance, the boundary between the disciplines begins to blur, emphasizing that it is now, more than ever, a requirement to have a solid background in multiple fields to fully understand emerging scientific advances. As faculty, we need to equip our undergraduate students not only with an introduction to these modern concepts, but also with the ability to apply them in future careers. In order to address this need, we have begun collaborating with faculty outside our individual fields to help educate students in the classroom and aid in our research projects. Specifically, we have combined undergraduate research students from both biology and mathematics departments to work together on projects requiring input from both perspectives. Students work side by side performing experiments, analyzing data, and teaching each other pertinent background information. Students benefit from this research since they encounter real-world data sets whose analysis requires knowledge beyond the typical textbook examples. In addition to performing experiments, students participate in journal clubs to stimulate discussion of experiments and to improve data analysis skills. This type of collaborative learning can also be applied to small classroom settings. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - In this study, international research collaboration (IRC) and international research orientation (IRO) have been studied at the micro-level of individual academics from the university sector (N = 8,466, 11 European systems). Both were studied cross-nationally, cross-disciplinarily, and cross-generationally. This study differs from most existing internationalization literature in its sample (Europe) and focus (patterns of internationalization in research), using more standard methods (a multivariate model approach). It addresses questions about the patterns of IRC and IRO, international publishing, and the predictors of IRC, or what makes some European academics more prone to collaborating with international colleagues in research than others. In the context of changing incentive and reward systems in European academic science, which are becoming more output oriented, it is ever more important for individual academics to cooperate internationally (as well as to co-publish internationally). "Internationalists" increasingly compete with "locals" in university hierarchies of prestige and for access to project-based research funding across Europe. Evidence is presented that co-authoring publications internationally is still a rare form of research internationalization in Europe (50.8% of academics co-author publications internationally). However, as compared with other world regions, the percentage of European academics collaborating internationally in research (63.8%) is very high. A striking cross-national differential within the youngest European generation of academics was found, which may be a strong barrier to intra-European research collaboration in the future.

AB  - Multidisciplinary courses are being developed at a number of US colleges and universities to highlight the connections between the rise or fall of world civilizations and the sustainable or unsustainable uses of soil and water resources. The content presented in these courses is complex because it includes concepts from disciplines as varied as geology, soil science, politics, economics, history, and anthropology. The learning goals for the courses include developing skills in the critical analysis of complex "real-world" problems for which there is often no simple or correct solution. Didactic materials for such courses are limited. Field trips to sites around the world that present some of the issues covered in the course would be ideal, but are logistically challenging. We considered that a series of virtual field trips (VFTs) to sites around the world would allow us to present students with complicated real-world situations, with which to practice critical analysis skills. The VFTs envisaged are neither tutorials nor field/lab exercises. Rather, they are meant to be complex, multi-faceted representations of a past or current civilization and how it affects or is affected by its environment. We expect that the students will use the VFTs to explore the relationships between physical geography and culture and how the decisions or actions of a civilization impact natural resources and the environment and thus affect its fate. A goal of the VFTs is that through consideration of their experiences, students arrive at novel associations that lead to dynamic in-class dialogue about the material presented and a deeper understanding of the intricacies of the situation in the field. This article describes the process of assembling a VFT, and analyzes the technological and didactic choices the process requires. Our experience with a pilot VFT suggests that no single medium (i.e., video clips, interactive maps, animation sequences, etc.) is comprehensive enough to meet the course learning goals. Thus, a web-based, open architecture format was selected for the VFTs because of its simplicity, flexibility and extensibility. Each medium was selected for its ability to support the course learning goals. The learning process was mediated by the VFT text, questions for thought, and in-class discussions. Preliminary results with the pilot VFT are encouraging. (Contains 7 figures.)

AB  - This ethnobiological study aims to document and discuss original knowledge that local people develop based on the climate, local ecology, culture, and tradition in order to sustain their society. An ethnobiological survey on Raji people was conducted in Uttarganga village of Surkhet in Western Nepal with a view to understanding what medicinal, animal and plant species the Raji community uses for treating different ailments, thereby exploring the traditional indigenous knowledge practiced by them. Data were collected through interviews with key informants (Dhami, Jhakri, and Gurau) and through group discussions. The study revealed that the Raji community has deep respect for its indigenous knowledge, such as biodiversity conservation, agricultural practice, medicinal practices for livelihood, yeast making practices, and art, craft, and technology. The implications of their worldview are then discussed within the context of higher education. In particular, we highlight the possibilities of using research like this to rethink curricula and pedagogy, as well as research and scholarship about higher education.

AB  - A quality children's literature program needs to be correlated with ongoing science lessons and units of study. It can enhance and enrich the science curriculum. Pupils tend to enjoy reading library books and the the literature may assist pupils to explore topics in greater depth. In addition to science experiments, demonstrations, and multi-media, children's literature is another avenue of learning science concepts and generalizations. Voluntarily, pupils may pursue personal interests and purposes in science (Ediger and Rao, 2005).

AB  - Transformative Learning Theory is a framework proposed by Mezirow (1991). It asserts that through reflection, active learning, and placing ourselves in uncomfortable situations students are able to develop their understanding of the world and of themselves, allowing a potential change to their perspectives and frames of reference. On the other hand Experiential Learning is defined as the type of education whereby knowledge and meaning are contextualized in actual experiences, as often found in study abroad programs (Perry, 2011). The very nature of study abroad involves international travel and experiencing unfamiliar environments, which when combined with effective programming can promote concrete learning. Through applying the basis of experiential learning to the potential outcomes of transformative learning, it may be possible to further direct educational programming in study abroad for the better. Since the outcomes of both experiential and transformative learning are in alignment with those desired in study abroad, it is appropriate to use them both as frameworks to assess the effectiveness of a variety of study abroad models. In this article, the authors suggest that experiential learning can provide guidance on designing study abroad programs to include activities that are "more hands on" and as such is an indicator of program type, whereas transformative learning theory contributes not only to program design, but also to assessing potential outcomes of these international experiences. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of program type (considering experiential components) and length on transformative learning outcomes. As such, this study uses transformative learning theory (Mezirow, 1991; 1997; 2003) and experiential learning theory (Kolb, 1984; Kolb & Kolb 2005) as combined conceptual frameworks. An online survey design was used to collect data from college students enrolled in 2012 summer study abroad programs through a large south-eastern US university. These programs included faculty-led study abroad and exchange programs ranging from one-week to one semester in length. The survey instrument consisted of a fixed-choice and open-ended response format questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). The quantitative data showed that almost all of the students achieved some level of transformative learning with some reporting that they had achieved what Mezirow (1991) terms a full perspective transformation. In the responses to the open-ended questions, there was evidence that participants showed signs of achieving all three of the basic pre-cursors to transformative learning. In terms of the influence of program length on cultural and transformative outcomes, where a program was less than 18 days long, a significantly lower chance of achieving transformative learning was found.

AB  - Word Generation (WG) is a research-based vocabulary program for middle school students designed to teach words through language arts, math, science, and social studies classes. The program consists of weekly units that introduce 5 high-utility target words through brief passages designed to spark active examination and discussion of contemporary issues. WG was designed with the understanding that promoting classroom discussion can result in particular kinds of academic benefits, such as improved word knowledge, reasoning, and expression. The IES funded evaluation of WG (as part of the Reading for Understanding initiative) is a school-level experimental study that includes two cohorts of schools randomized to treatment and control conditions. The first cohort has been studied for three years and the second cohort for two years; we present findings after the end of the 2nd year of the study and at the end of the 3rd year of the study.

AB  - This paper examines theoretical, pedagogical, and technological differences between two technologies that have been used in undergraduate interprofessional health sciences at the University of Toronto. One, a learning management system, WebCT 2.0, supports online coursework. The other, a Knowledge Building environment, Knowledge Forum 2.0, supports the collaborative work of knowledge-creating communities. Seventy students from six health science programs (Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, Pharmacy and Physical Therapy) participated online in a 5-day initiative to advance understanding of core principles and professional roles in pain assessment and management. Knowledge Forum functioned well as a learning management system but to preserve comparability between the two technologies its full resources were not brought into play. In this paper we examine three distinctive affordances of Knowledge Forum that have implications for health sciences education: (1) supports for Knowledge Building discourse as distinct from standard threaded discourse; (2) integration of sociocognitive functions as distinct from an assortment of separate tools; and (3) resources for multidimensional social and cognitive assessment that go beyond common participation indicators and instructor-designed quizzes and analyses. We argue that these design characteristics have the potential to open educational pathways that traditional learning management systems leave closed. (Contains 7 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - In search of methods that improve the efficiency of teaching and training in organizations, several authors point out that mass customization (MC) is a principle that covers individual needs of knowledge and skills and, at the same time limits the development costs of customized training to those of mass training. MC is proven and established in the economic sector, and shows high potential for continuing education, too. The paper explores this potential and proposes a multidisciplinary, pragmatic approach to teaching and training in organizations. The first section of the paper formulates four design principles of MC deduced from an examination of economics literature. The second section presents amit[TM], a frame for mass customized training, designed according to the principles presented in the first section. The evaluation results encourage the further development and use of mass customized training in continuing education, and offer suggestions for future research. (Contains 2 figures and 5 tables.)

This article presents a lesson that encourages students to investigate their local environment and take photos for their artwork, and invites science teachers to add related content to their lessons. In this lesson, students (1) create a balanced composition that incorporates both positive and negative space; (2) incorporate a variety of pen and ink techniques that develop positive spaces and relate to forms; and (3) invent images and symbolic objects to develop negative spaces.

AB  - A Project Based Learning (PBL) methodology was used in the practical laboratories of the Advanced Physical Chemistry department. The project type proposed simulates "real research" focusing on sol-gel synthesis and the application of the obtained sol as a stone consolidant. Students were divided into small groups (2 to 3 students) to simulate a real-world research team. This procedure allowed students to explore the sol-gel transition from synthesis until dry gel (xerogel), and analyze the properties of the sol, gel, and xerogels (especially pore volume and pore size). Moreover, the students learned an example of an application of sol-gel materials (as a "stone consolidant") and were introduced to the use of several instrumental techniques such as nitrogen adsorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), and rheology measurement.

AB  - Some students want to broaden their perspectives while others want to deepen their knowledge, and it is vital to challenge students to the level of their ability and interest. However, in regular degree programmes the possibilities for individualization and differentiation in content and didactics are often limited. The main focus of a regular degree programme is how to guarantee the bachelor's level for all students. Focusing on the average student alone, though, might cause students who are looking for an additional challenge to lose interest. This article describes how Windesheim University of Applied Sciences (the Netherlands) addresses the challenge of educating the leaders of the future through the Windesheim Honours College and Honours Programmes.

AB  - School gardens--and efforts to connect gardening to K-12 learning--are burgeoning. Children's gardens--green spaces that keep in mind the way children play and explore an outdoor space--have been one of the biggest recent trends in gardening. Progressive educators have long promoted gardening as an opportunity to connect knowledge about plants, animals, and ecosystems with personal experience--and as a natural way for students to develop an understanding of science. In addition to generating inquiry about nature, gardens help teachers authentically integrate botanical knowledge and broader science concepts into the school day. Although the relationships among science, math, and gardens are readily apparent, gardening isn't a boon for these two disciplines only. Think of the role that garden exploration might play in strengthening literacy. Gardening can inspire students to read, discover, research, write, and inform themselves and fellow gardeners. In this article, the author discusses three ways teachers can use authentic student activity in gardens to enrich literacy--and how literacy meshes with student experiences in a garden.

AB  - Purpose: Biobanks are collections of biological samples (e.g. tissue samples and body fluids) and their associated data intended for various approaches in medical research. The field of biobanking evolves rapidly as an interdisciplinary branch of research and requires educational efforts to provide skilled experts in Europe and beyond. New ways in research and research education play a pivotal role in the future of biobanking. Design/methodology/approach: The increasing of requests and potential uses of biospecimens from biobanks necessitates an international and national intensified transfer of forward looking knowledge and know-how. In Austria, this could be realized by special trainings as well as a postgraduate education. Furthermore, the forward looking research and further development of infrastructure will play a pivotal role in biobanks in the future. Findings: Few opportunities are available for specific education on biobanking in Europe. This could be remedied by the creation networks of ISO-certified biobanks and co-operation with interested parties. Research limitations/implications: The current research focuses on the situation of information transfer in the field of biobanking in Europe. A wider investigation in better harmonization and standardization of methods in other parts of the world would be beneficial. Originality/value: The value of biomolecular resources such as biobanks has previously been discussed in detail, e.g. by the "Time" magazine. The paper focuses on demonstrating the importance for education in the future of biobanking in general.

AB  - There is often a particular void in the education of deaf and hard-of-hearing students who intend to become competent working laboratory technicians. Inasmuch as certain basic professional skills ("soft skills," in this case) are not generally taught in traditional science courses, a new curriculum has been developed in order to enforce these skills. The "soft skills" of focus in this study are safety awareness, technical writing, and teamwork/conflict resolution. The development of the pedagogical tools used to teach these specific "soft skills" are discussed, as well as an assessment of the augmentation in student understanding in each skill area. By incorporating an interdisciplinary approach that enforces "soft skills", students should find greater success while on co-operative work experiences and have more prominent career opportunities. This curriculum was produced for the Chemical Technology-like program, Laboratory Science Technology, at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf- one of the eight colleges of the Rochester Institute of Technology, but the concepts are transferable to other technical-based programs.

AB  - Spatial thinking skills are vital for success in everyday living and work, not to mention the centrality of spatial reasoning in scientific discoveries, design-based disciplines, medicine, geosciences and mathematics to name a few. This case study describes a course in spatial thinking and communicating designed and delivered by an interdisciplinary team over a three-year period to first-year university students. Four major elements provide a framework for the sequencing of instruction and acquisition of 2D and 3D spatial thinking and reasoning skills in a computational design context. We describe the process of introducing students to computational design environments beginning with a fun and familiar tool in preparation for a more complex, industry-standard system (SolidWorks). A design project provides diverse student teams an opportunity to integrate and apply foundational spatial concepts and skills including sketching, 2D and 3D representations, as well as digital and physical modeling. Samples of student work illustrate the scaffolding necessary for students to successfully draw upon the spatial thinking and communication skills required to complete their team projects beginning with applying sketching techniques; modeling individual 3D parts; creating digital assemblies; and finally building the equivalent 3D physical model. Key instructional principles provide a framework for the analysis of what worked and what didn't in relation to spatial skills development in students. The lessons learned are identified along with potential future directions for teaching and learning scholarship in spatial thinking development within a computational design context.

AB  - Although scale has been identified as one of four major interdisciplinary themes that cut across the science domains by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1989), we are only beginning to understand how students learn and apply scale concepts. Early research on learning scale tended to focus on perceptions of linear distances, navigation and way finding, whereas more recent work has examined how students conceptualize scale in science contexts. This study sought to understand how understandings of scale develop from childhood to adulthood by asking 50 professionals to reflect on their experiences (in and out-of-school) learning about scale. Semi-structured interviews were utilized to obtain information about educational experiences, informal experiences, and applications of scale in different professions. Results showed that most of the participants used anchor points as conceptual benchmarks when applying scale in their job. Seventy-six percent of the participants attributed physical experiences such as moving through the environment by car, walking, bicycling, or flying in an airplane as contributing to the development of a sense of scale. Results of this study were used to develop a possible model of the trajectory of scale concepts that develop as individuals move from novice through increasing degrees of expertise. Across professions, participants emphasized the critical role that scale plays in their work. For many, scale was viewed as central to accomplishing the work-related tasks.

AB  - Higher education has embraced integrative learning as a means of enabling students to tackle so-called "wicked" problems, i.e. problems that are sufficiently complex, contested, and ambiguous that conventional, disciplinary specific approaches are inadequate to address. However, challenges remain in defining integrative learning consistently and effectively, especially because the cognitive processes that make up an integrative learning experience are not understood fully. This mixed-methods study was designed to help understand how students perceive, navigate, and resolve challenges that require them to integrate knowledge of one "wicked" subject (sustainability) with the skills of a practice rooted in mathematical logic (computer programming); how they express their integrative learning through reflective writing; and how we gain a stronger understanding of this process through linguistic analysis. The findings suggest that some students demonstrated the ability to integrate computational reasoning skills into socially relevant contexts more successfully, confidently, and in more well-rounded ways than others, though success required ways of thinking that extended beyond programming. The findings also underscore the potential need for reconceptualizing integrative teaching and learning in fields that have problem-solving traditions rooted in less "wicked" solutions.

AB  - Kathleen deMarrais, professor in the Department of Lifelong Education, Administration and Policy at the University of Georgia, was honored to be invited to contribute to this special issue of "Critical Questions in Education." deMarrais addressed college/university deans to review the role of social foundations in teacher education and the hotly debated issue it has been since the founding of the first social foundations course in the 1930s. deMarrais points out that the field continues to be under attack with a need to defend and protect itself, in this case, perhaps from extinction. In these difficult economic times when states are cutting funding to higher education, today's university deans are unique in that they are under additional pressure from policymakers, corporate leaders, and a coterie of wealthy philanthropists--all who believe they understand what is wrong with public schools, the teaching profession, teacher education, and colleges of education. deMarrais recommends that education deans pause briefly to consider the value of social foundations, as well as contributions social foundations faculty can make to their college as a whole. Foundations scholars are trained across a broad range of social science disciplines, bringing the knowledge and tools of those disciplines to the study of education and schooling. Today's teachers, leaders, and other school personnel not only want and need the tools and techniques of their major fields, but the abilities to apply sociocultural, political, philosophic, and historical perspectives to their work, to reflect on the values and beliefs they hold, and to understand and engage with children and adults in communities in meaning, productive learning. To these ends, deMarrais urges deans to partner with their social foundations faculty in the leadership of the college and its programs. A bibliography is provided.

AB  - Empirical psycho-aesthetics--an interdisciplinary field with a long tradition--is approached in this two-part article from two directions, in each case with several objectives. Part I, in this issue of "JAE", is devoted to the first direction, which is mainly definitional and organizational: the objectives are to present an outline of the field's origins; to discuss its attributes vis-a-vis the features of several "sister disciplines"--experimental philosophy, cognitive neuroscience of art, and neuroaesthetics; and to examine, in part through an analysis of notable in-field and cross-field recent debates (some of them heated, all instructive), a number of substantive, methodological, and science-practice issues regarding these various disciplines--with philosophical aesthetics as a backdrop. The second direction, to which part II of the article--to appear in the spring 2013 issue of "JAE"--is addressed, is empirical: the objectives are to illustrate, on the basis of a detailed presentation of five groups of research studies in a variety of art domains, the broad range of psycho-aesthetic topics, methods, participants, and techniques of stimulus manipulation and measurement and to use the presented research in a constructive dialogue with philosophical aesthetics and neuroaesthetics.

AB  - To address the problem of a serious Internet of Things (IoT) talent shortage, the Chinese government is encouraging universities and institutions to establish a major in IoT Engineering to train high-level IoT talent. Since 2011, 700 Chinese universities and institutions have established IoT Engineering undergraduate programs. We surveyed the history, status, curriculum, and problems of IoT undergraduate degree programs in China. Based on data collected from faculties, students, and graduates, we found that the IoT Engineering curriculum was an unsystematic patchwork and was deficient in practical platforms. We then provide suggestions for further development and exploration of IoT education by presenting a Technical Knowledge Map of IoT Engineering. This survey work on Chinese IoT education can prompt Chinese educators to reflect on its achievements and problems, which will contribute to IoT talent cultivation worldwide.

AB  - One of the efforts to improve and enhance the performance and achievement in mathematics of learners is the incorporation of life-related contexts in mathematics teaching and assessments. These contexts are normally, with good reasons, decided upon by curriculum makers, textbook authors, teachers and constructors of examinations and tests. However, little or no consideration is given to whether students prefer and find these real-life situations interesting. There is also a dearth of studies dealing explicitly with the real-life situations learners prefer to deal with in mathematics. This issue was investigated and data on students' choices for contextual issues to be used in mathematics were collected at two time periods. The results indicate that learners' preferences for contextual situations to be used in mathematics remained fairly stable. It is concluded that real-life issues that learners highly prefer are not normally included in the school mathematics curriculum and that there is a need for a multidisciplinary approach to develop mathematical activities which take into account the expressed preferences of learners.

AB  - Significant limitations have emerged in America's science training pipeline, including inaccessibility, inflexibility, financial limitations, and lack of diversity. We present three effective programs that collectively address these challenges. The programs are grounded in rigorous science and integrate through diverse disciplines across undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, and resonate with the broader community. We discuss these models in the context of current economic constraints on higher education and the urgent need for our institutions to recruit and retain diverse student populations and sustain the successful American record in scientific education and innovation.

AB  - In recent years, mathematical and quantitative arguments have become prominent in the media as well as in politics, business, and science conversations. This has led to multiple calls for mathematics to be more accessible and meaningful to a wider range of the population (AMATYC, 2006; Cerrito, 1996; Cheney, 1989; Cohen, 1982; College Board, 1983; CUPM, 1982; CUPM, 1998; Madison and Steen, 2003; Moses, 2002; NCTM, 1989; NRC 1989; Paulos, 1988; Steen, 2001; Steen 2004a). These calls for action have included broadening students' exposure to the breadth and applicability of mathematics in multiple interdisciplinary settings. As detailed by Madison and Steen (2008), this movement became known as the Quantitative Literacy (QL) movement.

AB  - We developed four separate scenarios focusing on the connections between mathematics, biology, and social sciences. This structure facilitated the coordination of faculty from seven academic departments on campus. Each scenario had students from different majors build mathematical models, gather information from their respective disciplines, and develop a final presentation that included a committee consensus on how to approach the problem in a practical way. As a result, students learned how mathematics plays a role in other disciplines and how insight from different points of view affects the approach taken to a complex problem.

AB  - From the time of Likert (1932) on, attitudes of expediency regarding both theory and methodology became apparent with reference to survey construction and validation practices. In place of theory and more--theoretically minded methods, such as those found in the early work of Thurstone (1928) and Coombs (1964), statistical models and methodological heuristics have come to dominate, with the result of gross simplification of complex techniques. Maul's Focus article, "Rethinking Traditional Methods of Survey Validation" (Andrew Maul), lampoons this atheoretical attitude with a rhetorical flair that is all too rare in this literature. More importantly, it draws stark attention to the scientific and ethical dilemmas that this attitude has created as self-report, survey-based instruments have become ubiquitous in psychological research, education systems, and modern society more generally. In this commentary, the authors emphasize Maul's call for survey validation practitioners (and methodologists in the psychological sciences, more generally, including ourselves) to critically reflect on current practices with the same attitude of openness, optimism, and perseverance toward conceptual and methodological growth that we increasingly expect of students in their own cognitive development as 21st-century learners. Such growth necessitates a spirit and process of critical inquiry, in order that survey validation methods find firmer scientific foundation through careful conceptual, logical, and empirical analysis (Petocz & Newbery, 2010). A primary tool of critical inquiry is logical analysis, which may be used to examine the clarity and coherence of current practices and their inherent (and often implicit) assumptions. In the discussion presented in this article, the authors direct such a logical analysis toward the empirical aspects of Maul's article. In doing so, the authors will somewhat disagree with Maul's empirical means of demonstration to strongly agree with his article's overarching message. No reverse coding will be necessary.

AB  - We developed a modular pair of experiments for use in the undergraduate physical chemistry and biochemistry laboratories. Both experiments examine the thermodynamics of the binding of a small molecule, eosin Y, to the protein lysozyme. The assay for binding is the quenching of lysozyme fluorescence by eosin through resonant energy transfer. In both experiments, students measure fluorescence quenching at constant lysozyme concentration as a function of added eosin and determine the dissociation constant, K[subscript D], and [Delta]G[degree] for binding. In the physical chemistry experiment, students repeat the fluorescence measurements at several temperatures to determine the temperature dependence of [Delta]G[degree], and therefore [Delta]H[degree] and [Delta]S[degree] as well. Typical student results yield a K[subscript D] of (28.3 [plus or minus] 7.5) [mu]mol L[superscript -1] and a binding [Delta]G[degree] of (-26.04 [plus or minus] 0.70) kJ mol[superscript -1] at 25 [degree]C. [Delta]H[degree] and [Delta]S[degree] of binding are found to be (-4.1 [plus or minus] 2.5) kJ mol[superscript -1] and (73.9 [plus or minus] 8.7) J mol[superscript -1] K[superscript -1], respectively. This pair of laboratories represents an interdisciplinary module in which students in different courses examine the same system but from different perspectives and with different emphases.

AB  - Integrated learning is the need of the hour. We at Shifa College of Medicine switched to an integrated modular curriculum last year. In the present article, we describe our experience with the renal module in year 2 of a 5-yr undergraduate medical curriculum. A multidisciplinary renal modular team developed the relevant objectives, themes, and clinical cases. The learning strategies used were large-group interactive sessions, small-group learning, problem-based learning, practicals, and self-directed learning. Assessment was both formative and summative. Student and faculty feedback questionnaires were administered at the end of the module. Forty-four percent of the students agreed that the basic science and clinical concepts were well balanced and integrated. Fifty-seven percent of the students believed that important learning issues could be identified and that participation and critical thinking were encouraged during the small-group sessions. Eighty-five percent of the facilitators agreed that they were able to motivate students for critical thinking and better learning through integrating various disciplines. In conclusion, the integrated method of curricular delivery was well received by students and faculty members, and it can be used successfully in undergraduate medical education in developing countries.

AB  - The paradigm of content area literacy instruction is shifting from a view of literacy as generalizable across the curriculum to a disciplinary perspective of literacies specific to the specialized language, text structures, and habits of thinking within particular subject areas. Preservice STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) teachers must be knowledgeable in their content fields and possess competence in pedagogical practices that allow them to scaffold their students' literacy growth within these disciplines. This study examined how infusing a disciplinary literacy project into a content area literacy course affected preservice secondary science and mathematics teachers' disciplinary literacy pedagogy and practice. The findings of this study suggest that structured inquiry into disciplinary communities enhances preservice teachers' understanding of disciplinary literacy development, but this knowledge is not easily transferred into classroom instruction. Implications for future research on disciplinary literacy models and preservice teacher preparation are discussed.

AB  - Science education reform initiatives emphasize (1) the value of concepts over facts; (2) the benefits of open-ended, inquiry-based problem-solving rather than protocols leading to a single correct answer; and (3) the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to teaching that is not confined by departmental boundaries. Neuroscientists should be at the forefront of this movement by the very nature of the discipline we study. Neuroscience is a relatively new field that integrates diverse subjects (anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, molecular biology, computer science, and psychology) and experimental advances are constantly changing and expanding our understanding of brain function. How can we convey this excitement in the classroom? The project described in this article uses nonscientific literature to introduce a scientific topic of study. In addition, the multitask assignment requires the acquisition of content knowledge and the development of critical thinking skills. As students explore the topic from multiple perspectives, they recognize the interconnectedness of science and society and confront ethical and moral issues related to science. A comparison of exam scores, essay responses, engagement level, as well as students' own reflections, demonstrates that inclusion of the project does not sacrifice content knowledge, rather it enhances the overall learning process.

AB  - The studies global warming problem conducted in education discipline in the world and in Turkey were analysed for this study. The literature was reviewed extensively especially through the articles in the indexed journals of Ebsco Host, Science Direct, Taylor and Francis and Web of Science databases and this study was conducted according to the descriptive method. 62 scientific publications about global warming which were published between the years 1992 and 2009 were included in the research. The articles obtained as a result of this review process were analyzed by taking the aims, results and the education levels into consideration. As a result of the research, some studies which didn't complement one another both in the world and in Turkey were encountered. However, for the most part the studies conducted had similar purposes and they had the same results. Descriptive studies introduced that similar misconceptions related to global warming existed in all levels of education and the media had negative effects during this process. Experimental studies revealed that the education methods where the students are active, visual materials and social activities outside the school were more effective methods in educating more conscious students about global warming.

AB  - The multidisciplinary study of complex systems in the physical and social sciences over the past quarter of a century has led to the articulation of important new conceptual perspectives and methodologies that are of value both to researchers in these fields as well as to professionals, policymakers, and citizens who must deal with challenging social and global problems in the 21st century. The main goals of this article are to (a) argue for the importance of learning these ideas at the precollege and college levels; (b) discuss the significant challenges inherent in learning complex systems knowledge from the standpoint of learning sciences theory and research; (c) discuss the "learnability issue" of complex systems conceptual perspectives and review a body of literature that has been exploring how learning sciences pedagogical approaches can lead to student learning of important dimensions of complex systems knowledge; (d) argue that the cognitive and sociocultural factors related to learning complex systems knowledge are relevant and challenging areas for learning sciences research; and (e) consider ways that concepts and methodologies from the study of complex systems raise important issues of theoretical and methodological centrality in the field of the learning sciences itself.

AB  - According to discoursal views on language, variations in textualization strategies are always sociocontextually motivated and never happen at random. The textual forms employed in a text, along with many other discoursal and contextual factors, could certainly affect the readability of the text, making it more or less processable for the same reader. On the basis of these assumptions, the present study set out to examine how our data varied across genres and disciplines in terms of our target textual forms. These forms are as follows: the magnitude of T-unit (MOTU), the degree of embeddedness of the main verb in T-unit (DE), the physical distance between the verb and its satellite elements (PD), the magnitude of the noun phrase appearing before the verb (MOX), and the magnitude of noun phrase appearing after the verb (MOY). Our data consisted of 20 research articles randomly selected from two different disciplines of Biology and Applied Linguistics, to be analyzed in terms of the above-named textual strategies. One way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey tests were used for data analyses. The results revealed cross-generic as well as cross-disciplinary differences in the employment of the above textual forms. These findings were discussed in terms of the academic concepts and discourse on the one hand and the possible effect of the required textual forms on the readability of the text on the other hand.

AB  - We describe the development and evolution of an interdisciplinary introductory course in psychology and sociology. Such a course benefits students by encouraging a wider view of the social sciences and interdisciplinary critical thinking. The challenges of a combined course include reduced content for each discipline, the selection of appropriate texts, and the negotiation of course processes between two professors. Course evaluations indicated that students appreciated thinking beyond the bounds of 1 discipline. Additionally, statistical analyses suggested that our students received similar grades in upper level psychology courses as a cohort of psychology majors who completed the traditional introduction to psychology course.

AB  - This article begins by examining whether "science" and "religion" can better be seen as distinct or related worldviews, focusing particularly on scientific and religious understandings of biodiversity. I then explore how people can see the natural world, depending on their worldview, by looking at two contrasting treatments of penguin behaviour, namely that provided in the film "March of the Penguins" and in the children's book "And Tango Makes Three." I end by drawing some initial conclusions as to what might and what might not be included about religion in school science lessons. Science educators and teachers need to take account of religious worldviews if some students are better to understand the compass of scientific thinking and some of science's key conclusions. It is perfectly possible for a science teacher to be respectful of the worldviews that students occupy, even if these are scientifically limited, while clearly and non-apologetically helping them to understand the scientific worldview on a particular issue.

AB  - Providing effective food safety education to young consumers is a national health priority to combat the nearly 76 million cases of foodborne illness in the United States annually. With the tremendous pressures on teachers for accountability in core subject areas, the focus of classrooms is on covering concepts that are tested on state performance examinations. As a result, topics such as food safety are rarely addressed in middle school classrooms. Middle school is an ideal time to teach food safety because adolescents are in the process of setting lifelong behaviors; therefore, they are more likely to synthesize new food safety knowledge in a way that will lead to the development of lifelong behaviors. The purpose of this study was to scientifically validate an educational resource that provides a method for classroom teachers to involve young consumers in food safety education while meeting state content area curriculum standards. An interdisciplinary curriculum targeted at middle school students and correlated directly to state content standards was designed to include highly effective instructional strategies that teach food safety concepts through all core subject classes (science, math, social studies, and language arts). The curriculum was pilot tested in 5 schools using a pretest, posttest, and follow-up test assessment model. The results showed that the curriculum was highly effective at raising student knowledge (21% gain) and improving students' food handling behaviors (8.47% gain) from pretests to posttests. In addition, 6 wk after implementation, students retained 86% of their total knowledge gain as measured by a follow-up assessment.

AB  - The curriculum module described in this article addresses the global issue of ocean acidification (OA) (Feely 2009; Figure 1). OA is a harmful consequence of excess carbon dioxide (CO[subscript 2]) in the atmosphere and poses a threat to marine life, both algae and animal. This module seeks to teach and help students master the cross-disciplinary content and skills needed to address such problems. Field testing with thousands of high school students has shown that this module, titled Ocean Acidification: A Systems Approach to a Global Problem, builds students' abilities to understand, research, experiment, and care about ocean acidification. In six lessons, the module teaches 21st-century skills (Partnership for 21st Century Skills 2002) and addresses standards from the" Next Generation Science Standards" (NGSS Lead States 2013) and "Common Core State Standards" (NGAC and CCSSO 2010).

AB  - Effective statistical collaboration in a multidisciplinary health research environment requires skills not taught in the usual statistics courses. Graduates often learn such collaborative skills through trial and error. In this paper, we discuss the development of a biostatistical collaboration course aimed at graduate students in a Health Research Methodology PhD program with Specialization in Biostatistics. The objectives of the course are to promote enthusiasm and commitment to excellence in statistical collaboration in clinical research; to enhance communication of statistical issues to non-statistician collaborators; to build statistical self-sufficiency and develop skill in applied statistics; and to enhance a culture of collaboration among statisticians and non-statistician researchers. The course uses a combination of lectures and tutorials led by faculty members, videotaped consulting practice sessions, and internship with mentoring of each student by an experienced biostatistician.

AB  - The faculty learning community project at Howard University involved a diverse group of men and women, tenured, tenure-track, and future faculty across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The purpose of the group was to engage in the scholarship of teaching and learning by learning about teaching, reflecting on their practice, and demonstrating competence or knowledge of effective teaching. Activities included interdisciplinary seminars, linked courses, teaching experiments, and biweekly meetings, which collectively became a process of learning and reflection that was supported by colleagues with an intention of getting things done. Evaluation of the faculty learning community (FLC) activities suggests that faculty learning communities are an effective mechanism for enhancing teaching and learning in STEM disciplines.

AB  - In 2001, the Greek Government introduced sex and gender relationships education as a thematic unit for interdisciplinary Health Education activities. However, the diffusion of such programmes remains extremely limited. The present paper discusses how sex and relationships issues are presented in contemporary Greek primary school textbooks since textbooks play a central role in teaching and learning processes. It has been found that textbook references on a particular topic encourage teachers to select this topic for developing and implementing Health Education projects. In this paper the recent educational reform is presented, as well as the general guidelines for the development of the National Curriculum and Health Education Subject Curriculum, the contents of which determined the guidelines for the development of the new primary textbooks. Within this framework, the article discusses how sex education issues are being represented in primary "Environmental Studies"/"Science" and "Mother Tongue"/"Literature" textbooks. Findings support the claim that such representation is limited and single-dimensional, placing sex education at the margins of educational interventions in Greece at the moment. The marginalization of sex education, as it is argued, can be regarded as the effect of conflicting societal values. (Contains 2 tables, 1 figure, and 7 notes.)

AB  - Background: This study presents two teacher design teams (TDTs) during a professional development experience centered on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-integrated curriculum development. The main activity of the study, curriculum design, was framed as a design problem in order to better understand how teachers engaged with the complexities of integrated curriculum development. Additionally, Remillard's, ("Review of Educational Research" 75:211-246, 2005) teacher-curriculum "participatory relationship" provided a framework for further exploring teacher actions during the design process. Utilizing a case study research design, participant curriculum design conversations were audio-recorded for 12 days during a summer professional development experience. Constructed grounded theory and a method of selective coding revealed insights about the processes and supports that enable collaborative curriculum design. Results: Results showed that when a TDT is not prompted and/or enabled to first lay out and articulate the overall value of a STEM-integrated curriculum, they will rightly follow their intuitions as classroom teachers and engage in the process accordingly. Second, involving practicing teachers in the curriculum design process requires complete "participation" with the curriculum ideas they are contemplating because in the end, the curriculum's resultant lessons will be taught in their own and other teacher's classrooms. Conclusions: The findings from this study indicate the importance of "pushing" active classroom teachers from the design to the mapping arena by instituting curriculum development activities and/or strategies (i.e., processes) that might help a TDT develop a "voice" (Remillard, "From Text to 'Lived' Resources":105-122, 2011) or "value" (Dorst, "Design Studies" 22:4-17, 2006) for the curriculum under development. If members of a TDT are willing to reveal their interpretations, perceptions, and beliefs about the conceptual ideas embedded within the curriculum being developed, both the teachers and curriculum being developed will benefit. Finally, teachers should be made aware of their roles and responsibilities, beyond superficial descriptions; and understand participation in STEM-integrated curriculum design brings with it the likelihood their individual ideas, perceptions, and beliefs will be integrated within the curriculum being developed.

AB  - Many basic scientists including anatomists are currently involved in decisions related to revisions of the undergraduate medical curriculum. Integration is a common theme in many of these decisions. As described by Harden, integration can occur along a multistep continuum from independent, discipline-based courses to a completely interdisciplinary curriculum. For anatomy, each derivative of curricular integration can be shown to involve progressive disruptions of the temporal and topographical relationship between organ systems in a body region, of the temporal relationship with other courses in a harmonized curriculum, and of the relationships between components of organ systems when integration is implemented in thematic curricula. Drawing from our experience teaching in various types of integrated medical curricula, we encourage readers to proceed cautiously with their curricular decisions because each one can have gains and losses that may impact learning in the new format.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate if we could improve retention by redesigning an online programming course from a gender perspective, while maintaining the focus on preferable and sustainable learning approaches. The study builds on results from an earlier study that investigated the relationship between approaches to learning and course completion and involves 1067 students that responded to the short version of the Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students (ASSIST) in 2010, 2012 and 2013. Three principles for course material design were identified; "gender neutral and non-biased messages," "emphasize the interdisciplinary approach" and "link to everyday examples." Responses to ASSIST were analysed in relation to performed changes in the course literature from a gender perspective. The probability to complete the course increased with 7% points for all students, in particular for men, and decreased for students with a high score in surface approach to learning, especially among women.

Unfortunately, teaching how to solve such problems often is relegated to math courses alone. This article examines how quantitative literacy also involves concepts and skills from English composition and the substantive disciplines. The author outlines a systematic approach to writing the answers to word problems--a fundamental skill that applies to ongoing education, everyday life, and the workplace.

A very important feature of most problem-solving activities is that they can be easily modified to fit different educational programs. The goal in implementing these activities is to give students hands-on experience in a practical and realistic scenario. This article describes bridge-building activity which gives students excellent problem-solving experience and a chance to apply academic learning--and an enjoyable challenge. The activity includes a measurable outcome, which is an additional benefit.

AB  - A classroom discussion started after a student noticed three days of accumulated trash in the wastebasket and exclaimed, "Wow, look at the trash! If it keeps piling up like this, it will soon be everywhere!" His statement motivated the authors' class to research about the trash, or solid waste, we create and what can we do about it. The project-based learning (PBL) unit shared in this article allows students to learn about solid waste management, actively construct their ideas, and collaboratively engage in tasks that emphasize the connection of science and mathematical knowledge. The unit, taught to fifth- and sixth grade students, engages students in science concepts such as solid waste, recyclables and nonrecyclables, and the students' neighborhood area. It was spread over a period of six weeks, and two hours every week were spent discussing and researching the driving question: How does the solid waste I create affect my community? In this article, as researchers and teacher educators who crafted this unit, the authors reflect on what was done each week in the classroom with students.

AB  - This article describes an experiment utilizing a research and development strategy to design and implement an innovative school for the future. The development of Cramim Elementary School was a joint effort of researchers from Tel-Aviv University and the staff of the school. The design stage involved constructing a new theoretical framework that defined school as a knowledge system, based on the state of the art, interdisciplinary study of the nature of humans, and the nature of knowledge. A new school design emerged based on this theoretical framework and the school was opened in 1995. Action research followed for 8 years and the results indicated that the school has emerged as a learning organization and successfully integrated knowledge technologies into the learning processes of both students and teachers. Differentiated teaching strategy resulted in a significant increase in achievements (+11% in maths, literacy, and science; +10% in literacy in kindergarten; persistence of higher achievement in junior high schools). The greatest beneficiaries were low-achieving students. As the school is a highly complex system, individual variables contributing to the increased effectiveness could not be isolated. The article's conclusion is that experimental schools are a productive strategy to bring about changes, but unless these schools are part and parcel of the culture of the mainstream education system culture, they are destined to remain isolated cases.

AB  - This investigation provides an extensive review of scientific, religious, and otherwise non-scientific factors that may influence student acceptance of biological evolution. We also measure the extent to which students' levels of acceptance changed following an educational experience designed to address an inclusive inventory of factors identified as potentially affecting student acceptance of evolution (n = 81, pre-test/post-test) n = 37, one-year longitudinal). Acceptance of evolution was measured using the Measure of Acceptance of the Theory of Evolution (MATE) instrument among participants enrolled in a secondary-level academic programme during the summer prior to their final year of high school and as they transitioned to the post-secondary level. Student acceptance of evolution was measured to be significantly higher than initial levels both immediately following and over one year after the educational experience. Results reported herein carry implications for future quantitative and qualitative research as well as for cross-disciplinary instruction plans related to evolutionary science and non-scientific factors which may influence student understanding of evolution.

AB  - The Bitara-STEM[TM] Training of Trainer Programme is a short-term professional development programme aimed to increase STEM teachers or facilitators' abilities to teach integrated STEM education and to increase their efficacy, beliefs and attitudes of integrated STEM teaching. The programme involves 35 facilitators, representing a broad spectrum of STEM fields. Pre- and post-test results of the participants' beliefs, attitudes, perceived efficacy and content knowledge in the context of integrated STEM teaching revealed significant changes. The findings also revealed: (1) knowledge of integrated STEM teaching to be related to facilitators' efficacy for teaching integrated STEM and (2) facilitators' attitudes to be related to beliefs of integrated STEM teaching. The outcomes of this study provide evidence that a relatively short-term professional development can have a significant impact on facilitators' beliefs, attitudes, efficacy and knowledge of integrated STEM teaching and STEM concepts.

AB  - During a two-week inquiry-based 5E learning cycle unit, children made observations and inferences to guide their explorations of animal traits and habitats (Bybee 2014). The children became "animal detectives" by studying a live-feed webcam and digital images of wolves in their natural habitat, reading books and online sources about other animals, and presenting original projects to the class. In third grade, students typically are ready to move beyond local organisms to those of other regions and habitats. A wolf webcam and nonfiction texts helped to broaden the variety of habitats observed and critically examined. Throughout, written and verbal communication deepened children's understanding of key science concepts, practicing Common Core English Language Arts (ELA) standards. Flexible grouping and differentiated activities supported each child's growth. Children entered the world of animals and emerged as thoughtful, thorough, and confident scientists.

AB  - Education in design shares with other disciplines a number of perennial challenges, including the need to transfer human culture, the choice of what parts of human culture to transfer and the decision as to what approaches work best in accomplishing that transfer. Design education also faces particular challenges, which are shared with only a few other disciplines. These are a predisposition towards the future, the increasing necessity of interdisciplinary approaches and the value for students in participating early in the culture of research. I argue for curricular advancements to accommodate each of these factors, including in particular a design PhD modeled on the humanities. Finally, I emphasize the importance of providing students with sufficient time to reflect.

AB  - Printed or digital textbooks contain texts accompanied by various kinds of visualisation. Successful comprehension of these materials requires integrating verbal and graphical information. This study investigates the time course of processing an illustrated text through eye-tracking methodology in the school context. The aims were to identify patterns of first- and second-pass reading and to examine whether the integrative processing of text and picture during the less automatic and more purposeful second-pass reading predicts learning, after controlling for reading comprehension, prior knowledge, and self-concept. Forty-three 7th graders read an illustrated science text while their eye movements were recorded. A cluster analysis revealed two processing patterns during the first-pass reading, which differed for the time spent on the main concepts in the text and picture. During re-reading, two patterns of stronger and weaker integrative processing emerged. Integration of verbal and graphical information was revealed by the frequency of second-pass transitions from text to picture and from picture to text, and the duration of picture re-inspecting while re-reading text information (look-from text to picture) and re-reading text information while re-inspecting the visualised information (look-from picture to text). A series of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that only the patterns of integrative processing during the second-pass reading uniquely predict verbal and graphical recalls, and the transfer of knowledge. The study provides evidence that the delayed processing which integrates text and graphics contributes to text retention and the application of newly learned knowledge, over and above individual characteristics. The educational significance is outlined.

AB  - The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' (NCTM's) "Principles and Standards for School Mathematics" (2000) outlines fi ve Process Standards that are essential for developing deep understanding of mathematics: (1) Problem Solving; (2) Reasoning and Proof; (3) Communication; (4) Connections; and (5) Representation. The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) include eight related Standards for Mathematical Practice (SMPs) (CCSSI 2010). Both standards documents articulate the notion that mathematics is more than just learning content knowledge--habits of mind are just as important as knowledge that is absorbed. How then can teachers help students see the importance of mathematics at the time that they are learning a new topic? This article describes how Douglas L. Jamerson Jr. Elementary School found one solution in the form of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) education. Developed by the classroom teachers with the assistance of local university professors, integrated engineering units of study allow for the application of mathematics skills in real-world contexts, removing engagement barriers and enhancing the development of NCTM's five Process Standards and the Common Core's eight Standards for Mathematical Practice. The purpose for learning is evident with a coherent, integrated curriculum, freeing students to reason about complex problems, analyze multiple solutions, and communicate ideas and results. They develop habits of mind along with the necessary mathematics skills.

AB  - Technical literacy is a component of professional competence of the pre-service technology teacher. However, the course content of technical disciplines in the pedagogical universities of Ukraine is not consistent with the content knowledge subsequently used in teaching practice of a technology teacher. Also, there is a need in general technical literacy of the students, yet it is developed only in its engineering design aspect. In the paper, it was proved that for the general technical literacy of pre-service technology teachers the basic concepts are the following technical phenomena: motion transmission, changes in kinematic parameters of motion, changes in force parameters of motion. Natural and scientific foundations of the machine drives were used as the basic topic-specific knowledge. It was hypothesized that effectiveness of teaching technical literacy to children would raise if the narrative about the technical phenomena is included in the content of the "Utility machinery" course for the pre-service technology teachers. The pedagogical experiment was performed in the Vinnytsia Mykhailo Kotsiubynskyi State Pedagogical University (Ukraine). It included ascertaining, formative, and control stages. At the ascertaining stage of the pedagogical experiment, the students' readiness level to study technical phenomena was determined. At the formative stage, the students' readiness to develop children's technical literacy was measured. At the control stage, students' readiness level to develop technical literacy was estimated in experimental and control groups. Theoretical value of the results is in substantiating technical topic-specific content knowledge as necessary for the pre-service technology teachers. Practical significance of the results is in implementation of the narratives about technical phenomena in the learning practice of the students of pedagogical university.

AB  - While science is certainly language based, it is also bilingual in the sense that mathematics is also "spoken" in science classes. There are many opportunities throughout the school year to integrate the language of mathematics with science lessons and activities. This month's column provides some measurement activities that can be incorporated into the science classroom. (Contains 1 figure and 8 resources.)

AB  - The National Science Education Standards in the United States advocate liberal, contextual, and cultural goals for science education including the significant historical and cultural aspects of science; however, scant treatment is given to the pendulum. Suggests a more routine incorporation of the history and philosophy of science into preservice and inservice courses for science teachers. (Author/SJR)

AB  - This paper examines the framings that the fields of the social studies of science and science education use for each other. It is shown that the social studies of science frames science education as passive and timeless. Science education frames science studies as a set of representations to better capture how science works. The paper then proceeds to sketch an alternative in which schools are understood, drawing on actor-network theory and cultural studies of science, as constituted through contesting scientific practices and discourses and, therefore, are proper objects of study within science studies frameworks. The curricular implications are briefly developed, emphasizing the need for much more reflection upon and activism within science education regarding the technoscientific constitution of students and schools.

AB  - Teacher quality has been a central issue in discourse on improvement of schooling outcomes. While the importance of teacher quality is widely acknowledged, there is considerable dispute regarding necessary skills, knowledge, and dispositions of a highly qualified teacher, as well as the methods for producing such teachers. Indeed, even the definition of teacher effectiveness is contested. One area of teacher preparation that has been marginalized in the debate on teacher quality is the social foundations of education (SFE), a critical, interdisciplinary area of study that examines education and schooling through lenses of history, philosophy, and the social sciences. In recent years, and particularly since the onset of the new century, the value of skills, knowledge, and dispositions promoted in teacher preparation SFE courses and the subsumed or related knowledge domain of multicultural education (ME), have been largely ignored in policy documents on teacher quality. Although limitations of extant data preclude comparison of current course requirements in SFE/ME with those in teacher education programs of the past, establishment of a benchmark on course requirements in this area will help clarify the status of SFE/ME in the field and enable future assessments of trends. This study examined the question of course requirements in SFE and ME in university-based teacher preparation programs in the United States that lead to an initial credential. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - The nature of moral values has occupied philosophers and educationalists for centuries and a variety of claims have been made about their origin and status. One tradition suggests they may be thoughts in the mind of God; another that they are eternal truths to be reached by rational reflection (much like the truths of mathematics) or alternatively through intuition; another that they are social conventions; and another (from the logical positivists) that they are not verifiable facts but simply the expression of emotional likes and dislikes. Standard introductory texts (e.g., Bowie 2004; Vardy and Grosch 1999) on the subject of ethics rarely mention Darwin or Darwinism (Mepham 2005 is a useful exception) possibly mindful of the fact that the relationship of evolutionary biology to moral questions has had a troublesome history. The effect of this has been that whole generations of moral philosophers have given the biological sciences a wide berth and consequently often remain poorly informed about recent advances in evolutionary thought and the neurosciences. On the other hand, scientists have developed interesting models of the evolution of the moral sentiments and are using new imaging techniques to explore the centres of the brain associated with emotion and motivation, but many have been fearful of committing the naturalistic fallacy and so have steered clear of extrapolating their findings to ethical questions. No one after all wants to be seen to be committing an elementary logical blunder. But in the last 20 years, evolutionary biologists have regained the confidence to explore the implications of evolution for the study of ethics (de Waal 1996; Wilson 1998; Wright 1994; Greene 2003). This paper is designed to encourage those entrusted with the teaching of ethics to be open to the potential of Darwinism as a source of ideas on the origins and status of ethical thought and behaviour. It is also hoped that it will illustrate for science educators the enormous explanatory power inherent in Darwinian thought.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to outline the particular character of the research and development project "Sustainable University--Sustainable development in the Context of University Remits" which lies both in its integrative perspective on universities and the attempt to transfer its findings onto other higher education institutions. Design/methodology/approach: The paper describes the testing and further development of transdisciplinary research methods (transformative approach, scenario development) for the purpose of both exploring and testing potentials/capabilities for sustainable development of a single institution (case study University of Luneburg, Germany) against the backdrop of sustainability concept; and making this kind of development transferable to other universities. The paper offers additional reinforcement of strategic scope/effectiveness by means of reference to findings of higher education research (e.g. relevance of neo-institutionalism). Findings: There is empirical evidence for successful development of transdisciplinary techniques for sustainability in higher education domains (among others management, research, and teaching--cf. other contributions of this issue). Further, dissemination of the "Luneburg Approach" by establishing an intermediate level of collaboration between sustainability activists within universities and in higher education policy and administration (e.g. constitution of working groups in northern Germany and at the federal level). Research limitations/implications: There is a need for enhancing research tools for transdisciplinary sustainability science; deliberating on international transferability (current focus: (solely) German academia). Practical implication: A systemic approach is indispensable: instead of focusing upon isolated sustainability fields of action (management, research, teaching, etc.), all-embracing advancement to encompass their strategic relationships and thus synergies. Originality/value: The paper provides a holistic view of academic organisations addressing the issue of how universities are to be proactive in advancing sustainable development.

AB  - In this article, the authors discuss finding teaching the standard on the apparent brightness of the Sun (5-ESS1-1) to be a challenging and frustrating experience due to the abstract nature of the standard and generally low interest of their fifth-grade students. They had previously used hands-on learning activities involving flashlights to model the phenomenon, but the results were less than stellar. All of that changed when they decided to integrate math standards on graphing points in the coordinate plane (5.G.A.1 and 5.G.A.2) and added a claim, evidence, and reasoning (CER) response. The result was a lively analysis of data in a real-world context, thoughtful discussions about word choice when making observations, and engaging arguments from evidence.

AB  - This article establishes and addresses opportunities for ethics integration into Machine-learning (ML) courses. Following a survey of the history of computing ethics and the current need for ethical consideration within ML, we consider the current state of ML ethics education via an exploratory analysis of course syllabi in computing programs. The results reveal that though ethics is part of the overall educational landscape in these programs, it is not frequently a part of core technical ML courses. To help address this gap, we offer a preliminary framework, developed via a systematic literature review, of relevant ethics questions that should be addressed within an ML project. A pilot study with 85 students confirms that this framework helped them identify and articulate key ethical considerations within their ML projects. Building from this work, we also provide three example ML course modules that bring ethical thinking directly into learning core ML content. Collectively, this research demonstrates: (1) the need for ethics to be taught as integrated within ML coursework, (2) a structured set of questions useful for identifying and addressing potential issues within an ML project, and (3) novel course models that provide examples for how to practically teach ML ethics without sacrificing core course content. An additional by-product of this research is the collection and integration of recent publications in the emerging field of ML ethics education.

AB  - The objective of the article is to reconstruct the mental programs, their cognitive, axiological and connotative structures, and construction on this basis of various modal patterns of social behavior in Russian society. Methodology of the article is based on an interdisciplinary scientific approach making it possible to conceptually disclose the contents of reflexive structures of mental programs that determine modal patterns of social behavior. On the basis of the cognitive construction the authors identify the distinctive features of the liberal pattern, liberal-statist pattern, statist pattern, and conservative-liberal pattern of social behavior in Russian society. It is shown that in modern Russian society, two alternative modal patterns of social behavior can be distinguished: liberal and conservative. However, in real life these patterns are mostly hybrid: statist-liberal, as they include elements of the liberal behavior pattern.

AB  - Imaging of artwork is an important aspect of art conservation, technical art history, and art authentication. Many forms of near-infrared (NIR) imaging are used by conservators, archaeologists, forensic scientists, and technical art historians to examine the underdrawings of paintings, to detect damages and restorations, to enhance faded or overpainted inscriptions, to study artists' techniques, to examine questioned documents, and as a nondestructive analytical tool for identifying certain pigments. The spectroscopic principles underlying the NIR imaging of artwork offer a powerful and engaging teaching opportunity for educators offering a chemistry-of-art course. This article introduces an inexpensive imaging system based on a night-vision webcam. The low cost of the total system (less than $20) could allow every student in a science course to use a NIR imaging camera. Examples are given to show the many techniques of NIR imaging that are important in the fields of art conservation and technical art history. Furthermore, additional spectroscopic experiments exploring the diffuse reflection spectra of traditional pigments in the visible and NIR regions are recommended to help explain the numerous interaction phenomena responsible for the NIR images of artwork and other objects and the occasionally bewildering images acquired outside the familiar visible spectrum.

AB  - The described interdisciplinary course helped a mixed population of in-service secondary English and biology teacher-participants increase their genetics content knowledge and awareness of Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) that arose from discoveries and practices associated with the Human Genome Project. This was accomplished by applying a critical literacy approach that allows people develop cognitive skills such that they are able to "read the world" (Wink, 2004). The approach is one that permits readers to go beyond the literal text to examine what is present as well as what is missing as it relates to issues of equity and fairness. Becoming critically literate enabled these teacher-participants to challenge the subtle attitudes, values, and beliefs conveyed by a range of written and oral texts. The teacher-participants in this course improved their critical literacy skills by actively reading, critically writing about, and using evidence to support their conclusions about issues arising from advances in human genetics. A biologist, a linguist, and an educator collaboratively designed and taught the course. The personalized focus on the integration of thoughtful reading and writing in this class enhanced the teacher-participants' (n = 16) professional and intellectual development and will potentially improve learning in their biology and English classrooms in the future.

AB  - College honors courses provide an opportunity to tackle controversial topics in an atmosphere that encourages active learning, critical thinking, and open discussion. This venue is particularly appropriate for examining the debate about teaching intelligent design (ID) in public school science classes. A one-credit honors enrichment seminar taught at the University of North Carolina Wilmington provides a model, with associated successes and challenges, for addressing the controversy. This interdisciplinary course consisted primarily of discussions based on a set of weekly readings that presented contrasting viewpoints on evolution and naturalism, ID, theology, and educational issues. In preparation for each class, students constructed charts contrasting the views of each writer on key points presented in the readings and summarizing their own responses. Discussion focused on a set of questions arising from the readings and designed to provoke debate. The "Kitzmiller v. Dover" decision served as a final case study; each student prepared a final paper defending or criticizing Judge Jones' decision in the Dover court case. Prior to the course, some students had not heard of ID and many had limited knowledge of evolution. The course improved student knowledge of evolution, ID, and the issues involved in the controversy, preparing them to make informed political decisions. Challenges included the uneven level of knowledge about evolution among students in this non-science course and the time constraints of a 1-credit course. In addition, because I had decided to serve as a facilitator and not press my opinions, misconceptions were more difficult to correct, although the variety of disciplines represented by the students allowed them to correct one another.

AB  - To maximize the contributions of nanotechnology to this society, at least 60 countries have put efforts into this field. In Taiwan, a government-funded K-12 Nanotechnology Programme was established to train K-12 teachers with adequate nanotechnology literacy to foster the next generation of Taiwanese people with sufficient knowledge in nanotechnology. In the present study, the Nanotechnology Attitude Scale for K-12 teachers (NAS-T) was developed to assess K-12 teachers' attitudes toward nanotechnology. The NAS-T included 23 Likert-scale items that can be grouped into three components: importance of nanotechnology, affective tendencies in science teaching, and behavioural tendencies to teach nanotechnology. A sample of 233 K-12 teachers who have participated in the K-12 Nanotechnology Programme was included in the present study to investigate the psychometric properties of the NAS-T. The exploratory factor analysis of this teacher sample suggested that the NAS-T was a three-factor model that explained 64.11% of the total variances. This model was also confirmed by the confirmatory factor analysis to validate the factor structure of the NAS-T. The Cronbach's alpha values of three NAS-T subscales ranged from 0.89 to 0.95. Moderate to strong correlations among teachers' NAS-T domain scores, self-perception of own nanoscience knowledge, and their science-teaching efficacy demonstrated good convergent validity of the NAS-T. As a whole, psychometric properties of the NAS-T indicated that this instrument is an effective instrument for assessing K-12 teachers' attitudes toward nanotechnology. The NAS-T will serve as a valuable tool to evaluate teachers' attitude changes after participating in the K-12 Nanotechnology Programme. (Contains 4 tables, 2 figures and 2 notes.)

AB  - This study was conducted to confirm the specifications of the laboratory and the list of practice tools for technology education in elementary schools in Korea. For effective technology education, standardized laboratory specifications and a list of practice tools are needed. However, there were no standardized laboratory specifications and a list of practice tools for elementary school students in Korea, so there were many difficulties in practicing related to technology education at the elementary level. In particular, elementary-level technology education is combined with home economic and agricultural education within the subject of practical art subjects in Korea. Therefore, the laboratory should have a complex function so that it is not only for technology education but also to enable practice in other fields. The name of the lab is "The Practical Arts Laboratory" in elementary schools in Korea. The study design and method to achieve the study purpose are as follows. First, in the theoretical analysis stage, the concept of the laboratory and considerations for designing the laboratory were confirmed through the review of previous studies. Next, a list of practice tools was derived using the big data analysis method. Then, in the actual design stage, the practical arts laboratory was designed and an expert feasibility study was conducted. The results of the study are as follows. First, the minimum area of the practical arts laboratory is 13,600mm×12,450mm, which is twice the size of a general classroom. In addition to the practical arts laboratory, a preparation room for storing practice tools is also required. The minimum area of the preparation room is 12,450mm×3,500mm, which is 1/4 the size of practical arts laboratory. Second, the practice table in the practical arts laboratory was designed as a comprehensive practice table that allows various types of practice, and the area was designed to be 600mm×1,200mm in consideration of the Korean work area. Third, the number of practice tables was set to six considering the size of the practical arts laboratory and the number of people per class in elementary schools in Korea. As of 2018, the number of people per class at an elementary school in Korea was 23.1, so four people were set to use one practice table. Practice is a key element in technology education. Thus, it will be said that the practical arts laboratory plays a very important role in Korea's elementary level technology education as an environmental background that makes the practice effective. For this reason, the standard specifications of the practical arts laboratory and the list of practice tools presented in this study are expected to contribute to the development of elementary-level technology education in Korea. Also, our results can be a reference for other countries in the world that have a similar situation to Korea.

AB  - This study explored students' ability to evaluate their learning from a multimedia inquiry unit about the causes of global climate change. Participants were 90 sixth grade students from four science classrooms. Students were provided with a text describing the causes of climate change as well as graphs showing average global temperature changes. Half of the students also received an analogy to help support their understanding of the topic. Results indicated that overall students were over-confident about how much they learned and how well they understood the topic. Further, the presence of an analogy led to higher levels of overconfidence. Results also indicated that students with better graph interpretation skills were less overconfident even when the analogy was present. These results suggest that the presence of graphs and analogies can negatively affect students' abilities to accurately judge their own level of understanding and may lead to an illusion of comprehension.

AB  - The case presentation is the core section of a medical case report. Issues in the teaching of case report writing have recently been the subject of great interest in medical education, especially in the era of globalization. Given that Taiwanese medical students, residents and junior physicians are requested to write case reports in English and they may experience difficulty in language use, there is a need to investigate models. The purpose of this study is to identify the rhetorical structure of case presentations and to find the differences in the linguistic features of case presentations between international and Taiwanese medical journals. We conducted a hand-tagged move analysis of a corpus of 40 case presentations. The findings revealed that the rhetorical structure of case presentations is similar. However, differences emerged in the analysis of the linguistic features showing chronological order and the record of admission and these were perceived as the two major drawbacks in Taiwanese presentations. For medical and English teachers, these findings can be easily transformed into teaching materials. This study contributes to a model of interdisciplinary collaboration among professionals in English for Medical Purposes (EMP) and Medicine on college teaching and training of medical English writing.

AB  - This study examined the frequency of small groups in university students' coursework and how that related to their general attitudes toward learning in groups and their views about different aspects of group work. We administered a survey to 208 students in an upper-division interdisciplinary arts and sciences program. Students reported that they had been in multiple groups, of different duration and types, both in their current program and in courses at their lower-division institutions. A regression analysis uncovered strong relationships between students' past and present group experiences, peers, and instructor clarity about group purpose. The findings suggest that successful group work is no longer a matter of instructor effort but requires campus initiatives and interdepartmental coordination if students are to understand and experience the benefits of learning in small groups.

AB  - What should a campus do when it needs more learning spaces but can't construct new buildings? Dr. Benjamin Sill's first task when he became the director of Clemson University's general engineering program was to find space for classrooms and for the advising program. His search ended in the old YMCA building (Holtzendorff Hall), where space was available--but all of it in serious need of renovation. By tightening the general engineering budget and with help of the dean of the College of Engineering and Science, the old movie theater was converted into a classroom, the old basketball gym into an engineering project lab, and the old ballroom into a SCALE-UP classroom (Student-Centered Activities for Large Enrollment Undergraduate Programs). Needing additional space, Sill focused on the abandoned swimming pool that first opened in 1918, which was full not of water but of broken furniture. While Sill and Dr. Elizabeth Stephan talked with facilities and the Provost's Office about design and budgets to renovate the swimming pool, a multidisciplinary group was meeting on the other side of campus. This group, called the Teaching with Technology Community (TwTC), began meeting for an hour each week in fall 2002, starting with only three people representing computer science, mathematical sciences, and experimental statistics, and one person in a dual role representing English and CCIT (Clemson Computing and Information Technology). The group's original purpose was to explore pedagogically sound ways to integrate laptops into the classroom. Since then, TwTC has grown to more than 80 faculty, staff, and graduate and undergraduate students representing nearly 30 academic disciplines, several deans' offices, the Rutland Center for Ethics, the Office of Teaching Effectiveness and Innovation, the libraries, student disabilities services, and additional CCIT areas. At the TwTC's first meeting each fall, members brainstorm on where they want to focus their attention that year. In fall 2006, everyone rallied around the idea of designing and installing a teaching with technology experimental classroom that would be available to faculty from all disciplines. Although Stephan was not at the meeting, as a member of TwTC she received the minutes and noted the TwTC's need for a shared classroom space that could be renovated. This article tells the story of how the old swimming pool became the Holtzendorff Teaching with Technology Experimental Classroom, or "the sandbox classroom."

AB  - There is an increasing need for an effective method of teaching bioinformatics. Increased progress and availability of computer-based tools for educating students have led to the implementation of a computer-based system for teaching bioinformatics as described in this paper. Bioinformatics is a recent, hybrid field of study combining elements of biology, statistics, and computer science. This paper describes the implementation of a system called bioinformatics foundational learning objects workbench (BioFLOW), that is intended to be used by instructors to educate their students in bioinformatics principles at a variety of grade levels. BioFLOW functions by dividing topics in bioinformatics into modules. These modules cover a wide variety of topics and may be inserted into different courses in bioinformatics-related fields, providing students with a basic understanding of bioinformatics if they choose to pursue it as a field of advanced study. BioFLOW also incorporates a method for assessing the performance of the modules and the students. Assessment includes evaluation of students' learning styles and their performance on quizzes and is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the modules. Utilized together, these tools can be used to refine the content of the teaching modules and thus provide an effective system for educating students in bioinformatics.

AB  - This article reports on formative research as part of a broader interdisciplinary campaign to increase voluntary environmentally responsible boating in a local lagoon. A telephone survey was conducted with a sample (N = 404) of targeted boaters to explore their views on the environmental issue and motivations to perform the desired behavior. Results reveal over half of respondents were unaware of the environmental damage caused by recreational boating but were somewhat concerned. Importantly, many believe they are able to engage in environmentally responsible boating and that it would help to protect this marine ecosystem. The article concludes by discussing scholarly and practical contributions and future research considerations.

AB  - Both those inside and outside of the education community are becoming increasingly familiar with the STEM acronym and the extensive efforts underway nationally to develop integrated PK-12 STEM programs that promote critical thinking, problem solving, 21st Century skill development and authentic learning experiences (Ingram, 2019). However, for those teachers on the front lines, the standards used to guide the curriculum and learning experiences in these new STEM programs have not been nearly as obvious. The purpose of this manuscript is to reveal the newly revised "Standards for Technological and Engineering Literacy" (2020) and discuss the powerful role it will play in PK-12 STEM education curriculum.

AB  - Education in nanotechnology presents major challenges in science literacy. One of these challenges relates to conveying size and scale-related concepts. Because of the potential difficulties in conveying concepts and ideas that are not visible to the naked eye, multimedia for learning could be an appropriate vehicle to deliver curricular materials related to nanoscale science and engineering. This study used qualitative and quantitative methods of inquiry to investigate how three different interactive multimedia tools for conveying concepts related to size and scale were perceived and experienced by two groups: (a) 224 novice/pre-service teachers, and (b) 8 instructional designers and trainers of pre-service teachers. Differences found between what these teachers and what instructional designers noticed about the interactive multimedia tools can inform the design of learning strategies for pre-service teachers training on the adoption and evaluation of multimedia for learning. Specifically, pre-service teachers focused on classroom management issues, but the instructional designers focused on aspects of instructional design and pedagogy. These issues are discussed, along with implications of the role of technology integration and the effective design of interactive multimedia in learning. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)

AB  - This article draws on systems theory, complexity theory, and the organizational sciences to engage boundary dynamics in the creation of parent-school partnerships. These partnerships help children succeed through an emergent process of dialogue and relationship building in the peripheral spaces where parents and schools interact on behalf of children. Historically, parental involvement and parent education programs evolved from mechanistic thinking. This review and interpretation of multidisciplinary research suggests reframing parent-school partnerships in the context of schools as learning communities that generate new knowledge and innovation as the experiences and competencies of teachers and parents interact to make tacit knowledge explicit. Knowledge society concepts including social capital, actionable knowledge, networked innovation, and communities of practice are applied to parent-school partnerships. Acknowledging vast contributions of research to current understanding of parental involvement, the article also explores the limitations of existing theoretical models and seeks to expand that understanding through the introduction of boundary dynamics and systems thinking.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to show a practical case of dialogic web-based learning that has provided a set of questions analysing two complex technological projects in "southern" countries with effects on multicultural equity. Design/methodology/approach: Structured online review processes in multicultural and systems science curricula allow for high density of literature-based reflection and analysis. Findings: The entirety of the set of over 50 questions developed by the proposed web-based dialogic procedure represents a starting point for an in-depth assessment of the effects of deploying "northern" technology in "southern" countries. Research limitations/implications: The present case study concentrates on energy technology, notably on two hydroelectric plants presently under construction in Ilisu, Turkey, and Belo Monte, Brazil. Practical implications: The multitude of questions calls for complex technological construction projects that have to undertake sound interdisciplinary in-depth analysis of technological, environmental, economic, cultural and social consequences in order to secure a necessary level of economic, environmental and social sustainability. Social implications: Application of widely accepted planning tools such as technology assessment, environmental impact assessment and strategic environmental assessment are useful but have to be complemented by analogous tools at a cultural and social level. Originality/value: This case study operates through questioning, largely in the Socratic tradition. Questions may trigger a broad discussion process within civil societies: which is the intention of the present text. (Contains 3 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - The goal of this project, one of the proposals of the EPS@ISEP Spring 2014, was to develop an Aquaponics System. Over recent years Aquaponics systems have received increased attention since they contribute to reduce the strain on resources within 1st and 3rd world countries. Aquaponics is the combination of Hydroponics and Aquaculture, mimicking a natural environment in order to successfully apply and enhance the understanding of natural cycles within an indoor process. Using this knowledge of natural cycles, it was possible to create a system with capabilities similar to that of a natural environment with the support of electronics, enhancing the overall efficiency of the system. The multinational team involved in the development of this system was composed of five students from five countries and fields of study. This paper describes their solution, including the overall design, the technology involved and the benefits it can bring to the current market. The team was able to design and render the Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings of the prototype, assemble all components, successfully test the electronics and comply with the budget. Furthermore, the designed solution was supported by a product sustainability study and included a specific marketing plan. Last but not least, the students enrolled in this project obtained new multidisciplinary knowledge and increased their team work and cross-cultural communication skills.

AB  - In the training of doctoral researchers in the use of qualitative research methods, considerable effort goes into preparation for fieldwork and the collection of data. Rather less attention, however, goes into what happens when they have collected their data and begin to make sense of it. In particular, relatively little attention has been paid to the ways in which doctoral researchers might be supported as they begin to write using qualitative data. In this article we report on an inter-disciplinary project that set out to develop research training for qualitative researchers who had completed their fieldwork and were about to embark on writing their theses. An important issue in the delivery of this training was the question of boundaries--disciplinary, academic, technological and personal--and how these might be productively negotiated in the quest for good social science writing.

AB  - This article demonstrates how Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS) art discussions and subsequent, inspired artmaking can help reach the goals of the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts & Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, & Technical Subjects (CCSS-ELA). The authors describe how this was achieved in a remedial writing club for 6- and 7-year-old boys. Their study of the boys in this club demonstrated that by developing the young learners' visual literacy via discussions of ancient through contemporary artworks representing a variety of mediums, the communicative literacy by which they critically "analyze, reflect upon, and respond to diverse communication situations" (Rowan University, 2011, p. 1) expanded as well. This finding fueled their contention that the CCSS-ELA (NGA Center, 2010), which emphasize integrated literacy, high-order thinking, and cross-disciplinary understandings, have provided visual art education with a carpe diem moment: the opportunity to demonstrate that the capacities upheld by the CCSS-ELA are authentically invited by the unique content of art and can be richly developed through comprehensive, high-quality art education programs. They assert that such programs should include not only reflective and meaningful artmaking, but also routinely conducted dialogic investigations of artworks and visual culture exemplars from the past and present. The authors further maintain that VTS offers a powerful means for enacting the kinds of evocative and substantive art encounters that will situate art education at the center of a standards-based education for all students.

AB  - Role-play provides fifth-grade students with the opportunity to develop meaningful connections to environmental science concepts and understand how those concepts relate to their community. Role-play also builds students' communication skills and increases their understanding of the attitudes of science. By participating in role-play, teachers develop a learning community that respects and values diverse opinions while constructing a deeper understanding of local environmental issues. This article describes a role-play activity which focuses on community activists trying to discourage people from planting nonnative plants (i.e., Bradford pear trees). The idea for this role-play came from local news stories about certain community members' dislike for Bradford pear trees and their potential as an invasive species. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - In this study we measured changes in science teachers' conceptual science understanding (content knowledge) and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) while participating in a problem-based learning (PBL) model of professional development. Teachers participated in a two-week long workshop followed by nine monthly meetings during one academic year that focused on deepening their content understanding and their teaching practices. We analyzed teachers' short writings and concept map depictions of their understanding, and found teachers significantly developed components of pedagogical content knowledge and clinical reasoning, such as knowledge of assessment. Gains on conceptual understanding of science, however, were limited to one group of teachers. We conclude that this PBL approach to professional development advanced components of science teachers' strategic pedagogical content knowledge and discuss the ongoing challenges in measuring changes in teachers' understanding in the context of an evolving PBL model of professional development.

AB  - Children's literature can play a significant role in integrating math and science concepts into real-world applications. One particularly delightful selection is "Cucumber Soup" (Krudwig, 1998). This book can create a context--making cucumber soup--for weighing and for a real-life on adding fractions. This kind of learning context takes children away from viewing math and science as rules and formulas, and encourages them to explore ideas in a more natural and informal manner that will help them discover connections and interrelationships among content and concepts. This article describes the use of "Cucumber Soup" as a powerful tool for teachers at the elementary level to engage students in actively doing math and science, and in investigating and exploring measurement and number concepts.

AB  - At North Carolina A&T State University (NCATSU), there was a critical need to better coordinate genuine research and classroom experiences for undergraduates early in their academic career. We describe the development and implementation of a faculty alliance across academic departments to increase biomathematics research opportunities for underrepresented minorities. Our faculty alliance is called the Integrative Biomathematical Learning and Empowerment Network for Diversity (iBLEND). The fundamental purpose of the iBLEND alliance was to inspire underrepresented minorities to pursue research careers by increasing the visibility of research conducted at the interface of mathematics and biology at NCATSU. Because of the many positive impacts, iBLEND gained significant buy-in from administration, faculty, and students by 1) working from the ground up with administration to promote campus-wide biomathematics research and training, 2) fostering associations between research and regular undergraduate academic courses, 3) creating and disseminating biomathematics teaching and learning modules, and 4) enhancing learning community support at the interface of mathematics and biology. Currently, iBLEND is viewed as a productive site for graduate schools to recruit underrepresented minority students having specific competencies related to mathematical biology. (Contains 8 tables.)

AB  - The rapid rate of expansion of the disciplines of biotechnology, genomics, and bioinformatics emphasizes the increased interdependency between computer science and biology, with mathematics serving as the bridge between these disciplines. This paper demonstrates this inter-relationship within the context of a computational model for a biological process. We designed and implemented a lesson plan for an interdisciplinary science course that examines the evolutionary process from biological, mathematical, and computer science perspectives. The observations obtained from this lesson can be used to augment studies in mathematics with emphasis on arithmetic functions, probability, and generating series.

AB  - Alternative teaching styles provide a unique and rewarding approach to reinforcing student knowledge and developing social skills. An approach that we implemented required students from the ecology class to organize and present information at the university-wide Earth Day celebration and exposition. In addition to the informational and research posters presented by the ecology class, the exposition included displays by local environmental groups, local and state agencies, student organizations on campus, research groups from the chemistry department, and an ethics class. We found that the level of student engagement far exceeded our expectations and that the students felt they had made a significant impact on the community. We highly recommend this approach to other faculty. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - This study aims to explore how online searching plays a role during PBL tutorials in two undergraduate health sciences curricula, Medicine and Dentistry. Utilizing Interactional Ethnography (IE) as an organizing framework for data collection and analysis, and drawing on a critical theory of technology as an explanatory lens, enabled a textured understanding of student practices and beliefs regarding online searching during face-to-face PBL tutorials. Two event maps trace key transitions in learning regarding online searching in one cycle of problem-based learning in each program. From a critical perspective, analysis of students' stimulated recall interviews indicated that the use of students' personal mobile devices with online searching capacity is considered a dynamic pedagogically and socially constructed process. Online searching during the PBL process is also viewed as a "site-of-struggle" where there are challenges for first-year undergraduates when implementing such learning technologies in PBL tutorials.

AB  - Statistics and statistical literacy can be found in the Learning Areas of Mathematics, Geography, Science, History and the upcoming Business and Economics, as well as in the General Capability of Numeracy and all three Crosscurriculum priorities. The Australian Curriculum affords many exciting and varied entry points for the teaching of statistics. The new curriculum also offers an opportunity to explore the pedagogy of using the statistical investigation process (s-i-p). This is based on the premise that the full statistics cycle really does matter and is fundamental to why statistics is important. The process of starting with a problem, collecting data, analysing data, and interpreting and communicating results is present throughout the curriculum. This discussion paper invites teachers to examine the intention of the curriculum and to identify where the statistics cycle is both explicit and implicit. It is about looking for the commonalities within and across the Learning Areas to support teachers to prepare materials and learning tasks to build statistical capability by understanding the statistical processes underpinning different representations of the cycle.

AB  - A random sample of middle school teachers (grades 6-9) from across the United States was surveyed about their use of writing to support students' learning. The selection process was stratified so there were an equal number of English language arts, social studies, and science teachers. More than one-half of the teachers reported applying 15 or more writing to learn strategies at least once a month or more often. The most commonly used writing to learn strategies were writing short answers to questions, note taking for reading, note taking while listening, and completing worksheets. While teachers reported using a variety of writing to learn strategies, most of them indicated they received minimal or no formal preparation in college on how to use writing to learn strategies to support student learning, less than one-half of teachers directly taught students how to use the writing to learn strategies commonly assigned, and the most commonly used writing to learn strategies did not require students to think deeply about the material they were learning. We further found that teachers' reported use of writing to learn strategies was related to their preparedness and the composition of their classroom in terms of above and below average writers, English Language Learners, and students with disabilities.

AB  - Interprofessional education (IPE) in clinical practice is believed to improve outcomes in health care delivery. Integrating teaching and learning objectives through cross discipline student interaction in basic sciences has the potential to initiate interprofessional collaboration at the early stages of health care education. Student attitudes and effectiveness of IPE in the context of a combined gross anatomy course for first-year students in Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) and Doctor of Medicine (MD) degrees curricula were evaluated. Integrated teams of MD and DPT students participated in part of the gross anatomy dissection course at Mayo Medical School. A survey was administered to 42 MD and 28 DPT students that assessed their attitudes toward IPE and cooperation among health care professionals. Pre- and post-experience surveys were evaluated. Positive comments were related to opportunities for developing a better understanding of the nature and scope of each other's programs, encouraging teamwork and communication, mutual respect, and reducing the perceptual divide between disciplines. Ninety-two percent of the students agreed that interprofessional learning would help them in becoming a more effective member of the health care team. This initial experience with IPE in gross anatomy provides a basis for continued development of interdisciplinary educational strategies. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Engineers today cannot meet their professional obligation to the welfare of society if they do not have a broad, multidisciplinary vision, and yet a multidisciplinary vision is becoming enormously difficult to obtain. A new curriculum must emerge that can integrate a focused, discipline-based scientific approach with an integrated approach. To do this, we must recognize that there is already a structure that is deeply embedded into the current pedagogy, which values performance ratios such as efficiency as paramount. Current trends indicate a call for a broader, reflexive, and preventative curriculum, but like many other calls for change, these will fail if the focus continues to be on wrong values. A model for an adaptive engineering curriculum is developed that strives to maintain a scientific approach as well as a broad "culture-based approach." A new way of thinking about engineering curriculum must involve a "resymbolization" in which experience, context, community, and certain nonmeasurable principles are valued.

AB  - Preservice teachers enrolled in a science content-based course wrote stories that could help their future students understand a science concept. First, participants chose their topic and wrote the story with few guidelines to establish a baseline. In the next part, a different set of students were given a choice of three topics (based on force, electricity, and heat misconceptions), and collaborated to write stories with guidance from the instructor. Stories were analyzed for narrative and science units, and test scores examined. Without guidance, many students struggled to find ways to integrate science within a story. With guidance, participants wrote stories that included more narrative elements overall, and participants felt the stories helped them understand the concepts.

AB  - This paper describes how a gamified rewards and penalties framework was used to increase attendance and engagement in a level six undergraduate computing module teaching game production. The framework was applied to the same module over two consecutive years: a control year and a trial year. In both years the tutor, assignments and assessment strategies were the same and daily attendance was recorded. In the module, students work in multi-disciplinary teams to complete an assignment to build a computer game prototype. Unequal contribution to team projects by other students is a frequently voiced complaint to lecturers setting team assignments: a problem which is only partially solved by peer assessments, which are a retrospective analysis. The gamification framework provides a method for the lecturer to quickly identify disengaging students and to re-motivate them. Partnership between student and teacher, both parties must present themselves in order for that exchange of knowledge to take place. If unequal team contribution is a constant problem for students, then empty lecture halls can be considered similarly difficult for educators. This paper addresses three key points: 1) Does the rewards/penalties framework improve attendance? 2) If yes, does improved attendance result in improved assessments? 3) Does the framework improve engagement and performance in student teams? This paper presents quantitative evidence to answer the first two and offers speculative comments on the third. Initial results suggest that the rewards and penalties framework improves attendance and increases student performance and overall grade. Speculatively, the framework appears to be effective in increasing motivation. Informal student commentary indicates that while motivation is not improved across the cohort, those that are motivated contribute significantly more time and effort to the project. Rewards proved successful in improving completion of previously resisted tasks and in attracting students to attend classes they would otherwise miss.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: The digital divide and educational inequalities remain a significant societal problem in the United States, and elsewhere, impacting low income, first-generation, and minority learners. Accordingly, institutions of higher education are challenged to meet the needs of students with varying levels of technological readiness with deficiencies in information and digital literacy shown to be a hindrance to student success. This paper documents the efforts of a mid-Atlantic minority-serving institution as it seeks to assess, and address, the digital and information literacy skills of underserved students. Background: A number of years ago, a historically Black university in Maryland developed an institutional commitment to the digital and information literacy of their students. These efforts have included adoption of an international certification exam used as a placement test for incoming freshmen; creation of a Center for Student Technology Certification and Training; course redesign, pre and post testing in computer applications courses; and a student perception survey. Methodology: A multi-methodological approach was applied in this study which relied on survey results, pre and post testing of students enrolled in introductory and intermediate computer applications courses, and scores from five years of placement testing. Student pre and post test scores were compared in order to examine degree of change, and post test scores were also assessed against five years of scores from the same test used as a placement for incoming freshmen. Finally, a student perception and satisfaction survey was administered to all students enrolled in the courses under consideration. The survey included a combination of dichotomous, Likert-scaled, and ranking questions and was administered electronically. The data was subsequently exported to Microsoft Excel and SPSS where descriptive statistical analyses were conducted. Contribution: This study provides research on a population (first-generation minority college students) that is expanding in numbers in higher education and that the literature reports as being under-prepared for academic success. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of current studies examining the information and technological readiness of students specifically enrolled at minority serving institutions. As such, this paper is timely and relevant and helps to extend our discourse on the digital divide and technological readiness as it impacts higher education. The students included in this study are representative of those enrolled in Historically Black Colleges or Universities (HBCUs) in the United States, giving this paper broad implications across the country. Internationally, most countries have populations of first-generation college students from under-served populations for whom a lack of digital readiness is an also an issue therefore giving this study a global relevance. Findings: The digital divide is a serious concern for higher education, especially as schools seek to increasingly reach out to underserved populations. In particular, the results of this study show that students attending a minority serving institution do not come to college with the technology skills needed for academic success. Pre and post testing of students, as well as responses to survey questions, have proven the efficacy of computer applications courses at building the technology skills of students. These courses are viewed overwhelmingly positive by students with respondents reporting that they are a necessary part of the college experience that benefits them academically and professionally. Use of an online simulated learning and assessment system with immediate automated feedback and remediation was also found to be particularly effective at building the computer and information literacy skills of students. The total sample size for this study was over 2,800 individuals as data from 2690 IC3 tests administered over a five year period were considered, as well as 160 completed surveys, and pre and post testing of 103 students. Recommendations for Practitioners: Institutions of higher education should invest in a thorough examination of the information and technology literacy skills, needs, and perceptions of students both coming into the institution as well as following course completion. Recommendation for Researchers: This research should be expanded to more minority serving institutions across the United States as well as abroad. This particular research protocol is easily replicated and can be duplicated at both minority and majority serving institutions enabling greater comparisons across groups. Impact on Society: The results of this research help to shed light on a problem that desperately needs to be addressed by institutions of higher education, which is the realities of the digital divide and the under preparedness of entering college students in particular those who are from low income, first generation, and minority groups. Future Research: A detailed quantitative survey study is being conducted that seeks to examine the technology uses, backgrounds, needs, interests, career goals, and professional expectations with respect to a range of currently relevant technologies.

AB  - One of the major teaching challenges of higher education is helping students to bridge knowledge with real life practice. This is especially important in applied fields including medicine, social science, education and engineering. Traditionally, practicum and internship programs are the only means for students to step outside of classroom learning and to connect with the outside world, and a chance to apply what they learn to real life problems. Increasingly, information and communication technology (ICT) is being used to create yet another dimension for authentic learning beyond the boundaries of the classrooms, and in addition afford collaborative and flexible learning mode. This paper details a collaborative effort between the engineering and the education disciplines, in using ICT to support students' professional growth in teacher education. An eLearning platform was created as a result of the joint effort for the training of student teachers in developing their professional knowledge in teaching and learning and gaining understanding of the work of a teacher. Through the platform, student teachers gain understanding about the teaching profession from different people of the education sector; and they can reflect and share their teaching practicum experiences with each other using the online communication tools.

AB  - A novel approach to the Chemical Engineering curriculum sequence of courses at West Point enabled our students to experience a much more realistic design process, which more closely replicated a real world scenario. Students conduct the synthesis in the organic chemistry lab, then conduct computer modeling of the reaction with ChemCad and Mathematica, analyze chemical separation processes, and design a reactor system. This interdisciplinary learning approach demonstrated to students that all of their courses are meant to complement each other, their learning, and experiences. (Contains 7 figures and 4 tables.)

AB  - There are few available resources for learning and teaching about ethical issues in neuroimaging research with children, who constitute a special and vulnerable population. Here, a brief review of ethical issues in developmental research, situated within the emerging field of neuroethics, highlights the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of research with children. Traditional boundaries between behavioural, psychological, neuroscientific and educational research are being blurred by multidisciplinary studies of learning and human development. Developmental and educational researchers need to be aware of the ethical quandaries inherent in such research, and moral educators need to encourage researchers to consider the ethical aspects of developmental neuroimaging. To this end, fictional case scenarios were designed to address two topics in the ethical conduct of neuroimaging research with children: inadvertent findings in paediatric neuroimaging and inclusion of young children in pharmacological clinical trials. The latter is contrasted with an educational trial in an alternate scenario, underscoring similarities in ethical issues across types of developmental research. It is hoped that discussions elicited by such scenarios will contribute to both moral education and paediatric neuroethics. (Contains 3 notes.)

AB  - The networked environment forced a sea change in Library and Information Science (LIS) education. Most LIS programs offer a mixed-mode of instruction that integrates online learning materials with more traditional classroom pedagogical methods and faculty are now responsible for developing content and digital learning objects. The teaching commons in a networked environment is one way to share, modify and repurpose learning objects while reducing the costs to educational institutions of developing course materials totally inhouse. It also provides a venue for sharing ideas, practices, and expertise in order to provide the best learning experience for students. Because metadata education has been impacted by rapid changes and metadata research is interdisciplinary and diffuse, the Metadata Education and Research Information Commons (MERIC) initiative aims to provide a virtual environment for sharing and collaboration within the extensive metadata community. This paper describes the development of MERIC from its origin as a simple clearinghouse proof-of-concept project to a service-oriented teaching and research commons prototype. The problems of enablers and barriers to participation and collaboration are discussed and the need for specific community building research is cited as critical for the success of MERIC within a broad metadata community.

AB  - Recent calls for border crossing between reading and science have heightened the need to support science teachers in integrating reading into science and to verify the robustness of this approach in the context of inquiry-based science. In this paper, we share what we did, found, and learned in a collaborative project in which a team of university-based reading educators and school-based science teachers worked together to infuse reading strategy instruction and quality science trade books into inquiry-based sixth-grade science classrooms. We suggest that infusing reading into middle school science enhances science teaching and learning, but is a complex, multifaceted undertaking. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)

AB  - The conflicting values in legal education between training for the profession and pursuing the academic discipline of law are examined, and tendencies toward isolationism of legal education are decried. Greater organizational and curricular integration between law and the social sciences at La Trobe University (Australia) is noted as a positive step toward transdisciplinarity. (DB)

AB  - This paper explores the ways students perceive the transfer of learned knowledge to new situations -- often a surprisingly difficult prospect. The novel aspect compared to the traditional transfer studies is that the learning phase is not a part of the experiment itself. The intention was only to activate acquired knowledge relevant to the transfer target using a short primer immediately prior to the situation where the knowledge was to be applied. Eight volunteer students from either mathematics or computer science curricula were given a task of designing an adder circuit using logic gates: a new context in which to apply knowledge of binary arithmetic and Boolean algebra. The results of a phenomenographic classification of the views presented by the students in their post-experiment interviews are reported. The degree to which the students were conscious of the acquired knowledge they employed and how they applied it in a new context emerged as the differentiating factors.

AB  - In 2008, the University of Melbourne rolled out its restructured undergraduate degree program offerings. Rather than offering a multitude of faculty-specific degrees, the University started to offer a limited number of generalist degrees that serve as developmental pathways to specialist masters programs as well as stand-alone employment preparation. While the other "Melbourne Model" degrees in arts, science, commerce and biomedicine primarily aligned with their cognate faculty, one degree, the Bachelor of Environments, was taught across four faculties. Three reviews of this unusual undergraduate degree have been undertaken since 2009 with each recommending that the degree reduce the number of common core first year subjects to one. However, the decision to reduce to one core subject proved difficult within the blurred boundaries of cross-faculty management structures. This paper analyses the strategies being used to reach consensus following the most recent review.
