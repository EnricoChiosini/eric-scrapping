AB  - Numerous authors in the library and information science (LIS) field have called for more authentic collaborative experiences for students in school librarian education programs, particularly experiences that partner school library students with pre-service teachers to collaboratively design instruction. The first-iteration, design-based study described below examines the impact of such a project, a collaborative science-focused lesson plan assignment given to pre-service elementary school teachers (PSTs) and pre-service school librarians (PSLs) at a public university in the southeastern United States. Specifically, this paper explores the impact of the project on school library students' understanding of collaboration between teachers and school librarians, particularly science-focused collaboration, and examines the features of the assignment that either facilitated or hindered their progress toward improved understanding. Based on the results of this project, we provide recommendations for school librarian educators interested in designing and implementing similar projects.

AB  - The evolution of the professional and environmental conditions is forcing the university education to a change in the teaching-learning process. This implies a new definition in the roles and functions of university teachers from whom new ways of educational training should arise. These days, university teachers are called upon to encourage and facilitate their students' learning. This new role of the teacher should be to help put the University at the level of the requirements and possibilities of this era, and those to come as well. In order to make the innovation and the change real in higher education is essential to start from concepts like "cooperation and collaboration" within the teaching staff, between them and in their departments. According to the new use of the didactic and organizational planning in higher education, this aspect is an aim for the development of the teaching quality in universities. In higher education, there is an increasing need of a formation which not only increases the conceptual knowledge of the professionals but also provides them the instrumental and attitudinal resources required for the professional development of their tasks. The aim of this paper is to show the work which has been done by a group of teachers at the Faculty of Educational Sciences and Humanities during four years in the degree of Educational Psychology. The activities carried out (information stands, sensitization workshops, leaflets with scientific-technical information, among others) facilitate our students' apprehension of the basic elements of different subject matters and increase their skills of analyzing, contrasting, synthesizing, increasing knowledge, debating, etc. and, in addition, they can confront the need to give an answer--as a professional--to very different situations taken from the real world.

AB  - Globalization, digitalization, and the permanent alteration of information have led to important changes in the world of work. This demands a realignment of essential skills in order to access job positions in the coming years. In order to face up to the digitalization process, education is one of the ambits that has most come to a tipping point. This adds an urgency to the need to bring skills in line with the new demands of the job market and the challenges posed in the 21st Century. The methodology was based on a systematic review of the most commonly-used databases. It analyzed and synthesized the existing information on the skills required for the future job market and educational proposals to facilitate their acquisition. At the beginning of the search, 2045 records were selected. However, following the application of the exclusion criteria, a total of 63 records were included. From this in-depth analysis, it was uncovered that the most in-demand skill for the job market relates to the management of technology. Different proposals were located which targeted these skills in educational settings. The majority of these pertained to innovative projects emanating from digital and technological phenomena.

AB  - A STEM methods course was developed for undergraduate preservice teachers at the faculty of education. The course model design had three phases: 1) review of the STEM literature and conceptual considerations, 2) planning of the STEM methods course, and 3) evaluation by experts and revision based on their feedback. Research literature and other documentation were reviewed. A framework and guiding principles for primary-level STEM education were developed to identify key elements, including STEM focus/essence, student-centered, curriculum, learning environment, and assessment. A 15-week STEM methods course was planned to model good practices for teaching integrated STEM and to let preservice teachers confront real-world issues and problems that arise in STEM instruction and then design their own STEM lessons or activities for teaching. The result of implementing the STEM methods course was examined through pre and post-surveys which showed the influence of the methods course in promoting preservice teachers' STEM understanding.

AB  - The mid-1960s were a time of historic social and cultural change, creating a perfect climate for a small university with a handful of students and some revolutionary ideas to take shape. During that dynamic era, Nova Southeastern University (NSU) was founded in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In 2014, NSU celebrated fifty years of growth, innovation, and inclusive educational opportunities; today it is the largest, not-for-profit, private university in the state with approximately 26,000 students. Just twelve years ago, the university's undergraduate honors program was initiated, and this past summer they elevated their commitment from a high-impact honors program housed within a traditional college of arts and sciences to a multidisciplinary honors college. The new honors college is one instance of an institution that, true to its dynamic origins, is constantly changing to suit the times. The establishment of the Farquhar Honors College reflects the importance the university places on promoting excellence across all degree levels and disciplines. NSU takes pride in becoming one of the approximately two hundred U.S. universities out of more than four thousand colleges and universities to house an honors college. The honors college was born out of the recognition that high academic performance is coterminous with leadership and out of the desire to acknowledge publicly the premier scholarship demonstrated by the students. This article describes how the honors college was designed to unleash a crucial potential in all students: the ability to lead.

AB  - In 2014, the Undergraduate Research Initiative at the University of Saskatchewan implemented a pilot project to organize, support, and promote curriculum-based research experience as an integral aspect of participating first-year courses. The framework for the course-based initiative was the research arc; usually in groups, students in these classes would develop a research question, investigate it using discipline-appropriate methodologies, and disseminate the results. Nine classes (Agriculture, Animal Bioscience, Environmental Science, Women's and Gender Studies, Psychology, Kinesiology, and Interdisciplinary Studies) participated in this program pilot. There were four key agents in the program: faculty instructors, research coaches, students in participating first-year classes, and university administrative staff. This preliminary evaluation of the pilot suggests that first-year undergraduate research experiences have potential to benefit the undergraduate student participants as well as the faculty and research coaches involved. The primary benefits that faculty reported experiencing included an increased interest in ways to engage learners, reexamination of and reflection on their teaching strategies, the pragmatic support of a research coach helping with their work load, and an invigoration of their research. The primary benefits to research coaches included enhancement of their professional skills, experience in lesson planning and facilitation, CV building, and an ideology shift in how to best facilitate learning for undergraduate students. The most prominent benefits for undergraduate students appeared to be that they gained a better idea about how researchers think and work, that they increased their understanding of how research works, and that their own research and professional skills had improved. Early, bottom-up evaluation identified characteristics of implementation that appear to best facilitate achievement of the initiative's outcomes and identified the potential pitfall of imposing outcomes, from related but distinct initiatives, that may not be achievable or optimal in in the setting of first-year classes. The results of this evaluation suggest that rather than gaining clarity or focus, first-year students in course-based research experiences might gain awareness of their personal potential, of the potential of research, and of their career/educational options.

AB  - This study investigated the efficacy of a multi-component reading comprehension instructional approach, Collaborative Strategic Reading (CSR), compared to business-as-usual instructional methods with 19 teachers and 1074 students in middle school social studies and science classrooms in a large urban district. Researchers collaborated with school personnel to provide teachers with ongoing professional development and classroom support. Using an experimental design, teachers' classrooms were assigned either to CSR or to a business-as-usual comparison condition. Multi-level analyses showed that students receiving CSR instruction scored higher on a standardized reading comprehension assessment compared to their peers in comparison classrooms (g = 0.18, p < 0.05). While implementation varied across classrooms, students in the CSR condition were observed using CSR strategies and working together in small groups. Teachers attended to the quality of student work and provided more feedback when teaching CSR. CSR is an effective method to improve the reading comprehension of adolescents and to increase their access to complex informational text.

AB  - Dispersion forces are ubiquitous in chemistry, yet they are often misunderstood. This article provides background into why they are called dispersion forces and explains how to describe them in terms of time-independent quantum mechanics. The article also describes the breakdown of the multipole series that is often used to describe dispersion forces, and it comments on the representation of dispersion forces in molecular mechanics. In general, the article tries to provide a proper framework for understanding and describing dispersion forces.

AB  - Ill-structured problems abound that require sophisticated problem-solving skills, knowledge across multiple domains and the abilities to think critically and communicate effectively. Despite the abundance of rhetoric supporting the need to build these skills in our students, the acquisition of domain-specific knowledge is still the primary focus of most disciplines. Students who have not mastered these skills and possess only domain-specific knowledge will be underprepared to successfully contribute to the solutions to these problems. The IDEA Studio at Virginia Tech implemented a transdisciplinary collaborative learning environment in an effort to bring these skills out of the literature and into the real-world classroom. This paper describes our strategies, the dominant themes that drove our course structure, the challenges we faced and the lessons learned.

AB  - Developing the connection between biology and mathematics is one of the most important ways to shift the paradigms of both established science disciplines. However, adding some mathematic content to biology or biology content to mathematics is not enough but must be accompanied by development of suitable pedagogical models. I propose a model of pedagogical mathematical biological content knowledge as a feasible starting point for connecting biology and mathematics in schools and universities. The process of connecting these disciplines should start as early as possible in the educational process, in order to produce prepared minds that will be able to combine both disciplines at graduate and postgraduate levels of study. Because teachers are a crucial factor in introducing innovations in education, the first step toward such a goal should be the education of prospective and practicing elementary and secondary school teachers.

AB  - The rapid development and increasing inter- and multi-disciplinarity of life sciences invokes revisions of life science course curricula, recognizing ("inter alia") the need to compromise between covering specific phenomena and general processes/principles. For these reasons there have been several initiatives to standardize curricula, and various authors have assessed general curricular requirements. The results have shown that teacher preferences strongly influence both topic arrangement and course content, and that generating consensus among scientists and lecturers is challenging. Applying a somewhat different approach, we have focused on a limited part of the curriculum (cell metabolism). Using Delphi methodology, in four rounds of surveys we investigated phenomena that 15 experienced, practising lecturers consider to be central aspects for students to learn in the cell metabolism module of an introductory university course. The overall aim was to identify "learning goals of special concern, i.e.," aspects considered by the teachers to be both central and difficult for students to understand. Our informants emphasized learning goals of overarching and principal type, "e.g. to be able to couple different system levels (from molecules to cells to organisms) and grasp the interactions between them." However, the teachers also expect students to retain detailed knowledge, "e.g. to know the structure of central biomolecules and metabolites." The main result of the study is a ranked list of learning goals of special concern in cell metabolism. We also identified both important learning goals and difficulties that have not been previously reported (even though they are covered by most textbooks), "e.g. the necessity of proximity and common intermediates for coupled reactions and that energy production occurs in well-regulated steps."

AB  - The determination of kinetic data is central to reaction mechanism; science courses usually include experiments on chemical kinetics. Thanks to PC-controlled data acquisition and availability of software, the students calculate rate constants, whether the experiment has been done properly or not. This contrasts with their experience in, e.g., organic synthesis, where a broad melting point indicates an impure product. In order to teach quality kinetics and link theory to experiment, we used a multistep project, based on the (convenient) pH-independent hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate in aqueous organic solvents. The steps of the project included statement of the experiment's objective; a quiz on reaction mechanism and experimental techniques in chemical kinetics; students' decision on the organic solvent to be employed; extraclass activity to assess their choice of the solvent; carrying out the experiment; and discussion of the results obtained. We have applied the constructivist approach to illustrate that controlling the experimental conditions (solution temperature and homogeneity) is a prerequisite for obtaining quality kinetic data. The students' evaluation was highly positive because they participated in the different steps of the project.

AB  - Globalization and the increasingly multicultural characteristic of many countries and societies have placed an acute spotlight on whether nations are able to develop citizens who are multiculturally educated and globally engaged. While the character and citizenship education literature in Asia and the Pacific often mentions intercultural understanding and global-mindedness as desirable outcomes, few models exist that translate effortlessly into citizenship curriculum or classroom pedagogy. There has also been a lack of interdisciplinary exchange between the best science and practices of intercultural competence from other disciplines and the domain of citizenship education. Cultural intelligence, a theory-based and empirically rigorous construct propounds an ideal framework for promoting intercultural competence in character and citizenship education. To that end, teachers are faced with both the chance and challenge to lead and teach with cultural intelligence. In this paper, the inexorable requirement for intercultural competence in character and citizenship education is contended. The fit between the theory and practice of cultural intelligence and citizenship education is explored and examples offered for how teachers can teach with cultural intelligence and develop culturally intelligent students who will become multiculturally educated and globally engaged citizens.

AB  - Common notions around the concept of sustainability tend to be framed within the values and principles that the world's natural environments need to be used and managed in such a way as to make them available for future generations. Consequently, pedagogical approaches in environmental education that follow this intellectual thread tend to adopt a standard scientific approach to inquiry-based learning. This article argues that the features of a geographical approach to inquiry, particularly in its wider conceptualisation of fieldwork, provides a much more effective means of developing an environmental education that is more cogniscent of the deeper aspects of sustainability. While the importance of the natural systems components of sustainability cannot be ignored, they tend to displace other inherent facets within the sustainability concept and, in particular, the reality that any discussion as to the sustainable use of natural environments must incorporate knowledge and understanding of the way people interact with these environments. We contend that sustainability, when taught in schools, has tended to be environmentally and scientifically based, diminishing the role of humans. In an example of how this deficit might be overcome, the Australian Curriculum incorporates "sustainability" as one of the three mandatory cross-curriculum priorities; that is, one of the avenues for encouraging complementary learning and teaching across different disciplines. Within this curriculum framework, the concept is expanded to not only include a consideration of the mutual interdependence of the environmental spheres ("Systems"), but also "World View and Futures"--thus including the human component. However, using the notion of the "fieldwork imperative" (Casinader & Kidman, 2017), which distinguishes between the reasons "why" we do fieldwork and the reasons "why we should" do fieldwork, we argue that sustainability education would be placed more effectively within the disciplinary domain of Geography, rather than as part of an integrated curriculum approach or in Science.

AB  - The article describes the methods of teaching students majoring in languages with the use of practice-oriented exercises, the need for the development and implementation of which is defined by a new methodological basis of modern higher vocational education--a competence-based approach. The study hypothesis involves the assumption that practice-oriented exercises allow to intensify the mental, practical and creative student activities, form a positive motivation both to study Japanese and be engaged in future professional activities. The article contains the results of the joint work of teachers of the Sakhalin State University on drawing up and introduction of practice-oriented exercises for students studying Japanese at the level of professional communication at the university and majoring in "Oriental and African Studies" and "Pedagogical Education." The study represents the general content of practice-oriented exercises, implying an interdisciplinary impact and integration of training courses, independent work of students, students' clear understanding of the ultimate goals of the task and assessment means. The content of each exercise, the rationale for its development, objectives, targets, the progress and the learning results have been described in detail. Students' comments have been presented demonstrating the efficiency of using practice-oriented exercises in the educational process.

AB  - Physiology as a discipline is uniquely positioned to engage undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research in response to the 2006-2011 National Science Foundation Strategic Plan call for innovative transformational research, which emphasizes multidisciplinary projects. To prepare undergraduates for careers that cross disciplinary boundaries, students need to practice interdisciplinary communication in academic programs that connect students in diverse disciplines. This report surveys policy documents relevant to this emphasis on interdisciplinary training and suggests a changing role for physiology courses in bioscience and engineering programs. A role for a physiology course is increasingly recommended for engineering programs, but the study of physiology from an engineering perspective might differ from the study of physiology as a basic science. Indeed, physiology laboratory courses provide an arena where biomedical engineering and bioscience students can apply knowledge from both fields while cooperating in multidisciplinary teams under specified technical constraints. Because different problem-solving approaches are used by students of engineering and bioscience, instructional innovations are needed to break down stereotypes between the disciplines and create an educational environment where interdisciplinary teamwork is used to bridge differences.

AB  - The University of Connecticut (UConn) is a public Carnegie Foundation Research institution with 14 schools and colleges that enrolls more than 18,000 undergraduate students at the main campus in Storrs, CT. Beginning in 1999, First-Year Experience (FYE) seminars were offered to entering freshman students. Since that time, the size of the program and the number of entering freshman who participate has increased. In conjunction with FYE classes, residential and non-residential learning communities (LC) were developed to create community within a broad interest area or within a discipline. One of these, the Animal Science LC, is open to all Animal Science majors and for the last 15 years has been led by the same faculty member. Students enrolled in the Animal Science LC complete a FYE seminar that can be clustered with 3 or 4 other courses to accomplish a sense of belonging among a cohort of majors, enhanced peer mentoring support, and sustained faculty-student interaction. A review of data has shown that over the last 10 years, students who participated in the Animal Science LC were more likely to persist in the Animal Science major, and they were more likely to graduate within 4 years.

AB  - The benefits of students learning together in peer-assisted learning (PAL) programmes have been widely reported. Implementing and evaluating PAL programmes provide specific challenges for academic staff. This paper explains how action research was used to design, trial and refine a same-year PAL programme to enhance student engagement. The PAL programme was successfully integrated into a multidisciplinary radiologic biology unit of study in 2010, following improvement over two trials in 2008 and 2009. The paper demonstrates the value of action research for designing the PAL programme to increase student engagement and for bringing research and practice together by using this experience to contribute to the scholarship of teaching and learning. Key factors influencing the success of the programme were: group size; the provision of structured and unstructured student support; peer assessment; the introduction of case-based learning; and the use of interactive tutorials. Achieving the appropriate balance of these factors increased students' engagement in their learning.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify and describe teaching actions--embedded in the "Science Writing Heuristic" approach, a systematic teaching approach that integrates literacy instruction and argument-based inquiry learning of science--supportive of the cross-disciplinary literacy expectations necessary to compete in the 21st century. This article reports on qualitative findings from a mixed method longitudinal study conducted with 32 elementary teachers and over 700 students. The analysis of multiple layers of data identified two essential teaching action categories supportive of cross-disciplinary literacy skills development among students: (a) building an inquiry-based literacy community of social learning and (b) purpose setting, with a gradual shift of responsibility from the teacher to the student. A model is presented that emerged from the data and visually illustrates how teachers and students explore the purpose, function, mode, and audience within critical science-literacy events while engaging in science content learning.

AB  - Pigments, dyes, and transition-metal compounds are made in courses across the undergraduate chemistry curriculum, but student characterization of these compounds' most striking features, their colors, seldom goes beyond verbal descriptions. Affordable, hand-held, fiber-optic reflectance spectrophotometers make it possible to advance students' understanding of color. Reflectance spectra provide graphical information about color, whereas CIE "L*a*b*" color coordinates describe color quantitatively. This article describes how collection and interpretation of reflectance data are used to round out pigment syntheses in a course for nonscience majors. This approach is transferrable to any experiment in which students obtain colored solids.

AB  - "Forensics," in its most universal sense, is defined as the use of science or technology in the investigation and establishment of facts or evidence for determining identity or relatedness. Most forensic reasoning is used for arguing legal matters. However, forensic studies are also used in agronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, and physics to identify the properties of materials or compare two different materials. The interdisciplinary nature of a forensics-based demonstration encourages science majors to move beyond their own narrow fields of study. This article presents a forensics-based demonstration that emphasizes the interconnectedness of biology, chemistry, and geology. This demonstration asks students to determine the purported origins of three soils collected from three different regions on a Hawaiian island. Students are guided step-by-step through a forensic analysis procedure using two data sets for determining each sample's origin. The 10 steps to be conducted to embed inquiry-based learning during the demonstration are presented. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - Purpose: Research-practice partnerships (RPPs) offer a tool for identifying, generating, and implementing evidencebased strategies that improve practice, policies, and client outcomes. We offer a description of RPPs and elements that facilitate successful utilization. The origin of RPPs, various approaches, and anticipated barriers are discussed. We illustrate some of the challenges and rewards of establishing an RPP using an example of a project that sought to implement a multitiered system of supports among a variety of early childhood education classrooms in a large urban school district. Method: A planning/leadership team established objectives and used surveys, focus groups, classroom observations, professional development records, and student outcome data to inform decision making. Results: The district's progress in implementing multitiered system of supports in early childhood and ways in which implementation plans were modified as a result of data-based decision making are described. A number of unexpected obstacles interfered with original plans, requiring significant revisions in our theory of change and new strategies to overcome challenges. Conclusion: This illustration helps elucidate critical elements of RPPs and highlights their applicability to researchers and practitioners in communication sciences and disorders.

AB  - As the use of data in courses that incorporate statistical methods has become more prevalent, so has the need for tools for working with such data, including those for data creation and adjustment. While numerous tools exist that support faculty who teach statistical methods, many are focused on data analysis or theoretical concepts, and there remains a need for tools that assist faculty when making data-based examples and assignments. In this article, we describe a free application, available both online and through an R package, which we developed for instructors of courses that incorporate introductory statistical methods. The app treats the process of coming up with data for examples and assignments synergistically, beginning with either data creation (through random number generation) or adjustment (when the user has data) and ending with an assessment of the data's suitability for the desired analysis. The app enables the quick creation of many versions of variables for multiple versions of assignments and is compatible with file types associated with popular interdisciplinary software such as Excel, R, and SPSS. We highlight the app's features and discuss survey feedback provided by faculty that demonstrates the desire and need for and effectiveness of such an app. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

AB  - Quality STEM teacher education is predicated on teacher educators who are well-equipped to design learning experiences, provide feedback, guide the development of teachers across their career span, and conduct rigorous research to advance education theory and praxis. While numerous models and approaches to professional development for teachers exist, few parallels can be drawn between the professional development of teachers and teacher educators (Loughran, 2014). To support the multi-faceted identity (trans)formation of STEM teacher educators, self-directed learning opportunities can help bridge knowledge and practice, enhance productive collaboration, and support efforts to negotiate multiple and conflicting agendas (Goodwin & Kosnik, 2013). The purpose of this empirical study was to explore the identity (trans)formation of teacher educators participating in a long-term interdisciplinary STEM-based Community of Practice (CoP; Wenger, 1998), which began in 2012. An analysis of our experiences through the figured worlds lens informs how a CoP can impact curricular approaches and teacher PD, imploring members to move through their comfort zones into innovative spaces. We conclude with suggestions for our STEM teacher educator colleagues who seek opportunities to challenge their own positions and best support preservice and in-service STEM teachers in a way that allows them to model for their students the value of community.

AB  - The article examines the stability and success of ideas within pedagogical discourses. Why do certain ideas attract actors and how does change come about? These general questions are dealt with through considering the example of the swift spread of an interdisciplinary idea, "arbetsområde" (translated to "spheres of work") in the process of a Swedish national curriculum reform 1966-1967. How did it manage to become such a central concept in the curriculum? The article uses the concept of the boundary object in order to understand the popularity of the "spheres of work" concept. Boundary objects have normally been used to explain the rigidity of science, and how the heterogeneity of different actors normally involved in the production of scientific knowledge can be coordinated and result in generalizable findings. However, lately, they have been applied to the field of curriculum studies. In this study, a boundary object pinpoints the fact that curricular solutions can be about coordinating different types of actors with different stakes in the making of a curriculum.

AB  - Collaborative learning activities offer the potential to support mutual knowledge construction and shared understanding amongst students. Introducing collaborative tasks into large first-year undergraduate science classes to create learning environments that foster student engagement and enhance communication skills is appealing. However, implementing group work in classes of over 1000 students presents challenges for instructors in terms of task design, group management and assessment. Interdisciplinary scenario-inquiry tasks have been designed for small group work in a large science cohort, informed by literature and current pedagogical practices relating to the integration of collaborative and active learning strategies. Facilitation and assessment of these tasks was perceived as too complex and time consuming for a single instructor to complete manually, so a web-based task management technology was developed. Evaluation of the technology supported collaborative group activities, including peer assessment, was conducted through questionnaires, student interviews and analysis of the artefacts of the learning process. The capabilities and limitations of the technology, and the insights into group learning gained through its use are presented. In general, students felt supported through the task. Evidence of resource interdependence was found between students in functional groups.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to raise the question of how end-user product innovation is developed by exploring the underlying learning mechanisms that drive such idea realization in practice. A trialogical learning perspective from educational science is applied as an analytical approach to enlighten the black box of learning dynamics in user innovation (UI). Design/methodology/approach: The field study of organizational ethnography is based on in situ observations of the testing and development phase of an adapted aid, an electro-mechanical device for completely hands-free dressing/undressing for people with no arm function. Findings: The results suggest that UI materializes through what this researcher conceptualized as "circuits of learning" around shared objects that are collaboratively mediated and shaped in interplay between three forces identified as "user requirements", "interdisciplinary co-creation" and "object transformation". Research limitations/implications: This in-depth study of UI realization has only started to open the research area of such practices. Further advancement is needed on users as inventors and learners. Cross-fertilization with other fields, such as pedagogy, and particularly branches of theory derived from a socio-material stance, seems fruitful. Practical implications: To cultivate UI through "circuits of learning", "users as learners" should pay attention to their shifting roles as teachers, co-learners and co-creators in interdisciplinary collaborative practices to enhance efficient work processes. Originality/value: This study shows the relevance of bringing in learning as a crucial underpinning that contributes to enhancing our understanding of how user innovators create new products. The paper contributes to the UI literature by elaborating on the concept of "circuits of learning" as a novel framework of learning mechanisms within UI.

AB  - The purpose of this quantitative study was to identify the perceived barriers obstructing the implementation of online education by administrators and faculty at the School of Arts and Sciences of a U.S. university located in Lebanon. The aim of this study was to offer a solution to the most important perceived barriers to online education that informs administrative decisions concerning the appropriate modalities of online instruction that may be implemented at the university. The exploratory factor analysis identified 8 factors out of 35 possible perceived barriers to online education. Faculty and administrators perceived the structural barriers and the pedagogical barriers as very important. Faculty also perceived technical barriers as very important. As a first step toward offering online instruction, the university leadership could offer blended traditional and online education instruction for suitable courses in the School of Arts and Sciences with the goal of assessing feasibility and acceptance. The implementation of this solution may be smoother if facilitated using various leadership styles. In this article, the transformational leadership style is used for implementing the solution to the problem. The findings of this research may be beneficial for other universities in Lebanon and other nations that may be considering the implementation of online education.

AB  - Engineering in K-12 classrooms has been receiving expanding emphasis in the United States. The integration of science, mathematics, and engineering is a benefit and goal of K-12 engineering; however, current empirical research on the efficacy of K-12 science, mathematics, and engineering integration is limited. This study adds to this growing field, using discourse analysis techniques to examine whether and why students integrate math and science concepts into their engineering design work. The study focuses on student work during a unit from a high school engineering course. Video data were collected during the unit and were used to identify episodes of students discussing math and science concepts. Using discourse analysis, the authors found that students successfully applied math and science concepts to their engineering design work without teacher prompting when the concepts were familiar. However, explicit teacher prompting and instruction regarding the integration of less familiar concepts did not seem to facilitate student use of those concepts. Possible explanations and implications are discussed.

AB  - Within the business world, there is growing evidence and increasing acceptance that sustainability and environmental practices are the main drivers for current innovation and success. We developed an interdisciplinary, offshore course where undergraduate business students could truly investigate and experience the benefits of environmentally and socially responsible business through the lens of the ecotourism industry. Many in the environmental movement, as well as those who teach about it, see business and environmental issues as being in opposition to each other. We found that this is definitely not the case. By exploring the important ways in which ecology, law, policy, ethics, and culture need to inform business decisions, students were able to apply what they learned in the course to capstone projects in which they created business plans that took into account the ecology of the land, the laws they must adhere to, the culture of the Costa Rican people, and the financial opportunities for socially and environmentally responsible entrepreneurs.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: This study examines differences in credit and noncredit users' learning and usage of the Plant Sciences E-Library (PASSEL, http://passel.unl.edu), a large international, open-source multidisciplinary learning object repository. Background: Advances in online education are helping educators to meet the needs of formal academic credit students, as well as informal noncredit learners. Since online learning attracts learners with a wide variety of backgrounds and intentions, it is important understand learner behavior so that instructional resources can be designed to meet the diversity of learner motivations and needs. Methodology: This research uses both descriptive statistics and cluster analysis. The descriptive statistics address the research question of how credit learners differ from noncredit learners in using an international e-library of learning objects. Cluster analysis identifies high and low credit/noncredit students based on their quiz scores and follow-up descriptive statistics to (a) differentiate their usage patterns and (b) help describe possible learning approaches (deep, surface, and strategic). Contribution: This research is unique in its use of objective, web-tracking data and its novel use of clustering and descriptive analytic approaches to compare credit and noncredit learners' online behavior of the same educational materials. It is also one of the first to begin to identify learning approaches of the noncredit learner. Findings: Results showed that credit users scored higher on quizzes and spent more time on the online quizzes and lessons than did noncredit learners, suggesting their academic orientation. Similarly, high credit scorers spent more time on individual lessons and quizzes than did the low scorers. The most striking difference among noncredit learners was in session times, with the low scorers spending more time in a session, suggesting more browsing behavior. Results were used to develop learner profiles for the four groups (high/low quiz scorers x credit/noncredit). Recommendations for Practitioners: These results provide preliminary insight for instructors or instructional designers. For example, low scoring credit students are spending a reasonable amount of time on a lesson but still score low on the quiz. Results suggest that they may need more online scaffolding or auto-generated guidance, such as the availability of relevant animations or the need to review certain parts of a lesson based on questions missed. Recommendation for Researchers: The study showed the value of objective, web-tracking data and novel use of clustering and descriptive analytic approaches to compare different types of learners. One conclusion of the study was that this web-tracking data be combined with student self-report data to provide more validation of results. Another conclusion was that demographic data from noncredit learners could be instrumental in further refining learning approaches for noncredit learners. Impact on Society: Learning object repositories, online courses, blended courses, and MOOCs often provide learners the option of moving freely among educational content, choosing not only topics of interest but also formats of material they feel will advance their learning. Since online learning is becoming more prolific and attracts learners with a wide variety of backgrounds and intentions, these results show the importance of understanding learner behavior so that e-learning instructional resources can be designed to meet the diversity of learner motivations and needs. Future Research: Future research should combine web-tracking data with student self-report to provide more validation of results. In addition, collection of demographic data and disaggregation of noncredit student usage motivations would help further refining learning approaches for this growing population of online users.

AB  - Each fall at harvest time, young students in the authors' part of the Midwest visit apple orchards to learn more about the life cycle of plants. This tradition is one part of a larger unit centered on apples, integrating life science with language arts and social studies. The authors partnered with kindergarten teachers at several schools to design and teach a five day apple-themed engineering design unit. Building on their fascination with things that float and how they apply forces to make them move, they turn apples into sailboats. This lesson utilized inexpensive and common materials, many of which are easily substituted, making it an accessible choice for at-home investigations by students or families.

AB  - The visualization of latent fingerprints often involves the use of a chemical substance that creates a contrast between the fingerprint residues and the surface on which the print was deposited. The chemical-aided visualization techniques can be divided into two main categories: those that chemically react with the fingerprint residue and those that adhere to the fingerprint residue by intermolecular forces. A plethora of empirically effective fingerprint revelation methods have been developed but the chemistry is often incompletely understood. This article briefly describes the chemical rationale of most fingerprint visualization techniques practiced today. This material is suitable for a forensic chemistry course or for an introductory chemistry course to introduce the relevance of chemistry in law enforcement. This material may also apply to an organic or biochemistry course when discussing noncovalent intermolecular interactions.

AB  - Inspired by the news that Bristol had become the UK's first Green Capital, Kate Hawkey, Jon James and Celia Tidmarsh set out to explore what a "Green Capital" School Curriculum might look like. Hawkey, James and Tidmarsh explain how they created a cross-curricular project to deliver in-school workshops focused on the teaching of climate change, involving student teachers from the subject disciplines of history, geography and science. Hawkey, James and Tidmarsh outline the objectives, activities and outcomes of this project, and explain the unique focus of each subject discipline. Hawkey, James and Tidmarsh illustrate the strengths of the project in terms of both pupils' understanding and student teachers' knowledge, of their own subject and how it connects to other subject disciplines and identify the challenges they faced in developing a "post-carbon" curriculum.

AB  - STEM integration has attracted considerable attention in educational research, yet there has been a dearth of research exploring how STEM integration is perceived and implemented in regular school settings. The purposes of the study were to explore Taiwanese junior secondary teachers' conceptions of STEM integration with regard to their practices, investigate the ways STEM integration is implemented in the current school curricula, and analyze contextual supports and barriers to the implementations. This study adopted a qualitative research design. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 in-service teachers who delivered integrated STEM in their classrooms. The teachers' conceptions and contextual factors were analyzed using the constant comparison method, whereas the implementations were examined by the two-dimensional spectral framework proposed in the study: "disciplinarity" and "pedagogy." Three categories of teacher conceptions were identified that highlighted how STEM can bring different learning experiences to students. The implementations varied in the degree of disciplinary integration and the extent to which teacher guidance was provided. While school conditions and wider educational contexts posed challenges to STEM integration and implementation, school professional support plays a key role in facilitating integration and teaching across disciplines. This study provides insights into how teachers reconcile their conceptions with school conditions and educational contexts to implement STEM integration in regular classrooms. The two-dimensional framework remarks the values of diversity, namely, to appreciate the learning possibilities opened by varied integration approaches, promote diverse learning outcomes, and allow adaptations based on school contexts.

AB  - Reading strategy instruction has been an important area in educational psychology for decades, however, research has primarily focused on its influence on learning outcomes rather than learning processes; reading pure texts rather than illustrated texts; and immediate effect rather than retention effect. This study used an eye-tracker to investigate the immediate and delayed effects of text-diagram reading instruction on reading comprehension and learning processes in illustrated text reading. Fourth-grade students with high (N = 66) and low reading ability (N = 66) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a text-diagram group who received text-diagram instruction which emphasized diagram decoding and integration of relevant textual and pictorial information, a placebo group who received instruction which emphasized comprehension monitoring, and a control group which received no reading instruction. All participants read four illustrated science texts for a baseline check, instructional example, immediate testing, and delayed testing. The results showed that the effect of text-diagram instruction was more evident in the immediate test than the delayed test. The eye-movement pattern showed that the students who received text-diagram reading instruction spent significantly more reading time on illustrations, made more integrative transitions between text and illustrations, and spent a higher proportion of total reading time on illustrations in immediate and delayed reading situations than the other groups. Overall, this study developed an effective text-diagram instruction method to promote reading comprehension, identified the reading processes underlying the effect of text-diagram strategy instruction, and depicted the changing appearances of reading instruction intervention over time.

AB  - This study aimed to elicit middle school preservice mathematics teachers' self-reported web of knowledge recalled in generating mathematically rich and contextually realistic problems. We designed this study as multi-tier design research incorporated into two teacher education courses in which 40 preservice teachers enrolled in total. Preservice teachers worked in small groups and recorded the characteristics of mathematically rich and contextually realistic problems. They were also asked to produce webs of knowledge recalled in this process. Preservice teachers' individual reflection papers, audio records of their group discussions and interviews were analyzed to understand how different types of knowledge in their web of knowledge function in relation to the mathematical richness and contextual realness aspects of the problems. The findings indicated that preservice teachers could identify various characteristics for mathematical richness and contextual realistic aspects of the problems. In relation to those characteristics, the preservice teachers' self-reported web of knowledge produced three core knowledge types for ensuring mathematical richness (i.e., knowledge of content, curriculum, and pedagogy) and two aspects of realistic contexts (i.e., real life knowledge and interdisciplinary knowledge). Furthermore, although they included common knowledge types, the webs of knowledge were in different shapes and indicated various relationships (i.e., hierarchical, categorical, influential, and holistic.). Considering the various relations indicated by the webs of knowledge, we claimed that teachers needed an interconnected knowledge base for mathematically rich and contextually realistic problems, the implications of which we discussed for mathematics teacher education.

AB  - Mathematics and science are tightly interwoven, yet they are often treated as distinct disciplines in the educational context. This study details the development, implementation and outcomes of a teaching intervention that highlights the links between mathematics and science, in the form of a first-year interdisciplinary course. A mixed method study using surveys and focus groups was employed to investigate undergraduate science students' perceptions of their experiences. Findings reveal that students bring strong beliefs about the nature of mathematics and science from secondary school, which can impact significantly on the success of interdisciplinary science-mathematics courses at the tertiary level. Despite this, a range of beneficial outcomes can arise from such courses when they are delivered within a framework of analysing real-world issues. However, students with weak mathematical skills derived little benefit from an interdisciplinary approach and are likely to disengage from learning, in comparison with students who enter university with a solid foundation in mathematics.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: The present study aims to describe existing peer-to-peer, social network-based sharing practices among adult students in teacher colleges. Background: Ubiquitous social network sites open up a wide array of possibilities for peer-to-peer information and knowledge sharing. College instructors are often unaware of such practices that happen behind the scenes. Methodology: An interpretative, qualitative research methodology was used. Thirty-seven Israeli students at a teacher college in Israel participated in either focus group discussions of (N = 29) or in-depth interviews (N = 8). Contribution: Whereas knowledge sharing has been a main focus of research in organizational and information sciences, its relevance to educational settings has thus far been underscored. Recent research shows that peer-to-peer knowledge sharing is wide-spread among teenage students. The current study extends that work to an adult student population. Findings: The findings show that knowledge sharing of this type is a common and even central feature of students' college life and study behavior. It takes place through a variety of small and larger social network-based peer groups of different formations, including mostly college students but at time also practicing, experienced teachers. Sharing groups are formed on the spot for short term purposes or are stable, continuous over longer time periods. The contents shared are predominantly lesson summaries, material for exams, reading summaries, and lesson plans. They are used immediately or stored for future use, as students have access to vast data bases of stored materials that have been compiled throughout the years by students of previous cohorts. Teacher students mentioned a range of reasons for sharing, and overall regard it very positive. However, some downsides were also acknowledged (i.e., superficial learning, exclusion, attentional overload, and interruptions). Recommendations for Practitioners: College faculty and teaching staff should be cognizant and informed about these widespread peer-based knowledge sharing practices and consider whether perhaps changes in teaching formats and task assignments are required as a result. Future Research: Future research should extend this work to other higher education settings, cultures and countries, and should map the perceptions of higher education teaching staff about peer-to-peer, online knowledge sharing.

AB  - Library and information science (LIS) is highly interdisciplinary by nature and is affected by the incessant evolution of technologies. A recent study surveying research trends in the years 2002-6 at various information science departments worldwide has found that a clear trend was identified in Masters theses and doctoral dissertations of social aspects of information moving into the spotlight. The study found that only a third of the research that was tagged on the ProQuest Digital Dissertations database under either or both "Library Science" and "Information Science" was actually conducted at LIS departments. The current study aims to examine the remaining two thirds of these papers, conducted in non-LIS departments. This will contribute toward our understanding of the field and its future development. The research findings indicate that there is a relatively clear division of research topics between the studies conducted in various information studies departments and those conducted in other departments that study information. The main difference found is the opposite foci of LIS and non-LIS studies. While LIS scholars focus on the information user, other fields, headed by business administration, computer science, education and communication, focus on the system, on information technology, the information industry and the management of information.

AB  - In practice, sustainable development is the use of natural resources in a manner that allows ecosystems to continue to function as natural ecosystems and biotic and abiotic interactions to maintain checks and balances are homeostatic. Historically, human activity has led to modification of nature that leads to (1) economic development, (2) biotic simplification (e.g., loss of biodiversity and simplified food chains), and (3) abiotic degradation (e.g., large changes in nutrient or light availability). Many experts believe that further biotic simplification and abiotic degradation are no longer sustainable, that the conflict between development and environment is the key to the quality of future human life on the planet, and that sustainability education should begin with young children. Thus, the central sustainable development focus is to balance quality of life with quality of the environment. The focus of the activity described in this article is to introduce and understand the concept of sustainable development by using ideas found in "The Lorax." While the activity as it is written is best suited for fifth grade, it has been used with minimal modification in grades 3-8. This activity is typically used as an introductory activity for a unit of instruction on sustainability and environmental problems, with appropriate follow-up activities tailored to meet specific school contexts. The activity is also suitable for use following lessons and activities on energy in both formal and informal (afterschool science clubs) settings. The recommended way of beginning this activity is small-group read-alouds using the Readers' Theater format. This type of integrated curricular reading is supported by both the anchor and grade-level standards of the "Common Core English Language Arts Standards" (CCSS-ELA). A project rubric and discussion sheet is available at www.nsta.org/SC1603.

AB  - Calls for increased interdisciplinary education have led to the development of numerous teaching methods designed to help teachers provide meaningful experiences for their students. However, methods of guiding teachers in the successful adoption of innovative teaching methods are not firmly set. This qualitative study sought to better understand how school-based agricultural education teachers decide to adopt or discontinue a teaching innovation when introduced through ready-made lesson plans, which is currently a common practice of teaching method integration in SBAE. Constant comparative analysis unveiled themes within the reactions to the teaching method's use, as well as how teacher actions to those reactions led to their ultimate adoption or discontinuance of the teaching method.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how students' engagement varies in different STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) learning environments. More specifically, we focus on the significance of a learning environment applying an integrated STEM (iSTEM) approach and the significance of STEM learning environments' student-centredness. Moreover, we explore the relative importance of different student-centred principles (lesson plan and implementation, communicative interactions, student-teacher relationships) for students' engagement in the STEM learning environment. Applying a mixed-method approach, we draw from observational data of 24 STEM lessons in combination with data from seven focus groups with 67 grade 9 students. The quantitative findings, based on the observational data, show that a learning environment applying an iSTEM approach seems to support students' engagement. Further investigation made it clear that the student-centredness in this learning environment is especially significant. Regarding the specific student-centred principles, all principles had a significant impact on students' engagement. The focus group data make clear that, besides student-centredness, the integrative aspect and the use of authentic real-world problems in iSTEM can also be engaging for students. These results indicate that iSTEM is a good practice to engage students in the STEM learning environment, as it facilitates teachers' implementation of a general student-centred approach.

AB  - In the present article, we describe a 3-day experimental workshop on type I diabetes aimed at helping high school students to understand how fundamental research on glycemia regulation contributes to the development of scientific knowledge and therapeutic strategies. The workshop engaged students in open-ended investigations and guided experiments. Each class was divided into three or four groups, with each group working with a trained doctoral student or postdoctoral fellow. During an initial questioning phase, students observed slides depicting the glycemia of individuals in various situations. Students identified hyperglycemic individuals relative to the average glycemia of the displayed population. Students were asked to devise a treatment for these diabetics. They quickly realized that they couldn't experiment on patients and understood the need for laboratory models. Each group gave ideas of experiments to perform. We then explained, taking into account their propositions, the protocols students could execute to address one of the following questions: Which criteria must an animal model of diabetes fulfill? How do pancreatic cells maintain glycemia? Is there a way to produce an insulin protein similar to the one released by human pancreatic cells? We used two different evaluation metrics of the workshop: a questionnaire filled out by the students before and after the workshop and a poster produced by students at the end of the workshop. We found that this educational approach successfully improved student awareness and understanding of the scientific reasoning and research process.

AB  - This paper explores the foundational principles of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) as an integrative teaching strategy designed deliberately to cross discipline boundaries in order to make meaningful and lasting connections. The authors suggest that while PBL has in recent times has largely manifested towards a method of inquiry within a single discipline the founding principles and key characteristics that inform PBL may be applied to solving technological inquiry where an understanding and application of scientific principles is fundamental in informing and developing the preferred solution. This paper highlights that in order to be effective classroom educators, in an ever increasing and complex world, pre-service teachers' need to develop robust mental models and metacognitive skills that are transferable. In supporting this development the rationale and the application of PBL as an integrated teaching and learning strategy in pre-service science and technology education will be examined. This paper suggests that PBL is an effective strategy in supporting inquiry of an interdisciplinary nature as well as developing dispositions that embrace collaborative inquiry and reflective practice.

AB  - Neuroaesthetics is a burgeoning new interdisciplinary research space in which cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy intersect in order to better inform our understanding of aesthetic experience. The purpose of this study is to analyze high-profile work in neuroaesthetics in the light of recent research into interdisciplinary epistemology, asking "Do current attempts to use neuroscience to explore art meet rigorous interdisciplinary quality criteria?" I suggest that current approaches in neuroaesthetics frequently fail in a number of ways: they fail to meet disciplinary standards in either aesthetics or neuroscience, they fail to blend disciplines in a generative way, and they add little new that could not be investigated more fruitfully at other levels of analysis. In response to these potential pitfalls, I recommend that future researchers embrace a form of "problem-focused epistemological pluralism" in their neuroaesthetic endeavors. I end with a consideration of the educational implications of these issues. (Contains 3 notes.)

AB  - STEM is the abbreviation of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, and S-STEM is with the addition of the Social Studies discipline. It is thought that getting the views of teachers who have made practical studies on STEM about S-STEM will shed light on both policy-makers and researchers. The aim of the research is to get the views of the primary teachers about SSTEM. This research is a phenomenological study within the scope of basic qualitative research method. Participants of this study are eight primary school teachers. Telephone interviews were used in the interview technique used in this phenomenological study. The data obtained in the research were evaluated by qualitative data analysis. Results were obtained such as the definition of STEM, STEM implementations, dimensions which integrate to STEM, suggestions on integrating social studies to STEM, values and skills which handled with STEM, suggestions for effective S-STEM implementations.

AB  - The modern teacher must respond to the needs of society in the context of Education 4.0. It seems suitable to adapt this trend to teaching children at an early age. The paper examines the usefulness of professional education for kindergarten and primary school teachers focused on personality development, emotional intelligence, and other social areas with an emphasis on creating a favourable classroom climate. The pilot study aims to discover which specific areas of this new education approach contributed to the teaching practice. The training effects were evaluated using questionnaires collected from 27 participants before and after the programme in 2018 and 2019. The data obtained from the closed questions were analysed using statistical methods, while open-ended questions were processed by content analysis. An ANOVA test demonstrated the effect in all monitored areas. In verbal answers, the participants appreciated the acquired skills in the field of communication and emotional intelligence. The results suggest that a training programme using elements from management appears to be beneficial to current teaching practice.

AB  - Many interesting research and design questions occur at the intersections of traditional disciplines, yet most coursework and research programs for undergraduate engineering students are focused on one discipline. This leads to underutilization of the potential in better preparing students through multidisciplinary projects. Identifying this opportunity to better prepare the engineering and technology students, this paper presents a multidisciplinary integrated research and design platform on tour guide robots. Through integration of electrical hardware, mechanical systems, design manufacture, and complex programming, the proposed work serves as an ideal platform through which students will be able to study a complex and integrated engineering system. Preliminary implementation of the proposed platform has led to numerous undergraduate research projects, capstone senior design projects, course improvements, publications in peer-reviewed conferences, and best student paper awards.

AB  - Mission-oriented research combines a wide array of natural and social science disciplines to offer solutions for complex and multi-dimensional challenges such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, and scarcity of natural resources. The utilization of the outputs of mission-oriented research aims for changes in behavior, policy and practice resulting in real world impacts. Systematically assessing such research impacts and impact-generating processes is novel and offers great potential to plan for impactful research. This article develops a framework for systemic research impact assessment (RIA) on the basis of a literature review taking natural resource management (NRM) research as an example. The review compiles and analyzes 70 relevant RIA approaches. The resulting framework combines four components for improving societal impacts (1) an integrated component enabling reflection of impacts on all sustainability dimensions, (2) a missions component orienting toward societal goals to ensure societal relevance, (3) an inclusive component enabling wide participation to ensure legitimacy of research and its impact, and (4) a strategic component to choose appropriate assessment scales and time dimensions to ensure effectiveness. We provide suitable examples for the framework and we conclude with a call for an increased use of systemic and formative RIA that incorporate participatory strategies for research priority setting as well as socially deliberated target systems (e.g. SDGs), to plan for impactful mission-oriented research.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: The dynamic nature of the information systems (IS) field presents educators with the perpetual challenge of keeping course offerings current and relevant. This paper describes the process at a College of Business (COB) to redesign the introductory IS course to better prepare students for advanced business classes and equip them with interdisciplinary knowledge and skills demanded in today's workplace. Background: The course was previously in the Computer Science (CSC) Department, itself within the COB. However, an administrative restructuring resulted in the CSC department's removal from the COB and left the core course in limbo. Methodology: This paper presents a case study using focus groups with students, faculty, and advisory council members to assess the value of the traditional introductory course. A survey was distributed to students after implementation of the newly developed course to assess the reception of the course. Contribution: This paper provides an outline of the decision-making process leading to the course redesign of the introductory IS course, including the context and the process of a new course development. Practical suggestions for implementing and teaching an introductory IS course in a business school are given. Findings: Focus group assessment revealed that stakeholders rated the existing introductory IS course of minimal value as students progressed through the COB program, and even less upon entering the workforce. The findings indicated a complete overhaul of the course was required. Recommendations for Practitioners: The subject of technology sometimes requires more than a simple update to the curriculum. When signs point to the need for a complete overhaul, this paper gives practical guidance supplemented with relevant literature for other academicians to follow. Impact on Society: Students are faced with increasing pressure to be proficient with the latest technology, in both the classroom where educators are trying to prepare them for the modern workplace, as well as the organization which faces an even greater pressure to leverage the latest technology. The newly designed introductory IS course provides students, and eventually organizations, a better measure of this proficiency. Future Research: Future research on the efficacy of this new course design should include longitudinal data to determine the impact on graduates, and eventually the assessment of those graduates' performance in the workplace.

AB  - This article argues that scholarship on literacy in and across the disciplines has disproportionately focused on the core subjects of English, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies rather than on "specialist" subjects such as Physical Education. This disparity in emphasis has provided little guidance to specialist teachers seeking to understand and address the literacy demands of subject areas that often privilege an expanded conception of literacy. To illustrate the affordances of such analysis for PE teachers as well as their literacy colleagues, the reading demands of a particular multimodal text from PE--a three-part basketball play--are presented in light of key themes from the US Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy. Complexities related to collective, embodied, and sequential meaning construction are explored. Recommendations for instruction and professional collaboration are shared.

AB  - The paper analyzes studies on continuing education, explains the concept of "continuity of patriotic education and moral development by means of regional culture", determines the uniqueness of regional culture as the core of patriotic education and moral development, and characterizes the model of continuity of patriotic education and moral development. The practical value of the paper is that its results could be used to develop the cultural potential of Russian regions. The results can also be used by the Federal districts administration, subjects of the Russian Federation, interregional cooperation associations, transnational companies, and governmental agencies that deal with the development of regional culture in Russia, in particular, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Regional Development of the Russian Federation, and the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation. The importance of regionalization as the key factor in the improvement of patriotic education and moral development was substantiated based on the analysis of ways of overcoming discontinuity of patriotic education and moral development. This enables evaluating the significance of the potential of regional schools and higher educational institutions and their effect on the formation of an individual's worldview.

AB  - The social and collaborative aspects of work settings are becoming increasingly important. For example, recent research has placed emphasis on the social nature of learning. In addition, many authors have suggested that 21st century skills that will be required in future work and professional environments will involve collaborative skills, making them essential for competitive careers. Currently little is known about how networks of professional teachers operate, especially those based on newer technologies. Given the importance of this issue, this study investigated the support networks and collegiality of career technical teachers working in the area of health science. Participants included 317 educators (secondary educators and individuals from the career technical sector), all part of a statewide health science career pathway program. The results indicated that most of the teachers reported having access to some type of support network. The results of a structural equation modeling analysis indicated that respondents who reported having more teachers in their programs were more likely to report higher levels of collegial support and collective efficacy. Similarly, teachers who reported working more with other teachers on interdisciplinary curriculum projects tended to report higher levels of collegial support and collective efficacy.

AB  - As demographics in the United States shift, family and consumer sciences (FCS) professionals must be prepared to foster healthy communities that embrace multilingual families. Because hegemonic language ideologies challenge multilingual families, FCS professionals need to know how to inclusively reframe communities to honor multilingual families. Addressing FCS pre- and professional development, this paper introduces an interdisciplinary dialogue exploring the intersection of sociolinguistics and FCS. The paper offers (a) a modified ecological model reflecting linguistic communities and (b) a pedagogical framework for constructing affective learning outcomes inclusive of multilingual communities. it also aims to initiate a dialogue between the disciplines of FCS and sociolinguistics, the study of language in the context of society and community.

AB  - Research, carried out mainly in the period between the 1960s and 1980s, reported significant differences in the thinking styles of science and arts students. At this time university and school teaching was highly specialised and concern was expressed in the ongoing "two cultures" debate (Snow, 1959).Considerable changes have taken place in the provision of education at all levels since this time, including changes in the role and culture of modern universities with a wider range of interdisciplinary degree modules; and the desire for students to keep their career options open, reflecting their uncertain employment future. In this study problem solving tests were completed by one hundred and sixteen participants recruited from a post-1992 university and equally balanced between arts and science undergraduate students. The tests covered convergent thinking, divergent thinking, preferred learning style and creative problem solving skills using examples of novel and imperfectly defined problems in the fields of management and public policy. This was followed by direct interviews with a selected sample to gain more textured insight into their contemporary educational experiences. The findings of this study were in marked contrast to earlier published results in that no differences were found in the problem solving skills of arts and science students. Differences were found in preferred learning styles but these were much smaller than reported previously. This research indicates that modern graduates are likely to have a more balanced educational profile than their specialised predecessors and examines possible causes. (Contains 8 figures.)

AB  - With a national emphasis on integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in K-16 courses, incorporating technology in a meaningful way is critical. This research examines whether STEM and non-STEM teachers were able to incorporate technology in STEM courses successfully with sufficient professional development. The teachers in this study consisted of faculty from middle schools, high schools, and colleges recruited for STEM Guitar Building institutes held between 2013 and 2016. Each teacher participated in a 50-hour professional development opportunity in the manufacture of a solid-body electric guitar and received instruction on how to teach integrated STEM Modular Learning Activities (MLAs), which are aligned with the Common Core mathematics standards and the "Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)". The data collected include pre- and postassessment from 769 students in three grade bands (grades 6-8, 9-12, and undergraduate level from 15 states). The results showed statistically significant gains at the p < 0.05 level across all 12 of the core MLAs, with no statistically significant difference between STEM and non-STEM instructors for all except two MLAs. The two MLAs that did reveal a statistically significant difference were more technical--Set Up and Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing Systems (CAD/CAM). These results show non-STEM and STEM teachers alike in this study were able to successfully incorporate technology in "NGSS"-aligned integrated STEM lessons, as evidenced by student learning gains.

AB  - For decades, educators have hoped to integrate geospatial tools into K-12 classrooms but struggled with barriers of time, technology, and curriculum alignment. The authors formed a design partnership with ninth-grade science and social studies teachers in an urban high school in order to conduct teacher professional development while also developing geospatially enabled curricula to enact in their classrooms. This article includes a description of the curriculum design principles and processes, as well as an explanation of the professional development strategies as participants worked shoulder to shoulder in designing engaging classroom instruction to enhance students' geospatial thinking and reasoning skills. One of the activities presented is an example of the design and development process, and lessons learned from the pilot test implementation are presented. This article may inform similar work with geospatial technologies in teacher professional development and curriculum development.

AB  - "Gardens for Bellies" ["Haver til Maver"] is an organic school gardens project at Krogerup farm in Northern Sealand, Denmark, which provides children with first-hand experiences in a natural, outdoor environment. The general intention of the project is to expand children's competences and their knowledge of nature, farming and food preparation. This article draws on a new evaluation of "Gardens for Bellies" based on qualitative as well as quantitative studies carried out by education researchers. The evaluation shows very positive learning benefits linked to experience and enjoyment. The outdoor learning programme and environment represents a unique addition to the national curriculum of the Danish state school system, providing the possibility of interdisciplinary and enjoyment-based learning. One of the main conclusions is that the pupils who participate in the "Gardens for Bellies" programme develop a desire to learn. A number of the competencies they develop relate directly to the subject of science, as well as other school subjects. Parents confirm the learning benefits and view "Gardens for Bellies" as a unique supplement to regular school teaching. The experience dimension and a certain communication of love together with the teachers' passion to show their passion for teaching on site provide one possible explanation as to why the desire to learn is stimulated among the pupils.

AB  - Biology majors team with business administration majors to develop proposals for "green" enterprise for a business plan competition. The course begins with a series of student presentations so that science students learn about the fundamentals of business, and business students learn about environmental biology. Then mixed biology-business student teams prepare a comprehensive business plan for a hypothetical green business start-up. The plans include a discussion of the environmental problem(s) that the proposed product or service addresses, along with a detailed discussion of the financial, managerial, and marketing steps needed to bring the product or service to market. The completed plans are entered into the college's annual business plan competition in which finalists present their plans in front of a panel of outside judges, including investors, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs. The experience gives students insight into the dynamics of cross-functional teaming and the challenges of learning differing vocabularies and ways of looking at problems, thus modeling what many of them will experience in the workforce.

AB  - The Panama-Heritage University Indigenous Intercambio Program (PIIP) is a science and cultural exchange between participants from both the United States (US) and the Ngäbe and Buglé (NB) of Panama. This study abroad program is specifically designed to resonate with the cultural backgrounds of Latinx and Native American students together with the Indigenous community they work with. PIIP provides a model for developing a community-based study abroad experience that is empowering for both students and host communities. Data gathered from US students, the NB participants, and a PIIP professor were analyzed to examine questions exploring how taking underrepresented minority students on an international experience is different--both for the study abroad student and the host community. We explore how power dynamics are always at play and begin to redefine the purpose of study abroad. Mutual learning, an exchange of ideas, and a relationship built on reciprocity and respect form the foundation for a balanced and fair partnership. PIIP offers possibilities and hope for both students and the partnering community members.

AB  - We present an empirical investigation of a classroom training fostering vocational students' consideration of source information when deciding about science-based controversies. The training was specifically aimed at raising students' awareness of the division of cognitive labor and the resulting need to take a source's competence into account when deciding whom to trust. Data were collected from a training group and a waiting list control group in a pretest-posttest design. The results show that students benefitted from the training in terms of their inclination to agree with pertinent expert sources rather than low-pertinent experts and to refer to the source of information to justify their judgment. Source memory was not affected by the training.

AB  - Although science educators at all levels have focused on teaching students scientific literacy for nearly five decades, studies indicate that the average student remains far from scientifically literate. To address this issue at the local level, faculty at Trinity University, in San Antonio, Texas, significantly revised the curriculum of an existing introductory physical geology laboratory course. The course, which satisfies general education requirements at Trinity, was revised to provide students learning opportunities in a scientific process context as part of a new science literacy initiative. This effort was spurred by general dissatisfaction with the existing curricular structure of the course as well as a new interdisciplinary, National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded initiative to support the integration of research-grade instrumentation in curricula and undergraduate research across campus. The physical geology laboratory course revision was based on research that demonstrated the efficacy of learning through active participation, interpretation, iteration, and reflection, especially when knowledge and skills are gained within an explicit scientific process context. In addition to significantly revising laboratory activities, we added new activities within the course framework that involved the use of two new, NSF-funded instruments, including a handheld X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) and an inductively coupled plasma-optical emissions spectrometer (ICP-OES), which we used to improve student understanding of qualitative and quantitative elemental analyses. Finally, we introduced the use of a new course reader that provided both background materials for each activity as well as a new focus on providing a scientific process context for students. To assess student learning, we used in-class observations, student-instructor discussions, pre- and postlearning questionnaires, prelaboratory quizzes, course activities completed during class time, modified postactivity reflection questions, practical examinations, and a final examination. We also included faculty, staff, and administrator perspectives to qualitatively assess the impact of course changes upon student learning. Our results imply that students achieved the primary learning goals we developed for this scientific literacy initiative, including: (1) improved understanding of the scientific process and the nature of science; (2) improved understanding of qualitative and quantitative elemental research methods; and (3) improved understanding of the applicability of scientific research to real-world problems. Importantly, our findings suggest that the integration of research-grade instrumentation into introductory coursework, in a scientific process context, is an effective way to promote scientific literacy as well as to provide opportunities for students to understand and apply the knowledge and skills necessary to perform scientific research. We believe that this example of a significant course redesign provides a model that can be transferred to other geosciences departments as well as to other scientific disciplines.

AB  - The need for interdisciplinary graduate training programs which prepare students to conceptualize the application of their research in clinical settings continues to grow. Though several programs have been cultivated to address this need, demand still outweighs supply. The following describes a curriculum developed with the intent of incorporating medical knowledge into a PhD graduate training program. Development of this Molecular Medicine program by the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine in collaboration with Case Western Reserve University was funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute "Med into Grad" initiative. The core curriculum of this program begins with a foundation in Human Physiology and Disease course in which anatomy faculty introduce students to a basic overview of gross anatomy structure and function. This course is followed by five fundamental basic science courses, a composite course focusing on principles of clinical and translation research, a course on laboratory techniques and three, 12-week research rotations. In the second year of the program, students begin their dissertation research, complete their qualifying examination, and partake in an individually tailored Clinical Experience course. Interdisciplinary graduate programs like this provide another venue for faculty in anatomical sciences to help aspiring translational scientists relate basic science knowledge to human pathophysiology and health.

AB  - Changes to the mathematics and science curriculums are designed to increase rigour in mathematics, and place greater emphasis on mathematical content in science subjects at key stages 3, 4 and 5 (ages 11-18). One way to meet the growing challenge of providing increased emphasis on mathematics in the science curriculum is greater collaboration between mathematics and science departments. This article explores possible ways in which this collaboration might take place, by looking at five case studies from schools who have implemented cross-curricular projects between mathematics and science departments.

AB  - Historically, scholars have made unfailing efforts to position education as a standard science, but no solid success has been achieved regardless of the positivistic paradigm, quantitative approaches, or value-free neutral stances they adopted. In China, scholars have set up a so-called "three independency" standard for the scientific study of education, but it has been finally proved invalid in practice. As interdisciplines permeate the field of education, education experiences a crisis of being colonized. After serious rethinking, interdisciplines were widely believed to do more good than harm to education. Therefore, education is beginning to transform from a "colony" to an "empire". In this transformation, education finds it necessary to break the traditional disciplinary boundaries and make it a field in which interdisciplinary communication is contributory to the enrichment of scholarship.

AB  - A modern school should encourage students to deepen the subjects autonomously and beyond the normal curricula. Such aim, requiring both well-disposed pupils and cooperative teachers, was reached by the pioneering interdisciplinary project "From Soccerene to Fullerene" in 2013. The scientific education was noticeably improved, especially for the mathematical aspect, through a constructivist activity never tried before in the Italian school system.

AB  - There are many continuous quantitative dimensions in the physical world. Philosophical, psychological and neural work has focused mostly on space and number. However, there are other important continuous dimensions (e.g., time, mass). Moreover, space can be broken down into more specific dimensions (e.g., length, area, density) and number can be conceptualized discretely or continuously (i.e., natural versus real numbers). Variation on these quantitative dimensions is typically correlated, e.g., larger objects often weigh more than smaller ones. Number is a distinctive continuous dimension, because the natural numbers (i.e., positive integers) are used to quantify collections of discrete objects. This aspect of number is emphasized by teaching of the count word sequence and arithmetic during the early school years. We review research on spatial and numerical estimation, and argue that a generalized magnitude system is the starting point for development in both domains. Development occurs along several lines: (1) changes in capacity, durability and precision, (2) differentiation of the generalized magnitude system into separable dimensions, (3) formation of a discrete number system, i.e., the positive integers, (4) mapping the positive integers onto the continuous number line, and (5) acquiring abstract knowledge of the relations between pairs of systems. We discuss implications of this approach for teaching various topics in mathematics, including scaling, measurement, proportional reasoning, and fractions.

AB  - While diagrams make the text more visually appealing and provide an image of the text, they also do much more. Subsequently, the authors designed a series of lessons for students to discover the many purposes of graphics in science. A particular utility of these interdisciplinary lessons is that they are used with any science text featuring visual images. (Contains 6 figures.)

AB  - We developed an interactive online textbook that interleaves R programming activities with text as a way to facilitate students' understanding of statistical ideas while minimizing the cognitive and emotional burden of learning programming. In this exploratory study, we characterize the attitudes and experiences of 672 undergraduate students as they used our online textbook as part of a 10-week introductory course in statistics. Students expressed negative attitudes and concerns related to R at the beginning of the course, but most developed more positive attitudes after engaging with course materials, regardless of demographic characteristics or prior programming experience. Analysis of a subgroup of students revealed that change in attitudes toward R may be linked to students' patterns of engagement over time and students' perceptions of the learning environment.

AB  - Learning communities (LCs) offer high-impact practices of active learning and practical application, but such practices demand devoted class time and room for reflection. Core science courses that serve as prerequisites for more advanced courses have specific and fixed content that offers no space in which to incorporate the ideals of LCs. Wagner College's three-course model for first-year LCs solves this conundrum by providing a Reflective Tutorial (RFT)--a course dedicated to critical thinking, frequent writing, reflection, and practical application through experiential learning--that bridges two content courses based on a well-developed theme. This structure allows any course appropriate for first-year students, including core science courses, to be incorporated in an LC. Two faculty members work as a team to create the three-course LC; each faculty member teaches one of the content courses to the same group of 24-28 students. The two instructors team teach the RFT or offer independent small sections of the RFT; the RFT replaces the traditional first-year writing course. Specific examples are provided of LCs incorporating a core science course.

AB  - Although conventional psychology is often characterised as the science of the individual mind, it is also important to introduce students to the potential interdisciplinary and multi-dimensional nature of psychology. In this paper we outline the design, development, and delivery of an innovative course that employed an ecological framework to engage students in mental health issues and policy via the teaching of a course on the basic elements of qualitative inquiry. Students received two lectures on qualitative methodology and methods and then participated in a set of practical-based activities that involved examining mental health themes and undertaking semi-structured interviews. The information gleaned from the students' interviews was collated and formed the basis of a formal submission to Scotland's National Mental Health Strategy 2011-2015. In this way the present approach encouraged students to consider the multiple levels of analysis that can be employed when researching mental health issues, fostered active citizenship through their participation in a democratic process, and drew a clear connection between psychological research and mental health policy.

AB  - Tuebingen's "Sectio Chirurgica" (TSC) is an innovative, interactive, multimedia, and transdisciplinary teaching method designed to complement dissection courses. The Tuebingen's "Sectio Chirurgica" (TSC) allows clinical anatomy to be taught via interactive live stream surgeries moderated by an anatomist. This method aims to provide an application-oriented approach to teaching anatomy that offers students a deeper learning experience. A cohort study was devised to determine whether students who participated in the TSC were better able to solve clinical application questions than students who did not participate. A total of 365 students participated in the dissection course during the winter term of the 2012/2013 academic year. The final examination contained 40 standard multiple-choice (S-MC) and 20 clinically-applied multiple-choice (CA-MC) items. The CA-MC items referred to clinical cases but could be answered solely using anatomical knowledge. Students who regularly participated in the TSC answered the CA-MC questions significantly better than the control group (75% and 65%, respectively; P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). The groups exhibited no differences on the S-MC questions (85% and 82.5%, respectively; P > 0.05). The CA-MC questions had a slightly higher level of difficulty than the S-MC questions (0.725 and 0.801, respectively; P = 0.083). The discriminatory power of the items was comparable (S-MC median Pearson correlations: 0.321; CA-MC: 0.283). The TSC successfully teaches the clinical application of anatomical knowledge. Students who attended the TSC in addition to the dissection course were able to answer CA-MC questions significantly better than students who did not attend the TSC. Thus, attending the TSC in addition to the dissection course supported students' clinical learning goals.

AB  - This research paper explores art integration into a science lesson unit that follows the Next Generation Science Standards (K-PS2-1) and focuses on the effects on memory retention of key concepts along with levels of enjoyment. An experiment was conducted with children ages 3 and 4 teaching scientific concepts about gears while incorporating student-made art products. The children were assigned to alternating experimental (artintegrated) or control (no art) conditions during the four stages of the lesson. The results did not show statistically significant differences at the alpha = 0.05 level between conditions in the amount of information retained based on the pretest, posttest, and distal posttest. However, there were overall knowledge gains for both conditions demonstrated by the gain scores. It appeared that incorporating arts into the curriculum can be beneficial for children, including those of diverse cultural backgrounds, as it provides a more enjoyable learning environment. Arts integration can also facilitate the construction of children's schema of gears which later may ease the learning of more complex concepts related to motion, stability, forces, and interaction.

AB  - "Computing in the Humanities," an undergraduate course for Computer Science Department majors and minors and Web Programming minors at New York University, represents a unique collaboration between the Computer Science Department and the University Archives. The course's final assignment required students to select, digitize, and contextualize materials from the Archives' collections in an interactive Web site. The design and implementation of the course incorporates four current and important trends in both disciplines. First, the professor and archivist worked closely together before and during the course, which served to integrate the archival research component into the core mission of the course. Second, the students' projects provided increased subject access and dynamic Web content to the repository and meaningful work to the students. Third, this course produced students who "bridge" the needs of humanists with the capabilities of technology. Fourth, this course illustrated the growing importance of Web programming and project-based courses in undergraduate computer science education. (Contains 3 footnotes and 28 notes.)

AB  - The interdisciplinary unit described in this article utilizes "Art and the Cosmic Connection," a free program conceived of by artists Monica and Tyler Aiello and developed by the artists, scientists, and educators through NASA's Discovery and New Frontiers Programs, to inspire learners to explore mysterious worlds in our solar system and uncover their geologic stories. Students become visual investigators as they study and interpret the unique surfaces of our rocky celestial neighbors: comets, asteroids, moons, and planets. They develop context for understanding their own planet Earth in the process. Originally developed for general audiences, "Art and the Cosmic Connection" has been pilot-tested in elementary grades 3-5, with art, science, and language arts teachers. The activity uses inexpensive materials available in any craft or art store. Students have engaged in the full activity in as little as 90 minutes; it also offers a wonderful opportunity to support concept development across disciplines in a more prolonged unit. In this article, the authors share their experiences in grades 3-5 with special focus on an interdisciplinary unit fourth graders explored.

AB  - Korea has recently started to implement a STEM-like approach in K-12 education, titled STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) curriculum, to educate the next generation of students to become creative innovators. As this approach has been shown to increase educational success, it is vital to prepare and develop interest in middle school students to participate in STEAM subjects-related learning opportunities. This study examined the impact of hands-on global climate change monitoring projects whose curriculum was designed based on the six structured inventive thinking (SSIT) approach that can facilitate the development of the knowledge of STEAM content and investigate the perceptions of STEAM subjects by middle school students. The participants in the study were sixty-eight grade 7 students from a middle school in Seoul, Korea. Employing a quasi-experimental research design, the participants were measured on their STEAM knowledge and perceptions before and after participation. The findings indicate that students who participated in global climate change monitoring activities reported gains in their STEAM content knowledge and showed an improvement in their perceptions of STEAM subjects. The latter finding was more pronounced for female students who had significantly higher science achievement and positive perceptions of the STEAM program than for male students. The results of this study suggest that carefully designed projects comprised of SSIT-based environmental activities can be effective in STEAM education at the middle school level.

AB  - A molecule of the month extra credit assignment was introduced to a didactic introductory pharmacology and medicinal chemistry course for first-year pharmacy students. The structure of a clinically approved drug molecule was presented to students each month of the course after the first month. Students would answer questions pertaining to the name of the drug, its mechanism of action, specific aspects of its chemistry, and the indication(s) it is used in. Mean and median course scores were compared between classes of students who undertook molecule of the month questions and classes that did not. Extra credit earned from molecule of the month questions could not be applied to failing scores. Students overwhelmingly participated (85-96%) in answering molecule of the month questions. Students who had the molecule of the month questions available performed significantly better than those that did not. The number of students receiving a final course score >91% increased more than 3-fold, and no students attained a failing score (<70%).

AB  - Young children love stories, and teachers love to read stories. Young children also love to explore the motion of objects--they watch tossed balls, observe objects rolling down ramps, and are mesmerized by spinning tops. Yet it can be challenging to integrate these two loves, stories and exploring motion, in one lesson. Furthermore, while children are fascinated with motion, describing motion and change in position as a result of motion involves using challenging scientific practices. In this article, the authors describe a learning experience that follows an alternate approach to integrating science and literacy. The learning experience was designed for kindergarten through second-grade students participating in an enrichment program conducted by teacher education students. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - This paper discusses a K-12/university collaboration in which students participated in a four-day scenario-based summer STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) camp aimed at making difficult scientific concepts salient. This scenario, Jumpstart STEM-CSI: Chocolate Science Investigation (JSCSI), used open- and guided-inquiry methods to generate meaningful student engagement for 33 rising 8th through 12th graders. This paper presents curriculum for the scenario; reports results from postevent survey data regarding students' self-reported gains in science motivation, science confidence, science knowledge, and students' associations with scientifically-minded social niches; and illustrates how a scenario can incorporate the use of skills and knowledge from many disciplines and make them relevant to student learning, providing a context for STEM literacy. Implications for science educators are discussed.

AB  - This paper discusses experiences and lessons learned from developing an interdisciplinary graduate program (IDP) during the last 10 y: The Howard University Graduate Program in Atmospheric Sciences (HUPAS). HUPAS is the first advanced degree program in the atmospheric sciences, or related fields such as meteorology and earth system sciences, instituted at a historically black college or university or minority-serving institution (MSI). The PhD program in atmospheric sciences was implemented in 1996 as a direct result of synergies between overlapping interests in initiating interdisciplinary programs within the Howard University Graduate School, and within a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-funded university research center to produce greater institutional depth and breadth of research in the geosciences. The development of HUPAS has revitalized a significant segment of the Howard University research community, leveraged a significant level of funding for research and training, raised the visibility of the university in a vibrant area of research, and made a great impact on the national statistics for the production of underrepresented minority (URM) advanced degree holders in the atmospheric sciences. Though the HUPAS program is still in its infancy with respect to many well-established programs in atmospheric sciences and meteorology, it has benefited from a number of federal, state, and academic partnerships, which have led to increasing capacity development, improved resources for students, and research infrastructure enhancements. Specific examples of successful partnerships among HUPAS and federal funding agencies such as NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been critical cornerstones in the development process. The student recruitment and retention strategies that have enabled the success of this program and statistics of student graduation during the last decade are discussed. Entering its tenth year, HUPAS has apparently overcome many of the pitfalls that plague the development of IDPs that draw their faculty from existing, traditional departments. It is hoped that the approaches and lessons learned and discussed in this paper may be illuminating and useful for others to emulate in the development of a similar IDP programs in atmospheric and other earth and environmental sciences, especially at MSIs and at institutions with small- to medium-sized graduate enrollments.

AB  - The ability to read and compose original scientific literature is critical to educating informed citizens, yet may be severely lacking in undergraduate curricula. We developed a linked course offering in fall 2017 consisting of a 16-student group taking an introductory biology course paired with a first-year composition course. The composition course focused specifically on scientific literature composed in the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion (IMRaD) structure. In the composition course, instruction focused on helping students conceptualize and compose proposals, poster presentations, and manuscripts based on their lab activities. We surveyed for prior experience with scientific literature and self-reported reading and writing confidence. Participants in the linked courses showed an improvement in self-reported ability and confidence in writing compared to a control group that did not participate. We assembled a rubric assessing correct IMRaD structure and used it to assess composition before and after the linked courses. Adherence to IMRaD improved significantly for the Methods section. Our experiences indicate that learning communities can be useful pedagogies to provide students with confidence and learning gains that facilitate use of information and communication.

AB  - With the increasing challenges facing professional engineers working in more complex, global and interdisciplinary contexts, different approaches to understanding how engineers practice and learn are necessary. This paper draws on recent research in the social sciences from the field of workplace learning, to suggest that a practice-theory perspective on engineers' professional learning is fruitful. It shifts the focus from the attributes of the individual learner (knowledge, skills and attitudes) to the attributes of the practice (interactions, materiality, opportunities and challenges). Learning is thus more than the technical "acquisition" and "transfer" of knowledge, but a complex bundle of activities, that is, social, material, embodied and emerging. The paper is illustrated with examples from a research study of the learning of experienced engineers in the construction industry to demonstrate common practices--site walks and design review meetings--in which learning takes place.

AB  - It has become widely accepted that the computer is an indispensable tool in the study of science and technology. Thus, in recent years curricular programs such as Industrial Technology and associated scientific disciplines have been adopting and adapting the computer as a tool in new and innovative ways to support teaching, learning, and research. Industrial Technology is a management-oriented technical curriculum built upon studies from a variety of disciplines related to manufacturing technology. Included are a sound knowledge and understanding of material and production processes; principles of distribution; and concepts of industrial management and human relations. The importance of readily available technology and supporting software, which has flexibility in design and usage, has become an integral component of technology curriculums. The flexibility of these computer systems and their peripherals provides opportunities for interdisciplinary studies that extend well beyond the traditional technology curriculum into broader areas of science and mathematics. The facilities and curriculum described in this article support the ongoing collaborative work of students and faculty from the disciplines of computer science, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and industrial technology.

AB  - Climate change is one of the most challenging problems facing today's global society (e.g., IPCC 2013). While climate change is a widely covered topic in the media, and abundant information is made available through the internet, the causes and consequences of climate change in its full complexity are difficult for individuals, especially non-scientists, to grasp. Science education is a field which can play a crucial role in fostering meaningful education of students to become climate literate citizens (e.g., NOAA 2009; Schreiner et al., 41, 3-50, 2005). If students are, at some point, to participate in societal discussions about the sustainable development of our planet, their learning with respect to such issues needs to be supported. This includes the ability to think critically, to cope with complex scientific evidence, which is often subject to ongoing inquiry, and to reach informed decisions on the basis of factual information as well as values-based considerations. The study presented in this paper focused on efforts to advance students in (1) their conceptual understanding about climate change and (2) their socioscientific reasoning and decision making regarding socioscientific issues in general. Although there is evidence that "knowledge" does not guarantee pro-environmental behavior (e.g. Schreiner et al., 41, 3-50, 2005; Skamp et al., 97(2), 191-217, 2013), conceptual, interdisciplinary understanding of climate change is an important prerequisite to change individuals' attitudes towards climate change and thus to eventually foster climate literate citizens (e.g., Clark et al. 2013). In order to foster conceptual understanding and socioscientific reasoning, a computer-based learning environment with an embedded concept mapping tool was utilized to support senior high school students' learning about climate change and possible solution strategies. The evaluation of the effect of different concept mapping scaffolds focused on the quality of student-generated concept maps, as well as on students' test performance with respect to conceptual knowledge as well as socioscientific reasoning and socioscientific decision making.

AB  - English is the medium of instruction in all Science and Engineering undergraduate programmes at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Therefore, students who do not meet minimum proficiency requirements are placed in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses to help them improve. Other generic, domain-specific and workplace communication courses are also offered as core courses or electives so that most students take at least one such course before they graduate. The strong focus on communication skills training for NUS students is aimed at equipping them with academic writing and speaking skills, in general, and workplace interaction skills. This paper, however, discusses the "embedding" of communication skills training within the content curricula of two modules in electrical engineering and one module in a special science programme in NUS as a pedagogical strategy to 'enculturate' [Prior, P. 1998. "Writing/Disciplinarity: A Sociohistoric Account of Literate Activity in the Academy." Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates] students into the academic and professional discourse communities of their disciplines. These three implementations are unique, firstly, because they 'include' all students in the cohort in the training, regardless of whether they have taken EAP or other communication courses [Wingate, U., and C. Tribble. 2011. "The Best of Both Worlds? Towards an English for Academic Purposes/Academic Literacies Writing Pedagogy." "Studies in Higher Education" 1-15. iFirst Article]. Secondly, content and communication lecturers collaborate closely with one another and with students to co-construct the latter's deeper engagement in their disciplines.

AB  - The study examined the relevance of entrepreneurial education to the practice of estate surveying by the graduates of Estate Management in becoming self-made entrepreneurs in their chosen field. Real estate is a multi-disciplinary field that comprises all areas of construction, design and management, such as property management consultancy, valuation services, agency administration, and real property development services. The study reviewed related literatures, such as real estate management, investment, entrepreneurship education in real estate business. The study used questionnaire, oral and telephone interview to collect samples, and the study population was centered on graduates of estate management practicing in various firms in Abuja. Some of the specific issues addressed include but not limited to current place of employment, level of satisfaction of the young graduates, willingness to go into full time practice by starting up their own estate firms. The study revealed that 94.2% of the respondents were strongly willing to start up their own private firm, while the remaining people had different sheds of opinions. Therefore, it was recommended among other things that government and good spirited individuals make a startup capital available for graduates of estate management who are willing to become real estate entrepreneurs. In addition, further training on business ideas will assist them in no small measure in actualizing their dreams of becoming employers of labour thereby contributing to the growth of the nation.

AB  - We review and interpret two propositions published by Ellerman [2014. On double-entry bookkeeping: the mathematical treatment. "Accounting Education," 23(5), 483-501] in this journal. The paper builds on this contribution with the view of reconciling the two, apparently dichotomous, perspectives of accounting measurement: the stock and the flow approaches to income. It claims that T-accounts have an underlying algebraic structure suitable for approaching measurement from either or both perspectives. Accountants' preferences for stocks or flows can be framed in ways which are mutually consistent. This is a first step in addressing this consistency issue. We avoid the difficult mathematics of abstract algebra by applying the concept of syntax to accounting numbers such that the accounting procedure qualifies as a formal language to convey meaning. We are addressing those educators responsible for designing accounting degree programmes, for whom grasping the issue of syntax is important when offering cross-disciplinary options to accounting students with interest in, or need for, engaging with information science.

AB  - China entered the baby boom era with the announcement of Second Child Policy in 2015, this has led to increase of child birth rate and subsequently a growing shortage of preschool teachers. To solve this issue, Chinese State Council drafted the policy proposal on training of cross-disciplinary talents in higher education allowing people with different bachelor degree to become preschool teachers. Cross-Disciplinary Preschool Education Master Degree (CDPEM) program offered in some universities is an outcome of this policy. The purpose of this study is to explore in depth professional growth experiences of these CDPEM students. Findings of the study can be input to decision of the continuity of this policy. The study was conducted using qualitative research method. In-depth interviews of three Chinese CDPEM participants were used to collect data. These three CDPEM participants respectively have Chinese Literature, English Education and Applied Chemistry background. Findings is discussed according to the characteristics of professional growth, personalities and experiences, and strategies to overcome problem faced during the Master course. The results of professional growth experiences are summarized into four themes: professional attitude and motivation, professional ability, professional knowledge and professional philosophy. Data analysis indicated that these three CDPEM students have strong desire of professional development, and consistently striving for professional identity, however they have low self-efficacy, perceived weak professional knowledge, perceived lack of professional ability and poor research ability. The background knowledge from Bachelor degree, real-life experience, inherent motivation and attitude towards learning influence their professional development in the course. These students develop their own authentic internal strategies towards ascertaining professional identity. The external strategies are cultivation of research ability and internship as well as participation in universities joint projects. The policy of CDPEM is feasible as a short-term measure to counter shortage of preschool teachers however the shortcomings need to be overcome to ensure quality of preschool teachers produced through CDPEM program.

AB  - Evaluations that combine social science and law have tremendous potential to illuminate the effects of governmental policies and yield insights into how effectively policy makers' efforts achieve their aims. This potential is infrequently achieved, however, because such interdisciplinary research contains often overlooked substantive and methodological challenges. This article offers detailed guidance for conducting successful multidisciplinary evaluations that use legal data. It addresses major issues that commonly arise and offers practical solutions based both on the authors' extensive experience and recommended best practices developed in concert with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Public Health Law Research Program.

AB  - Here we examine the role art activities play in aesthetic experience and learning of science. We compare recordings of two sequential occurrences in an elementary school class. The purpose of the first sequence was scientific and involved the children in observing leaves with magnifiers. The second sequence had an artistic purpose, where the children made pictures of leaves by rubbing them with crayons. The material was analyzed by means of practical epistemology analysis, Dewey's philosophy of aesthetics and socio-cultural approaches using the concept of mediation. The results show that what was mediated in the two sequences differed; the mediating artefacts used thereby having an effect on learning. The children also learned how to take part in the activities aesthetically. What the results mean for the use of artistic activities in science education is discussed.

AB  - In the arts-informed teaching and learning spaces, knowledge is potentially produced and shared based on resonance that can involve a whole person. Concerned with educational processes enveloped in relational aesthetics, the authors designed a workshop to reconnect with green awareness, based as much as possible on the methodology that is located in the body and enveloped in art activism. The workshop developed for the U.S. Academy of Management meeting in Chicago last summer illustrates the authors' teaching practice within a paradigm of green art activism. The workshop focused on an encounter in the city: a conceptual intervention, in a form of walking art/installation. This article posits interdisciplinary approach to pedagogy in social sciences, incorporating green awareness, in addition to combining art-teaching methods with dialogical and emotive ethics.

AB  - Drawing from their respective work at the intersection of music and science, the coauthors argue that engaging in processes of making music can help students more deeply engage in the kinds of creativity associated with inquiry based science education (IBSE) and scientists better convey their ideas to others. Of equal importance, the processes of music making can provide students a means to experience another central aspect of IBSE, the liminal ontological experience of being utterly lost in the inquiry process. This piece is also part of burgeoning studies documenting the use of the arts in STEM education (STEAM).

AB  - In recent years, nanoscience and nanotechnology have been drawing enormous attention due to the numerous applications of nanomaterials. In an attempt to nurture interest towards these areas in young minds and to develop the next generation of environmentally conscious scientists and engineers, this new laboratory module focuses on the green and nongreen aspects of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) synthesis. The element of novelty is represented by the guided, inquiry-based exploration of alternative, green fabrication methods using environmentally friendly reducing agents (e.g., tea extracts, coffee, honey, coconut oil, and banana peel). The inquiry-based learning was developed according to the five essential features laid by the National Research Council (NRC), and was successfully implemented after science and engineering students gained theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience with conventional, nongreen fabrication methods of colloidal silver and gold NPs (i.e., the Lee-Meisel and Turkevich methods). The student assignments and evaluations demonstrated that this inquiry-based laboratory increased students' interest in green nanochemistry, provided them with new laboratory skills, and stimulated their critical thinking.

AB  - We utilized cross tabulation statistics, word frequency counts, and content analysis of research output to conduct a bibliometric study, and used CiteSpace software to depict a knowledge map for research on entrepreneurship education in China from 2004 to 2013. The study shows that, in this duration, the study of Chinese entrepreneurship education experienced a progression through three stages, an "exploratory stage of learning from foreign models," a "developmental stage geared toward employment problems," and a "transformative stage promoting cultivation of student abilities," and featured three primary characteristics, "multidisciplinary fusion," "imbalanced regional distribution," and "policy orientation." In the future, popular fields in the study of entrepreneurship education are to be concentrated in the three areas, namely "entrepreneurship education and talent cultivation," "entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial environments," and "entrepreneurship education and innovation education."

AB  - While a number of studies have investigated people's perceptions or conceptions of creativity, there is a lack of studies looking into science teachers' views. The study aimed to explore the meanings of scientific creativity in the classroom context as perceived by a selective group of upper primary (Grades 3-6; student ages 8-12) science teachers (n?=?16) in Taiwan. Using a self-report, open-ended questionnaire and follow-up interviews, the participants responded to questions as to (1) what quality, behaviours and abilities characterise a creative learner in their science classrooms, (2) what a science classroom should be like if it is to facilitate scientific creativity, and (3) whether and what particular elements of the inquiry approach are incorporated in such a classroom. The analyses revealed that the teachers captured the central features of creativity and proposed diverse ideas about how to foster creativity in school science, but seemed to overlook some aspects, such as convergent thinking, problem-finding, and linking the arts and science. These missing features are regarded as important for scientific creativity in contemporary research. The findings were discussed along with their implications for teacher education and future research.

AB  - Hands-on experiences are excellent tools for increasing retention of first year engineering students. They also encourage interdisciplinary collaboration, a critical skill for modern engineers. In this paper, we describe and evaluate a joint Chemical and Materials Engineering hands-on lab that explores cross-linking and glass transition in polymeric materials. We find that the experience provides an engaging introduction to polymers for Chemical and Materials engineers.

AB  - Science education trends promote student engagement in authentic knowledge in practice to tackle personally consequential problems. This study explored how partnering scientists and students on a social media platform supported students' development of disciplinary practice knowledge through practice-based learning with experts during two pilot enactments of a project-based curriculum focusing on the ecological impacts of climate change. Through the online platform, scientists provided feedback on students' infographics, visual argumentation artifacts that use data to communicate about climate change science. We conceptualize the infographics and professional data sets as boundary objects that supported authentic argumentation practices across classroom and professional contexts, but found that student generated data was not robust enough to cross these boundaries. Analysis of the structure and content of the scientists' feedback revealed that when critiquing argumentation, scientists initiated engagement in multiple scientific practices, supporting a holistic rather than discrete model of practice-based learning. While traditional classroom inquiry has emphasized student experimentation, we found that engagement with existing professional data sets provided students with a platform for developing expertise in systemic scientific practices during argument construction. We further found that many students increased the complexity and improved the visual presentation of their arguments after feedback.

AB  - This paper provides an example of an innovative solution to program development that addresses the diverse needs of teacher educators throughout various geographical locations in Florida, through a collaborative multi-university, multi-agency teacher training program funded by one collaborative grant. In this time of economic uncertainties, institutions of higher education must become creative and emphasize interdisciplinary collaborative efforts both internally and externally in order to develop cost-effective, innovative programs that embrace diversity. Innovation is driven out of need. My teaching experience, in the K-12 public school and in the university setting, fostered my awareness of the need for professional collaboration, and this awareness ignited my creativity. I will discuss how I identified the needs at my university and then utilized creativity and collaboration to network and obtain the grant, which then facilitated, developed, and taught in a new Masters of Education program in Arts and Academic Interdisciplinary Education. Program content and delivery were both planned around the diverse student population within the multi-university collaboration, with each university designing diverse programs to address the specific needs of their population but with the same concept of arts integration. Collaboration also occurred within each university: the College of Arts and Science and the College of Education. In addition, teachers were required to collaborate as coaches in their schools to train and support others in increasing arts integration in their schools.

AB  - Mathematics traditionally has been taught in a way that reifies the cultural belief that it is discrete in nature and, therefore, irrelevant to other content areas and the real world. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, inclusive of mathematics teacher educators, views this belief as unproductive to learning and has stressed the need for students to make connections between mathematical content areas, to other disciplines, and to the real world. Unfortunately, many teacher-preparation programs (TPPs) structurally are organized with overt divisions between content areas, which likely perpetuates the belief that mathematics is disconnected and irrelevant. Nonetheless, this project was motivated by the hope that at the individual classroom level within such TPPs, non-mathematics teacher educators (TEs) were integrating mathematical practices and, thus, assisting in changing this unproductive belief. An analysis was completed of a three-part, data-collection process of (a) 180 pre-service teachers' assignments requiring that they align activities from non-mathematics education courses with mathematical practices; (b) 16 TEs' questionnaire data on how they use mathematical practices in their instruction; and (c) 11 full-class, video-taped observations of TEs teaching. Findings revealed that TEs do implement mathematical practices but do not claim always that this is what they are doing.

AB  - The use of Content and Language Integrated Learning has been increasing in many European countries simultaneous to the use of English as a medium of instruction in the non-Anglophone countries due to globalization and internationalization. Since the 1979 revolution, discussion on English as a medium of instruction in the Iranian formal education has been a taboo. This study aims to figure out the possibilities of introducing English as a partial medium of instruction (EPMI) for mathematics and science at senior high schools. The convergent mixed methods design was used to collect perspectives of students, content area teachers, parents, and administrative staff in Bojnord through e-mail interviews and survey questionnaires. The majority of the interviewees in the qualitative phase as well as most of the students, parents, teachers, and administrative staff in the quantitative phase have supported the possible use of EPMI. The findings of this study suggest future considerations to assist language education authorities in taking decisions to overcome students' language proficiency constraints while developing efficient and effective programs for CLIL.

AB  - While storytelling pedagogy presents novel perspectives and affordances to educators, a fundamental question that bears attention is the match between storytelling pedagogy and the nature of knowledge. Quite simply, the problem may be posed thus: is storytelling the optimum means for teaching all forms of knowledge? While rather obvious matches occur for knowledge in the social science, humanities, languages and literacy education, would storytelling pedagogy "work" for the natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics classrooms? If so, what may be optimum means to integrate storytelling instruction in these latter kinds of classrooms? In this study, we report on the results of an implementation of digital storytelling in a grade five science classroom. Using what we termed the "edu-tainment" approach, we asked students to design a digital story that communicated a scientific concept embedded within the narrative structure--characters within the narrative would experience the effects of the concept, the quality of the story being proxy indicators of students' understanding of the scientific concept. We propose that this pedagogical strategy presents a strong challenge to discern students' understanding, and we also discuss the effect of knowledge forms on the success of this pedagogy.

AB  - Authentic leadership has attracted recent empirical research from a wide range of social science disciplines interested largely in its relationship to human resource management and organisational effectiveness. In contrast, the focus of this study is specifically on the philosophical foundations of authentic leadership and their implications for leadership practice and continuing professional development. It emphasises the contribution of virtue ethics by identifying key moral and intellectual virtues associated with authenticity and how they can provide an ethical framework for action guidance in the school leadership context. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research based on more interdisciplinary and international comparative studies, especially in non-Western societies and cultural contexts, both to deepen and broaden our understanding of authentic-ethical leadership and its impact.

AB  - Objectives: The humanities, including narrative arts, are a valuable tool to foster reflection for professionally competent clinical practice. Integrating such study into traditional medical school curricula can prove challenging. A preclinical elective on opera and medicine was developed and piloted at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University for pre-medical and medical students to foster reflective capacity supporting professional identity formation. Methods: Interdisciplinary faculty from the departments of arts and sciences conducted nine facilitated discussion sessions. A field trip to the Metropolitan Opera, NY complemented students' operatic studies. Students were asked reflection-inviting questions concerning their emotional response to operatic scenes, characters, and physician-patient interactions throughout the course and given opportunities to discuss how opera reflects and reinforces stereotypes and societal stigma of patients, diseases, and physicians. A final reflective paper prompted analysis of more and less successful patient-provider interactions, exploring how students felt about these relationships, and drawing conclusions about how they would like to ideally act in the future. Formative feedback was provided using a reflection rubric. Results: Course evaluations demonstrated that sessions were well received. Students' qualitative comments described the influence of the course on the development of their professional identities, as well as the potential impact on their future careers as physicians. Lessons learned and future directions are suggested. Conclusions: This novel curriculum can serve as a model for using opera to enhance reflection and foster professional identity formation at other health profession and liberal arts institutions.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine undergraduate students' satisfaction levels through learning with peers. Specifically, students from two departments were brought into a collective group activity to understand whether they experienced different levels of satisfaction by working with peers from a different department. Data gathered from a sample of 47 Science Education (SE) and 72 Computer Education and Instructional Technology (CEIT) students during the fall 2011 semester. Students overall were highly satisfied. Students of the two departments did not significantly differ from each other in terms of satisfaction. That means they equally enjoyed the activity. There were six themes that were identified that cause satisfaction in this interprofessional work: Performing responsibilities, socialization, cohesion, work habits, learning in general, and professional development. The most prominent theme was cohesion, and it emerged out of mostly positive but also negative student opinions. The least prominent was professional development and it was mainly expressed as a positive theme. It is argued that students do not articulate the scope of the study as much as they can. It is also argued that the nature of the assigned task let them consider the social aspects more than the other aspects.

AB  - Biogeochemical cycles support all anthropogenic activities and are affected by them, therefore they are intricately interlinked with global environmental and socioeconomic issues. Elements of these cycles that are already included in the science/chemical curriculum and textbooks intended for formal education in Greek secondary schools were thoroughly reviewed and on the basis of the gaps and needs identified new didactic materials were produced. The didactic materials were designed in order to enhance the comprehension of the biogeochemical cycles (of water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur) and include educational content and guidance to achieve ESD goals including strengthening of students' environmentally-friendly attitudes and commitment towards sustainability. These materials clarify the function of the cycles supplementing chemical knowledge and scientific information relevant to the real world phenomena and conditions (e.g. climate change, ocean acidification, eutrophication) that learners could experience, connecting them with sustainable development issues (sustainable consumption and production, renewable energies, etc.). The materials were assessed as successful by educators and students through experimental implementation in 16 Greek secondary schools. The present article (Part I of the research) focuses on the aim, content and design of the didactic materials while in Part II, assessment of their impact on the knowledge and attitudes of students is presented.

AB  - Purpose: This paper will examine the extent to which Economics education within the integrated Austrian subject of Geography and Economics delivered by teachers outside their own subject area differs from teaching delivered by those with a formal qualification in the subject. Design: Hypothesis testing was carried out using variance analyses, factor analyses and X[superscript 2] independence tests; qualitative content analysis was used to evaluate responses to the open questions of a questionnaire (Mayring 2000, Kuckartz 2012). Findings: The results show significant differences between the two teacher groups with regard to the popularity of Economics education, attitudes towards economics generally, and professional self-image. Limitations and implications: For resource reasons, the study had to be limited to Vienna. A further broader investigation seems necessary. Practical implications: In order to support teachers working outside their own subject area, two project networks have been launched which develop teaching materials for Socioeconomics education.

AB  - Team projects are a way to expose students to conflicting project objectives, and "[t]here should be a strong real-world element … to ensure that the experience is realistic" [ACM/IEEE-CS 2015b]. Team projects provide students an opportunity to put their education into practice and prepare them for their professional careers. The aim of this special issue is to collect and share evidence about the state-of-practice of team projects in computing education and to help educators in designing and running team projects. From a record number of 69 submitted abstracts, 19 were invited to submit a full paper. Finally, nine papers were accepted for publication in this and a subsequent issue. The articles presented in the present issue cover the following topics: real projects for real clients, open source projects, multidisciplinary team projects, student and team assessment, and cognitive and psychological aspects of team projects.

AB  - Researchers, administrators, and policy makers need valid and reliable information about teaching practices. The Postsecondary Instructional Practices Survey (PIPS) is designed to measure the instructional practices of postsecondary instructors from any discipline. The PIPS has 24 instructional practice statements and nine demographic questions. Users calculate PIPS scores by an intuitive proportion-based scoring convention. Factor analyses from 72 departments at four institutions (N = 891) support a 2- or 5-factor solution for the PIPS; both models include all 24 instructional practice items and have good model fit statistics. Factors in the 2-factor model include (a) instructor-centered practices, nine items; and (b) student-centered practices, 13 items. Factors in the 5-factor model include (a) student--student interactions, six items; (b) content delivery, four items; (c) formative assessment, five items; (d) student-content engagement, five items; and (e) summative assessment, four items. In this article, we describe our development and validation processes, provide scoring conventions and outputs for results, and describe wider applications of the instrument.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to persuade legal studies teachers of the benefits of using works from other disciplines to illustrate the rationales for law, the greater context in which the legal order operates, and the relationship between law and society. The tangential benefits of using works from other disciplines are the enhancement of the joy of teaching, improvement of the attention and imagination of students, and the broadening of the minds of students who may lack a broad exposure to the humanities. Some maintain that instruction in the humanities is a critical tool in shaping democratic citizens. Materials from the humanities and social sciences or "Extra-Legal Sources" (ELS) engage students in different ways and are well suited to teaching students possessing a range of individual learning styles. The value of an interdisciplinary approach to teaching legal studies is that it provides another means to enhance student understanding. Part I provides an introduction to the use of ELS in the curriculum to teach legal studies. It provides a brief overview of the literature dealing with ELS. It discusses the nature of the interdisciplinary approach to legal studies teaching, prior literature, and how the current recommendations build upon the work of prior legal education scholars. Part II addresses how ELS can broaden critical thinking skills, and engage students on both an emotional and a cognitive level. Part III focuses on four sources that provide a rich, interdisciplinary context for discussing legal principles including works relating to the trial of Adolph Eichmann, a penetrating film on the corruption of law, "Hitler's Courts: Betrayal of the Rule of Law in Nazi Germany," a classic adventure story, "Lord of the Flies," and the book "The Help," by Kathryn Stockett. Part IV provides classroom examples of how specific assignments drawing from these sources can enrich a business school or law school curriculum. (Contains 105 footnotes.)

AB  - The use of integrated science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instruction has the affordances of combining harmonious content area connections into real-world experiences that are both engaging and challenging. This article introduces findings from a study that used an integrated robotics module to expose in-service and preservice teachers to the engineering design process, programming, mathematical connections and context, and problem-based learning. With participants ranging from novice to advanced user, this integrated module proved that given the appropriate scaffolding, anyone can successfully program a robot and have fun while engaging in STEM learning along the way. Implications lead to the conclusion that teacher preparation programs should integrate activities such as this to better equip teachers to engage students in the wonders of STEM in their own classrooms.

AB  - The current study examined the relations among key variables that underlie reading comprehension of expository science texts in a diverse population of adult native English readers. Using Mechanical Turk to sample a range of adult readers, the study also examined the effect of text presentation on readers' comprehension and knowledge structure established after reading. In Study 1, ratings of situational interest, select reading background variables, and select measures of readers' knowledge structure accounted for significant variance in comprehension. In Study 2, the knowledge structure metrics of primacy, recency, and node degree as well as several text ratings were found to be comparable across text presentation formats. Participants who read the text sentence-by-sentence obtained higher scores on measures of comprehension and provided higher ratings of situational interest than those who received the whole paragraph text at once. Knowledge structure measures for the sentence-by-sentence and paragraph formats were similar (68% overlap). We discuss implications for future research examining factors that underlie the successful comprehension of science texts.

AB  - Multidisciplinary cooperation in health care requires a solid knowledge in the basic sciences for a common ground of communication. In speech pathology, these fundamentals improve the accuracy of descriptive diagnoses and support the development of new therapeutic techniques and strategies. The aim of this study is to briefly discuss the benefits of hands-on education on laryngeal anatomy and voice physiology in Brazilian graduate programs in speech pathology, as well as to describe a simple prototype that can be used as a useful educational tool for this purpose. The laryngeal anatomic support device was designed to provide a vertical frame to hold human or mammalian larynges with no preservation treatment, with the goal of allowing good visualization of the vocal folds during artificial phonation. The device was designed to provide the user the ability to manipulate the soft and cartilaginous structures of the larynx with near-natural biomechanical properties. The description of the project is detailed to allow the reproduction of this simple and inexpensive device. It may be used as an experimental feature in a variety of settings, from high-school programs to experimental research methods, and may suit a wide array of different educational models.

AB  - Sustainability education competes for curricular space, both in schools and in teacher education. Opportunities and barriers for the inclusion of sustainability education in an Australian university primary teacher education program are examined in this article. The study focused on the roles, practices and perceptions of teacher educators in promoting sustainability education. Three focus groups were conducted with members of faculty staff from each of the K-6 Key Learning Areas to gather data, which were analysed according to three frameworks: espoused/aspirational and actual practices of staff members; barriers to and affordances for teaching sustainability education; and the nature of initiatives, in terms of teaching/learning activities, assessment tasks, and resources. Beyond the Social Sciences, and Science and Technology, we found that inclusion of sustainability education is somewhat sporadic. The article proposes some ways forward to promote and abet sustainability education in a tertiary context.

AB  - This investigation examines English as foreign language college interdisciplinary and intercultural differences in learning strategy use and their implications for language processing. Positivism underpins this research at the levels of ontology (standardized variables), epistemology (detachment from the subjects) and methodology, using nomothetic research strategy (survey), instruments (questionnaires) and data analysis techniques (multivariate analysis of variance and analysis of variance). Main findings show interdisciplinary differences between the Humanities and Science majors in student use of compensation strategies in favour of the Science major while finding no intermajor differences in student use of other strategies. The findings indicate no ethnic differences in learning strategy use, since European, American and Eastern ethnicities almost use typical strategies. Therefore, disagreements on alleged unmediated deterministic relationships between ethnicity and cognitive processing remain in place. Instead, curriculum and instructional designs, strategy training and individual differences rather than cultural stereotypes influence language processing. For curriculum and instructional designs to facilitate language processing and pedagogy, effective strategies should underlie national, classroom-level and school-level curriculum developments.

AB  - "The Chemistry of Perfume" is a lab-only course for nonscience majors. Students learn fundamental concepts of chemistry through the context of fragrance, a pervasive aspect of daily life. The course consists of laboratories pertaining to five units: introduction, extraction, synthesis, characterization, and application. The introduction unit acquaints students with basic perfume terminology and the idea that chemical structure relates to scent. The extraction unit focuses on capturing and isolating fragrant essences from natural materials, whereas the synthetic unit considers mimicking such scents through chemical reactions. In the characterization unit, students analyze the components of perfume and fragrant materials. The course ends with the application unit in which students incorporate their fragrances into consumer products and toiletries. Curriculum structure, content, and student feedback are described. This perfume lab course results from an effort to increase interest in chemistry among nonscience students and encourage interdisciplinary learning. (Contains 2 tables and 6 figures.)

AB  - Businesses are increasingly facing economic, social, and environmental sustainability challenges. Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) are needed to address business sustainability needs, yet such competencies are noticeably absent from academic literature and business curricula. To mend the curricular gap, we make the case for developing cross-disciplinary STEM-based business sustainability curricula that enhance students' sustainability literacy and cognitive abilities related to STEM and sustainability. A literature review is provided that documents curricular gaps specific to STEM and sustainability in the academic literature and in business sustainability program offerings. We then present a framework that can be used to integrate STEM and sustainability across the curricula and to evaluate curricular implementation. This review provides timely and relevant information that can help business management educators, instructors, and administrators justify, design, develop, implement, and evaluate STEM-based business sustainability curricula.

AB  - Through a collaborative effort between a sixth-grade teacher and two university faculty, we designed an integrated unit to learn about motion and we learned that an integrated teaching and learning experience about motion is MESSY (i.e., it includes movement, engagement, social interactions, spontaneity, yikes, and yippees!). We engaged in a twofold goal process of integrating mathematics, science, and technology. First, we embedded an inquiry approach in our planning and facilitation of learning experiences. Second, students coconstructed their understandings of motion through collective inquiry. School and university faculty, as well as students, learned about inquiry, about using motion detectors to learn and teach about motion, and about how mutual respect and collaboration support productive STEM learning, teaching, and research.

AB  - This mixed methods study is one of the first to evaluate the effects of the incorporation of dramatic inquiry, dance, visual arts and physical education into preK-3 science, technology, engineering and mathematics units on student conceptual understanding of technology and engineering. The study used data collected from over 200 student surveys and focus group interviews with 14 teachers. The use of integrated STEAM units supported significant improvement in 4 to 8 year old students' understanding of engineering and technology. We report an average 55% increase in student understanding of what engineers do, and a 36% increase in their understanding of technology. The effect sizes for both assessments showed mostly large effects for all grade levels. The pre test scores across all grade levels were not significantly different. By implementing these integrated units with our younger students, we aimed to nurture their interest and understanding of engineering and technology across grade levels. This study results imply that students may not learn about these important topics outside of school hours; thus, it is important they become acquainted with these topics during school hours. Our work suggests that engineering units with dramatic inquiry should be introduced beginning in kindergarten.

AB  - After more than two decades of research on the design and development of implantable biomedical microsystems, it is time now to organize research achievements in this area in a consolidated and pedagogical form. This paper introduces a new graduate course in advanced biomedical circuits and systems. Designed for graduate students with electrical and biomedical engineering backgrounds, this course provides a general overview of the multidisciplinary field of implantable biomedical microsystems. In addition to some introductory material on physiology and biology where needed, this course comprises extensive contents and in-depth discussions on both system- and circuit-level aspects of the design of implantable microsystems. Moreover, this course also deals with issues surrounding design for implantability and testability. Wireless interfacing, signal processing, microelectrode array fabrication, and circuit design for implantable neural recording microsystems are studied extensively. Various design aspects of neural stimulation microsystems, cochlear implants, and visual prostheses are also reviewed briefly.

AB  - Given that few studies have formally examined pedagogical design considerations of Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs), this study explored variations in the pedagogical design of six MOOCs offered at the University of Toronto, while considering disciplinary characteristics and expectations of each MOOC. Using a framework (Neumann et al., 2002) characterizing teaching and learning across categories of disciplines, three of the MOOCs represented social sciences and humanities, or "soft" MOOCs, while another three represented sciences, or "hard" MOOCS. We utilized a multicase study design for understanding differences and similarities across MOOCs regarding learning outcomes, assessment methods, interaction design, and curricular content. MOOC instructor interviews, MOOC curricular documents, and discussion forum data comprised the data set. Learning outcomes of the six MOOCs reflected broad cognitive competencies promoted in each MOOC, with the structure of curricular content following disciplinary expectations. The instructors of soft MOOCs adopted a spiral curriculum and created new content in response to learner contributions. Assessment methods in each MOOC aligned well with stated learning outcomes. In soft MOOCs, discussion and exposure to diverse perspectives were promoted while in hard MOOCs there was more emphasis on question and answer. This study shows disciplinary-informed variations in MOOC pedagogy, and highlights instructors' strategies to foster disciplinary ways of knowing, skills, and practices within the parameters of a generic MOOC platform. Pedagogical approaches such as peer assessment bridged the disciplines. Suggestions for advancing research and practice related to MOOC pedagogy are also included.

AB  - A growing body of research, both nationally and internationally, indicates that children in the early childhood years (birth to age 8) learn primarily through their senses and from direct experience. They develop an understanding about the world through play, exploration, and creative activities as well as by watching and imitating adults and other children. "Growing Up WILD" (2010) is a large format book that promotes teacher efficacy with 27 developmentally appropriate activities, yet gives educators the flexibility to modify activities to meet the needs of children at different age levels and learning stages. The authors describe the contents of the resource as it presents a wide range of options for a variety of classroom strategies: small group, whole group, centers, pair and individual work, plus teachable moments that encourage child-initiated learning experiences. Activities allow opportunities for learning through play by integrating environmental science with literacy, math, and art. Social, emotional, physical, language, and cognitive domains are involved as students participate in hands-on experiences that are particularly effective in early childhood settings. Included in the article is a summary of activities that align with the NAAEE guidelines for teaching environmental education concepts, as well as the Early Childhood Environmental Education Programs: Guidelines for Excellence, and addresses the Head Start Outcomes.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of group collaborative argumentation on the quality of decision-making on waste incineration of socioscientific issues (SSI). To achieve this, fifty-nine high school students engaged with a lecture-style class that did not use any argumentation activities. They then completed an individual survey aimed at examining individual decision-making, as the pre-test. The participants then received a two-week pedagogical intervention of collaborative argumentation, after which they completed the same survey again, as the post-test. The results showed that, after the argumentation intervention, students made more statements that considered ethical issues and policies. In addition, students defended their positions with more in-depth analysis supported by sufficient and scientific evidence. These findings reveal that argumentation facilitates students' growth in interdisciplinary thinking and improves the quality of their decision-making on the SSI. Implication was group argumentation will be of great value to the more widespread implementation of the SSI curriculum.

AB  - In January 2011, a review about teacher education in Scotland included 50 recommendations designed to improve the learning of young people in Scotland. A feature of the recommendations was enhancement of teacher education via new national initiatives and strengthened partnerships between schools, local authorities and universities. The Scottish Baccalaureate is a new national initiative that could be used as a method for implementing recommendations made by Donaldson. The aim of this report is to describe a model of learning and teaching involving the Baccalaureate in Science that demonstrates how 14 Interdisciplinary Projects could be managed within a semi-rural secondary school and, through a "whole-school" approach, be used to enhance pupil learning and teacher education while encouraging partnerships between the school and outside agencies. While this model addresses recommendations made by Donaldson, it also embraces the essential elements of Curriculum for Excellence. (Contains 1 table, 6 figures, and 6 online resources.)

AB  - Novel carbon nanomaterials such as reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and graphene oxide (GO) can be easily incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum to discuss basic chemistry and nanotechnology concepts. This paper describes a laboratory experiment designed to study the differences between GO and rGO regarding their physicochemical properties (e.g., color, hydrophobicity, type of functional groups, electrical conductivity, etc.). In this course, students carry out the chemical reduction of GO using ascorbic acid, a mild and environmentally friendly reducing agent. The differences between GO and rGO can be spotted by the naked eye and can be further evaluated by spectroscopic methods, as Fourier transform infrared and UV-vis spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Simple and applicable in all laboratories, use of the multimeter to measure resistance was proposed to reveal the different electrical properties of GO and rGO. Moreover, the proposed laboratory experiment is an ideal pretext to discuss the definition of graphene in the context of the overuse of this term in the literature.

AB  - In the most general sense children's rights can be defined as benefits which are protected by legal rules so that the child can grow up in a healthy, normal way and in freedom and dignity with the aspects of physical, cognitive, sensual, social and moral. The most important document regulating children's rights is the "Convention on the Rights of the Child" accepted by United Nations. In order to teach their rights to children, all the lessons in school curriculum, for example in life sciences, social studies and Turkish classes, should include the subject of rights and responsibilities. The aim of this study is to reveal to what extent the subject of children's rights is included in primary school in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd grade life sciences textbooks which were published and delivered to schools to be taught during the academic year of 2011 to 2012 by the Ministry of National Education. In the study, qualitative research method was preferred and the texts in all themes of life sciences textbooks of 1st, 2nd and 3rd grade were studied with content analysis. In analysing data, frequencies and percent were used. In the study, it was found that terms related to children's rights were used in the 2nd grade life sciences textbooks at most in parallel with the lesson curriculum. It was suggested that in the gains of life sciences classes children's rights should be taken into consideration and the textbooks should be rearranged.

AB  - This study examined prospective middle grade mathematics teachers' knowledge of algebra for teaching with a focus on knowledge for teaching the concept of function. 115 prospective teachers from an interdisciplinary program for mathematics and science middle teacher preparation at a large public university in the USA participated in a survey. It was found that the participants had relatively limited knowledge of algebra for teaching. They also revealed weakness in selecting appropriate perspectives of the concept of function and flexibly using representations of quadratic functions. They made numerous mistakes in solving quadratic or irrational equations and in algebraic manipulation and reasoning. The participants' weakness in connecting algebraic and graphic representations resulted in their failure to solve quadratic inequalities and to judge the number of roots of quadratic functions. Follow-up interview further revealed the participants' lack of knowledge in solving problems by integrating algebraic and graphic representations. The implications of these findings for mathematics teacher preparation are discussed. (Contains 4 figures and 5 tables.)

AB  - The authors of the focus article describe an important issue related to the use and interpretation of causal indicators within the context of structural equation modeling (SEM). In the focus article, the authors illustrate with simulated data the effects of omitting a causal indicator. Since SEMs are used extensively in the social and behavioral sciences to define key constructs, it is important to examine the use of casual indicators within the context of structural equations with latent variables. One of the controversies in using SEMs is related to the use of various types of indicators for defining latent variables to represent constructs. There are several alternative measurement paradigms (Engelhard & Wang, 2014) including SEM and item response theory (IRT). The essence of the distinctions between the models can be viewed in terms of the theoretically implied directions of causality. Causal indicators represent the influence of observed variables on a latent variable, while effect indicators represent the latent variable as affecting observed indicators (Wang, Engelhard, & Lu, 2014). An IRT model can be viewed as an effect indicator measurement model from an SEM perspective with other special features, such as invariant measurement (Engelhard, 2013). There is vigorous debate among researchers regarding the appropriate use of causal indicators in a measurement model. Although some researchers support the use of causal indicators in a measurement model (Diamantopoulos & Winklhofer, 2001; Jarvis, MacKenzie, & Podsakoff, 2003), we are persuaded by other methodologists who have urged caution in using causal indicator models (Edwards, 2011; Hardin & Marcoulides, 2011; Howell, Breivik, & Wilcox, 2013). In our commentary, we briefly reflect on some of the major conclusions from the focus article.

AB  - It has been a busy time for the Association of Education Finance and Policy (AEFP). Over the past few years the association has acquired a new name, a new journal, and many new members. The 2012 annual conference, convened in Boston last March, proved to be the largest conference in the association's thirty-seven-year history, with 556 members in attendance. The Boston meeting was notable not only for the number in attendance. The unique qualities and strengths of the association were in clear display: papers of unusual methodological rigor; an interdisciplinary mix of academics from the social sciences, public policy schools, and colleges of education; educational finance professionals, policy analysts, and practitioners, a mix rarely found in the same place; and sessions addressing today's hot topics as well as issues that have endured over the years. This paper looks back to the origins of the association, the issues that caused it to come into being, and how it has developed over the past four decades. In doing so the author strives to identify what have been the enduring qualities of the association and what has been and remains unique in its contributions. (Contains 2 footnotes.)

AB  - Chia seeds will sprout on almost any moist surface, and they respond quickly to experimental variables. Furthermore, the newly recognized nutritional value and rich cultural history of chia seeds offer the possibility of highly motivating and educational interdisciplinary extensions, especially appropriate to students in the middle grades. Together with participating science teachers from six different schools, the author has developed a series of science inquiry activities using chia seeds and tested them with 500 New York students in grades 5 through 8. Her goals were to minimize expense while maximizing student engagement, and to create a mess-free environment where inquiry occurs spontaneously. (Contains 2 figures and 5 resources.)

AB  - The engineering profession continues to struggle to attract new talent, in part because it is not well understood by the general public and often viewed in a negative light. Therefore, engineering professionals have called for new approaches promote better understanding and change negative perceptions. One suggested approach is for engineering professors to create and teach courses for non-majors, perhaps as an option to fulfill general studies requirements. This paper describes one such course developed and offered at Elon University. The "Experience Engineering" course features hands-on, interdisciplinary team experiences that result in a tangible product: a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). Students are guided through the fundamental principles of physics, engineering, and electronics that govern the basic system components and operation. Teams are then challenged to integrate these basic components into a system design that is capable of achieving simulated real-world tasks within the confines of the materials provided, allotted budget, and available class time. In addition to discussing the course content in greater detail, this paper describes the assessment methods and outcomes from the first offering of the course. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - The goal of this practice guide is to offer educators specific, evidence-based recommendations that address the challenges of teaching students in grades 6-12 to write effectively. This guide synthesizes the best publicly available research and shares practices that are supported by evidence. It is intended to be practical and easy for teachers to use. The guide includes many examples in each recommendation to demonstrate the concepts discussed. Throughout the guide, examples, definitions, and other concepts supported by evidence are indicated by endnotes within the example title or content. For examples that are supported by studies that meet WWC design standards, the citation in the endnote is bolded. Examples without specific citations were developed in conjunction with the expert panel based on their experience, expertise, and knowledge of the related literature. This guide provides secondary teachers in all disciplines and administrators with instructional recommendations that can be implemented in conjunction with existing standards or curricula. Teachers can use the guide when planning instruction to support the development of writing skills among students in grades 6-12 in diverse contexts. The following are appended: (1) Postscript from the Institute of Education Sciences; (2) About the Authors; (3) Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest; and (4) Rationale for Evidence Ratings.

AB  - Analyzing a conference, especially one as young and focused as LAK, provides the opportunity to observe the structure and contributions of the scientific community around it. This work will perform a Scientometric analysis, coupled with a more in-depth manual content analysis, to extract this insight from the proceedings and program of LAK 2013. Authorship analysis reveals an open and international community, while internal citation analysis provides evidence of the construction of a body of knowledge central to Learning Analytics. The analysis of the content of the papers found five main topics: visualization, behaviour analysis, social learning analytics, learning analytics for MOOCs, and learning analytics issues (ethical, scalability, etc.), as well as papers reflecting on the field itself. We discuss representative papers presented at the conference, highlighting trends and new developments. Learning analytics is a diverse multidisciplinary field with an emerging interdisciplinary core, well situated to benefit from productive dialogue concerning its scope and purpose and to reflect on the pedagogies and epistemologies implied by its methods.

AB  - This article explores the usefulness of Maude's translation of Young's idea of powerful knowledge into geography education. Maude's classification of five types of powerful knowledge in geography education was used to analyse the written curriculum of the 'human and society' interdisciplinary domain in four schools in the Netherlands. The characterization appears to be useful in terms of painting a picture of what an integrated curriculum looks like from the perspective of powerful knowledge. The emphasis in the curricula is on learning geographical concepts that students might use to analyse phenomena (Type 2 knowledge). Remarkably little attention is paid to learning about places (Type 5), as a result of which the integrated curricula hardly contribute to a central aim of school geography, namely to build an extensive geographical world view.

AB  - The challenge for a discussant of the Humphry article in this issue is that the profundity of the simple insights of the article, and the lucid arguments by which the insights are sustained, might be easily overlooked, undervalued, or misconstrued. At the risk of repeating major inferences already presented, one may note that the article represents a major consolidation of ideas within the Rasch measurement model paradigm on several fronts. The article renders explicit the role of the implicit unit of measurement within any frame of reference tentatively described by the conventional one-parameter logistic (1PL) or Rasch measurement model. The 1PL model is a working hypothesis, but subject to well-known tests of adequacy and goodness-of-fit of a conventional statistical type. The implications of the article are manifold. At one level it provides substantial machinery for equating of diverse probe instruments in desired educational, psychometric, and sociometric measurement settings. It should open fresh dialogue between proponents of two-parameter logistic (2PL) models and of conventional Rasch approaches.

AB  - Higher education in health study programs is particularly focused on the development of technical skills, despite there being a consensus on the importance of training students regarding socioemotional and life skills. The aim of this study was to characterize and explore correlations between socioemotional skills and decision-making styles in undergraduate health students. Undergraduate students (18-25 years old) were recruited at a School of Health Sciences in Portugal. Participants were characterized in terms of sociodemographic data, socioemotional skills (Study on Social and Emotional Skills questionnaire) and decision-making styles (Melbourne Decision Making questionnaire). Descriptive statistics and correlations between questionnaires´ subscales were calculated. Students presented higher scores in tolerance (34.8±3.4), cooperation (34.7±2.4), empathy (31.1±3.2), vigilance (16.0±1.9), and procrastination (9.9±2.1). Assertiveness presented negative correlations with buck-passing ("rho"=-0.43, p<0.01) and procrastination ("rho"=-0.38, p<0.01) and positive correlation with vigilance ("rho"=0.22, p=0.03). Students demonstrated higher values in empathy, cooperation, and tolerance skills, meaning they tend to be kind and care for others' well-being. Vigilance style is related to assertiveness characterizing hard working leaders able to pay attention to others' needs. Training that involves socioemotional skills might be crucial for the style of decision-making in future health professionals.

AB  - This book contains a compilation of papers presented at the International Psychological Applications Conference and Trends (InPACT) 2018, organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (W.I.A.R.S.). Modern psychology offers a large range of scientific fields where it can be applied. The goal of understanding individuals and groups (mental functions and behavioral standpoints), from this academic and practical scientific discipline, aims ultimately to benefit society. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the several areas within the Psychology field, new developments in studies and proposals for future scientific projects. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between psychologists, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in psychological issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement the view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons there are nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. InPACT 2018 received 386 submissions, from more than 35 different countries from all over the world, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. 126 submissions (overall, 32% acceptance rate) were accepted for presentation in the conference. The conference also includes a keynote presentation by Dr. Saima Löfgren (BSc(Hons), MSc, DClinPsy, Clinical Psychologist, Visiting Lecturer at the Universities of Nottingham and Leicester, United Kingdom); and two Special Talks, one by Prof. Dr. Michael Wang (Professor of Clinical Psychology, University of Leicester, United Kingdom), and the other by Prof. Dr. Pedro Oliveira (MSc on Anthropology and Child Development, PhD in Social Anthropology, Clinical Psychologist, Member of the Portuguese Order of Psychologists, Portugal). We would like to express our gratitude to all our invitees. The Conference addresses different categories inside Applied Psychology area and papers fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. The conference program includes six main broad-ranging categories that cover diversified interest areas: (1) Clinical Psychology: Emotions and related psychological processes; Assessment; Psychotherapy and counseling; Addictive behaviors; Eating disorders; Personality disorders; Quality of life and mental health; Communication within relationships; Services of mental health; and Psychopathology. (2) Educational Psychology: Language and cognitive processes; School environment and childhood disorders; Parenting and parenting related processes; Learning and technology; Psychology in schools; Intelligence and creativity; Motivation in classroom; Perspectives on teaching; Assessment and evaluation; and Individual differences in learning. (3) Social Psychology: Cross-cultural dimensions of mental disorders; Employment issues and training; Organizational psychology; Psychology in politics and international issues; Social factors in adolescence and its development; Social anxiety and self-esteem; Immigration and social policy; Self-efficacy and identity development; Parenting and social support; Addiction and stigmatization; and Psychological and social impact of virtual networks. (4) Legal Psychology: Violence and trauma; Mass-media and aggression; Intra-familial violence; Juvenile delinquency; Aggressive behavior in childhood; Internet offending; Working with crime perpetrators; Forensic psychology; Violent risk assessment; and Law enforcement and stress. (5) Cognitive and Experimental Psychology: Perception, memory and attention; Decision making and problem-solving; Concept formation, reasoning and judgment; Language processing; Learning skills and education; Cognitive Neuroscience; Computer analogies and information processing (Artificial Intelligence and computer simulations); Social and cultural factors in the cognitive approach; Experimental methods, research and statistics; and Biopsychology. (6) Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytical Psychotherapy: Psychoanalysis and psychology; The unconscious; The Oedipus complex; Psychoanalysis of children; Pathological mourning; Addictive personalities; Borderline organizations; Narcissistic personalities; Anxiety and phobias; Psychosis; Neuropsychoanalysis. This book contains the results of the different researches conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to study and develop research in areas related to Psychology and its applications. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters that are hereby sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. We would like to express thanks to all the authors and participants, the members of the academic scientific committee, and of course, to the organizing and administration team for making and putting this conference together.

AB  - The K-5 school years are crucial, setting the framework for all subjects as well as critical thinking skills. The single most important component in a classroom is the teacher. However, in a formative timeframe for elementary-school aged children, the number of K-5 teachers that are educated with a Science, Technology, Engineering or Math specialization ("STEM") is substantially underrepresented. At The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) it was felt that the Department of Technological Studies was well positioned to provide a unique academic major by combining the T&E with the M&S components of STEM, resulting in a program breadth that matches the breadth of skills needed by a highly skilled K-5 teacher. Such a program was established at TCNJ and is formally referred to as the Math-Science-Technology or MST program. It was demonstrated that a multidisciplinary MST program was successful both in terms of growth and content knowledge. The MST program should be particularly well-suited to today's educational environment in which substantial numbers of students in STEM-related areas are lost, their scores are low on quantitative literacy, and they would likely score low on measures of technological literacy (Steen, 2001).

AB  - Providing challenging and engaging learning opportunities is one way to motivate students to learn. In this article, we discuss the contributions of the gifted education field to the development of enrichment pedagogy and identify several different types of these engaging instructional strategies, including interest-based learning pedagogy, differentiation and curriculum compacting, project-based learning, open-ended choice, and the application of creative productivity to students learning. We identify this specialized pedagogy and give examples of how these exciting pedagogical strategies can be implemented in classrooms and by enrichment specialists and school counselors, both for academically talented and for all students. We conclude with a brief overview of research that demonstrates longitudinal benefits for students who are exposed to this type of teaching, suggesting positive outcomes.

AB  - Objective: Innovation will be key to the success of the Grand Challenges Initiative in social work. A structural systems framework based in system dynamics could be useful for considering how to advance innovation. Method: Diagrams using system dynamics conventions were developed to link common themes across concept papers written by social work faculty members and graduate students (N = 19). Results: Transdisciplinary teams and ethical partnerships with communities and practitioners will be needed to responsibly develop high-quality innovative solutions. A useful next step would be to clarify to what extent factors that could "make or break" these partnerships arise from within versus outside of the field of social work and how this has changed over time. Conclusions: Advancing innovation in social work will mean making decisions in a complex, ever-changing system. Principles and tools from methods that account for complexity, such as system dynamics, can help improve this decision-making process.

AB  - The classroom exercise outlined here is a self-directed assignment that connects students to the environmental contamination problem surrounding the DePue Superfund site. By connecting chemistry knowledge gained in the classroom with a real-world problem, students are encouraged to personally connect with the problem while simultaneously developing skills in data management and interpretation. Designed for first-year undergraduate, general chemistry students, each of the four primary exercises builds upon the skills developed in those before it. This approach makes it easy to tailor this assignment to the needs of individual classrooms. This assignment was given as the first laboratory course assignment to a pilot group of 178 general chemistry undergraduate students at Northwestern University. Students enrolled in this course had already completed the first of two accelerated general chemistry courses. Over 75% of students scored in the 85% to 100% grade range, illustrating that the majority of students who completed this assignment demonstrated a high level of comprehension.

AB  - This study used the Interprofessional Attitudes Scale (IPAS) to examine attitudes of pharmacy and nursing students before and after an interprofessional education activity at a health science center campus. Results were analyzed using a matched pairs design to detect changes in attitudes from pre- to post-survey. Findings showed statistically significant changes with small effect sizes on seven items, with six moving in the desired direction and one moving in a direction not desired. Descriptive data indicated a possible need for intervention regarding prejudices and assumptions about other disciplines within health care professions.

AB  - This paper seeks to deconstruct the place of midwives as professionals using the novel interdisciplinary lens of the Place Model--an innovative analytical device which originated in education and has been previously applied to both teachers and teacher educators. The Place Model allows us to map the metaphorical professional landscape of the midwife and to consider how and where midwives are located in the combined context of two senses of place: in the sociological sense of public esteem and also the humanistic geography tradition of place as a cumulative process of professional learning. A range of exemplars will bring this map to life uncovering both the dystopias and potentially utopian places in which midwives find their various professional places in the world. The Model can be used to help student midwives to consider and take charge of their learning and status trajectories within the profession.

AB  - Smartphones have evolved into all-purpose computing machines with exceptional capabilities. They are becoming increasingly powerful, with modern audio "codec" (coder/decoder) chips that provide recorded audio of high quality. Smartphone developers now offer many sound applications (apps) using both the devices' built-in microphone and headphones. This, in principle, enables hearing tests like pure-tone audiometry on a smartphone, where students can measure the frequency-dependent hearing threshold level of their own ears using a smartphone. They may test each ear individually and compare them, or compare their results with others. Experiments on this physiological subject provide an opportunity to understand and deepen many physical concepts in an interdisciplinary approach.

AB  - This paper discusses strategies for promoting literacy and metaliteracy development in international and multicultural classrooms. Drawing on the first author's observational research and the second author's expertise in metaliteracy, we present a case study of international postgraduate students in an interdisciplinary department. The authors synthesize their different areas of work to describe how a fusion of metaliteracy, constructive alignment, and learning oriented assessments (LOA) facilitates student engagement with theories of knowledge organization and extensible markup language (XML) data-encoding standards. Our discussion describes curriculum design and redesign strategies and contextualizes observations about student success. The authors' observations provide a basis for proposing methods for using metaliteracy to implement constructive alignment and LOA methods for promoting collaborative and truly diverse learning.

AB  - Basic education in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) seems to be characterized by lecture methods of instruction, a lack of interdisciplinary approaches and a disconnection with local community problems. During 2008, a "My Community, Our Earth" (MyCOE) workshop was organized in the MENA region and involved teachers of geography, math and science. It aimed to promote and support the use of geographic methods and technologies, including Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS), regarding sustainable development topics as a way to improve primary and secondary teaching and learning through an interdisciplinary approach and connection to local issues. These subjects were integrated to a perspective based on spatial thinking, spatial analysis, active learning and problem solving on a variety of regional and local issues. This article explores the impact that the MyCOE workshop may have on participants' learning. Preworkshop and postworkshop questionnaires were administered, and the analysis of qualitative and quantitative data shows that the respondents' expertise was reinforced and that they learned to use geographic technologies. In addition, the MyCOE workshop resulted in the development of a more concrete vision among participants of what basic math and science education could be in Arab nations, by using geographic learning as a framework for integrated education.

AB  - Amber is a fossil by itself, and can also contain plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Some of these perfectly preserved specimens give scientists a convenient window to past environments, including the biology, ecology, geology, and chemistry of Earth's past. By using an interdisciplinary approach, we can demonstrate to students a more accurate representation of the scientific community, which does not work in isolation. (Contains 6 figures.)

AB  - Quality Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education is vital for the future success of students. Integrated STEM education is one way to make learning more connected and relevant for students. There is a need for further research and discussion on the knowledge, experiences, and background that teachers need to effectively teach integrated STEM education. A support, teaching, efficacy, and materials (s.t.e.m.) model of considerations for teaching integrated STEM education was developed through a year-long partnership with a middle school. The middle school was implementing Project Lead the Way's "Gateway to Technology" curriculum. The s.t.e.m. model is a good starting point for teachers as they implement and improve integrated STEM education.

AB  - Computer science and the liberal arts have much to offer each other. Yet liberal arts colleges, in particular, have been slow to recognize the opportunity that the study of computer science provides for achieving the goals of a liberal education. After the precipitous drop in computer science enrollments during the first decade of this century, many small liberal arts colleges, like their large university counterparts, found themselves with significantly diminished numbers of majors. From the author's perspective, the primary issue is that neither students nor educators really understand what computer science is. Consequently, they do not recognize the opportunities it provides for practicing precise logical and algorithmic thinking, for developing creative solutions to difficult problems, and perhaps most importantly, for encouraging interdisciplinary approaches. In this article, the author discusses what computer science education can contribute to a liberal arts education and vice versa.

AB  - Ballistocardiograms (BCGs) are graphical representations of the recoil from the pumping action of the heart. Introductory mechanics and a basic knowledge of the circulatory system are sufficient to understand the key features of a BCG. BCGs with adequate detail for instructional purposes may be produced easily and rapidly using hardware (a force plate) and software common to introductory physics labs. The interdisciplinary nature of this exercise is a particularly attractive feature. We have used it as a demonstration in a course on mechanics for nonphysics majors as well as for visiting high school students, and indicate here possible ways to incorporate it into upper-level physics or biomechanics courses.

AB  - Abstract: Students' perception of 8 criteria (rationale of the problem; interdisciplinary learning; facilitator asked essential questions; learner's skills; assessments; facilitation procedures; team's use of resources [team collaboration], and facilitator within a problem-based learning context) were assessed for a food biotechnology course that was part of a 3rd year biotechnology program. The mean score for "perceived learner's skills" was the lowest whereas those for "facilitation" and "facilitator" were the highest. Selected qualitative comments from students were also analyzed. This study demonstrated interdisciplinary learning as the students could make meaningful connections across different science disciplines. Further investigation is needed to develop possible strategies to accommodate the challenges in making meaningful connections across science disciplines as well as to develop a defined hybrid method for analysis of students' responses.

AB  - This study seeks to examine the importance of sleep health in an Irish urban school context of high poverty. It adopts an action research approach to conduct small-scale research with a non-probability sample of twenty-four sixth class pupils, to ascertain whether a five-week school and home based intervention can improve; sleep behaviours among the participants; self-reported daytime sleepiness of participants; and self-reported motivation to improve sleep health. The results indicated a notable improvement in child-reported daytime sleepiness, particularly among high-risk children. There was also a reduction in children reporting a bedtime post-midnight after the intervention. This intervention is innovative in its approach, as it provides a possible model for implementing a sleep health programme in the Irish primary curriculum to address the current Irish national policy neglect of this issue. It incorporates a parental involvement element, which has been recommended by previous international sleep interventions [Blunden et al. 2012. "Does Sleep Education Change Sleep Parameters? Comparing Sleep Education Trials for Middle School Students in Australia and New Zealand." "The Open Sleep Journal" 5: 12-18]. In addition, it aims to exert behaviour change, not just changing attitudes. These results, coupled with a positive feedback from children, their parents and class teacher, suggest positive potential for curricular multi-disciplinary model interventions in addressing sleep health needs among school-aged children.

AB  - With global specialization of work units within organizations, interdisciplinary work practices comprised of collaborative efforts between technical and business teams are increasingly common in today's workplace. While higher education has responded by creating opportunities for remote teams to learn from collaborative work, occasions for interaction between remotely situated "significantly diverse" teams such as business and engineering are few. This study describes a pedagogical offering between U.S.-based business teams and U.K.-based engineering teams that delivers such an experience around mutually dependent, socially responsible projects. Results from student surveys and reflections confirm that the pedagogical design is able to generate perceived interdependence between these diverse teams. Student responses to surveys also suggest that the collaboration is effective in raising student confidence in interdisciplinary and remote team work among students. The study concludes with recommendations for transferability and actualization of interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - In an ever changing society of the 21st century, there is a demand to equip students with meta competences going beyond cognitive knowledge. Education, therefore, needs a transition from transferring knowledge to developing individual potentials with the help of constructivist learning. Advantages of constructivist learning, and criteria for its realisation have been well-determined through theoretical findings in pedagogy (Reich 2008, de Corte, OECD 2010). However, the practical implementation leaves a lot to be desired (Gardner 2010, Wagner 2011). Knowledge acquisition is still fragmented into isolated subjects. Lesson layouts are not efficiently designed to help teachers execute a holistic and interdisciplinary learning. As is shown in this paper, teachers are having negative classroom experience with project work or interdisciplinary teaching, due to a constant feeling of uncertainty and chaos, as well as lack of a process to follow. We therefore conclude: there is a missing link between theoretical findings and demands by pedagogy science and its practical implementation. We claim that, Design Thinking as a team-based learning process offers teachers support towards practice-oriented and holistic modes of constructivist learning in projects. Our case study confirms an improvement of classroom experience for teacher and student alike when using Design Thinking. This leads to a positive attitude towards constructivist learning and an increase of its implementation in education. The ultimate goal of this paper is to prove that Design Thinking gets teachers empowered to facilitate constructivist learning in order to foster 21st century skills. (Contains 12 figures.)

AB  - Recent initiatives in the UK and the US have added greatly to the amount and quality of research on the effectiveness of secondary reading programmes, especially programmes for struggling readers. This review of the experimental research on secondary reading programmes focuses on 69 studies that used random assignment (n=62) or high-quality quasi-experiments (n=7) to evaluate outcomes of 51 programmes on widely accepted measures of reading. Categories of programmes using one-to-one and small-group tutoring, cooperative learning, whole-school approaches including organisational reforms such as teacher teams, and writing-focused approaches showed positive outcomes. Individual approaches in a few other categories also showed positive impacts. These include programmes emphasising arts, humanities and science, structured strategies, and personalised and group/personalisation rotation approaches for struggling readers. Programmes that provide a daily extra period of reading and those utilising technology were no more effective, on average, than programmes that did not provide these resources. The findings suggest that secondary readers benefit more from socially and cognitively engaging teaching than from additional reading periods or technology.

AB  - The demand for scientifically-based educational research has fostered a new methodological orthodoxy exemplified by documents such as the National Research Council's "Scientific Research in Education" and "Advancing Scientific Research in Education" and American Educational Research Association's "Standards for Reporting on Empirical Social Science Research in AERA Journals". This article criticizes the new orthodoxy as being a throwback to positivist reductionism and the "two dogmas" of educational research: the quantitative/ qualitative incompatibility thesis and fact/value dichotomy. It then criticizes the new orthodoxy for fostering a "third dogma" of educational research cut from the same cloth as the first two: the empirical science/humanities dualism. The article advances the view that no fundamental epistemological dividing line can be drawn between the empirical sciences and the humanities and that, accordingly, empirical research in education should not be cordoned off from the humanities, particularly their focus on values. It concludes with several observations about the problems and prospects for interdisciplinary research in education across the empirical science/humanities divide. (Contains 13 notes.)

AB  - Undergraduates use a spike sorting routine developed in Octave to analyze the spiking activity generated from mechanical stimulation of spines of cockroach legs with the inexpensive SpikerBox amplifier and the free software Audacity. Students learn the procedures involved in handling the cockroaches and recording extracellular action potentials (spikes) with the SpikerBox apparatus as well as the importance of spike sorting for analysis in neuroscience. The spike sorting process requires students to choose the spike threshold and spike selection criteria and interact with the clustering process that forms the groups of similar spikes. Once the spike groups are identified, interspike intervals and neuron firing frequencies can be calculated and analyzed. A classic neurophysiology lab exercise is thus adapted to be interdisciplinary for underrepresented students in a small rural college.

AB  - Wind energy conversion systems (WECS) nowadays offer an extremely wide range of topologies, including various different types of electrical generators and power converters. Wind energy is also an application of great interest to students and with a huge potential for engineering employment. Making WECS the main center of interest when teaching power electronics and electrical machines can therefore be highly advantageous. This paper describes a novel teaching experience using wind energy as the starting point for understanding power electronics and electrical machines. The results point out the wide variety of concepts involved in the course, the numerous competences that it can enhance, and its positive reception by learners.

AB  - The author discusses the role of the liberal arts in a business curriculum for an increasingly science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-centered world. The author introduces the rhetoric, orthography, ontology, and teleology (ROOT) disciplines, and links them to the traditional liberal arts foundation of higher education. The expanded role of the ROOTs in a business curriculum and its contribution to the STEM disciplines is explored. Finally different approaches for integrating ROOTs into the business curriculum are considered.

AB  - This article presents three cases of community-engaged, or "public," scholarship across diverse disciplines (social science, natural science, and health science) in which the rigid boundaries of what has been conceived as traditional service-learning have been blurred. The innovations represented within these cases explicitly address discipline-specific knowledge and civic skills acquisition. Moreover, they do so in ways that encourage the integration of scholarship, service, teaching, and learning. We argue that civic learning can be authentically realized through the synthesis of disciplinary content and civic sensibilities; integration of teaching, learning, research, and service; and by organizing our efforts around community problems (rather than organizing around specific pedagogical or research methods).

AB  - Cases of unethical business practices and technical failures have been extensively reported. It seems that actions are often taken by individuals with little apparent concern for those affected by their negative outcomes, which can be described as moral disengagement. This study investigates levels of moral disengagement demonstrated by business and science undergraduate students. Results indicate higher levels of moral disengagement in men than in women, but few significant differences between students majoring in business and those majoring in science.

AB  - This paper describes a research project into heritage education. Taking an interdisciplinary perspective from within the field of Experimental and Social Science Education, it presents an analysis of teachers' and administrators' conceptions of heritage, its teaching and its dissemination in Spain. A statistical description is provided of the results of a questionnaire. A factor analysis (FA) was applied to explore possible conjectures accounting for the correlations between the variables with respect to both the conceptualisation of heritage and its teaching and dissemination. The results emphasise the relevance of academic background, initial training and professional context with regard to the conceptualisations of heritage held by the different groups.

AB  - The growing number of students needing additional language support requires extra time in the hectic schedule of a typical science teacher. The good news for busy teachers is that several researchers and educators have crafted methods for using "sheltered instruction" to meet the unique needs of English language learner (ELL) students: "Sheltered instruction is an approach for teaching content to English learners in strategic ways that make the subject matter concepts comprehensible while promoting the students' English language development" (Echevarria, Vogt, and Short 2007, p. 5). These techniques allow teachers to combine language development with science instruction. This article discusses common strategic elements promoted in both science inquiry and sheltered instruction.

AB  - Alarmed by the possibility of social studies being overlooked in this context of new national disciplinary standards, National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS) and the Campaign for the Civic Mission of Schools convened a meeting of 15 national organizations representing civics, economics, geography, and history, to begin a conversation about a set of Common State Standards for Social Studies. The meeting culminated in a collaborative commitment to move forward toward a framework for state standards based on the shared concept that: Social studies is an interdisciplinary exploration of the social sciences and humanities, including civics, history, economics, and geography, in order to develop responsible, informed, and engaged citizens and to foster civic, global, historical, geographic, and economic literacy. It was agreed that the initiative would focus on the subjects identified by the No Child Left Behind Framework as the "core" social studies subjects: civics, economics, geography, and history. At the same time, a group of states organized as the Social Studies Assessment Curriculum and Instruction (SSACI) collaborative of the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) had initiated a parallel conversation about creating social studies standards that could be used across states. Introduced by colleagues aware of both efforts, the organizations and states joined forces to create what was to become the College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Framework for Social Studies State Standards. The C3 Framework offers a vision of social studies that is founded on inquiry, and emphasizes the skills and knowledge that prepare young people for college, career, and civic life. The vision has not yet been realized and the road has not been welltraveled, but progress has been made and these aspirations are attainable. Achieving them will confirm the essential role of social studies in our nation's educational system.

AB  - This paper examines the degree of multidisplinary cooperation for Geographic Information Science (GIS) education programs that award GIS-related degrees or certificates at US colleges and universities. We classified departments and courses into ten major disciplines using Dewey Decimal Classification. In the 2007-2008 academic year, approximately 40 per cent of GIS education programs related to multiple disciplines and nearly 20 per cent were involved with more than three disciplines. Geography was the major provider of GIS education programs, but the ratio between geography-related discipline and other disciplines combined was approximately 1:3. Fostering multidisciplinary GIS education programs should strengthen geography in general as well as GIS education. (Contains 9 figures and 4 tables.)

AB  - While the average teenager's conversation may seem inundated with the word "like", in the mathematics classroom, teenagers use it with purpose. Linguists study the word "like" to understand and categorize comparative statements. By overlapping linguistics and mathematics education within the frame of cognitive science, this study found that high school students do not use the word "like" arbitrarily. Its use within conceptual-metaphor analysis (Lakoff, & Johnson, 2003; 1980) suggests a specific purpose within mathematical problem solving. This interdisciplinary study identifies distinctions in high school students' use of the word "like." Specifically, students predominantly used the word "like" in a concrete manner to aid in conceptualization. This article offers practical indicators for teachers to improve students' ability to solve mathematics problems. (Contains 5 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Research by Jon Miller, professor of Interdisciplinary Studies and director of the International Center for Scientific Literacy at Michigan State University, shows that the U.S. scientific literacy course requirements for nonscience college students pull the United States into second place in international rankings of adult scientific literacy. This despite the poor science scores of U.S. primary and secondary school students as compared with other nations. The far lower adult scientific literacy rankings of most European nations and other industrialized nations appear to be due to the lack of any such college scientific literacy requirement in those nations. Instituting such a requirement in all nations, and improving the quality and quantity of such courses on U.S. campuses, would increase global scientific literacy significantly, arguably doubling Europe's scientific literacy rate. In view of this result and today's crying need for scientific literacy, physics educators should make physics for nonscientists their top priority.

AB  - This study involved using teaching strategies from the ARCS Motivational Model to develop new interdisciplinary curricular modules and ability assessments that combine Atayal culture with information technology. The purpose was to explore whether, through pedagogy based on the ARCS motivational model, indigenous middle-school students had a significant improvement in teamwork, creative thinking, and communication abilities, and whether or not students' interest in information technology and culture was inspired. Research subjects were 17 first-year students in an Atayal Comprehensive Junior-Senior High School in Nan'ao, Yilan County. The research period was 2016-2017, and data was collected from teaching demonstrations, thoughts written down by students, and tests. Research tools include the qualitative written thoughts of the students and a quantitative assessment of the key abilities of teamwork, creative thinking, and communication abilities. There were a total of 33 items. To explore whether there was a significant change in indigenous students' teamwork, creative thinking, and communication abilities, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for statistical analysis of pre-test and post-test results. Research results show that indigenous students performed significantly better in the post-test than in the pre-test with respect to teamwork, creative thinking, and communication. The thoughts students wrote down after class clearly expressed interest in the cross-disciplinary course combining culture and information technology. Therefore, the course using an ARCS motivational model to combine Atayal culture and information technology significantly improved indigenous students' teamwork, creative thinking, and communication abilities.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the intercultural learning outcomes for students in the Interdisciplinary Ghana Study Abroad Program. Data were collected from 28 students using the Intercultural Learning Outcomes (ILO) questionnaire containing 29 statements and 5 content domains (functional knowledge, world geography knowledge, interpersonal accommodation knowledge, global interdependence knowledge, and cultural sensitivity knowledge). Data were collected before engaging in and after completing the short-term program. Overall mean ratings showed that 83% of the 29 statements increased from pretest to posttest whereas none of the statements experienced a decrease in ratings. Paired t test revealed that a significant increase occurred in mean ratings for two content domains--functional knowledge and knowledge of global interdependence.

AB  - Humanity is in a tight race between planetary catastrophe and enlightenment. It is not clear which will prevail. The old paradigm, that of materialism, individualism, and fierce competition, is failing at all levels--economic, social, political, and environmental--and bringing life as we know it to the edge of a precipice. At the same time, a "new" paradigm is emerging, one that emphasizes interconnectedness, the sacredness of all creation, universal consciousness, and cooperation. In truth, the "new" paradigm is anything but new. What is new is that scientific discoveries are now beginning to resonate with and reinforce ancient wisdom, wisdom that has been imbedded in indigenous mythologies for millennia. It is incumbent upon those who have already transitioned to a more sustainable "myth of meaning" to find ways to encourage others along the path. A demographic naturally resonant to holistic worldviews, but largely untapped, is that of undergraduate Honors students. This paper describes a pioneering Honors course at James Madison University that, by many measures, has succeeded in integrating science and spirituality into a new way of thinking and being.

AB  - The Scottish Baccalaureate in Science or Languages is a new qualification, introduced in 2009, currently being undertaken by senior pupils in Scottish schools. To achieve a Baccalaureate, each pupil must complete an Interdisciplinary Project, a research project that bridges two subjects being studied at Advanced Higher level, plus two Advanced Highers. The new qualification is designed to broaden the learner experience, extend subject knowledge and enhance pupils' independent thinking. It will also help pupils develop interpersonal skills, generic skills and confidence. The aim of this article is to describe a model of learning and teaching that demonstrates how fourteen Interdisciplinary Projects for a Baccalaureate in Science could be managed within one school and, through a "whole school approach", be used to enhance pupil learning while embracing the essential elements of the Curriculum for Excellence (CfE), which is designed to produce effective contributors, confident individuals, successful learners and responsible citizens.

AB  - The emerging discourse on science in social work (SW) has generated much-needed analysis of the profession's status as a scientific enterprise. Brekke raised critical issues that must be addressed for SW to become a science. This response examines the contextual factors that led to the call for SW science. It also relies on a comparative analysis of attempts by other professions and disciplines to become scientific to discuss critical challenges and opportunities for SW to evolve to science status in the highly contentious scientific environment of the 21st century.

AB  - As inspirations from flora and fauna have led to many advances in modern technology, the concept of drawing ideas from nature for design should be reflected in engineering education. This paper focuses on a maple-seed robotic flier (MRF) with various complexities, a robotic platform modeled after the samaras of maple or ash trees, to teach STEM concepts to K-12 learners. Experiments using MRFs were also designed and incorporated into an undergraduate engineering course. Details are given on how the MRFs have been incorporated into K-12 camps and the undergraduate course. Unique features of MRF development are (a) very simple (using LEGOs and paper) to extremely complex (incorporation of microcontrollers and sensors) learning suitable for pre-K children, free-will adult learners, workforce training, undergraduate and graduate students, (b) research-oriented education, (c) entrepreneurship education and (d) trans-disciplinary education and research. Using microfabrication and nanofabrication technologies, the long range goal is to mass produce MRFs for surveillance in hard-to-reach and dangerous environments.

AB  - The article contains the results of the study conducted in order to discover the most effective ways of developing students' programming abilities with the means of non-programming disciplines and activities. The authors observe the learning practices and habits employed by students with highly developed programming abilities and compare these practices and habits with those employed by students with poor academic performance at programming lessons. Then they use the results of the observation to formulate theoretical and educational principles that can be applied to programming instruction for effective development of programming abilities. The authors have discovered the factors that have the most significant impact on developing students' programming abilities. The article describes interdisciplinary connections existing between computer programming, writing scientific essays, reading scientific texts and solving chess problems that have not been fully covered so far in scientific journals. Also, it specifies which type of mathematical problems is especially useful in developing students' programming abilities.

AB  - When contextualizing educational methods, teachers can focus on constructivism to develop inquiry materials as STEAM subject matter for use in schools. However, there is little research concerning what STEAM teaching resources teachers view as inquiry with hands-on STEAM instructional material for use in kindergartens. Therefore, this research used a spiral developmental course design with action research to apply a teaching inquiry and hands-on STEAM model focusing on lesson development for kindergarten children via a one-year workshop. The lesson development process of this research included a total of six stages, allowing 24 participating teachers to analyse the STEAM elements from their original lesson plans, then make revisions according to a model, including: prediction, do/observation, quiz/discussion, and explanation/ transfer (PD/OQ/DE/T). After the initial lesson plan was completed, teaching experiments were conducted, and the lesson plan was adjusted through reflection and revisions based on the suggestions of domain experts during the implementation process. Finally, 48 PDOQDET inquiry and hands-on based STEAM lesson plans were developed. Thus, it is proposed that the inquiry and hands-on i-STEAM modules developed using the PDOQDET approach can represent exemplars illustrative of an enriched design constructivist paradigm to support students' i-STEAM learning in kindergartens.

AB  - In this paper, we examined students' engagement in an implementation of a Workplace Simulation Project (WSP). The WSP was designed to actively engage students in learning disciplinary content by inviting engineers from industry to have a physical presence within the school building to collaborate with teachers and students to complete projects which simulate the tasks authentic to their work. We focus on the first year implementation of the program that partnered a high school in the rural Midwest with an engineering unit of a government organization. Using a multiple methods study design, we analyzed disciplinary and interdisciplinary pre and posts test along with students' interviews to determine learning gains as well as students' interpretations of creative and critical thinking as experienced in the project and their knowledge of the engineering design process. Effect sizes showed that students in the WSP group had notable gains over the control group participants. Additionally, students' knowledge of core elements of the design process were identified in inductive analyses of the interviews. Findings from this study will provide usable knowledge about effective ways to support systems and design thinking and ways to support expert-novice collaboration to ensure success.

AB  - Modern information and communication technologies have progressed quickly. Mobile technology, personal computers and the Internet have become closely linked to human life. However, all these devices and their use bring various pitfalls. Cheating of pupils and students in the school environment has been an interdisciplinary issue linked not only to pedagogy, but also to the whole range of sub-disciplines, like for example social pedagogy or etopedy. The latter disciplines have been significantly interfered by information and communication technologies that bring new forms of illegal school activities. Due to modern technologies we can also trace an increase of inattention of pupils and students and their tendency to distraction during lessons. Signs of Internet addiction among pupils and students can be observed more often. The paper deals with a research focusing on Internet use by secondary school youth and possible risks of using the Internet for them. Three aspects entering the educational process of adolescents are discussed there; Internet use, school cheating and Internet addictive behavior. In addition, a relation between possible risks of Internet use and educational strategies according the Learning Combination Inventory originated by Christine A. Johnston was examined within the research.

AB  - Ongoing changes in mental and personal characteristics of the modern child initiate the updating of means and forms of education. And they, in their turn, update methodological techniques and approaches to the use of methods during the math class. The source of updating methodological techniques may be the principles used when solving scientific problems. Scientific creativity traditionally systematizes knowledge and skills for their use to a wide range of sciences. Therefore, the principles of scientific creativity have a lot in common with different subjects, showing the student the unity of approaches in working with knowledge. In this regard, the article is aimed at substantiating the principles of scientific creativity as effective methodological techniques for finding solutions to math problems and, on their basis, developing recommendations for conducting classes that prepare for final certification at school in mathematics. The leading research methods in this case are: observation of the methodological work of teachers of mathematics, conversations with teachers, analysis of guidance papers and questionnaires of teachers, statistical processing of research results. In 2018-2019 the experiment in which 19 mathematics teachers took part was conducted. Based on its results the authors of the article succeeded in: highlighting the principles of finding solutions to math problems based on the approaches used in scientific creativity; developing and implementing on the basis of these principles recommendations for conducting classes that prepare for final certification at school in mathematics. The effectiveness of using the principles of finding solutions to math problems was assessed. It allowed the authors to conclude that students have an increase in the speed of finding solutions to math problems by an average of 11%. Practical use of the proposed principles makes it possible to organize training for schoolchildren in solving math problems in traditional forms of teaching, but taking into account the particularities of the development of the modern schoolchild. Methodological recommendations developed by the authors can be used to teach students how to find solutions to math problems during classes that prepare for final certification at school in mathematics.

AB  - Our view of learning takes into account how learners, when learning, are engaged in both doing science and mathematics and becoming mathematicians and scientists. Drawing on our work on a number of European projects that developed inquiry approaches across mathematics and science, we propose a new research and development agenda seeking new ways of connecting the subjects. In this article we consider how knowledge might be organised in ways that ensure learners gain insight into how mathematical understanding can prove powerful as they consider how science has applicability in making sense of a range of meaningful situations.

AB  - Chronic shortages of health, social service, and mental health professionals in rural areas necessitate creative partnerships in support of families. Cooperative extension professionals in Family and Consumer Sciences and community health nurses, who can bring critical skills to human services teams, are introduced as trusted professionals in rural communities. Multidisciplinary prevention programs offer particularly good contexts for county extension educators and community health nurses to work in collaboration with social workers. The case of grandparents raising grandchildren illustrates the critical roles that can be filled by professionals in these two fields to extend the reach of family support programs.

AB  - The primary objective of this study was to determine how experience in learning to teach scientific inquiry using a practical approach affected teacher's attitudes, evaluations of use of inquiry and their actual design of inquiry based instruction. The methodology included the use an approach incorporating inquiry methodology combined with a technology-infused and engineering rich approach called "Intelligent Robotics" to help teachers learn and use a new approach to teaching scientific inquiry. The findings showed that these teachers progressively moved from more teacher-centered thinking about teaching to student-centered thinking and actions incorporating scientific inquiry. They also worked together in designing an interdisciplinary inquiry curriculum, providing an effective alternative to traditional rigid standards based curriculum and teacher directed instruction.

AB  - In general, laboratory experiments focus on traditional chemical disciplines. While this approach allows students the ability to learn and explore fundamental concepts in a specific area, it does not always encourage students to explore interdisciplinary science. Often little transfer of knowledge from one area to another is observed, as students are given step-by-step instructions on how to complete their task with little involvement or problem solving. Herein, we provide an example of a real-time research laboratory experiment that is aimed at individual's exploration and development, with the scientific goal of discovering inexpensive, stable oxide semiconductors that can efficiently photoelectrolyze water to a useable fuel, hydrogen. Students create unique metal oxide semiconductors combinations, scan the samples for photoactivity using a purchased scan station, and report their findings to a collaborative database. A distinctive feature of the project is its ability to be implemented in a variety of educational levels with a breadth and depth of material covered accordingly. Currently, kits are being used in secondary education classrooms, at undergraduate institutions, or as outreach activities. The project provides students and scientists from different disciplines the opportunity to collaborate in research pertaining to clean energy and the global energy crisis.

AB  - An empirical study on 12th-grade students' engagement on a global warming debate as a citizens' conference is reported. Within the design-based research methodology, an interdisciplinary teaching sequence integrating an initiation to non-violent communication was developed. Students' debates were analyzed according to three dimensions: communication, argumentation, and knowledge. Students regulated their oral contributions to the debate by identifying judgments in their discussions. Rhetorical processes developed by students were mainly related to the identity of debate protagonists with interest attributions, authority, and positions. Students' arguments also relied on empirical data. The students' knowledge focused on energy choices, economic, political, and science development issues. Implications for socioscientific issues integration in class are discussed.

AB  - In this article, the authors describe how one group of California teacher educators has responded to the call for high school dropout rates with new thinking and action in regard to making teacher preparation a key strategy for reducing the dropout rates, raising student academic achievement, and eliminating the pervasive inequities in learning opportunities for students. The authors present a five-year initiative in which teacher preparation institutions partnered around the shared purpose of preparing new teachers to teach in secondary schools that have adopted a major reform in secondary education known as Linked Learning, a reform that research suggests is accomplishing the aforementioned results. In this reform, schools tend to operate as small learning communities in which authentic applications of curriculum center on an industry theme (e.g., health sciences, engineering, hospitality and tourism). They blend academic and career technical education and implement problem-based, interdisciplinary projects as a key instructional strategy. By design, all students experience a rigorous academic core, a demanding technical core, and associated work-based learning activities across grade levels. In addition, a range of support services is designed to help students to be successful.
