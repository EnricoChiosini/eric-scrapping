AB  - Professional development becomes relevant and effective when teachers are actively involved, collaborate, and when it is linked to teachers' daily school practice (Hunzicker in "Prof Dev Educ" 37:177-179, 2011). Preparation of teachers for a curriculum implementation such as the new subject Nature, Life, and Technology can be done by a professional development programme where teachers are actively involved (Visser et al. 2010). This study evaluates the designed and implemented professional development programme with respect to its effectiveness in terms of degree of teacher learning and development. Effects are evaluated for five learning areas: Instructional strategies, differences in students' prior knowledge, adjustments to the module, assessment methods and instruments, and field trips and guest lectures. Eleven teachers from four different schools participated in two professional development programmes, six teachers in the first professional development programme and five teachers in the programme for the subsequent module. Questionnaires and interviews were used to assess the effects in the different learning areas. The findings show that the professional development programme is a useful venture for teachers' professional growth in different learning areas.

AB  - Education research changed significantly with the passage of the Education Science Reform Act of 2002. That legislation created the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) within the U.S. Department of Education, forever changing research in education broadly writ, including school psychology. The creation of IES served many purposes, from defining education as a scientific discipline to encouraging research designs based on the premise that they make causal inferences more tenable. Something had to change, and IES brought about this shift.

AB  - Students with learning disabilities have significantly lower achievement in math and science than students from the general population. If these students with learning disabilities also are English Learners, the challenges for success in math and science are even more difficult. Teachers need to infuse best practices into their classrooms to support the learning of all students. These practices include, but are not limited to, the following: developing conversational language that bridges the gap to academic language; focusing on the academic languages of math and science that contain specific vocabulary terms and everyday conversational terms with different academic meaning; implementing verbal scaffolding, procedural scaffolding, and instructional scaffolding to facilitate cognitive connections; connecting new math and science content to student experiences; providing visual learning experiences with hands-on learning; using concrete materials and strategies; and providing writing and vocabulary enrichment activities. The strategies and methods presented are a beginning point for teachers and represent good teaching practices for all students.

AB  - Academic language is a kind of social language for the purpose of schooling. It is central to disciplinary learning, thinking, and communication. This study examined adolescents' use of academic language in informational writing, a genre highly valued in school, workplace, and society. Ninety-three seventh and ninth grade students from a U.S. public school were asked to write a science report based on a "wordless" picture book about a familiar class of animals called crocodylia. The student writing corpus was coded for presence of a constellation of academic language features. Statistical analyses of these data showed that (a) the adolescents made limited use of academic language features in their writing, (b) there were no significant differences between the two grade levels in academic language use, (c) there was a significant relationship between reading ability and academic language use, and (d) academic language use was a significant predictor of writing quality. These findings highlight both the importance of and the need for more explicit attention to academic language in secondary literacy instruction.

AB  - One of the key ideas of evidence-centered assessment design (ECD) is that task features can be deliberately manipulated to change the psychometric properties of items. ECD identifies a number of roles that task-feature variables can play, including determining the focus of evidence, guiding form creation, determining item difficulty and discrimination, characterizing proficiency, and producing task variants. Assessment developers can use these task features to manipulate the psychometric properties of both conventional assessment formats and complex tasks embedded in simulations and games. Simulations and games tasks present additional challenges: even defining what corresponds to an item can be difficult. Often task features are determined by game or simulation logic rather than psychometric design. Despite these difficulties, the roles for task features identified in ECD are useful for analyzing the psychometric properties of embedded assessments in simulations and games. This article compares a conventional test of mathematics-problem-solving ability using word problems to an assessment of conceptual physics, creativity, and conscientiousness embedded in the game "Newton's Playground," describing how the task roles play out in each setting and how they can be used to manipulate the evidence provided by an assessment.

AB  - This article reviews recent research in math problem solving for students with learning disabilities. Two recently published syntheses of research on mathematics by the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) are used as frameworks for interpreting this body of work. A significant amount of the work in special education over the last decade is consonant with the IES syntheses. At the same time, there are concerns regarding the role of explicitness in teaching problem solving as well as the relative lack of attention to discourse that should be considered as the field moves forward in this area of mathematics.

AB  - Active, student-centered pedagogies such as project-based learning (PjBL) can offer significant potential for engaging undergraduates with complex sustainability issues. Driven by institution-wide curriculum changes and informed by educational theories and evidence from previous studies, a trial PjBL activity was designed and delivered on three separate occasions, to three different student groups, at a university in the United Kingdom. In these trials, students from geography, Earth, and environmental science (GEES) programs worked in small (5 to 6 people), multiple-discipline teams to explore a single research question focused on a global sustainability issue. The perceptions and experiences of the trial participants (students and faculty) were investigated using data from surveys and interviews, and the findings applied to designing a new, multiple-disciplinary module focused on energy and climate change. In general, all participants engaged positively with the PjBL approach, although issues around the nature and extent of support available to the students and appropriate methods of assessing PjBL outputs emerged as requiring further consideration. The findings demonstrate that a single research question need not constrain the approach students take when completing a PjBL activity and identify clear potential benefits in terms of developing students' wider professional skills. This study also highlights the value to curriculum developers in trialing new pedagogic approaches, as the opportunity to "have a go" enabled potential issues for learners and instructors to be identified and mitigated prior to the final module design and implementation.

AB  - Science teachers know that the mathematics concepts taught in the Common Core are critical for students' understanding of science. But what can a teacher do when his/her students lack the necessary mathematics skills to master science content? There may be other reasons besides students not paying attention in their math courses. Maybe the required math has been taught once and then forgotten. Maybe it is brand new, so students are not ready to apply it yet. Or maybe the necessary mathematical concepts have not been taught at all. When teaching one's subject area is dependent, at least in part, on student understanding of concepts taught in other classes, it becomes even more important to identify and bridge gaps in understanding as they arise. This provides a key opportunity for collaboration across content areas. Math teachers can be called in to explain to the science teacher where the gaps in student knowledge are likely to be--not only in general, but for specific students, based on their performance in class and standardized test scores. This article discusses what teachers need to do when their students lack the necessary math skills to master science content. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - "Learning by doing" involves completing a practice activity through the method of inquiry. This study combined the predict-observe-explain (POE) inquiry method and hands-on doing processes to develop a cycle-mode POED (predict-observe-explain-do) model with an e-learning system to help students complete a practice activity using scientific inquiry. The study selected 60 sixth-grade students, who were divided into the experimental group (cycle-mode POED model) and the control group (lectures and PowerPoint slides). The students learned how to use hands-on tools to make a "Voltaic Battery Car" and complete the "Car Climbing the Ramp" task with the interdisciplinary knowledge that they had gained. The experiment was conducted over a period of 18 classes for a total duration of 720 min. The results showed that both groups of students improved their learning motivation, learning performance, and hands-on ability. Moreover, the student with lower prior knowledge were able to learn how to complete the activity using the cycle-mode POED model and scientific inquiry. This study developed the cycle-mode POED model to assist students in connecting their scientific conceptual knowledge with practical hands-on doing processes. The research contribution is a pedagogy manuscript for instructors who want to teach scientific inquiry to complete a practice activity.

AB  - Current childhood obesity treatment programs do not address medically underserved populations or settings where all members of an interdisciplinary team may not exist - either within one organization or within the community. In this paper, we describe the use of a community-academic partnership to iteratively adapt Epstein's Traffic Light Diet (TLD), into Building Healthy Families (BHF), a community-placed evidence-based pediatric weight management intervention (PWMI) and evaluate its effectiveness in reducing BMI z scores. Nine cohorts of families completed BHF. Participants included children aged 6-12 years with obesity (M = 9.46, SD = 1.74). The Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications-Expanded guided our classification of modifications across BHF cohorts. Using the FRAME reporting structure, the changes that were documented were (1) planned and occurred pre-implementation, (2) based on decisions from local stakeholders (e.g., school administrator, members of the implementation team), and (3) specific to changes in content and context - with a focus on implementation and potential for local scale-up. The nature of the adaptations included adding elements (whole of family approach), removing elements (calorie counting), and substituting elements (steps for minutes of physical activity). Across 9 cohorts, 84 families initiated the BHF program, 69 families successfully completed the 12-week program, and 45 families returned for 6-month follow-up assessments. Results indicated that the BMI z score in children was reduced by 0.31 ± 0.17 at 6 months across all cohorts. Reduction in BMI z score ranged from 0.41 in cohort 4 to 0.13 in cohort 5. Iterative adaptations to BHF were completed to improve the fit of BHF to the setting and participants and have contributed to a sustained community PWMI that adheres to the underlying principles and core elements of other evidence-based PWMIs. Monitoring adaptations and related changes to outcomes can play a role in long-term sustainability and effectiveness.

AB  - Three themes are central to preparing doctoral students for the professoriate: identity formation, scientific integration, and intellectual communities. In this article, we argue that these three themes are not separate pillars but interlocking circles. Our main thesis is that (1) social work must develop into a distinct integrative scientific discipline; (2) this recognition is core to the identity formation of doctoral scholars and, reflectively, their identity formation is central to the future development of social work as a scientific discipline; and (3) the sustainability of social work as a scientific discipline is dependent upon the development of intellectual communities. Developing social work as an integrative discipline will foster and congeal the identity of our scholars while allowing them to flourish within intellectual communities. Implications include nurturing a scientific sense of identity through a dialogical approach to doctoral education, creating and supporting intellectual communities, and making identity formation explicit in mentoring practices.

AB  - The importance of engaging students in science and helping them to become informed citizens has been highlighted by many groups invested in science education. This report describes a project that furthers both academic and civic goals through the integration of a service learning component into an undergraduate course. This nonmajors class covers the biology underlying the use of genetic information in today's society and provides students with the opportunity to discuss related ethical and political issues. The service learning project itself involved the creation of instructional materials dealing with the above topics and issues for use in local secondary school classrooms. Students developed materials in a digital media format to allow for revision in response to peer and community feedback. Outcomes of this pilot project suggest benefits to undergraduates as well as high school educators and students. Interdisciplinary collaborations and local educational partnerships have also been developed and strengthened through this work. (Contains 3 figures, 7 tables, and 1 footnote.)

AB  - In this article, the authors describe a cross-curricular project designed to enhance learning about micro-organisms. This project includes studies in art and poetry, not subjects that teachers would think of linking with science, however research notes that scientists and poets share the ability to pay close attention to things, a key skill also shared with artists. The stimulus for this work was images of yeast cells taken with a microscope, which provided a window into the "hidden world" of micro-organisms. The authors reference the work of Charlene Czerniak (2007), who described several different models for planning a cross-curricular study, one of which is what she called the "process approach," when similar skills and processes are taught across different subjects. The world of micro-organisms is just one of many "hidden worlds" waiting for students to observe. Poetry and art give children the opportunity to respond to the awe and wonder aspect of the science curriculum.

AB  - This work analyzes spontaneous cooperation between children who participated in Automata for STEM, European Union funded Erasmus+ project workshops. Taking into account the characteristics of automata, that involve a narrative part and a mechanism, the project used them to implement contextualized and interdisciplinary STEM activities. The pedagogical method involved the presentation of automata, and children being challenged to plan and construct their own. Although no cooperative learning strategies were imposed during the workshops, this research aimed to identify types of spontaneous cooperation that could emerge among children. Data was gathered through participant observation and a questionnaire. Core dimensions of spontaneous cooperation were identified as well as specific dimensions, pointing to a divergent type, characterized by involvement between pairs of children in different projects, and to another type, convergent, involving work between pairs of children in the same project. Spontaneous cooperation also varied according to the children's age or the workshop structure. During workshops with children aged 6-7 years, the class teacher was present and provided guidance, the children were seated in pairs or in a presentation arrangement. During workshops for older children of 8-9 years of age, there was less guidance and the class teacher sometimes was not even in the room the children worked at round tables.

AB  - Interdisciplinary concepts and methodology are increasingly common in today's secondary schools. However, many interdisciplinary lessons combine courses in related areas (e.g., English with history or science with mathematics). This article examines the use of mathematical ideas in the teaching of literature and writing. Employing mathematical knowledge in the instruction of literature and writing provides another means of illustrating literary and writing concepts. (Contains 7 figures.)

AB  - Latest standards-based reform documents from mathematics and science education organizations and communities bring forward one important issue--higher-order thinking skills, namely reasoning. In this article, we share our experiences and our approach to developing an integrated course for mathematics and science prospective teachers centered on fostering reasoning with the use of technology. This study took place in an integrated mathematics and science methods course. The prospective teachers were career changers with STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) backgrounds. A sociocultural theoretical approach framed this study, wherein learning is evident in the constructed and enacted plans to engage STEM students in reasoning. The analysis of prospective teachers' reflections and integrated lesson plans suggested that the structure of the course scaffold with minilesson study helped prospective teachers extend their view of reasoning and consider reasoning when planning lessons in the future.

AB  - Education for human development within the constraints of sustainability is problematic for schools. On one hand, it is a political idea that continues to evolve with successive compromises between social groups with differing or even conflicting interests. ESD is therefore inherently "non-disciplinary" and cannot be the basis of a single school subject if we wish to keep the creativity that results from the dynamics at work. On the other hand, SD leads us to think collectively about solutions that ensure a future of our choosing that preserves the biological capacity of the planet and to reduce our vulnerability. The sciences thus have a key role: their ability to question the world and to model the consequences of collective and individual choices. But there is a risk of technocratic drift and SD leads us to think about society's values and aims. A new link is established between sciences and humanities with a democratic model in sight. This paper presents what is possible out of the prospective scenarios method within general and compulsory education by seeking, through an empirical approach, to determine its feasibility, its contributions, its limits, and to locate the place of science education in the elaboration of the perception of "vulnerability". Both primary and secondary schools are concerned. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - This supplement of "Health Education & Behavior" showcases the current state of the field of systems science applications in health promotion and public health. Behind this work lies a steady stream of public dollars at the federal level. This perspective details nearly a decade of investment by the National Institutes of Health's Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research. These investments have included funding opportunity announcements, training programs, developing resources for researchers, cross-disciplinary fertilization, and publication. While much progress has been made, continuing investment is needed in the future to ensure the viability and sustainability of this young but increasingly important field.

AB  - Compare the sounds produced by a symphony with those produced by a high school orchestra, the notes produced by hitting a tympani with those produced by hitting a trash can lid, and the sounds produced by Al Green with those produced by Yoko Ono. Even though the pitch of a note (determined by the "frequency" of the sound wave) is the same in different instances, the quality of the sound can vary quite a bit. Musicians refer to the quality of a note as the "timbre" of the note. In this article the author describes several activities that investigate what contributes to the timbre of music using a Slinky, 10 feet of latex tubing, and a stringed instrument.

AB  - Within the subfields of political psychology and the study of gender, the introduction of new data collection efforts, methodologies, and theoretical approaches are transforming our understandings of these two fields and the places at which they intersect. In this article we present an overview of the research that was presented at a National Science Foundation (NSF) (#SES-1014854) funded conference "New Research on Gender in Political Psychology" at Rutgers University in March 2011. This scholarship represents the expanding questions and approaches that enhance our understanding of gender within political psychology. As a result, we suggest that further innovation is needed with regard to theory and methods to understand better how gender shapes the political attitudes and actions of individuals. Our discussion here covers the use of data, interdisciplinary methods, and intersectionality to study gender. We conclude with thoughts about the theoretical implications of this recent scholarship and the future of political science research on gender.

AB  - Scenes from the works of William Shakespeare were incorporated into individual and group projects for an upper-level chemistry class, instrumental analysis. Students read excerpts from different plays and then viewed a corresponding video clip from a stage or movie production. Guided-research assignments were developed based on these scenes. These projects required students to make significant use of primary scientific literature to address open-ended research questions inspired by Shakespearean plays. Projects were scaffolded with in-class activities to guide and encourage student progress. Class performance, student perceptions, and learning outcomes will be discussed, and a student perspective is included. Recommendations for the incorporation of Shakespeare into other chemistry courses are provided.

AB  - Computer Science is a rich field with many growing application areas, such as Health Information Systems. What we suggest here is that multi-disciplinary threads can be introduced to supplement, enhance, and strengthen the primary area of study in a course. We call these supplementary materials "threads," because they are executed alongside the material presented in the course, reinforcing and augmenting it but not replacing it. Many studies have been performed on how making a topic more meaningful and relevant to students can improve their outcomes. Integrating Health Information Systems into the Computer Science curriculum can achieve this. In this paper, we present a case study in which the development of a health system is integrated into a Database course. The results indicate that students enjoyed the course more, were more motivated to complete the course project, and were able to learn and apply the core course materials more readily.

AB  - This study investigated the writing parameters of a research paper by multiple authors who formed a research team in a public university in Malaysia. Drafts of the research paper were produced through the research activities and writings of the participant researchers. By observations, interviews, and textual analysis of drafts, we studied the three main parameters that each written text naturally contains: who wrote the text, what the text was, and to whom the text was written. Participants in the present study comprised a team of researchers from different disciplines. They conducted a project in science, wrote, and published their findings in an on-line journal. The findings indicate that the authentic task of writing a multi-authored research paper by a team of experienced researchers is beyond and more complicated than fulfilling a basic task of writing in the context of a class by a novice student. The experiences through which the participant researchers of this study produced the drafts of the article are greatly valuable for the academics who are planning to publish their findings in the form of an article. This study has implications for teaching of writing academic texts, particularly writing of research papers.

AB  - The authors have developed and implemented a novel general education science course that examines scientific knowledge, laboratory experimentation, and science-related public policy through the lens of feminist science studies. They argue that this approach to teaching general science education is useful for improving science literacy. Goals for science literacy for nonscience majors are discussed. They used pre- and post-surveys (Likert scale), exam scores, and classroom assessments to examine the impact of this course on students. A final analysis shows that students made significant gains in science content knowledge, increased their confidence in learning science (content and experimental work), and increased their understanding of feminist analysis of science and science-related public policy.

AB  - This study examined an interdisciplinary scientific research project to understand how graduate and undergraduate honors students learn to do science. It was found that the education of the students occurs as part of an apprenticeship. The apprenticeship takes place in research groups. In general, research groups are structured in two ways: loosely organized and tightly organized, and have characteristics of both communities of practice and epistemic communities. Students have different roles in the research groups: novice researcher, proficient technician, or knowledge producer. Their role depends on their knowledge and skills, and their degree programs. It is possible for students to develop expertise along a continuum from novice researcher to knowledge producer. The members of the research group, including the professor and other students, facilitate the development of the students along the continuum of roles. Implications for the education of science teachers are discussed.

AB  - This article describes a collaborative learning experience in experimental design that closely approximates what practicing statisticians and researchers in applied science experience during consulting. Statistics majors worked with a teaching assistant from the chemistry department to conduct a series of experiments characterizing the variation in measured voltage output of Smestad and Gratzel's nanocrystaline titanium dioxide (TiO2) solar cells. These solar cells can be constructed easily in a laboratory, and they are reported to produce an open circuit voltage in direct sunlight of 0.3 to 0.5V. Statistics students planned a series of experiments as part of an experimental design class, and the chemistry TA performed the experiments in the lab where the statistics students could observe. The students wrote a description of what they did and the results. From the students' comments about what they learned from this experience, it appears that this type of exercise could be very beneficial in training future consulting statisticians and scientists or technologists who will use experimentation in their work.

AB  - This special issue on language diversity and bilingual processing is based on papers presented at the "Exploratory Workshop on Speaking, Thinking and Gesturing in Two Languages," at the University of Reading, UK, in September 2012, sponsored by the European Science Foundation (IM/SCH/EW11-145). The workshop brought together a multidisciplinary team of researchers interested in exploring how language affects cognition both in terms of structuring information for the purpose of communication, and in terms of non-verbal categorization and perception of reality and the world. Research shows that the information speakers select to describe events and how they package that information is to some extent dependent on the language they speak. Because the research to date has largely focused on monolingual speakers, there is a gap in knowledge about the thinking processes of bilinguals and L2 learners. Thus, studying bilinguals allows tracing the developmental trajectory of language and cognition in the human mind, and thus gain important new insights into the correlation between linguistic and sociocultural variables on the one hand and cognitive categories on the other hand, which studies of monolinguals do not reveal (Athanasopoulos 2011).

Malt; EJ1064750--"There Is No Prime for Time: The Missing Link between Form and Concept of Progressive Aspect in L2 Production," by J. Gerwien and M.

AB  - In this study, science faculty and educators collaboratively developed a plan to evaluate an interdisciplinary science curriculum and its administration policy. The science faculty were engaged in determining criteria for evaluation and interpreting data. The collaborative evaluation stressed graduate attributes in the affective domain and provided a dynamic for curriculum revision. Four cohorts of students voluntarily completed scales that measured their attitudes toward interdisciplinary study, course-taking patterns, and career choice. The results suggested that students' involvement and learning loadings were crucial to the effectiveness of the reform. Moreover, the traditional policy at Asian universities that requires entrants to declare a major should be changed, as most university entrants are not certain enough about their interests and abilities to make an appropriate decision about their major at such an early stage.

AB  - A science teacher has the advantage of hooking learners with all their senses: flashes, bangs and smells. The science labs are something that many learners at the start of secondary school (high school) are eager to explore, and when there is an open day at school it feels unfair that the mathematics department has to try to compete for excitement with the liquid nitrogen and explosions on display in the science area. The author argues that there is nothing wrong with being a science teacher, but school science teaching is full of restrictions. On the contrary, mathematics teachers are lucky because they do not have to be a control freak in the classroom. What the author loves about teaching mathematics is that learners can explore without permission--no teacher needs to impede their thinking by fencing off areas and telling them they are too young or too inexperienced or too clumsy to go there. The author loves the way that learners of mathematics can take control and come to conclusions that they "know" are right, not because someone tells them so but because they have reasoned it out for themselves.

AB  - This study explores boundary-crossing interaction between two grade 5/6 science classrooms that operated as knowledge building communities. The two classrooms studied human body systems with the support of the Knowledge Forum over a ten-week period. The knowledge building practice integrated student-driven inquiry and discourse within each community and cross-community interaction mediated through "super notes" posted in a cross-community meta-space. Students co-authored super notes as epistemic boundary objects, each of which synthesized knowledge progress in an emergent line of inquiry for cross-community sharing. Qualitative analyses of classroom videos, online discourse, and interviews provide a rich description of how the students conceived, generated, and interacted with the super notes for knowledge building. The processes to transcend student ideas toward the higher social levels for sharing through boundary-crossing further served as a larger context for idea development toward higher epistemic levels. Incorporating cross-community interaction is important for scaling CSCL-based classroom practices in a way that fosters high-level epistemic engagement.

AB  - The inclusion of activities to develop sensory awareness, spatial thinking, and physical dexterity, operationalized through hands-on science lessons such as water play, have long been part of early childhood education. This practical article addresses Next Generation Science Standards K-2 ETS1-3 and K-2 ETS1-2 by having four-year-old prekindergarten students direct the path of water on a vertical pegboard water table with strategically-placed, attached plastic cups with holes drilled into them that leak streams of water into each other. Students enhanced their retelling of the story of the "Billy Goats Gruff" by placing student-made watercolor artwork along the path of the water, which represented the stream in the story. Students devised a variety of working solutions to guide the path of the water from the upper right to the lower left of the vertical water table. Students grew in confidence and skill as they voiced and tested their solutions. They also enjoyed retelling the story of the "Billy Goats Gruff" from the beginning of the water stream to the end, using the illustrations they had made. Later, students created their own challenges on the water table. Through play and exploration, students were able to test their spatial designs, incorporate literacy and art, and work on social-emotional skills while being actively engaged in their endeavors.

AB  - The aim of this study was to elicit participants' experiences with a multidisciplinary patient education programme and their views regarding the usefulness of the programme. Focus group interviews were conducted with 10 participants immediately and nine months following participation in the programme and analysed using thematic analysis. Initially, the participants experienced confusion and insecurity regarding coping with the illness. Participation in the programme appeared to promote understanding, acceptance and coping through gaining greater knowledge, learning coping strategies and exchanging experiences, as well as receiving understanding and acceptance. Thus, the programme was experienced to be a beneficial intervention. However, the participants expressed a need for more guidance or follow-up to maintain the practice of coping strategies for better coping with their illness.

AB  - In the context of the increasing migration into Germany that has taken place in recent years and German efforts to establish an inclusive school system, which enables learners from different religious, ethnic, language and social backgrounds with and without disabilities to participate, religious education has become a key topic for interdisciplinary discourse between theology, philosophy, and pedagogy in German schools. The following questions are of special interest: How can we manage diversity in inclusive classroom settings in general, and specifically: how can we do so with regard to worldview diversity? Does worldview diversity in schools exist, and if so, how can we recognize it in its plurality and complexity? How can we acknowledge different worldviews in the context of a changing inclusive school system? In this article, we would like to present the theoretical foundation, the research setting and the first findings of our ongoing pilot studies of worldview education at an inclusive German school. The experiments are part of a larger project context that is also described. The case study presented in this article, in which innovative language and machine learning technology was used for data analysis, illustrates the potential of inclusive methods and didactic concepts such as Universal Design for Learning, Learning in the Presence of the Other, and Reflexive Inclusion for inclusive worldview education in the context of a religiously pluralized and secularized society.

AB  - Educators in many disciplines recognize interdisciplinary teaching as effective for student learning. This article provides a model for developing an interdisciplinary literacy and science study with states of water as the core scientific study with corresponding literacy strategies. Authors have included suggestions for children's literature as well as science experiences to use with this study. This water model provides teachers a base for developing studies that integrate their literacy and science curricula. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) sites widely serve as the first major research gateway for undergraduates seeking a structured research experience. Given their lack of prior research skills, and the highly compressed duration of the REU programs, these students frequently encounter barriers to a seamless transition into a new laboratory environment. We hypothesized that the design of a unified short course on laboratory and analysis techniques could serve as a pivotal orientation experience. Our goal was to rapidly align student expertise to their summer research goals while also integrating the student participants into a cohesive learning community. This article discusses the design and outcomes of a Cellular Bioengineering Boot Camp, which is offered at the outset of the 10-week REU site at Rutgers. The Boot Camp provides hands-on, supervised training for techniques and procedures that are common among projects. The training establishes a common language and baseline for the REU students and allows their first laboratory experiences to be with each other, and creates an immediate network of peers and mentors. Surveys before and after the Boot Camp and at the end of the summer indicated a significant improvement in student proficiency in the techniques that was retained throughout the summer. We believe that the Boot Camp approach can be tailored to the specifics of each REU site and its associated projects and research foci.

AB  - We assessed the effectiveness of an integrated engineering public-speaking class relative to a traditionally taught public-speaking class. The integrated class was designed to meet the growing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics communication needs and the fundamental Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology and the National Communication Association student outcomes related to public speaking. Working within the Communication in the Disciplines theoretical framework, this study employed a quasi-experiment with both a test (engineering specific communication class) and control (traditional communication class) group; finding a significant increase with respect to attitude toward communication for students before and after the engineering specific class compared with the traditional class. Along with attitude toward communication, efficacy toward communication and being enrolled in the engineering specific class related positively to a sense of engineering identity for students at the end of class. For students enrolled in the engineering specific class, their sense of engineering identity was mediated through an improved attitude toward communication.

AB  - Schools, as institutions for general education, are believed to have a responsibility to equip their students with the knowledge and commitment to take personally meaningful decisions and action to address the challenges posed by both lifestyle and societal conditions. Achieving this goal requires, among other things, adequate integration of the "challenges" into the school curricula. This paper reports results of a study that assessed whether (and the extent to which) loss of biological diversity and climate change have been incorporated into Biology curriculum guides for Ethiopian secondary and preparatory schools. To this end, content analysis has been used as a principal technique. The findings revealed that the revised curriculum guides have integrated a number of issues that could enhance understanding about the significance of biodiversity and consequences of its loss. Issues related to biodiversity have been addressed, in one form or the other, in all grades except grade eleven. When it comes to climate change, the revised curriculum guides offer little opportunity to integrate the issue. The paper thus argues that, where such issues are not "manifestly" integrated into the curriculum guides, one cannot expect concrete action planned and executed against loss of biodiversity and climate change. The paper calls for redressing some of the observed limitations through interdisciplinary collaboration and/or revision of existing content. (Contains 3 figures and 8 tables.)

AB  - Interdisciplinary research and education (IDRE) holds center stage in current academic discussions. Despite the widespread agreement on the promises of IDRE, barriers for effective IDRE implementation remain significant. This study explored the opportunities and challenges of IDRE in integrated soil and water sciences at the Pennsylvania State University through a faculty survey and an educational project. The study revealed that: (1) co-advising graduate student is a common practice as a means of IDRE, and the overall positive aspects out-weigh the negative aspects; (2) joint faculty appointments receive mixed reactions, and are viewed by some as advantageous for the university but difficult for the faculty; (3) people issues are absolutely a critical aspect of successful IDRE; however, IDRE could also be accomplished by small groups or individuals; (4) synergistic approaches have not yet been commonly implemented, because IDRE collaborations often consist of faculty continuing piece-meal contributions independent of one another; (5) a new/renewed interdisciplinary undergraduate program in integrated soil and water sciences remains questionable as a viable solution to the declining undergraduate enrollment; (6) a potential new and broader graduate program appears to be promising, with a possible target on the emerging Critical Zone science (an interdisciplinary science that advocates the holistic studies of the Earth's near-surface environments, which extend from the top of vegetations to the bottom of aquifers); and (7) reward system needs to be enhanced to truly facilitate IDRE, and should be considered as a focus from both administration and practicality points of view. It is hoped, through such a study, that more true synergies can be realized through enhanced IDRE in academic environments. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)

AB  - Many students struggle to interconnect biochemistry and molecular biology (BMB) contents taught in separate classes or to relate BMB to what they learn in other courses. Such students lack the necessary perspective to perceive the intradisciplinary and interdisciplinary "bonds" of BMB. In other words used before in this journal, they are unable to see the tertiary and quaternary structure of BMB. Teachers of BMB must strongly consider how to change this if they wish their students to understand what they want them to learn. Integration offers an opportunity to help students make connections, to learn better how to scaffold and organize their BMB. More and better integration will always be good news for student-centered education and should thus be strongly encouraged. Interdisciplinary integration relates to curricular structure. Therefore, perhaps it makes sense to look at integration as a feature with levels of progressive complexity. Picturing integration by levels is empowering and makes integration feasible.

AB  - Although "STEM" has been part of the education lexicon for years, the "E" for engineering has received little attention from K-12 educators. Engineering is taught only sporadically in K-12 schools, despite growing evidence that engaging in engineering education leads to improved student learning and achievement in mathematics and science, in part by connecting these subjects to real-world problems. This Smart Brief describes research that shows increased national interest in and the benefits of engineering education. It goes on to discuss challenges of implementation as reported by the National Academy of Engineering. Lastly, the Brief highlights three examples of National Science Foundation-funded programs that show promise for educating future generations of scientifically literate and engineering-talented adults.

AB  - The role of empathy in human social interaction has been examined in several research fields, including medical education (ME) and social neuroscience (SN). SN yields insights into empathy based on neurobiological processes, and such information may also be relevant to ME. In this reflection article, the authors first critically review current definitions and concepts of empathy in ME and link them to recent SN findings. In the light of recent evidence from SN, research in ME regarding the positive and negative effects of empathy for physicians and patients is discussed, as well as the question whether (future) physicians differ from the general population with regard to empathic skills. Commonly used SN paradigms and ME approaches to assess empathy are contrasted, a joint approach is advocated, and implications for further interdisciplinary studies are outlined. Finally, the authors delineate the contribution of SN to the question of whether empathy is teachable, and argue that SN findings represent a potential for new ME training approaches. In conclusion, the authors discuss how the incorporation of perspectives on empathy from different research areas would benefit ME, and suggest the translation and integration of such findings into ME research approaches.

AB  - The main aim of the presented research was to examine the interaction between student's gender and achievements in learning concepts of electricity via STEAM integrated approach utilizing Scratch. This research was aimed to determine the gender disparity for lower-secondary school students in learning about the concepts of electricity. Quasi-experimental design involving male and female groups was used in this research. Students were required to utilize Scratch to design games and animated stories on electricity concepts. The Electricity Achievement Test (EAT) was administered for pre- and post-test. The findings proved that the STEAM integrated approach via Scratch could narrow the gap between male and female in learning concepts of electricity. The findings of ANCOVA indicated that the intervention had similar positive effects on male and female students' achievement in learning concepts of electricity. This research also provided a new method and an alternate connective framework for learning concepts of electricity via art and showed that both males and females were able to understand the topic of electricity, which reduced gender biases and disparity in the field of science.

AB  - This article describes a simple and inexpensive undergraduate-level kinetics experiment that uses magnetic levitation to monitor the progress and determine the activation energy of a condensation reaction on a polymeric solid support. The method employs a cuvette filled with a paramagnetic solution positioned between two strong magnets. The vertical position of the polymeric beads suspended in the paramagnetic solution correlates with the density of the beads and, consequently, with the progress of the chemical reaction within these beads. Varying the temperature of the reaction between the leucine-functionalized support and 2,5-diiodobenzoic acid under pseudo-first-order reaction conditions yields an activation energy of 65.4 [plus or minus] 9.2 kJ/mol. This value compares well the activation energy of 63.5 [plus or minus] 4.1 kJ/mol determined using a density analysis. This experiment combines a number of interdisciplinary concepts including organic chemistry, kinetics, and magnetism and, therefore, could be implemented in a number of undergraduate chemistry courses at various levels.

AB  - Traditional secondary science education draws on markedly different pedagogies than those made use of in contemporary environmental education, therefore, embedding environmental education within secondary science curriculum presents both epistemological and practical difficulties for teachers. This ethnographic study examines the work of six secondary science teachers in Northern Ontario, Canada, as they engage in an action research project focused on merging environmental education in their science lessons. Over the course of five months the teachers examine and discuss their views and their professional development related to the project. In the place of definitive conclusions, six propositions relating the work of secondary science teachers to environmental education, form the basis for a discussion of the implications of the study. The implications are particularly relevant to secondary schools in Ontario, Canada, where the embedding of environmental education in science studies has been mandated. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Research Findings: Each year the federal government disburses billions of dollars to support young children, with a particular focus on assisting families facing hardships. Policies for children revolve around several fundamental themes, including the promotion of physical health and high-quality environments, intellectual and language skills, emotional well-being, and interpersonal relationships, which are also areas of focus in the increasingly interdisciplinary neuroscience and child development research communities. Practice or Policy: Through intentional and skillful dialogue, the field of brain and cognitive research can collaborate with the early education and care and policy communities to create meaningful changes rooted in the science of human development. Research on the relationships between social and environmental variables and child outcomes should work in concert with a coordinated approach to creating and presenting policy recommendations.

AB  - Data literacy is recognized as a critically important skill in today's society, but thinking with and about data is often ignored in K-12 curricula. The Thinking With Data (TWD) project advocates that data literacy is a skill that should be addressed in an interdisciplinary manner. This article provides an overview of the TWD curriculum for middle school, which uses an extended Preparation for Future Learning (PFL) framework to teach data literacy across subjects. Research conducted during field implementation of the curriculum in two middle schools investigated whether the approach worked, and if so, why. Results show evidence of student gains in data literacy skills as well as in mathematics and science. Our best evidence of learning of data literacy skills was found during the social studies and mathematics modules. While we have preliminary evidence of learning in science and language arts, potential gains in these modules need to be more closely examined. (Contains 5 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - Researchers agree that an interdisciplinary approach should be taken to address bioethical issues at school. Little is known about the knowledge students need to be able to understand and take part in discussions about these issues. We investigate the relationship between 79 students' prior knowledge in various domains and their ability to recall and produce arguments about a bioethical issue. Our results partially confirm theoretical assumptions presented in, and findings from, related studies. Knowledge in various domains facilitates understanding of bioethical issues and facilitates recall and development of related arguments. Addressing bioethical issues at school has numerous benefits for students, for example, it allows them to develop and employ knowledge in various domains and to see how it interconnects.

AB  - Background: Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is becoming more prevalent at the elementary level, and there has been a push to focus on the integration between the STEM disciplines. Researchers within this study sought to understand the extent to which triads composed of a classroom teacher, student teacher, and an engineering fellow were able to use the context of an engineering design challenge to integrate and incorporate STEM concepts into the elementary classroom. Using a content analysis approach, researchers analyzed STEM integration across four phases of learning: professional development workshop, lesson plan, classroom enactment, and post-lesson reflection. Results: Results highlight the ability for triads to conceptualize the integration of STEM concepts but also the challenge to sustain the integration of STEM concepts across phases of enactment. Conclusions: The need to support teacher learning of STEM content and pedagogical practices for integration are discussed.

AB  - This study, in which the explanatory mixed design was used, has two aims. The first aim is the development of a scale to determine teachers' beliefs about the integration of mathematics and children's literature. The second one is to examine the beliefs of teachers on children's literature and mathematics teaching, with the data collected through the scale. The items of the scale developed within the scope of the study were created based on the literature and the opinions of 56 teachers who were aware of this topic (phase 1). The draft scale was applied to 392 teachers. After the validity and reliability studies, the scale was finalized. Accordingly, the scale has four dimensions and 33 items: positive pedagogical effects of the integration, the role of resources influencing the integration process, teacher competencies that make the integration process difficult and social norms, and teacher competencies that facilitate the integration process (phase 2). The data were collected from 772 pre-school, primary, and middle school teachers (phase 3) to reveal teachers' beliefs about the mathematics and children's literature integration through the final form of the scale. The results indicate that pre-school teachers have much higher scores in contrast to the primary and middle school teachers except for the dimension of the role of resources influencing the integration process, and novice teachers have more positive beliefs about the positive pedagogical effects of integration and their competencies in this regard. Also, the beliefs about the integration process significantly vary based on the awareness levels about integration.

AB  - The processes of puberty, including reproductive fertility and social-role transitions, now begin earlier, last longer, and are experienced in very different contexts. Because of this, all children and adolescents need good-quality puberty education in school curricula, and this need is supported by positive cost-benefit analysis and international professional consensus. The introduction of a new nationwide curriculum is an ideal opportunity to seek evidence for the presence of puberty education, in this case, in the Australian Curriculum. This study, a concise account of the first-known search for such evidence, aims to examine the compulsory curriculum Content Descriptions in the subject Learning Areas (LAs) developed for Australian students in Years 1-10. Quantitative and qualitative content analyses were conducted of audits taken at critical learning/teaching stages for students aged 5, 10 and 15. Findings highlight negligible levels of puberty education presence, even in the LA of Health and Physical Education (HPE), but immense potential for the inclusion of puberty education in all audited LAs. The introduction of consistent, continuous and competent programmes in all school years would likely enhance students' well-being, health and safety, educational outcomes and life chances.

AB  - The University of Texas at Austin has developed an upper-division undergraduate laboratory called "NANOLAB" to introduce undergraduate science and engineering students to nanoscale science and engineering (NSE) concepts. The NANOLAB is not a stand-alone course offered by a specific department, but rather a laboratory station--or hub--that interfaces with existing "traditional" laboratory courses across both the Colleges of Engineering and Natural Sciences. The chemical engineering department played a central role in developing the NANOLAB, which is designed to provide close to 1,000 undergraduate students per year with a hands-on introduction to NSE fundamentals.

AB  - Education policy in Australia and comparable countries requires that all secondary content teachers actively teach the literacy of their learning area and support the literacy development of students in their classes. In this paper we present evidence on the capacity of graduating teachers to meet that obligation. We review assessment data from 393 Initial Teacher Education students who completed a core unit in secondary curriculum literacy prior to graduation. We report that while the majority met the unit requirements, approximately 30% graduated as teachers with marginal or inadequate capacity to teach the literacy of their subject or support student learning through literacy. Approximately 12% of the sampled cohort failed the unit on their first attempt; yet 76% of those who failed went on to graduate. We show that such performance is consistent across the secondary disciplines included in the survey. We pose the questions as to whether secondary teachers with a marginal command of literacy strategies and poor literacy knowledge can be expected to provide effective literacy support, and whether education policy goals and provision of training in this area are therefore realistic.

AB  - Hands-on experimentation has widely demonstrated its efficacy in engineering training, especially in control formation, since experimentation using computer-aided control system design (CACSD) tools is essential for future engineers. In this context, this article describes a case study for Control Engineering formation, based on a new lab practice for the linear and angular velocity control for a commercial P3-DX robot platform, to teach industrial control. This lab proposal includes all the stages involved in the design of a real control system, from plant identification from an open-loop test to real experimentation of the designed control system. The lab practices proposed have a twofold objective: First, it is an interdisciplinary approach that allows students to put into practice the skills from other subjects in the curriculum, facilitating the integration of knowledge. In addition, it allows increasing the motivation of the students by working with a complex and realistic plant. The proposal has been evaluated through the grades of the students, as well as the perception of both students and instructors, and the results obtained allow to confirm the benefits of the proposal.

AB  - In a rapidly changing world of knowledge exchange, innovation and technological advancements, entrepreneurship continues to fuel economic growth in both developed and developing countries. In the developed world, an increased influx of graduate entrepreneurs sustains economic growth whilst, in contrast, developing countries continue to suffer from a dearth of entrepreneurial learning mechanisms. To remedy this situation in Ghana a collaborative and interdisciplinary venture, involving the Business School of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and an international panel of experts, has developed the Kite Vision Actualization Laboratory (KVAL). The raison d'etre of the KVAL is to support and nurture talent, develop and implement business solutions and innovations, encourage the development of entrepreneurial undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and stimulate graduate business start-ups. The KVAL integrates four development stages of entrepreneurial learning: knowledge transfer and exchange; innovations and inventions; technology and enterprise development; and panel review, assessment and final approval protocols. The innovative KVAL framework mirrors demand-led transformation and self-actualization processes that represent a departure from traditional offerings in entrepreneurship education.

AB  - Universities are undertaking transformation projects that align their work with the Sustainable Development Goals. This paper describes how Ocean I3, an educational innovation project that aims to reduce plastic in the sea, has made an impact on its community over its three editions (2018/19 to 2020/21). Methodologically, it has been approached by the people who make up the technical team and academic coordination as an exploratory study using discrete, non-reactive techniques, mainly from the public domain (websites, blogs, press releases, etc.), and instruments, such as field notes and work material to manage, organize, and train within the project. The analytical procedure has represented a dynamic and systematic process of categorisation. The results highlight the repercussion of the project in terms of capstone projects, master's thesis, coursework, etc., produced by the students involved; association with employability; collaborative work from the teaching teams; monitoring experience for research purposes, and social dissemination of the project. It concludes by suggesting lines for Ocean I3 to work on in the future to make its footprint sustainable in institutions over time.

AB  - In this article we expand on ideas of making and maker spaces to develop Indigenous making and sharing. We draw from an ArtScience participatory design project that involved Indigenous youth, families, community artists, and scientists in a summer Indigenous STEAM program designed to cultivate social and ecologically just nature-culture relations grounded in Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and making. In this article we focus specifically on clay making and the ways in which onto-epistemic heterogeneity can be engaged to create transformative maker spaces. We present findings from an analysis of the pedagogies of walking, observing and talking lands and waters to outline principles of Indigenous making and sharing in youth-based learning environments.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to establish the necessity to fully and effectively integrate the sub-disciplines of educational foundations, such as psychology and philosophy, in addition to the natural and social sciences, within medical and health-related educational programs. This is particularly pertinent in Catholic and other religiously affiliated institutions of higher education and professional practice. The ability to effectively and systematically integrate key concepts, theories, skills, and dispositions will enable students, as well as future and current health care professionals, to understand, synthesize, apply, and actualize values and virtues. These attributes and competences will include empathy, caring, and understanding with a deep commitment to self-reflection so that they can deliver care that involves the ingredients of quality, affordability, accessibility, availability, and continuity for their patients. These characteristics of the patient care will certainly enhance and reflect the principles of their belief systems and education in pursuit of quality health care for all. If these values/virtues are taught constructively, systematically, and well, then the health care professionals will be able to transmit the traditions of excellence, dedication, and creativity to future generations. Indeed, such concerns would ultimately help future health care professionals to come closer to the educational, philosophical, and theological mission of their institution and more fully integrate their approach to health care education at the pre-service and continuing post-certification/licensure levels.

AB  - A major challenge in contemporary research is how to connect medical education and cognitive neuroscience and achieve synergy between these domains. Based on this starting point we discuss how this may result in a common language about learning, more educationally focused scientific inquiry, and multidisciplinary research projects. As the topic of prior knowledge in understanding plays a strategic role in both medical education and cognitive neuroscience it is used as a central element in our discussion. A critical condition for the acquisition of new knowledge is the existence of prior knowledge, which can be built in a mental model or "schema." Formation of "schemas" is a central event in student-centered active learning, by which mental models are constructed and reconstructed. These theoretical considerations from cognitive psychology foster scientific discussions that may lead to salient issues and questions for research with cognitive neuroscience. Cognitive neuroscience attempts to understand how knowledge, insight and experience are established in the brain and to clarify their neural correlates. Recently, evidence has been obtained that new information processed by the hippocampus can be consolidated into a stable, neocortical network more rapidly if this new information fits readily into a "schema." Opportunities for medical education and medical education research can be created in a fruitful dialogue within an educational multidisciplinary platform. In this synergetic setting many questions can be raised by educational scholars interested in "evidence-based" education that may be highly relevant for integrative research and the further development of medical education.

AB  - Integrating interdisciplinary social studies topics and social responsibility concepts into a business education class can be meaningful for student learning. The discipline of social studies includes multiple areas such as economics, history, sociology, and anthropology. Social responsibility in a business sense means that companies are concerned with the communities in which they operate beyond making a profit. Social responsibility has recently been emphasized as a way to teach students about how their actions can affect society. Microfinance is an example of social responsibility in which individuals across the world can loan money to struggling entrepreneurs in poor countries. Microfinance lends itself well with social studies since it emphasizes how people live and work in other countries. This paper describes how social responsibility and social studies can be woven into an integrated project for an introductory computer applications class. The course and projects are described and they can be customized for use in a high school or post-secondary setting.

AB  - Learner-centered blended learning approaches, such as Knowledge Creation, emphasize the self-organizing characteristic of thought and action, and value the students' autonomy and self-regulation during the engagement in collaborative learning tasks. In blended contexts, the students need to organize their learning paths within a complex environment, including multiple online and offline learning spaces. This process of self-organization during courses based on the Knowledge Creation approach is currently an overlooked topic of research. The present case study is aimed at addressing this research gap by providing an in-depth understanding of the collaborative self-organization of a group of five undergraduate students participating in an interdisciplinary media design course. The course was designed according to the Knowledge Creation approach and was carried out before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dialogical theory of the chronotope and the theory of cultural models constitute the main theoretical tools for the research. We used qualitative methods inspired by ethnography, including participant observation, in addition to the collection and analysis of audio-visual records, stimulated recall interviews, and learning diaries completed by the students. The findings show that the group self-organization changed across different phases of the collaborative task and involved the development of specific practices of self-organization. Cultural models associated with the task contributed to determine the students' choices related to self-organization.

AB  - The aim of the research is to determine the peculiarities of the evaluative categorization of human intelligence in linguistic world images. The study describes the interdisciplinary approach to studying evaluative categorization, which assumes the use of complex methodology including the anthropocentric, the interdisciplinary, and the cognitive principles. The paper suggests a modified cognitive procedure of evaluation, based on determining and using cognitive classification features, and differential abilities of subjects, based on the consideration of their ethnic experience. Research findings can be used in studies on the evaluative categorization of any objects of reality and during the systematization of evaluative linguistic phenomena as a modus representation of knowledge of objects and phenomena in the world.

AB  - This study aims to test the nature of the assumption that there are relationships between scientific epistemological views (SEVs) and reasoning processes in socioscientific decision making. A mixed methodology that combines both qualitative and quantitative approaches of data collection and analysis was adopted not only to verify the assumption but also to explore the patterns of interaction between the two constructs. A total of 177 college students (60% science and 40% non-science majors) completed a SEVs survey and a decision-making instrument. The decision-making instrument contains expository text introducing the environmental management issue of an invasive species, and a series of open-ended questions to elicit participants' reasons and judgments on the issue. Analyses revealed that tentativeness and creativity of SEVs are the significant components directly manifested in the socioscientific decision-making process. Students who held changing and tentative beliefs about scientific knowledge were more likely to recognize the complexity, take multiple perspectives, and question omniscient authority in the decision-making process. It was also found that over one-half of the college students, especially those who were science majors, make decisions based on a single disciplinary perspective. The findings suggest that educational programs should encourage students to actively participate in issue investigation and decision making by utilizing multiple reasoning modes and interdisciplinary thinking.

AB  - Key stage 3 (ages 11-14) in UK schools has been identified as the educational period when pupils rapidly become disengaged with science, largely due to its perceived irrelevance in everyday life and the manner in which it is taught. Until recently, a heavily prescriptive National Curriculum has prevented educationists from devising and delivering more effective science education. However, since 2008 a minimum-content model has been adopted for key stage 3, permitting educators greater flexibility in the teaching process. In line with these changes, specific pedagogies such as pupil-led enquiry, cross-curricular learning and themed teaching have increasingly been advocated as means of addressing the attitudinal crisis towards science. This article reports on the use of themed debate as a way of facilitating genuine engagement with science by addressing the pertinent socio-scientific issue "Is shipping a sustainable form of transport for the 21st century?"

AB  - Interdisciplinary studies foster integration of ideas across disciplines. The knowledge building pedagogy, with its 12 principles and associated technology, Knowledge Forum®, provides multifaceted support for linking ideas across disciplines and communities. This exploratory study aims to assess the extent to which elementary-school students within knowledge building communities work productively with ideas across content areas. Toward that end we examine "crisscrossing topics" -- student use of concepts from multiple content areas -- to explore the extent to which students think and theorize across disciplinary boundaries, use concepts found in curriculum guidelines at and beyond their grade level, and generate cross-topic notes that advance discourse. Results show that elementary school students engaged in knowledge building can extend knowledge boundaries and bring a considerable range of conceptual content to their work, resulting in productive discourse threads that contribute to community knowledge.

Following critical childhood studies scholars who emphasize the urgency of re-formulating relationships with taken-for-granted concepts in the field, we argue for a practice of noticing, tracing, naming, and questioning how PD comes to matter as a strategy toward becoming accountable for the ethical and political consequences of how we use, teach, and critique PD. We trace three formations of PD relevant to Toronto: (1) PD informed by bioscientific knowledges; (2) PD as synonymous with physical literacy and (3) PD as a distinct mode of learning. With each conceptualization, we interrogate how PD is produced as a concept worthy of concern, take seriously the possibilities for children's learning and lives enabled by each understanding, and then draw upon interdisciplinary perspectives to complexify how we might 'do' PD otherwise. We conclude by offering our practice of tracing, interrogating, and doing PD as an ongoing commitment, whereby scholars, students, and practitioners might continually re-visit how and why we come to understand PD with particular relations, knowledges, resources, and intentions.

AB  - Thirty years of academic dialogue and reinvention about environmental and sustainability education conceals the consistency of rhetoric that literature holds. This paper argues that higher education for sustainable development does not call for the invention of anything disconcertingly new. In fact, four simple, long-standing concepts contribute most of the philosophy, disciplinary content and pedagogy required: liberal education, interdisciplinarity, cosmopolitanism and civics. A review is undertaken of the literature behind these "ideas neither young nor mature" and a sustainability canon is derived that features integrated sciences, humanities and social sciences theory, engaging, active pedagogy and authentic external experiences.

AB  - Flow synthesis in microfluidic devices has been rapidly adapted in the pharmaceutical industry and in many research laboratories. Yet, the cost of commercial flow reactors is a major factor limiting the dissemination of this technology in the undergraduate curriculum. Here, we present a laboratory activity where students design and fabricate homemade microfluidic flow reactors using thermoplastic molds and soft lithographic methods, and conduct inorganic syntheses of magnetite particles and gold-citrate nanoparticles, as well as a two-step organic synthesis of azo dyes. The success of these reactions can be quickly assessed by colors or physical characteristics, which makes optimizations of reactor designs and reaction conditions possible on-the-spot. The activity also successfully integrates some important concepts in chemical engineering, organic and inorganic synthesis, nanomaterial chemistry, and analytical chemistry.

AB  - This study presented a course on preparing in-service teachers to learn communication technology education and how to integrate museum resources into their teaching. The course was organised and conducted by a teacher educator and museum educator together. Forty-two participants enrolled in this course, including 29 elementary school teachers, nine senior high school teachers, and four future teachers. During the course, data were collected and analysed to address issues and problems emerged from the study and to assess if it is appropriate to be suggested for further adoption. The data sources included reflective journals, lesson plans and peers' comments, video-tapes, and final reports. Findings, issues, and problems were presented and discussed including a lesson developed through an interdisciplinary approach. To be concluded, a professional development programme that will make changes need to include three important components: student involvement, heterogeneity of the participants, and role models provided by teacher educators.

AB  - This study aimed to present an example activity in which the engineering design process was used. The activity was carried out in an out-of-school learning environment in 12 periods of 40 minutes. Twenty-four students who were in the 6th, 7th or 8th grade, participated in the activity. Students were presented with a design problem in which moving companies must carry out transport operations in high-rise buildings without using the lifts of the buildings. They were then requested to make a design at a scale of 1/20 that can be used to carry goods to the fourth floor of a building. The students used technology (the Arduino program) for developing a solution. This activity enabled integration of the disciplines of technology, engineering, science, and mathematics. Students expressed positive opinions about the activity. The difficulties that students experienced and the suggestions for how to support them are discussed in the paper.

AB  - College science is often poorly taught and it is rare that any consideration is given to the nine visions for reform of science teaching featured in the National Science Education Standards (NSES) (NRC 1996, p. 52). It is even more rare to see interdisciplinary science courses taught in colleges. At many universities, this is changing where there are Science-Technology-Society (STS) enthusiasts. For example, Clemson University (Cheek 2006) is struggling with developing such courses as part of their general education requirements for all undergraduates and similar changes are occurring in Turkish higher education.

First, it would allow them to become acquainted with less naive conceptualizations of the capacities of citizens. Second, it would help them to consider the nature and role of scientific expertise from richer, more nuanced and less stereotypical conceptual angles. Third and lastly, it would allow future researchers and engineers to become familiar with different models of interaction between citizens, scientists and decision.

AB  - Introduction: The presentation seeks to investigate the facilitators and obstacles to convergence between library and information science theory and practice in an information disciplines context. The starting point consists of a review of "inward" and "outward" fragmentations existing in our discipline: between academia and professionals, between research areas, between university research and the other university functions: teaching and extension. The role of research problems' approaches to disciplinary unit, and the relevance of articulation of information disciplines to the promotion of information public policies are also considered. Development: These ideas are shared and discussed in light of a review and reflection on our experiences with interdisciplinary teams in library and information science research projects from 1990 to present in Uruguay. Conclusions: We refer to the challenges faced by information disciplines in view of, firstly, the new development model adopted by this country, based on building an information and knowledge society aiming to promote research and innovation and, secondly, a university in the middle of a reform process towards the integrity of university functions and the needed creation of "interdisciplinary spaces".

AB  - Genomics and proteomics projects have produced a huge amount of raw biological data including DNA and protein sequences. Although these data have been stored in data banks, their evaluation is strictly dependent on bioinformatics tools. These tools have been developed by multidisciplinary experts for fast and robust analysis of biological data. However, there is a gap in the development of educational materials in the bioinformatics area for undergraduate students in bioscience departments. A sample "in silico" laboratory manual on the prediction of N-glycosylation sites in phosphoethanolamine transferases is presented in this study. The method proposed in this study is simple to apply in laboratory courses and is dependent on the use of internet-based bioinformatics tools such as ProtParam, ClustalW2 and NetNGlyc. In conclusion, this application can stimulate the interest of undergraduate students in bioscience departments and may also contribute to the development of bioinformatics.

AB  - Problem-based learning (PBL) is an instructional design approach for promoting student learning, understanding and knowledge development in context rich settings. Previous PBL research has primarily focused on face-to-face learning environments, but current technologies afford PBL designers the opportunities to create online, virtual, PBL environments. The GlobalEd 2 Project is an example of a PBL environment that combines the positive characteristics of both face-to-face and online environments in a 14-week simulation of international negotiations of science advisors on global water resource issues. The GlobalEd 2 PBL environment is described examining the impact it has had on middle school students' interest in future science education experiences, self-efficacy related to writing in science and self-efficacy related to technology use for academic purposes using a pre-test post-test design. Analyses using ANOVAs of gain scores and ANCOVAs of subgroup differences demonstrate a positive impact on the science interest and self-efficacy of 208 middle-grade students from urban and suburban schools.

AB  - An environmental research project was carried out by a consortium established among scientists and university lecturers in collaboration with two high schools. High school students participated in a long-term study of the local temporal profiles of tropospheric ozone and the relationship to pollution and meteorological parameters. Low-cost research facilities for the high schools were obtained from public funds. The experimental setup provided a continuous source of data that was followed by the students under the supervision of the teachers. The participation was multidisciplinary (across various classes) and included activities related to the atmospheric study. The experience was motivating for students, providing them with a practical contact with science and the university. (Contains 2 notes, 1 table and 3 figures.)

AB  - The need for a convergence of the visual arts and the natural sciences within the framework of both formal (schools, universities) and non-formal education (museum) at the level of dissemination and popularization of this knowledge is something that has preoccupied the communities of artists, scientists and educators. In the present work we aim to present in a concise way certain positions with regard to the historical, philosophical and didactical dimensions of the problem of popularizing and teaching the relation between the visual arts and the natural sciences. More precisely, we intend to show the existence of this relation throughout history and within the society by reference to certain typical examples of how scientific ideas about nature and the propagation of light influenced the practices of the neo-impressionists or the early abstract painters in relation to the use of colour or the way the visual arts aid in the representation of scientific objects and/or ideas. At the epistemological level, we are going to put forth Levy-Leblond's idea that the relation between the visual arts and the natural sciences is a relation of meeting, controversy or even conflict but definitely not a relation of confusion or fusion. Furthermore, at the didactical level we aim to present the popularization and the teaching of the relation between the visual arts and the natural sciences as a problem of the didactic transformation of knowledge and reference practices and not as a clearly pedagogical construct.

AB  - Interdisciplinary service-learning projects are mutually beneficial for communities and students. This service-learning project focused on eating disorder prevention and involved students majoring in nutrition, art, and psychology at a public Southern university. The nutrition majors completed the Eating Attitudes Test before and after the project, assisted with the delivery of an eating disorder awareness dance performance in local elementary schools, and reflected on their experiences. The nutrition majors in this study did not demonstrate a significant change in their own eating attitudes and behaviors as a result of the learning experience, but they did reflect positive feelings regarding service-learning, community responsibility, and community partnerships.

AB  - A course in contemporary education issues is proposed as a valuable general education vehicle for citizenship education. Such a course offers the advantages of being inherently political and interdisciplinary, and relevant to students' life experience. Moreover, such a course would help satisfy the academy's responsibility to inform public debate about privatizing public education, an issue of national concern. (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - Evaluation as a particular kind of investigated discipline is distinguished from, for example, traditional empirical research in the social sciences or from literary criticism, criminalistics, or investigative reporting, partly by its extraordinary multidisciplinarity (Scrivens, 1991, p. 141). It is this unique multidisciplinary feature of evaluation that adds usefulness when determining the effectiveness of programs seeking to integrate mathematics and science teaching and learning across elementary and middle grade levels. In 2005, a K-8 mathematics and science program celebrated its 15th year of service. The program was the result of education, business, and community partnership efforts focused on improving mathematics and science teaching and learning in schools throughout a metropolitan region in the southeastern United States. This article focuses on the evaluation results for years 1 and 2, conducted from 1999 to 2004. It is concluded that the mathematics and science education program described in this  article was committed to increasing teachers' science and mathematics content understanding and developing their reflective practices. Just as important as it was to learn what were graduates' classroom practices and perceptions of the program, it was equally important to add to the body of evaluation literature on mathematics and science programs.

AB  - Achieving a sustainable future requires that individuals adopt sustainable behaviors, which are often learned and cemented at a young age. Yet, traditional education efforts have been inadequate in fostering transformative change, in part because many programs focus on fact-heavy, teacher-centered techniques while neglecting the practices that behavioral and sustainability scholars highlight as central to creating change. To address this gap, the pre-sent research integrates three critical yet mostly disparate bodies of research--educational pedagogy, behavior change, and sustainability competencies. This interdisciplinary approach to education was implemented and evaluated with a small group of students during an intensive summer program and year-long case study. The curriculum focused on food and waste behaviors and utilized experiential, real-world, problem-based methods in order to increase competence in sustainability and promote pro-environmental actions. The impact of the program was assessed through surveys, interviews, videos, and participant observations. The data showed that significant changes in knowledge and behaviors were achieved, while suggesting that social knowledge in terms of food is more resistant to change as compared to that of waste. Throughout the year, students maintained significant behavior changes in terms of their waste decisions; however, sustainable food behaviors were more resistant to long-term change due to the students' social and cultural environment. This article will detail the education program and assessment techniques while highlighting each student's unique characteristics, barriers to change, and motivations for action.

AB  - This article examines the ways in which art and aesthetics provide powerful and rich models for inquiry and connection, facilitating fresh perception, conceptualization, and engagement in qualitative research. The very engagement with research parallels the engagement with the arts. In this engagement, problem setting and problem solving, the conceptual and the embodied, the analytic and the holistic, are interconnected and interdependent. This article discusses a specific pedagogy used in the author's research courses to develop and nurture this inquiring mindset: a museum activity around consonant and dissonant artworks ("bounded systems") that targets the skills of observation and conceptualization, the identification of relevant contexts for inquiry, and the generation of directions for further inquiry.

AB  - A random sample of teachers in grades 3 and 4 (N = 157) from across the United States were surveyed about their use of evidence-based writing practices, preparation to teach writing, and beliefs about writing. Teachers' beliefs included their efficacy to teach writing, their orientations to teach writing, their attitude about teaching writing, and their attitudes about their own writing. The teachers' responses raised some concerns about the quality of writing instruction third- and fourth-grade students receive, as teachers reported spending only 15 min a day teaching writing and students spend only 25 min a day at school writing. While teachers indicated they used a variety of evidence based writing practices in their classroom, a majority of these were applied infrequently. Further, three out of every four teachers reported that their college teacher preparation programs provided no or minimal instruction on how to teach writing. They further rated their preparation to teach writing lower than their preparation to teach reading, math, science, or social studies. On a more positive note, a majority of teachers asked students to write multiple paragraph texts relatively frequently (4 times a month or more often) and complete at least one narrative, informative, and persuasive writing assignment monthly. Teachers were also generally positive about teaching writing, their efficacy to teach writing, and their beliefs about their own writing. Finally, efficacy to teach writing and philosophical orientations to teaching writing each made a unique contribution to predicting teachers' use of evidence based practices, whereas teacher preparation did the same for reported time spent teaching writing and reported time students wrote at school and home.

AB  - The Science Cafe is a national movement that attempts to foster community dialog and inquiry on scientific topics in informal venues such as coffee houses, bookstores, restaurants and bars. The California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, Robert E. Kennedy Library staff have taken the Science Cafe model out of bars and cafes and into the university's library. They have created an outreach opportunity as the campus community comes together to share and discuss faculty research, student work, and outside speakers' knowledge. The Science Cafe programs encourage open, easy-to-understand conversation exploring scientific and interdisciplinary topics in an attempt to build connections among disciplines. Cal Poly's Science Cafe is unique as it is one of the first to be held in an academic setting and the only Science Cafe within 200 miles of the campus. The program's development is described below.

AB  - As part of an integrative learning experience at the end of a sophomore Calculus II course at the United States Military Academy, this project served as a multidisciplinary problem-solving exercise that explored the connections among mathematics, biology, and other fields of study. During a seven-lesson block of instruction, this module was primarily intended to develop student awareness of the role of mathematics in all disciplines, especially the field of their recently chosen major. As a result, in addition to building mathematical models and exploring solution techniques for the resulting differential equations, several hours of class time focused on the connection between their mathematical models and the multidisciplinary issues involved in the scenario.

It emphasizes man as a biological organism interacting in a cultural-physical environment. Since the program is multidisciplinary and community-oriented the organization is by problem area such as man-environment interactions not by discipline. (MR)

AB  - The digital humanities (DH) is an emerging field of teaching and research that invites modern technologies to address traditional humanities questions while simultaneously making space for humanistic critiques of those technologies. A natural relationship exists between DH and the field of information studies (the iField), particularly surrounding their common focus on the interface between humans and computers, as well as subfields such as the organization of information, libraries and archives, data preservation, and information in society. Thus, we propose that iField programs in universities should take an active role in DH education. We are particularly interested in programs that are officially Information Schools (iSchools), members of the international iSchools Organization. Our research began as part of a DH curriculum committee convened by the iSchools Organization. To support iSchool engagement in DH education, we have inventoried and analyzed the degrees and supplemental credentials offered by DH education programs throughout the world. Our study deployed multiple data collection methods, which included conducting both ad hoc and comprehensive website surveys, querying an online DH catalog, and inviting members of the iSchools Organization to participate in an online questionnaire. This work has revealed several common patterns for the current structure of DH programs, including the various types of degrees or supplemental credentials offered. We observe that iSchools have a significant opportunity to become more engaged in DH education and we suggest several possible approaches based on our research.

AB  - This issue's theme is "shifting paradigms" in family and consumer sciences (FCS) professional practice. This can mean that things in the world are moving around and changing, people are moving from one way of seeing the world to another, or some combination. The question posed for this issue was "What is FCS doing and how is what they are doing changing per these paradigms?" The intent is to explore the nature of this question, not to provide an answer. This article provides an overview of the main challenges to America's individual and familial well-being (framed as wicked problems). The discussion then turns to what constitutes a normative (should) perspective (including value judgments and practical reasoning). A discussion of the relationship between ideologies and paradigms follows, including the process of shifting paradigms. This article suggests four different ways FCS professionals should expand their practice so they can better address 21st century wicked problems.

AB  - Interdisciplinary work within higher education has increased significantly over past decades (Amey 2004; Creamer and Lattuca 2005). However, the professional implications of interdisciplinary research and instruction for the faculty members who engage in such academic work remain unclear. This study of science educators who hold appointments in two academic departments begins to address this empirical gap. The outcomes provide insight into the factors that influence the professional lives of these faculty members. The knowledge gained from the study will provide mentors, colleagues, and administrators insight into the challenges facing academics undertaking this work. Further, this research seeks to inform policy makers in regard to how tenure and promotion is determined for jointly appointed faculty in science education and other interdisciplinary fields.

While many science classrooms incorporate root beer-brewing activities, the root beer lab presented in this article has an added environmental benefit: It uses local ingredients and recycled products. This lab also encourages student inquiry into a multitude of interdisciplinary topics--and your students will enjoy sampling the results of their scientific endeavors. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Development of environmental literacy needs an interdisciplinary effort. Especially language classes, with environment related texts, have potential to support environmental literacy. In this research it is aimed to analyze the Turkish language course books in terms of components of environmental literacy. To this end, four Turkish course books being taught between 5th and 8th grades were selected. As a qualitative inquiry technique content analysis was used. Three types of main components of environmental literacy (knowledge, affect, and behavior) and their sub-components determined. It was found that the most cited environmental literacy component was knowledge. Others were relatively less emphasized. Results showed that Turkish course books with environment related texts have potential to support development of environmental literacy.

AB  - This article attempts to address the workforce crisis with implications for economic competitiveness and national defense faced by America and the dichotomy of STEM needs and available employees. Businesses struggle to fill critical skilled roles in STEM occupations and thus suffer sluggish growth. In fact, some estimate up to 2.4 million STEM jobs go unfilled College graduates in STEM fields struggle to find jobs. STEM jobs have doubled as a proportion of all jobs since the industrial revolution. New jobs and entirely new fields are being created daily. Estimates suggest that 65 percent of children entering elementary school today will ultimately end up working in completely new job types that are not on our radar yet. More students are in college than ever before, and STEM graduates out-earn those in non-STEM fields 12-30 percent across all education levels. It seems impossible for both these narratives to be accurate. Yet, impossibly, they are both quite real. These two realities demand a greater understanding of the STEM talent ecosystem and a greater commitment to action. Both employers who have jobs to fill and job seekers are facing myriad confusing messages, options, and challenges. Considering this complexity, it is tempting to put our energy towards finding a single solution--the one program, metric, or organization that has all the answers. Since the National Science Foundation (NSF) coined the term "STEM" nearly two decades ago, we have seen an explosion in interest, investment, programs, research, and data all seeking such a solution.

AB  - To most people in the author's profession of Special Education, the "D" means "disabilities." At The Lab School of Washington, the "D" means "different"--learning "differently" and teaching "differently." Sally Smith, the founder of the school, had this uncanny ability to see things in her staff that they could not. The year the author graduated from her graduate program at American University, Smith offered her a fulltime position in the elementary science department. She was disinterested in the subject, after all, she held a Bachelor's in Fine Art and a Master's in Special Education: Learning Disabilities, "not" science. The challenge posed to her was how she was going to make science exciting and engaging for herself much less her students. The 10-year work experience of developing science and history-based exhibits for museums, combined with the techniques she learned in graduate school, formed the basis for her career as an elementary school science teacher. Today, as she was embarking on her fourth year teaching science, she had the opportunity to teach art again. Now, she enjoys teaching science.

AB  - Science Across the World is an exchange programme between schools world-wide. It has two main components: existing resources for students (age 6-10) and a database with all participating schools. The programme exists since 1990. It is carried out in partnership with the British Association of Science Education (ASE) and international pharmaceutical industry GlaxoSmithKline and is growing rapidly. This paper deals with the Science Across the World programme in Teacher Training in three countries: the Netherlands, Ireland and Germany. It shows how international collaboration can be fostered by participation in the programme. Amsterdam Teacher Training College in the Netherlands offers Science Across the World as an elective course to Dutch and European Erasmus students, who work in international interdisciplinary groups. They study the Science Across the World website and choose a topic to study in more detail. Later they write an implementation plan for their teaching practice school. At University College Cork in Ireland Science Across the World is part of a (Higher Diploma in Education) course on Science teaching methodology. Participating students implement the programme in their teaching practice schools. An elaborate research was carried out to investigate the success of this implementation. Teachers are enthusiastic about possibilities the programme offers and suggest an in-service training course on the programme and methodology. The government of the State of Hessen, Germany has just started a new concept in Biology methodology. The government decided to base Teacher Training in Biology on "Competencies and Standards." With increasing globalisation in the next decades the largest, easy to use, global exchange programme Science Across the World can help to achieve aims if modern education in all countries. Teacher Training can help with training student teachers in international collaboration on school level. The triangle Teacher Training--Science Across the World--Research should be promoted.

AB  - Gränsöverskridande Nordisk Undervisning/Utdanelse (GNU, meaning Cross-Border Nordic Education), the larger Nordic project, under which this case study was carried out, aims at developing innovative, cross-border teaching models in different subject domains in elementary school, including mathematics, language, science, social studies and history. This paper provides an in-depth description and analysis of how four social science and history elementary school teachers and their 70 students (5th-7th grades) worked together between November 2011 and December 2012. Previous research regarding the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in history education in elementary schools is limited, thus calling for contemporary investigations in this particular subject domain. The Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model, enhancing the combination of teachers' pedagogical, content and technical competence, was used as the analytical framework, together with nation-specific curricula and the European Union's recommendations regarding students' skills for lifelong learning. A range of empirical materials was analyzed, such as classroom observations, students' video productions, texts and photos distributed and shared on a mutual blog, real-time interaction and teachers' communication. The teachers tried out two ICT didactic models. In the asynchronous model, the major focus was on the form and content of the video productions being shared, whereas work with the synchronous model concentrated on the content and quality of the communication. Notwithstanding obstacles, cross-border collaboration provided added value. The nation-specific differences triggered curiosity and motivation to produce digital presentations of history content to be understood by the students in the three nations, facilitating goal fulfillment in communication skills and digital competence. However, achieving subject-specific goals in history remained challenging.

AB  - One of the more effective ways to convey the story of our origin and evolution is to present the entire chronicle in a multimedia format that allows today's tech-savvy students to browse at will, thereby extracting parts of the story at their own pace and comfort. This article describes an interactive CD-ROM (included in this issue of "The Science Teacher") that teaches students and teachers about integrated, interdisciplinary science. The opening screen of the CD shows the archetypal symbol of cosmic evolution--the "arrow of time." The arrow starts with the big bang at the left, moving across billions of years to the present at the right. The resulting scope and sequence flow across seven epochs in 14 billion years, and include physics, astronomy, geology, chemistry, and biology--conventionally taught as separate subjects but woven together here to give each subject greater context and relevance. This arrow of time enables teachers and students to browse their favorite topics and to probe how each science discipline overlaps and relates to others. The CD can be used alone or along with the Internet; the latter method allows users to connect to scores of additional websites that provide complementary material about different epochs along the arrow of time.

AB  - As the world has grown more interconnected, many political science programs have added courses on international law, international organizations, the laws of war and peace, international human rights, and comparative judicial politics. While in many cases these are relatively new offerings within international studies, all of these subjects have long been part of the law school curriculum. There is, therefore, a long pedagogical history to be examined in terms of the techniques and content used in law schools to teach these courses. This paper examines a number of these techniques and discusses how they may be used in political science courses to enhance student learning opportunities.

AB  - Whilst adaptive experts have well-researched beliefs and attitudes towards learning, what is unclear are the interactions that occur within the learning environment that constitute their learning experiences. The practice of geriatric medicine emphasises the interdisciplinary care of complex frail older adults. Our study sets out to understand the learning experiences of adaptive experts in geriatric medicine by examining how interactions at the intra-personal, inter-personal and organisational levels contributed to the development of adaptive expertise. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study through semi-structured interviews of 16 geriatricians experts from a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Data were analyzed via reflexive thematic analysis. The core essence of the learning experiences was described as a journey of 'knowing when we do not know', which was characterised by three themes: (i) Anchoring ethos of person-centric care where the experts drew upon their values to develop a holistic view of the patient beyond the medical domain, (ii) Enabling stance of being curious where their curiosity and openness to learning was nurtured through the practice of reflection, and with the benefit of time as a commodity and for development of expertise, and (iii) Scaffolding organisational culture of inquiry where an environment that is supportive of learning is built on the culture of psychological safety and the culture of mentoring. Taken together, our study highlighted the importance of interactions at the intra-personal, inter-personal and organisational levels in the learning experiences of adaptive experts.

AB  - This study aims to examine to what extent the field of competence regarding curriculum knowledge is concordant with the other sub-competency fields of teaching. These fields are field knowledge, pedagogic competence in field teaching, use of information and communication technologies in teaching, student behaviours and class management, individualised learning approaches, teaching students with special needs, education in a multicultural and multilingual environment, teaching crosscurricular skills, vocational guidance, internal evaluation of schools and self-evaluation, teacher-parent collaboration and school management and administration. Survey is our research model. The participations of the study are 54.395 teachers from 17 different countries, which have been obtained from PISA 2015. The correspondence and multiple correspondence analyses were used. The results of simple correspondence analysis have revealed that the measure of accountable correspondence is more than 50% between the sources of curriculum knowledge and those of other sub-competency fields such as field insight and knowledge, pedagogic competence in field teaching and student assessment procedures. Likewise, multiple correspondence analysis has also produced similar results.

AB  - The Common Core State Standards (CCSS); the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS); and the College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Framework for Social State Standards are bringing many changes to schools and classrooms across the United States. This article suggests using the power of questions to make connections across seemingly disparate disciplinary goals to help bring greater balance, coherence and meaning to the academic lives of teachers, students, and parents. The paper begins with a rationale for using guiding questions within the context of PDS and then includes an example, tools and suggestions for professional development with PDS stakeholders.

AB  - The need for a more robust, well-trained STEM workforce is becoming increasingly acute in the United States, and there is a clear need to recruit and retain a larger and more diverse population of undergraduate STEM majors. Although numerous efforts to improve engagement and support in the traditional P-16 classroom have been implemented successfully, it is also critical to explore other types of activities that have potential for high impact. The STEM Club Leadership for Undergraduate STEM Education, Recruiting and Success project at our large public research university in the Mountain West presents an outreach model to engage undergraduate STEM majors in developing and facilitating activities in local middle and high school STEM clubs. Through case studies, built on data from reflective journals and semi-structured interviews, the project has identified a number of benefits to the first cohort of participants, which is comprised of 11 undergraduate students operating in interdisciplinary teams across five schools. In this article we describe the essential elements of our outreach model and suggest benefits related to undergraduates' content knowledge, communication skills, metacognition, and identity as a future STEM professional.

AB  - For some children maths and science are exciting subjects that work side by side, one providing the opportunity to practise and hone skills and knowledge gained from the other. For other children the subjects are  disjointed and seem to bear no relationship to each other. Science can provide a wonderful opportunity to practise a variety of math skills within an engaging context. Moreover, the small-group-work nature of investigative science offers a supportive environment in which to work. So, how can a science context be used to enhance understanding in a few specific areas of the maths curriculum? Within the maths curriculum, children are expected to learn measure length, weight and capacity using appropriate equipment. Measuring skills can be taught in one of three ways: (1) abstractly--where the measuring equipment is used but with no context; (2) in a maths context--where there is a purpose to the task; and (3) in a science context--where some additional knowledge or understanding will be gained by carrying out the task so motivation to carry out the task will be greater.

AB  - In this content analysis, the authors examined articles from three international STEM journals to highlight and indicate if there were any trends for iSTEM research from 2013 to 2018. Of the 296 articles analyzed in this content analysis, 41 investigated the integration of STEM disciplines. Findings revealed that integrated STEM (iSTEM) education research is often qualitative and occurs in the United States. This study also indicates an upward trend in the percentage of iSTEM education research from 2013 to 2018, and many of the articles focused on middle school students. A closer examination of the introductions, backgrounds, and literature reviews of the 41 articles revealed four explicit definitions for iSTEM education. Furthermore, STEM and Education were the most frequently used author keywords and ERIC descriptors.

AB  - The target paper, "Rethinking Traditional Methods of Survey Validation" (Andrew Maul), raises some interesting critical ideas, both old and new, about the validation of self-report surveys. As indicated by Dr. Maul, recent policy initiatives in the United States (e.g., ESSA) have led to a demand for assessments of "non-academic" skills that are suitable for applied educational contexts. It seems inevitable that self-report surveys will play a role in meeting this demand, because of their ubiquity and the relatively low bar that has been established for their validation in social science research. It is therefore a good time to take a hard look at self-reports and their validation methodology. The author personally found the empirical studies to be the most interesting part of the paper. Although the examples were contrived, the results were nonetheless surprising and were successful in casting doubt (even more doubt) upon standard research practices associated with self-report surveys. However, the author does not agree with Dr. Maul's interpretation of the implications of the empirical studies. In this commentary, the author shares his opinion on Dr. Maul's article.

AB  - Electronic textiles, especially those that can be worn (wearable textiles) are gaining traction within the P12 education community. The technology provides hands-on learning that is both exciting and personally relevant, especially for females, who have historically responded positively to aesthetics and textile design. A number of studies have examined the potential of wearable technologies in education but they generally use small samples, mostly engage secondary school students, and are carried out in either formal or informal settings. In contrast, this study utilized a large sample of 808 upper elementary students and involved both in- and out-of-school learning contexts led by formal and informal educators. The present study used a quasi-experimental, prepost design with two groups (treatment and control) to measure the impact of a wearable technology intervention on students' (a) knowledge of circuitry, programming, and engineering design and (b) self-efficacy in making a wearable e-textile product. The three-level multilevel (i.e., children nested within teachers which were nested within schools) ANCOVAs were estimated for each outcome of interest (knowledge of circuitry, programming, engineering design, engineering self-efficacy, and programming self-efficacy). Results indicate that wearable technology's integration of engineering, computing, and aesthetics promises to be an excellent interdisciplinary context to support students' STEM learning and attitudes at the upper elementary level. However, differential results between males and females underscore the need to infuse gender-appropriate pedagogical practices to insure that females develop the needed self-confidence to successfully complete tasks involving these two skill areas.

AB  - While interest is central to learning, considerable disparities have been reported between students' science interests and the science curriculum. This study explores how 5th grade students' (n = 72) competence, relatedness and interest levels changed as a consequence of using two online learning environments, which bridged the students' anonymous curiosity questions and the required science curriculum on the topic of "Natural Resources." One environment provided answers to the students' questions (a "linear" environment), whereas the other provided relevant links and sent the students to find the answer by themselves (a "hypermedia" environment). Each student experienced both of the environments, and their competence, relatedness and interest levels were examined using a closed pre/posttest questionnaire. Interest level increased only after experiencing learning with the linear environment, whereas competence level increased only after using the hypermedia environment. These findings point to the potential of using online learning environments to narrow the gap between the curriculum and students' interests, while emphasizing the pedagogical need for diverse online environments for different learners and learning goals.

AB  - Research concerning the basic course known as Foundations of Art and Design strengthens the pedagogical approach for K-16 art and design education. The version of Foundations introduced to America by Josef Albers, although hardly changed, is shown to have continued, timeless relevance. Next, a sequential, implicit logic is revealed in linking the literature of the originators' old intentions for the course, reflections by their students, and directions taken by later colleagues (particularly design scientists and the theorists addressing the current paradigm combining aspects of art, design, mathematics and science education), revealing some limitless, possible new dimensions. The first focus of this article points to the foundations course as a common denominator for the assimilation of complex new material through aesthetic play, paving the way for new cultural forms. A second theme begins to intertwine literature from many interdisciplinary fields, revealing a profound and deeply rooted pedagogical underpinning, accessible to art and design researchers and educators to aid with their move toward future transformation.

AB  - One can extrapolate from the art of language instruction to discover methods applicable across the disciplines in higher education. The paradigm presented by language instruction is applicable throughout the arts and sciences. If cultivated--and there are institutional pressures working against it--such an art can impact the languages and codes of the individual disciplines so as to advance the research mission of scholars in those fields; it can also favor the interrelationships between the disciplines. How the student learns another language (L2) is comparable to the process of learning a scientific discipline.

AB  - Recent studies have highlighted a fear or difficulty with the study and understanding of neuroanatomy among medical and healthcare students. This has been linked with a diminished confidence of clinical practitioners and students to manage patients with neurological conditions. The underlying reasons for this difficulty have been queried among a broad cohort of medical, dental, occupational therapy, and speech and language sciences students. Direct evidence of the students' perception regarding specific difficulties associated with learning neuroanatomy has been provided and some of the measures required to address these issues have been identified. Neuroanatomy is perceived as a more difficult subject compared to other anatomy topics (e.g., reproductive/pelvic anatomy) and not all components of the neuroanatomy curriculum are viewed as equally challenging. The difficulty in understanding neuroanatomical concepts is linked to intrinsic factors such as the inherent complex nature of the topic rather than outside influences (e.g., lecture duration). Participants reporting high levels of interest in the subject reported higher levels of knowledge, suggesting that teaching tools aimed at increasing interest, such as case-based scenarios, could facilitate acquisition of knowledge. Newer pedagogies, including web-resources and computer assisted learning (CAL) are considered important tools to improve neuroanatomy learning, whereas traditional tools such as lecture slides and notes were considered less important. In conclusion, it is suggested that understanding of neuroanatomy could be enhanced and neurophobia be decreased by purposefully designed CAL resources. This data could help curricular designers to refocus attention and guide educators to develop improved neuroanatomy web-resources in future.

AB  - The author believes that giving children more control over what, and how, they investigate can really engage and motivate them in science. Holligan suggests that providing creative science investigations can also provide a great basis for developing literacy and numeracy skills. Teachers have to provide lots of opportunity for class discussion, speaking and listening, asking good questions, problem solving, and effective teamwork. This article shows that allowing pupils to design their own science investigations, or giving them more input to the ones already planned, can bring benefits. Examples of topics for pupil-led investigations are provided, along with tips that teachers can use to keep the process "manageable."

AB  - It is shown that, by applying elementary concepts in electromagnetism and electrochemistry to a system consisting of salt water flowing in a thin rectangular pipe at an average velocity v[subscript A] under the influence of a transverse magnetic field B[subscript 0], an electromotive force generator can be conceived. In fact, the Lorentz force acting on the sodium and chlorine ions in a water solution gives rise to a so-called Faraday voltage across the two metal electrodes, positioned at the sides of the pipe. The effect is carried along the following chemical reactions at the electrodes: at the cathode, water is reduced (instead of sodium ions) and hydrogen gas is generated; at the anode, chlorine gas is produced. In college physics teaching, this interdisciplinary subject can be adopted to stress analogies and differences between the Hall voltage in conductors and the Faraday voltage in electrolyte solutions.

AB  - Today's healthcare can be characterised by the increasing importance of specialisation that requires cooperation across disciplines and specialities. In view of the number of educational programmes for interdisciplinary cooperation, surprisingly little is known on how learning arises from interdisciplinary work. In order to analyse the learning and teaching practices of interdisciplinary cooperation, a multiple case study research focused on how consults, i.e., doctor-to-doctor consultations between medical doctors from different disciplines were carried out: semi-structured interviews with doctors of all levels of seniority from two hospital sites in Switzerland were conducted. Starting with a priori constructs based on the "methods" underpinning cognitive apprenticeship (CA), the transcribed interviews were analysed according to the principles of qualitative content analysis. The research contributes to three debates: (1) socio-cognitive and situated learning, (2) intra- and interdisciplinary learning in clinical settings, and (3), more generally, to cooperation and problem solving. Patient cases, which necessitate the cooperation of doctors in consults across boundaries of clinical specialisms, trigger intra- as well as interdisciplinary learning and offer numerous and varied opportunities for learning by requesting doctors as well as for on-call doctors, in particular those in residence. The relevance of consults for learning can also be verified from the perspective of CA which is commonly used by experts, albeit in varying forms, degrees of frequency and quality, and valued by learners. Through data analysis a model for collaborative problem-solving and help-seeking was developed which shows the interplay of pedagogical "methods" of CA in informal clinical learning contexts.

AB  - The focus of this Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) project was on RNA secondary structure prediction by using a lattice walk approach. The lattice walk approach is a combinatorial and computational biology method used to enumerate possible secondary structures and predict RNA secondary structure from RNA sequences. The method uses discrete mathematical techniques and identifies specified base pairs as parameters. The goal of the REU was to introduce upper-level undergraduate students to the principles and challenges of interdisciplinary research in molecular biology and discrete mathematics. At the beginning of the project, students from the biology and mathematics departments of a mid-sized university received instruction on the role of secondary structure in the function of eukaryotic RNAs and RNA viruses, RNA related to combinatorics, and the National Center for Biotechnology Information resources. The student research projects focused on RNA secondary structure prediction on a regulatory region of the yellow fever virus RNA genome and on an untranslated region of an mRNA of a gene associated with the neurological disorder epilepsy. At the end of the project, the REU students gave poster and oral presentations, and they submitted written final project reports to the program director. The outcome of the REU was that the students gained transferable knowledge and skills in bioinformatics and an awareness of the applications of discrete mathematics to biological research problems.

AB  - As the community of Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) scholars has flourished across Canada and around the world, there has been a growing sense among humanists that SoTL work has been dominated by the epistemologies, philosophies, and research methods of the social sciences. This is a view that has been supported by SoTL journal editors and resources dedicated to introducing faculty to SoTL. To quote Nancy Chick (2012) in a recent book on the current state of SoTL in the disciplines, "while many well-known SoTL leaders come from humanities backgrounds …, the on-the-ground work largely marginalizes the practices of their disciplines" (p. 15). The question then follows: "How does the apparent under-representation of (arts and) humanities-based disciplines affect expectations for SoTL, from norms for research design and methodology to the genre and style of its products?" (McKinney & Chick, 2010, p. 10). This paper, which frames the special issue looking at "SoTL through the lenses of the Arts and Humanities," explores the difficulties with, and opportunities provided by, creating an inclusive teaching commons where the scholarly traditions of the arts and humanities are recognized for the value they bring to the SoTL research imaginary.

AB  - Difficulties in teaching a multi-disciplinary subject such as the mechatronics system design module in Departments of Mechatronics Engineering at Temasek Polytechnic arise from the gap in experience and skill among staff and students who have different backgrounds in mechanical, computer and electrical engineering within the Mechatronics Department. The departments piloted a new vertical stream curricula model (VSCAM) to enhance student learning in mechatronics system design through integration of educational activities from the first to the second year of the course. In this case study, a problem-based learning (PBL) method on an autonomous vacuum robot in the mechatronics systems design module was proposed to allow the students to have hands-on experience in the mechatronics system design. The proposed works included in PBL consist of seminar sessions, weekly works and project presentation to provide holistic assessment on teamwork and individual contributions. At the end of VSCAM, an integrative evaluation was conducted using confidence logs, attitude surveys and questionnaires. It was found that the activities were quite appreciated by the participating staff and students. Hence, PBL has served as an effective pedagogical framework for teaching multidisciplinary subjects in mechatronics engineering education if adequate guidance and support are given to staff and students.

AB  - Saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR has emerged as one of the most popular ligand-based NMR techniques for the study of protein-ligand interactions. The success of this technique is a consequence of its robustness and the fact that it is focused on the signals of the ligand, without any need of processing NMR information about the receptor and only using small quantities of nonlabeled macromolecule. Moreover, the attractiveness of this experiment is also extendable to the classroom. In the context of a practical NMR class, this experiment is ideal to illustrate some fundamental NMR concepts, such as the nuclear Overhauser effect and relaxation in a multidisciplinary context, bridging chemistry and biochemistry with a taste of medicinal chemistry. We use the readily available human serum albumin (HSA), 6-d,l-methyl-tryptophan (6-CH[subscript 3-Trp), and 7- d,l-methyl-tryptophan (7-CH[subscript 3]-Trp) to introduce the STD-NMR experiment and to illustrate its applicability for ligand screening, mapping of binding moieties, and determination of the dissociation constant, in a context that can be explored or adapted to the student's course level and topic (chemistry or biochemistry). We also cover the most important theoretical aspects of the STD experiment, calling attention to some of its limitations and drawbacks without a complex theoretical approach. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - Medicine is increasingly focused on team-based practice as interprofessional cooperation leads to better patient care. Thus, it is necessary to teach teamwork and collaboration with other health care professionals in undergraduate medical education to ensure that trainees entering the workforce are prepared to work in teams. Gross anatomy provides an opportunity to expose students to interprofessional education (IPE) early in their training. The purpose of this study is to describe an IPE experience and report if the experience has lasting influence on the participating students. The Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) questionnaire was administered to first year medical (MD) and physical therapy (PT) students at Mayo Medical School and Mayo School of Health Sciences. Results demonstrated an openness on the part of the students to IPE. Interprofessional education experiences were incorporated into gross anatomy courses in both medical and PT curricula. The IPE experiences included a social event, peer-teaching, and collaborative clinical problem-solving sessions. These sessions enhanced gross anatomy education by reinforcing previous material and providing the opportunity to work on clinical cases from the perspective of two healthcare disciplines. After course completion, students again completed the RIPLS. Finally, one year after course completion, students were asked to provide feedback on their experience. The post-curricular RIPLS, similar to the pre-curricular RIPLS, illustrated openness to IPE from both MD and PT students. There were however, significant differences in MD and PT perceptions of roles and responsibilities. One-year follow-up indicated long-term retention of lessons learned during IPE.

AB  - The notion of risk in relation to food and food production has heightened the need to educate students to effectively deal with risk in relation to decision making from a science-based perspective. Curricula and related materials were developed and adopted to support graduate learning opportunities in risk analysis and decision making as applied in agriculture, veterinary medicine, and the life sciences. Student and instructor interviews, course evaluations, and expert reviews of course syllabi and the program description were used to determine the value of formalizing this interdisciplinary graduate minor/certificate program. The quality of the three graduate level core courses developed and delivered exhibited the merit of the program but a major challenge remains with regard to long-term sustainability of this specialized training.

AB  - From a Cartesian perspective of rational analysis, the electric potential difference across the cell membrane is one of the fundamental concepts for the study of physiology. Unfortunately, undergraduate students often struggle to understand the genesis of this energy gradient, which makes the teaching activity a hard task for the instructor. The topic of bioelectrogenesis encompasses multidisciplinary concepts, involves several mechanisms, and is a dynamic process, i.e., it never turns off during the lifetime of the cell. Therefore, to improve the transmission and acquisition of knowledge in this field, I present an alternative didactic model. The design of the model assumes that it is possible to build, in a series of sequential steps, an assembly of proteins within the membrane of an isolated cell in a simulated electrophysiology experiment. Initially, no proteins are inserted in the membrane and the cell is at a baseline energy state; the extracellular and intracellular fluids are at thermodynamic equilibrium. Students are guided through a sequence of four steps that add key membrane transport proteins to the model cell. The model is simple at the start and becomes progressively more complex, finally producing transmembrane chemical and electrical gradients. I believe that this didactic approach helps instructors with a more efficient tool for the teaching of the mechanisms of resting membrane potential while helping students avoid common difficulties that may be encountered when learning this topic.

AB  - E-Learning is becoming an integral part of undergraduate medicine, with many curricula incorporating a number of online activities and resources, in addition to more traditional teaching methods. This study examines physical attendance, online activity, and examination outcomes in a first-year undergraduate medical program. All 358 students who completed the Alimentary System module within the first semester of the program were included, 30 of whom were repeating the year, and thus the module. This systems-based, multidisciplinary module incorporated didactic lectures, cadaveric small group tutorials and additional e-Learning resources such as online histology tutorials. Significant differences were demonstrated in physical attendance and utilization of online resources between repeating students and those participating in the module for the first time. Subsequent analyses confirmed that physical attendance, access of online lecture resources, and utilization of online histology tutorials were all significantly correlated. In addition, both physical attendance and utilization of online resources significantly correlated with summative examination performance. While nonattendance may be due to a variety of factors, our data confirm that significant differences exist in both physical attendance and online activity between new entrants and repeating students, such that all students repeating a module or academic year should be routinely interviewed and offered appropriate supports to ensure that they continue to engage with the program. While the development of complex algorithmic models may be resource intensive, using readily available indices from virtual learning environments is a straightforward, albeit less powerful, means to identify struggling students prior to summative examinations.

AB  - We conducted research within a program serving future mathematics and science teachers. Groups of teachers worked primarily online in an asynchronous discussion environment on a 6-week task in which they applied learning-science ideas acquired from an educational psychology course to design interdisciplinary instructional units. We employed an adapted coding system to determine that group leadership was highly distributed among participants. We illustrated that leadership emerged through different forms of participation described in this paper and that, in some cases, individuals specialized in specific leadership roles within groups. Findings helped validate the theoretical concept of group cognition and led us to suggest an approach to online asynchronous learning for college students that depends more on students' emergent leadership skills than on prescriptive assignment or scripting of participant roles.

AB  - This article presents an interview with H. Craig Heller, a professor of Biological Sciences (in Humanities and Sciences) at Stanford University. In this interview, Heller talks about an interesting course he has taught at Stanford called "Exercise Physiology" and what he likes about it. What is unique about this course is that in laboratory, the students do experiments  on each other.  Heller describes a human biology outreach program for middle school grades that he developed, explains the structure of the interdisciplinary human biology program which he is involved in, and comments on writing and updating his popular textbook, "Life: The Science of Biology."

AB  - The ethnography presented by van Eijck and Roth focuses on the activities of people involved in a government funded internship program in conservation and restoration, which was offered by a "multidisciplinary research center" through a local First Nation adult education center. The internship was designed, in partnership with a local non-profit conservation society (OceanHealth), to appeal to First Nation men and women considering career change, returning to school, or re-entering the work place. The primary aim of the internship was to "provide authentic science for diverse student populations (and their teachers), with particular attention to the needs of students from First Nations, to become scientifically literate to the extent that it prepares them for participating in public debates, community decision-making, and personal living consistent with long-term environmentally sustainable forms of life". The authors report that at least one of the two interns was not interested in science and a WSANEC elder expressed dissatisfaction with the efforts to establish the nature park and its current approved uses. Van Eijck and Roth argue that the divergence between the project aims and the goals of the participants are a result of how "place" is viewed in place-based education and that disagreements like these can be resolved if place is theorized as chronotope. There are many interesting ideas raised and directions taken in the article by van Eijck and Roth. After several discussions during the review process, we decided to focus our forum response on the meaning of "place" in place-based education, the utility of theorizing place as a chronotope, the implications for teaching-learning ("education"), and musings on what remains unclear.

AB  - This paper is intended to stimulate discussion and recommendations related to science and technology education and its role in sustainable development. It puts forward points of view and addresses concerns in science education. The paper recognizes that all in not well within science and technology education and that there are concerns related to its vision, its philosophy, its research, its approach, its way of meeting needs, its expected outcomes and most definitely in the manner in which it is taught. This paper recognises that science and technology education must do more than simply pay "lip service" to sustainable development and must focus learning on issues of relevance facing society. It is simply not enough to apply scientific ideas to technological application. The education context must provide the frame for learning. As this is heavily interdisciplinary and related to values, so must be science education. This in turn suggests there is a need to re-examine the goals of education and with this the goals of science education. It is suggested that education for sustainable development has little to do with accumulating a body of scientific knowledge and is far more aligned with the development of personal and social aptitudes leading to responsible citizenship.

AB  - Maybe it's the peculiar way they walk or their cute little suits, but students of all ages are drawn to penguins. To meet younger students' curiosity, the authors adapted a middle-school level, penguin-themed curriculum unit called Save the Penguins (Schnittka, Bell, and Richards 2010) for third-grade students. The students loved learning about penguins that live all over the world and in various climates. This three-day interdisciplinary science unit allows students to explore their own ideas about penguins, temperature, and heat. The students even used engineering to design miniature dwellings to protect models of South African penguins from climate change and attacks by gulls. Specifically, the objectives of the unit are for students to (1) describe where penguins live, some features of warm and cold climate penguins, and the climate issue affecting penguin populations; (2) compare the temperatures for each given sample of material and describe which materials prevent heat transfer the best; (3) construct a small shelter for a penguin-shaped ice cube so that at least half the penguin mass remains after being placed in a thermal oven for 20 minutes; and (4) describe that heat travels more slowly through some materials than others and that light is reflected by some colors and absorbed by others to make the material hot. The authors used the 5E Learning Cycle model (BSCS 1989) to achieve these objectives because it is a proven method of teaching science. (Contains 3 figures, 2 resources and 5 online resources.)

AB  - The University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) General Education "Clusters" are innovations in student-centered undergraduate education focused on complex phenomena that require an interdisciplinary perspective. UCLA gerontology and geriatric faculty recognized the opportunity to introduce freshmen to the field of aging through this new initiative. In 2000, with support of the College of Letters and Science, the School of Medicine Multicampus Program in Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology created "Frontiers in Human Aging: Biomedical, Social and Policy Perspectives." The active and cooperative student-centered teaching of aging that is integral to this course has successfully contributed to the development of intellectual skills needed for academic and life success in over 1,200 freshman honors students.

AB  - The article studies theoretical issues of modern anthropocentric paradigm of scientific knowledge from the history of anthropocentric linguistics development as a special field of language science. The purpose of this study is to answer the question about human influence on the semiotic system. The material result is the unification of specific approaches to anthropological linguistics subject. Therefore, approach based on linguistics solved the problem of establishment of the human's linguistic nature, his language world. Conversely, the anthropocentric approach is focused on the person as a subject of speech activity that implements his communicative intentions in certain speech acts oriented to the world of semantics and mental human activities. Offered situations are examined on the actual material of the Russian language, which was analyzed from the standpoint of cognitive semantics. The problematics of anthropological linguistics, therefore, is not new and there are no sufficient grounds to consider it firmly established and generally accepted direction; only obvious trends are outlined, therefore it is better to talk about it as a linguistic paradigm having its own background in linguistics and closely related to other related sciences' issues.

AB  - Mobilizing scientific knowledge for understanding the natural world and for critically appraise socio-scientific situations and make decisions are key competencies for today's' society. Therefore, it is essential to understand how students at the end of compulsory schooling use scientific knowledge for understanding the surrounding world. The objective of this study is to understand how students construct a scientifically oriented explanation while making sense of a phenomenon related to health. We analysed 526 answers to a question of a Portuguese national 9th grade science exam. The results reveal that most students present difficulties in explaining a phenomenon related to health supported by logical and clear reasoning, and in mobilizing scientific knowledge for connecting different scientific domains. We reaffirm the need to reconceptualize the role of health education within science education. Developing reading, writing and discussion activities related to health, which requires the use of scientific knowledge from different domains, would facilitate students' understanding and appropriation of scientific knowledge and its transference. This is a fundamental competence for promoting active and informed citizenship.

AB  - A piece of children's literature can be a powerful tool for teaching and learning science; however, it takes more than reading about a topic to qualify as "doing science." Inspired by the book, "The Gift of the Tree", the author developed an in-depth interdisciplinary lesson for her sixth-grade students without diluting the science. Through this lesson, students read and experience the concepts in the story in two ways--through a macro lens to see how these plants and animals are interconnected, and through a micro lens to learn specific hands-on science skills, such as making inexpensive nonglass slides, looking through the microscope, and observing and recording parts of the tree and other plants.

AB  - In this paper we describe an interdisciplinary course on dynamics that is appropriate for nonscience majors. This course introduces ideas about mathematical modeling using examples based on pendulums, chemical kinetics, and population dynamics. The unique emphasis for a nonmajors course is on chemical reactions as dynamical systems that do more than simply come to equilibrium. By presenting chemical systems that can undergo either periodic or chaotic behavior we provide the basis for understanding how chemistry can underlie complex natural systems. By describing these systems in the common language of dynamics in an interdisciplinary setting, we acquaint students with the motivations and methodologies behind the more mathematical aspects of chemistry. Students learn about the nature of measurement and prediction through the use of spreadsheet software for solution of equations and experimental data collection. (Contains 1 textbox and 3 lists.)

The four works of art discussed are examples that can be linked visually and conceptually to physics properties in mathematics, space, energy, and light. The discussion questions are designed for grades 8 through 10. Art teachers are urged to share this article with science teachers; team teaching with a science teacher would be especially appropriate.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the application of cognitive neuroscience in educational thinking and practice, and here we review findings from neuroscience that demonstrate its potential relevance to technology-enhanced learning (TEL). First, we identify some of the issues in integrating neuroscientific concepts into TEL research. We caution against seeking prescriptive neuroscience solutions for TEL and emphasize the need, instead, to conceptualize TEL at several different levels of analysis (brain, mind and behaviour, including social behaviour). Our review emphasizes the possibility of combining TEL and neuroscience concepts in adaptive educational systems, and we consider instances of interdisciplinary technology-based interventions drawing on neuroscience and aimed at remediating developmental disorders. We also consider the potential relevance of findings from neuroscience for the development of artificial agency, creativity, collaborative learning and neural insights into how different types of multimodality may influence learning, which may have implications for the future developments of tangibles. Finally, we identify a range of reasons why dialogue between neuroscience and the communities involved with technology and learning is likely to increase in the future.

AB  - Historically, biology has not been a heavily quantitative science, but this is changing rapidly (Ewing 2002; Gross 2000; Hastings and palmer 2003; Jungck 2005; Steen 2005). Quantitative approaches now constitute a key tool for modern biologists, yet undergraduate biology courses remain largely qualitative and descriptive. Although biology majors are often required to take a full year of calculus, these courses generally use examples unrelated to biology (Gross 1994) and ignore fields of mathematics that may be more relevant to biology, such as liner algebra or theoretical probability and statistics (NRC 2003). In this series of interactive, web-based modules, students are introduced to the mathematical underpinnings of introductory biology in an informal but powerful way.

AB  - The study of astronomy, as an important part of any science education programme, provides our students with insights into more than just the cosmos. It may also serve as a mechanism to link them to other natural and social sciences. This article examines equally valid interpretations of the constellation Canes Venatici as an example of how the study of astronomy may serve this multidisciplinary educational role. In addition, it is an extension of the thoughts of Stannard (2001) on communicating physics through story. (Contains 4 figures and 13 footnotes.)

AB  - Pairing an inquiry lesson with a traditional reading activity creates a jarring philosophical mismatch between the interaction, deep thinking, and scientific reasoning that drives meaningful inquiry instruction and the "scan the text, copy the answers" response often obtained from elementary nonfiction readers. Realizing that there must be a better approach, the author recently made it his quest to seek and adapt reading activities that more closely match the spirit of science inquiry instruction. Based on his search, the author presents a pair of fifth-grade activities: an inquiry science activity and an active reading activity. In the science activity, students use straws and marbles to conduct hands-on investigations of force and two-dimensional motion. In the reading activity that immediately follows, the students solidify their understanding of the inquiry lesson's underlying concepts as they collaboratively analyze a text that contains words that have been blacked out.

AB  - Problem Statement: Design, which is a process of creating, supports individuals' pursuit, experience and discovery, and contributes to the improvement of higher-order thinking skills. A systematic design education offered in the early years of life boosts especially creative thinking and problem solving skills as well as awareness of the environment and nature. Such education programs have been implemented continuously in Europe and America. However, in Turkey, there is no design education for children. Purpose of the Study: This research aims to adapt into Turkish culture the Architectural Design Education Program for American preschool and primary school children aged 6-11 and to analyze its effectiveness in improving the design skills of Turkish children. The effectiveness of the program is examined within the sub-question if there are any statistically significant differences between the experimental groups instructed by adapted program and the control groups instructed by conventional activities in the concept of design skills exhibited through performancebased assessments particular to each instructional session. Method: The Architectural Design Education Program was adapted into the Turkish culture through studies carried out with expert groups. In the academic year 2011-2012, 177 children were given this education program in a primary school in Ankara. These students constituted six experimental groups that represented all levels of grade/age (i.e. preschool and primary education from 1st to 5th year students/aged 6-11). On the other hand, a total of 167 children in six control groups received a program consisting of conventional activities. Analytic rubrics were used to assess, at the end of each instructional session, the products designed by children in line with performance tasks. With a view to comparing the design skills of children in different programs, Mann Whitney U-test for independent samples was used for analysis. Findings: The analyses show that there are significant differences in the development of design skills between the experimental groups and the control groups at all levels of grade/age, and that the difference was in favor of the experimental groups. Conclusion and Recommendations: The results show that all instructional activities carried out within the scope of the Architectural Design Education Program are effective in social, emotional and cognitive development of children aged six to 11, improving their higher-order thinking processes based on design skills. It is recommended that this interdisciplinary program, making use of mathematics, history, science and arts, should be integrated with basic areas of instruction in education programs so that its effectiveness can be enhanced.

AB  - The article investigates the status of geography education in the Finnish national curricula from the 1970s until today. Conceptions of teaching, learning and change in society are traced through curriculum texts; in addition, the ways in which these are applied in the subject-specified aims and content of the geography curriculum are explored. This is done in the context of the success story of the Finnish education system. The analysis shows how constructivist ideas of learning have been implemented in the curriculum, but are not necessarily seen in the students' learning outcomes. Changes in society have been reflected in the underlying values and cross-disciplinary themes defined in the curricula, although their application in geography has been relatively weak. The content of the geography curriculum has remained strongly connected to the tradition of teaching regional geography, while the close linkage between geography and biology has guaranteed a stronger position for physical rather than cultural geography. Some contemporary changes, in information and communications technology (ICT) and geographic information systems (GIS) in particular, have quickly been implemented in the geography curriculum, while some themes--for example, those emphasizing students' everyday experiences--have remained marginal.

AB  - This case investigation followed the progress of middle students with disabilities, their peers, and teachers in co-taught science classrooms where a hands-on, inquiry-based curriculum was used. Students with disabilities (n=21), including learning disabilities, mild intellectual impairment, and mild autism were placed in co-taught classes with students without disabilities (n= 41). Science and special educators (n=5) received professional development on implementing co-teaching and inclusive strategies along with time for co-planning and support during the school year. Data collection included pre and posttest administrations of the science subtest of the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS), classroom observations, and teacher interviews. Analysis of pre and posttest scores on the ITBS indicated significant increases in science achievement for students with and without disabilities. Classroom observations indicated a high level of student-to-student interaction and engagement with teachers and the curriculum and the application of whole-class and individual adaptations to improve learning and behavior. Teachers viewed co-teaching as a valuable method of service delivery for students with disabilities who might otherwise be served in more restrictive settings. Findings were explored in terms of the relationship between co-teaching variables and the curricular and instructional features of the inquiry-based program. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - This project served as a capstone event for the United States Military Academy sophomore Calculus II course. This multi-disciplinary problem-solving exercise motivated the link between math and biology and many other fields of study. The seven-lesson block of instruction was developed to show students how mathematics play a role in every discipline. Of the seven lessons two were specifically designed to connect the students area of study to the mathematical model in the scenario. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - Citation analysis of dissertations was used to explore the interdisciplinary nature of education graduate students' research. A sample of curriculum and instruction dissertations, and their bibliographies we studied using citation analysis methods and analysis of "Digital Dissertation" records. Research methodologies were also explored. Rather than crossing broad disciplinary boundaries, interdisciplinary work for these students occurred at the level of specific fields of study within curriculum and instruction, and at times education subdisciplines. Questions are raised about the nature of interdisciplinarity in graduate student work. As faculty research and academic structures continues to evolve, graduate student work also may change.

AB  - In an online graduate paleontology course taken by practicing Earth Science teachers, we designed an investigation using teachers' local informal educational environments. Teachers (N = 28) were responsible for photographing, describing, and integrating fossil specimens from two informal sites into a paleoenvironmental analysis of the landscape in which the fossils were originally deposited. Our practicing teachers also developed mini-units for their individual classrooms, utilizing the fossils and the informal sites they investigated. Not only did teachers develop a multitude of innovative and effective activities, but they were overwhelmingly enthusiastic about incorporating aspects of local informal sites within their individual classrooms. Content analysis of teachers' anonymous responses revealed three stable findings: 1) The informal sites and local fossils affirmed the importance of the local environment and put it into a larger context, 2) directed student activities within informal sites can maximize learning, and 3) informal sites provide a context for information and can supply an interdisciplinary "big picture" for students. We propose that directed interdisciplinary investigations that incorporate the local environment may enhance science learning at informal education sites. (Contains 4 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - In this article I explain why I wrote the set of teaching notes on Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) and why they look the way they do. The notes were intended as a student reference to question, highlight and write over as much as they wish during an initial practical demonstration of the threshold concept being introduced, in this case inferring the existence of quantized electron energy levels in atoms from class room observations. That is why the notes commence with an overview of how a handheld spectroscope works followed by how they are used for analysing emission spectroscopy observations. The notes decode the noun phrase "Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy" into its individual sequenced components by defining Light Spectra [right arrow] Spectroscopy [right arrow] Emission Spectroscopy [right arrow] Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (AES) [right arrow] Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. There is every expectation that the teacher delivering this introduction has provided a class set of hand held spectroscopes to the students and a variety of demonstration emission sources such as hollow cathode lamps for mono atomic helium and neon plus a sodium vapour lamp. This concrete experience can now be developed into abstract knowledge and analytical applications in line with the South Australian Stage 2 Chemistry Curriculum Statement (CS) requiring students to understand the principles of AES and AAS. It is also an explicit departure from the more traditional secondary school method of presenting electron energy levels in atoms as a form of ritualized knowledge. The teaching notes that follow show how practical inquiry in the secondary school class room can remain the foundation of scientific method and learning with even the most troublesome of knowledge, such as electron energy levels in atoms.

AB  - With funding from the UK's Royal Academy of Engineering, the University of Edinburgh has developed a series of truly interdisciplinary design courses aimed at improving penultimate-year students' ability to operate across disciplines and improve their preparation for industry. Led by a Visiting Industrial Professor, the course on hydropower design requires students to provide a full feasibility study of a small scheme in western Scotland tackling issues from hydrology through to grid connection. The course has had several very successful outcomes which include: appreciation of other engineering disciplines; experience of teams where different skills and expertise are available; demonstration of the links between engineering design and economic viability; introduction to non-technical areas essential to the UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence; and enhancing interest in the hydropower sector in technological and career terms. The key message from this project is the need to ensure balance across tasks, within groups and staff support across disciplines. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Problem-based learning (PBL) is a constructivist method of instruction aligned with the science educational reform movement to increase scientific literacy for all Americans. As such, PBL instruction is an increasingly popular topic for professional development workshops offered to teachers in secondary learning environments. This research presents a case study of four teachers' alignment of classroom practice with constructivist principles after participating in a one-week PBL workshop. Teachers assimilated PBL instruction into their current system of teaching; therefore, despite congruent beliefs, those teachers without a constructivist system of practice taught the PBL method with less alignment to constructivist principles. This discrepancy between beliefs and practice could be addressed by helping PBL workshop participants contemplate how components of PBL encourage reform-based constructivist practices and by assisting teachers with modifying preexisting routines to better assimilate PBL instruction.

AB  - The freshman research paper can be a labor for both the teacher and the student with its many layers of skills and expectations. While academia has moved beyond note cards and simplified documentation models, students continue to get lost in the research process, often to the point that instructors may even wonder if they had been teaching in an alternate reality once they begin grading the finished products. As a dual enrollment instructor for Virginia Western Community College (VWCC) and Botetourt County Public Schools for the past eight years, the author has struggled to make the research process more appealing to her students so that their investment in their final papers is greater and yields more success. Typically educators see the research process as an individual and isolating experience where no one shares ideas or sources to avoid plagiarism. The truth is that students freely share ideas and sources and have become adept at hiding their collaboration from instructors. An interdisciplinary English composition/political science course used inquiry-based learning, technology, collaboration, and a real-world problem to engage students in a memorable project. The author reports that this approach reduces plagiarism, increases the students' research and writing skills as well as their interest, and decreases her workload.

AB  - Emissions reductions targets for the UK set out in the Climate Change Act for the period to 2050 will only be achieved with significant changes to the built environment, which is currently estimated to account for 50% of the UK's carbon emissions. The socio-technological nature of Civil Engineering means that this field is uniquely placed to lead the UK through such adaptations. This paper discusses the importance of interdisciplinary teaching to produce multi-faceted team approaches to sustainable design solutions. Methods for measuring success in education are often not fit for purpose, producing good students but poor engineers. Real-world failures to apply sustainable design present a serious, difficult to detect, and ultimately economically negative situation. Techniques to replace summative examinations are presented and discussed, with the aim of enhancing core technical skills alongside those required for sustainable design. Finally, the role of our future engineers in policy-making is discussed. In addition to carbon, the provision of water and food will heavily influence the work of civil engineers in the coming decades. Leadership from civil engineers with the technical knowledge and social awareness to tackle these issues will be required. This provides both opportunities and challenges for engineering education in the UK.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the inclusion of bioinformatics in program curricula in the Middle East, focusing on educational institutions in the Arabian Gulf. Bioinformatics is a multidisciplinary field which has emerged in response to the need for efficient data storage and retrieval, and accurate and fast computational and statistical methods to handle huge amounts of biological data. Bioinformatics is an important field and has great impact on advances in biological, medical, and pharmaceutical research. Although, several worldwide universities have already implemented bioinformatics in their undergraduate and postgraduate programs for more than a decade, the results of our investigation show that very few educational institutions (less than 1%) have recently implemented bioinformatics in their undergraduate programs. Therefore, it is important to promote this field in the region and to include it in undergraduate program curricula, and thereby introducing students to bioinformatics tools for solving biological problems, preparing them for future careers taking into account job market trends, and preparing students who wish to pursue research career to make significant contribution to the field.

AB  - The aim of this research is to develop principles for a pedagogy of risk in socio-scientific issues. Risk is challenging to teach because of its contested conceptual basis incorporating epistemic and non-epistemic values, its situated nature and its mathematical basis in probability and statistics. In our project--"Promoting Teachers' Understanding of Risk in Socio-scientific Issues" (TURS)--we have built a set of mature software tools designed through an epistemological analysis of risk and consideration of teaching and learning, as reflected in discussions with teachers. This software provides teachers with tools that enable them to express what they see as the significant issues, giving feedback for them to re-draft their models in the light of the consequences of their decisions. Pairs of science and mathematics teachers have modelled a scenario based on personal decision-making for a surgical intervention. Inductive analysis of teacher dialogue has generated four key findings: teaching risk lends itself to a multi-disciplinary approach; recognition of the multi-dimensional nature of risk can be elicited through engagement with contextualised biological dilemmas; use of executable models promotes discussion of the complexity of risk, and expressive tools can be designed which support coordinated analysis of the multi-dimensional nature of risk.

AB  - Developing and applying oral and written communication skills in the undergraduate computer science and computer information systems curriculum--one of the ABET accreditation requirements - is a very challenging and, at the same time, a rewarding task that provides various opportunities to enrich the undergraduate computer science and computer information systems curriculum. We discuss a comprehensive three-step program developed at our institution that provides opportunities to efficiently develop oral and written communication skills. We present our successful experience of integrating a project component into a core introductory course designed to focus on developing these skills. We discuss and present the results of interdisciplinary collaborations between Computer Science and English faculty members to achieve the goals of the project. We also discuss a Senior Design Project course sequence and a Research Topics in Computer Science course, and the opportunities that these courses provide to develop oral and written communication skills.

AB  - Educational neuroscience promises to incorporate emerging insights from neuroscience into education, and is an exiting renovation of cognitive science in education. But unlike cognitive neuroscience--which aims to explain how the mind is embodied--educational neuroscience necessarily incorporates values that reflect the kind of citizen and the kind of society we aspire to create. Neuroscience can help fulfill the mandate of public education, but only as a tool that is part of a broader conversation about what schools should strive to achieve for the millions of students who attend them. I propose that educational neuroscience must advance our understanding of how knowledge is embodied in light of efforts to promote personal learning and development.

AB  - Collaborative research is a demanding endeavor, and for a group of undergraduate students tasked with identifying their own interdisciplinary research problem, the challenges are even greater. "It was scary--we didn't know what to ask the professors, and we couldn't decide on a research question," says Miran Park, a student at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis), about her first quarter there in the Collaborative Learning at the Interface of Mathematics and Biology (CLIMB) program. The CLIMB program abandons the traditional apprentice model for research experiences, says Rick Grosberg, its principal investigator and an evolutionary ecologist. Unlike many undergraduate research experiences, CLIMB does not assign a project or enlist students in current faculty research. Each year a cohort of biology and math majors in their junior or senior year becomes part of an interdisciplinary collaborative team that uses "mathematics and computation to answer state-of-the-art questions in biology."

AB  - This study aims to analyse the views of elementary school students on active learning integrated with art branches in core courses (Turkish, mathematics, science and social studies). The research was conducted in the province of Bursa during the academic year 2015-2016, and the study sample comprised of 22 students, including 15 male and 7 female students. The core courses of elementary school were taught using active learning techniques, and the subjects taught during the lessons were evaluated through art branches. The research data obtained through observation and by means of an interview form were analysed and interpreted by descriptive analysis method. The frequencies and percentages of the data obtained using qualitative analysis were calculated. Through active learning approaches, the students learnt better and in a more enjoyable way, their self-esteem also increased. Thus, the elementary school students had positive views on active learning integrated with art branches in core courses.

AB  - Argumentation has become an increasingly recognized focus for science instruction--as a learning process, as an outcome associated with the appropriation of scientific discourse, and as a window onto the epistemic work of science. Only a small set of theoretical conceptualizations of argumentation have been deployed and investigated in science education, however, while a plethora of conceptualizations have been developed in  the interdisciplinary fields associated with science studies and the learning sciences. This  paper attempts to review a range of such theoretical conceptualizations of argumentation  and discuss the possible implications for the orchestration of science education; the goal  being that the science education research community might consider a broader range of  argumentation forms and roles in conjunction with the learning of science.

AB  - This study investigates the process of identifying high-quality lessons for gifted learners that integrate the arts with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. These STEAM lessons have the potential to develop deep thinking, as well as develop creativity and visual--spatial skills that are necessary in the STEM disciplines. Lessons were solicited from teachers through their involvement in national organizations, and 61 lessons were analyzed and reviewed by experts in the arts and STEM fields, as well as master teachers. High-quality lessons provided deep content knowledge in both STEM and arts fields, connections across content areas, specific criteria for assessment, and collaborations between teachers and between students. The findings from this study will be used to further define the evaluation process for STEAM lessons designed for gifted learners and to develop professional development opportunities for teachers of the gifted.

AB  - In view of the complex problems of this age, the question of the socio-ethical dimension of science acquires particular importance. We approach this matter from a philosophical and sociological standpoint, looking at such focal concerns as the motivation, purposes and methods of scientific activity, the ambivalence of scientific research and the concomitant risks, and the conflict between research freedom and external socio-political intervention. We then point out the impediments to the effectiveness of cross-disciplinary or broader meetings for addressing these complex problems and managing the associated risks, given the difficulty in communication between experts in different fields and non-experts, difficulties that education is challenged to help resolve. We find that the social necessity of informed decision-making on the basis of cross-disciplinary collaboration is reflected in the newer curricula, such as that of Greece, in aims like the acquisition of cross-subject knowledge and skills, and the ability to make decisions on controversial issues involving value conflicts. The interest and the reflections of the science education community in these matters increase its--traditionally limited--contribution to the theoretical debate on education and, by extension, the value of science education in the education system.

AB  - Teaching is acknowledged to be complex, multifaceted and dynamic. Curriculum revisions in Scotland, and elsewhere, call for teachers who are adaptable and capable of change. Yet the skills and attributes traditionally valued and acquired by teachers during their education do not necessarily equip them to cope with the shifting landscape of educational change. This article draws on a collaborative review of literature relating to teacher education, undertaken for the Scottish Teachers for a New Era project. It examines the nature of knowledge for teaching generally and in relation to science education in particular to discuss contested aspects and to develop a conceptual framework for future research and development in this area. The main argument for this study is that a reformulation of teacher education is required. This involves changing the way teachers are educated within an accompanying shift in epistemology and a move to interdisciplinarity. It calls for a more egalitarian way of learning as a means to facilitate change within schools for the creation of a more equal and just society.

AB  - The increasingly interdisciplinary nature of today's scientific research is leading to the transformation of undergraduate education. In addressing these needs, the University of Houston's College of Technology has developed a new interdisciplinary research-based biotechnology laboratory curriculum. Using the pesticide degrading bacterium, "Brevundimonas diminuta," as an anchor organism, the curriculum follows a logical progression starting with isolation and identification of pesticide degrading soil microbes, gene cloning, gene expression, bioprocessing of the gene product and commercial applications, thus demonstrating the life cycle of a typical biotechnology product. These series of laboratory protocols use a guided inquiry method to teach appropriate techniques and skills and help students build a bridge between materials presented in courses and applications in real life. Students then apply these concepts and techniques in independently designed investigations. The modular nature of this curriculum makes it flexible for integration into a variety of courses and could serve as a model for interdisciplinary education.

AB  - Science education is under revision. Recent changes in society require changes in education to respond to new demands. Scientific literacy can be considered a new goal of science education and the epistemological gap between natural sciences and literacy disciplines must be overcome. The history of science is a possible bridge to link these "two cultures" and to foster an interdisciplinary approach in the classroom. This paper acknowledges Darwin's legacy and proposes the use of cartoons and narrative expositions to put this interesting chapter of science into its historical context. A five-lesson didactic sequence was developed to tell part of the story of Darwin's expedition through South America for students from 10 to 12 years of age. Beyond geological and biological perspectives, the inclusion of historical, social and geographical facts demonstrated the beauty and complexity of the findings that Darwin employed to propose the theory of evolution.

AB  - The philosophies and epistemologies that guide the environmental thought of a certain educational community influences its actions in favor of the environment, including the absences of these actions, thus the political-pedagogical propositions that guide the environmental education actions are also strongly affected. In this context, the actions in environmental education in the town of Presidente Kennedy (Brazil) are analyzed as well as the perceptions/actions regarding environment, considering specifically the high school students of the town. The analysis will occur from semi structured interviews with two important professionals that act in the field and also from a questionnaire with open-ended questions applied to a group of second year students. The data were analyzed from Bardin (2010) content analysis. The project indicates that the way of thinking the environment, represented by conservatism, and the traditional perspective of environmental education maintain the actions and can contribute to the maintenance of indifference to the theme that addresses what is broadcasted by the media in a superficial, uncritical and little contextualized way.

AB  - Edgar Allan Poe's standing as a literary figure, who drew on (and sometimes dabbled in) the scientific debates of his time, makes him an intriguing character for any exploration of the historical interrelationship between science, literature and philosophy. His sprawling "prose-poem" "Eureka" (1848), in particular, has sometimes been scrutinized for anticipations of later scientific developments. By contrast, the present paper argues that it should be understood as a contribution to the raging debates about scientific methodology at the time. This methodological interest, which is echoed in Poe's "tales of ratiocination", gives rise to a proposed new mode of--broadly abductive--inference, which Poe attributes to the hybrid figure of the "poet-mathematician". Without creative imagination and intuition, Science would necessarily remain incomplete, "even by its own standards". This concern with imaginative (abductive) inference ties in nicely with his coherentism, which grants pride of place to the twin virtues of Simplicity and Consistency, which must constrain imagination lest it degenerate into mere fancy.

AB  - President Obama's "Educate to Innovate" initiative emphasizes training in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). More recently, arts have been added to STEM, resulting in the acronym STEAM: Science and Technology interpreted through Engineering and the Arts, based in the Mathematical elements. However, should the arts be used only to cultivate better scientists? Or might the arts be valued apart from of their service to math and science?

AB  - Grand Canyon Semesters (GCS) at Northern Arizona University are integrated learning experiences in the humanities and sciences. Students study the environmental and social challenges confronting us in the twenty-first century using an interdisciplinary approach to the curriculum. During previous semesters, participants have tackled complex issues such as how to balance environmental protection of Grand Canyon National Park while still meeting the needs of over five million visitors each year. Past GCS students have also, in an outdoor classroom experience, excavated and stabilized centuries-old cultural sites in the park while learning about the rights of indigenous peoples whose ancestors have lived in the Grand Canyon for thousands of years. This article describes a cultural mapping assignment, brand new to the author and her students, in which they examined and charted water's economic, political, artistic, ecological, social, and spiritual forces in both the classroom and field focusing specifically on the Greater Grand Canyon Region.

AB  - A primary purpose of schooling is to provide opportunities for children to develop positive dispositions about learning and persistence, hone academic content knowledge, and develop skills for applying content in relevant ways. To this end, instruction has focused to a large degree on literacy and math instruction. Social studies, science, and especially the arts are marginalized or removed completely from the instructional day. Concerned about how this narrowed lens may serve to undermine children's experiences and practices within the scope of the "Four Cs" of 21st-century learning--creativity, communication, critical thinking, and collaboration--one school has been exploring how artists are uniquely positioned to foster skills across these areas. At the E11 school in Colorado, artists as teachers are poised to guide learning within the four Cs, applying their background skills and experience in divergent thinking, new idea generation, and synthesis of the new and the existing in ways that are practical and personally meaningful for children. When skilled aesthetic literacy instruction and content learning are integrated across the curriculum, the four Cs are authentically interwoven in applied and experiential ways.

AB  - Background: Under the challenge of many post-modern theories and critics on art and art history, the boundaries and definition of art has becoming more diverse. Conventional art appreciation no longer covers all the debates and issues arising from the complex meaning of art in the modern world. Art education today must widen students' vision of art appreciation. Focus of discussion: The experience central to art appreciation relates one to a broad spectrum of interdisciplinary exposure. This paper aims to elucidate the close relationship between art and other disciplines including aesthetics, anthropology, history, social studies, and even science. It demonstrates how such integrated perspective can be conveyed to the students of different levels. Art appreciation, in many ways, is the study of human behaviours and experience, both past and present. Cross-disciplinary knowledge and comparative studies of various art help understand the meaning of art both in its microscopic and macroscopic levels. Arguments: Conventional art education focuses on the intrinsic values of art, having well defined objects to study for their artistic qualities and theoretical bases. Today, the world of art has lost much of its autonomy. The paper argues that we can take art as a way of seeing and therefore will be better understood by relating art to its social, historical and cultural context. An interdisciplinary approach to art appreciation will widen students' perspective of and sensitivity to the meaning of art, and could be attained by students of different levels. Conclusion: The interdisciplinary vision of art appreciation accords with the vision of Liberal Studies. It enhances students' analytical and critical thinking, broadens their world of ideas, and hones their judgement of cultural products and related issues. (Contains 16 footnotes.)

AB  - This paper theorizes and provides evidence of a "Research Communication Continuum" in which acquisition of skills conducive to communication with broader audiences contributes to greater efficacy in cross-disciplinary discourse and collaboration among scientists and engineers engaged in research; and, vice versa, acquisition of skills conducive to cross-disciplinary discourse and collaboration among scientists and engineers contributes to greater efficacy communicating with broader audiences. At first glance, this may seem a trivial observation; however, as explored here, it could have profound implications for how we conceive and carry out future museum-university partnerships, and it suggests new approaches for improving the productivity of cross-disciplinary research while also enhancing graduate education and facilitating public engagement through a broad range of integrated science communication professional development activities.

AB  - This article explores the development of the UK Government's Sustainable Schools Initiative and examines the contribution that science teaching can make to this. Drawing on recent research in schools and on development work in initial teacher education, the article argues that, in the absence of policy that enables schools to bring subject areas together, schools will have to take responsibility for this themselves. Schools should develop new ways of thinking about the focus and nature of science education, given the scope that this has for helping young people understand their world and what they can contribute to making it more sustainable.

AB  - The research reported here addresses 2 aspects of integrated mathematics and science instruction. First we provide insights into how middle grades teachers' characterize integrated mathematics and science instruction. Then we discuss how middle grades teachers see an integrated curriculum fitting into their teaching contexts and how these contexts reflect various educational reforms, such as "the middle school model," standards-based curriculum and standardized testing. Data were gathered through the use of an open-ended survey and face-to-face interviews with middle grades teachers. Qualitative analysis techniques were used to independently analyze the survey and interview data. The results of the independent analyses were then compared. The research findings suggest that teachers draw upon a teaming model of integration when they are in their teaching contexts, which significantly differs from the models of mathematics and science integration found in the research literature.

AB  - The teaching of the different aspects of a sensor system, with a focus on the involved nanotechnology, is a challenging, yet important task. We present the development of an electronic nose system that utilizes a nanoscale amperometric sensing mechanism for gas mixtures. The fabrication of the system makes use of a basic microfabrication facility, as well as an undergraduate chemistry laboratory for material synthesis and preparation. The sensing device consists of an array of cross-reactive sensors composed of metal-oxide semiconducting nanoparticles. Each sensor in the array produces a unique response in the presence of a target gas, allowing the sensor to determine the identity and concentration of multiple gases in a mixture. The educational aspects include microheater simulation and fabrication, design and fabrication of interdigitated electrodes, development of interfacing circuitry and software, development and calibration of a sensory array, sol-gel processing of nanoparticle films and their characterization, and details of the fundamental chemical sensing mechanism.

AB  - Despite advances to move anatomy education away from its didactic history, there is a continued need for students to contextualize their studies to make learning more meaningful. This article investigates authentic learning in the context of an inquiry-based approach to learning human gross anatomy. Utilizing a case-study design with three groups of students (n = 18) and their facilitators (n = 3), methods of classroom observations, interviews, and artifact collection were utilized to investigate students' experiences of learning through an inquiry project. Qualitative data analysis through open and selective coding produced common meaningful themes of group and student experiences. Overall results demonstrate how the project served as a unique learning experience where learners engaged in the opportunity to make sense of anatomy in context of their interests and wider interdisciplinary considerations through collaborative, group-based investigation. Results were further considered in context of theoretical frameworks of inquiry-based and authentic learning. Results from this study demonstrate how students can engage anatomical understandings to inquire and apply disciplinary considerations to their personal lives and the world around them.

AB  - In Dutch universities, honors programs are a fast growing development. The first such programs started in 1993. Twenty years later a large number of programs are implemented at nearly all research universities and also at many universities of applied sciences in the Netherlands. Recent data have revealed significant diversity in the types and structures of honors programs, many of which have functioned as laboratories of educational innovation within university- wide curricula and had positive spin-off effects on the regular curriculum and also on the transfer of talented students from secondary into higher education. Especially in the last decade, these spin-offs have had a strong influence on educational policy in the Netherlands at the primary and secondary as well as university levels. This article presents an update to the authors' 2004 "Journal of the National Collegiate Honors Council" article describing the increasing number of Dutch universities that had developed honors programs for the more motivated and able students wanting to do more than the regular curriculum offered them (Wolfensberger et al., "Honours Programs"). As a result, talented and motivated students were receiving many new opportunities. The development of honors programs was relevant as an important innovation in higher education with a wide influence on all university programs. Since 2004, this trend has continued to a degree, warranting this update to the authors' earlier findings.

AB  - As part of the celebration of Manchester being the European City of Science 2016, schools across the City were invited to take part in a Citizen-Engineering project, which set out a quest to make a recycled robot orchestra. It is a unique project, which is an experiment itself--to bring people together to create, collaborate and care for the planet. In this article, the authors who are teachers, discuss their experiences with their students creating robots for the orchestra and also analyze the positives and negatives of encouraging students to participate. In conclusion, the authors discuss how they can incorporate engineering into future curriculum.

AB  - Innovations from the United States have often led the world to new discoveries and solutions to complex problems. However, there are alarming indications that the United States is falling behind other countries in the ability to apply science, technology, engineering, and math to complex problems facing our world. In order for the country to maintain its position in global business and as a major innovator, there is a need for educators to rededicate their efforts in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). State College Area School District's Park Forest Middle School organized and implemented the state's first STEM Education interdisciplinary team. This group of science, technology education, and math teachers work in a cross-curricular format to develop engineering projects and events to enlighten their students, parents, and community members about these disciplines. In the fall of 2009, the school's building principal, Dr. Karen Wiser, challenged the faculty to come up with activities to brighten students' afternoons following the Pennsylvania PSSA tests. Within the next few hours, the STEM Education team met and painted the broad strokes of what would become known as the STEM Education Fair. This article presents a narrative of how to organize an event that will capture both the minds and imaginations of students while reaping accolades from administrators and community.

AB  - The STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) movement has developed from a non-educational rationale. Although some think it may enliven the delivery of maths and science in classrooms, the social and economic rationales are those that have initiated this movement. Spurred on by the global financial crisis, it is hoped that coordination and integration of STEM activities will better equip a workforce for dealing with the contemporary nature of business and industry, and encourage more school leavers to seek further training and employment in areas of engineering and science. The problem for educators here is that the consequent absence of a sound educational rationale for this combination of subjects inhibits its development. There needs to be a reason for integrating these subjects which relates to quality learning outcomes for students. Given the developing momentum of the STEM agendas, it may be unwise for technology educators to isolate themselves from this movement. In addition, it may be an opportunity to reinforce the place of Technology Education in the school core curriculum. Rather than integration, a more reasonable approach may be to develop interaction between STEM subjects by fostering cross-curricular links in a context where the integrity of each subject remains respected. However, almost as many impediments remain to interaction as to integration: rigid school timetables and curriculum structures, deficient awareness by teachers of other subject areas, inflexible classroom design, and assessment. With a focus on STEM interaction, driven by teachers, interventions can be developed which will overcome these impediments. A focus on STEM integration will not overcome the barriers, and may result in the decimation of technology as a distinct component of the school core curriculum. A STEM orientation, therefore, must be approached with caution.

AB  - Much like medieval, feudal nations, professional fields such as gifted education can take shape as centralized kingdoms with strong armies controlling their compliant populations and protecting closed borders, or as loose collections of conflict-prone principalities with borders open to invaders. Using an investigative framework borrowed from an interdisciplinary group of scholars in the social sciences and humanities, four scholars of gifted education analyzed four different analytic levels of our field (practice, research, theory, philosophy) to discern whether gifted education is unified, insular, and firmly policed, or fractured, conflict-ridden, and porous. Each disciplinary structure generates unique advantages, disadvantages, and implications for scholars and practitioners. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - Increasing college degree attainment for students from disadvantaged backgrounds is a prominent component of numerous state and federal legislation focused on higher education. In 1999, the National Science Foundation (NSF) instituted the "Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships" (CSEMS) program; this initiative was designed to provide greater access and support to academically talented students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Originally intended to provide financial support to lower income students, this NSF program also advocated that additional professional development and advising would be strategies to increase undergraduate persistence to graduation. This innovative program for economically disadvantaged students was extended in 2004 to include students from other disciplines including the physical and life sciences as well as the technology fields, and the new name of the program was Scholarships for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM). The implementation of these two programs in Louisiana State University (LSU) has shown significant and measurable success since 2000, making LSU a Model University in providing support to economically disadvantaged students within the STEM disciplines. The achievement of these programs is evidenced by the graduation rates of its participants. This report provides details on the educational model employed through the CSEMS/S-STEM projects at LSU and provides a path to success for increasing student retention rates in STEM disciplines. While the LSU's experience is presented as a case study, the potential relevance of this innovative mentoring program in conjunction with the financial support system is discussed in detail.

AB  - One of the shortcomings in most efforts to integrate art and science is that many people have a shallow understanding of art, which inevitably leads to shallow connections between art and science. Coloring drawings of planets, building sculptures of volcanoes, and decorating scientific diagrams are fine activities, but they do not link science and art in powerful ways. One way to more deeply connect art and science is to consider art in its more broad form--aesthetics, and in this case, sublime. Aesthetics is the study of beauty, taste, transcendence, and sublime. In aesthetics, sublime describes a feeling of astonishment at a phenomena, event, or experience. This article helps teachers make apparent the artistic concept of sublime as they complete an integrated math/science activity that gives students a better sense of how big "big numbers" really are. As students begin to appreciate the enormity of these numbers--which are used in various science disciplines from geology, astronomy, physics, and more--they can in the same way begin to appreciate the sublime in other areas they observe in the natural environment, thus developing deeper artistic awareness.

AB  - The reconstruction of ancient atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations is essential to understanding the history of the Earth and life. It is also an important guide to identifying the sensitivity of the Earth system to this greenhouse gas and, therefore, constraining its future impact on climate. However, determining the concentration of CO[subscript 2] in ancient atmospheres is a challenging endeavour requiring the application of state-of-the-art analytical chemistry to geological materials, underpinned by an understanding of photosynthesis and biochemistry. It is truly an interdisciplinary challenge. (Contains 5 figures and 1 box.)
