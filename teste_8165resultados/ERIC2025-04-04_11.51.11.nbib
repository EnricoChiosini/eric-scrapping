AB  - Purpose: This paper narrates a case study on design thinking-based education work in an industrial design honours program. Student projects were developed in a multi-disciplinary setting across a Computing and Engineering faculty that allowed promoting technologically and user-driven innovation strategies. Design/methodology/approach: A renewed culture and environment for industrial design (ID) students emphasised seeking functionality and fidelity, user and society value over beauty and form factors alone. The pedagogical approach sought to determine the new industrial products reality with an increasing contribution by design thinking, and its associated methodologies that are currently advancing typical ID. Findings: In conclusion, the authors propose a number of reflections as recommendations, which may be useful for educational institutions contemplating similar curriculum makeovers to their design degrees. Originality/value: Our research provides valuable lessons to other design courses that wish to invigorate their curriculum with technical and design thinking-based advances.

AB  - Data analytics is a rapidly growing field that plays a crucial role in extracting valuable insights from large volumes of data. A data analytics practicum course provides students with hands-on experience in applying data analytics techniques and tools to real-world scenarios. This practicum is intended to serve as a bridge between the student's academic environment and the professional application of their skills in an employment and internship setting. This study examined the design of a data analytics practicum course. The main objectives included (1) the identification of topics and skills employers look for in new hires in data analytics-related internships and entry-level positions, (2) the development and implementation of a Data Analytics practicum course and (3) reflection on the first-time offering of the course and suggested improvements for the next iteration. As part of this study, industry and organization survey responses drove the design of the course and development of key student learning gains for five learning modules throughout the semester. Faculty within the departments of information technology (IT), mathematics, and statistics collaborated in the construction, development, and implementation of team-teaching instructional practices of the Data Analytics Practicum in Spring 2023. This study applies an interdisciplinary approach to data analytics practicum development and instruction.

AB  - Effective communication by science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals is crucial to building an informed and scientifically literate public (Holt, 2019). While universities do an excellent job of training scientists in the practices of their discipline, they often fail to produce scientists equally effective at communicating about their work to the public. In addition, although there are many resources available on the mechanics of creating an excellent presentation or poster (American Association for the Advancement of Science, n.d.) there are few resources available to give speakers an opportunity to practice connecting with audiences. The University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison), is working to address this gap in training in two synergistic ways. First, by working directly with young scientists using improvisational theater-based training to build their science communication competence. Second, by training the people who educate scientists at other universities to do this work. The results are highly encouraging, with participants reporting solid gains in both communication confidence and competence that they retain well after completing the practicum.

AB  - This paper describes students' experience of participating in a case-based peer-assisted learning (PAL) program in order to examine whether the approach is pedagogically effective and likely to contribute to students' professional development. It presents the findings of a study which examined the integration of PAL and case-based learning (CBL) in a multidisciplinary radiologic biology unit as part of an undergraduate degree program in Radiography and Medical Imaging. The study indicated the value of students working together in small groups to prepare and offer a case-based tutorial for their peers, with the cases offering a focus for their research and teaching in the multidisciplinary context. Working in groups and peer teaching were the most beneficial aspects of the program for enhancing student learning. The program involved three episodes of peer assessment (assessing teaching, assessing learning and assessing contributions to group work), with the first of these contributing most to the program, though further development and exploration of the latter two aspects are needed. The integration of PAL with CBL provided a "real world" context for teaching and learning. Students recognised that interacting with peers would be an important aspect of their professional lives and that the program offered them opportunities to prepare for this. Implementation and evaluation of this approach with other groups of students in vocational and non-vocational courses would determine its broader pedagogical effectiveness.

AB  - This article explores the nature of education as a vital part of human knowledge. The argument that is presented addresses the critique of education as having epistemological weaknesses as an academic discipline. The argument is framed by scholarship that has categorised the discipline of education as derived from three main traditions of knowledge. In order to explore the coherence of education as a discipline, contrasts are made with other disciplines such as mathematics and sciences. The article also reviews scholarship in relation to the concept of education research that is "close-to-practice," and the relevance of this to understanding education as an academic discipline. The article concludes by suggesting a new model that shows the relationships between practical knowledge and academic knowledge that are an intrinsic part of education. A more confident portrayal of education as an academic discipline is also advocated.

AB  - Digitization and preservation of natural resource documents were reviewed and the current status of digitization presented for a North American university. It is important to present the status of the digitation process for natural resources and to advocate for increased collections of digital material for ease of reference and exchange of information. Digital collections need to include both published documents and ancillary material for research projects and data for future use and interpretation. The methods in this paper can be applied to other natural resource collections increasing their use and distribution. The process of decision making for documents and their preservation and inclusion in ScholarWorks is presented as a part of the Forest Sciences Commons as a subset of the Life Sciences Commons of the Digital Commons Open Network launched and maintained by Steen Library. Digitization has increased the roles and skillsets needed for librarians and from libraries. This creates new challenges and opportunities for the library as publisher and as an advocate for open access. Digital curation melds together digitization and knowledge management and enhances community engagement. Digitization of collections are reviewed and natural resource documentation presented for faculty publications, Research Projects and Centers, eBooks, Journals, Galleries and electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs). Recommendations are made to increase the digital curation of the collection by encouraging community participation and use. Digital archives are important to natural resource professionals as society-ready natural resource graduates need to deal effectively with complex ecological, economic and social issues of current natural resources management. Natural resource research for the future needs to ensure that professionals have a greater breath of knowledge as they interpret and apply new knowledge, understanding, and technology to complex, transdisciplinary social and biological issues and challenges.

AB  - Few educators are well-equipped to bridge cultural differences to ensure that all students have opportunities to learn and succeed. Existing frameworks for culturally responsive practices (CRP) suggest its potential for promoting equitable learning environments, yet the state of the science has not been assessed. This systematic review aimed to (a) describe the features of empirically examined inservice CRP interventions, (b) analyze the quality of the empirical studies, and (c) characterize study measures, outcomes, and conclusions regarding intervention impact. We found a total of just 10 empirical studies of the impact of CRP inservice training models (two quantitative and eight qualitative). Study methods universally failed to meet standards of evidence for efficacy, effectiveness, and dissemination; none employed rigorous design features to allow causal inference. Findings suggest that the research base is inadequate to draw conclusions regarding effectiveness and that more rigorous CRP inservice intervention research is needed.

AB  - An investigation of the possibility of life in the universe, or astrobiology, is
an ideal topic for an interdisciplinary seminar course. Answering the topic's
inherent questions--whether life exists elsewhere in the universe and, if it
does indeed exist, whether we on Earth could contact such life--requires
an interdisciplinary approach and multiple perspectives from the sciences,
social sciences, and humanities. Described are several highlights of a
community college's 15-week seminar course, Life in the Universe, including
students' perceptions of the course elements as ascertained from an end-of-course survey. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - There has been a dramatic increase in the number of multilingual and multicultural students in U.S. schools. Because of high-stakes testing and English-only mandates, instructional practices and curricula in most urban school districts neglect the cultural and linguistic interests of their diverse student populations. In this interpretive study, we use exploratory case study methods to demonstrate how Culturally Sustaining Pedagogy (CSP) and Arts Integration (including drawing and graphic story with Photoshop) can support the learning of ten students whose first language is not English. This article introduces research activities supporting the use of culturally sustaining pedagogy and arts in a biology unit (the role of selection population) in communication skills class, particularly with bilingual and multilingual youth.

AB  - The buildings in which people work, live, and spend their leisure time are increasingly embedded with sophisticated information technology (IT). This article describes the approach of Metropolitan Community College (MCC) in Omaha, Nebraska of the United States to provide an occupational context to some of their IT coursework by organizing IT instruction around the context of building automation systems (BAS). This contextualization allows IT students not only to study IT as a standalone discipline but also to study its integrated use within a specific occupational context. The article also describes MCC's focused curriculum design efforts funded by the National Science Foundation's Advanced Technological Education program. These efforts toward BAS-contextualization of the IT curriculum have become a catalyst for systematic contextualization of IT instruction at MCC and support the institution's broader efforts to become a national model in IT instruction and interdisciplinary engagement within the United States. The research-based approach, activities, and outcomes of this project are all described here, as well as the lessons learned by one community college seeking to make their IT program increasingly relevant to their students and the IT workforce of today.

AB  - Following collaboration between two chemistry lecturers and an academic developer an attempt was made to enhance the learning of students within a chemistry module through the adaptation of the delivery of content material. This paper reports a piece of practitioner led research which considered how effective the approach developed was upon the level of student understanding and the process through which this occurred. The module delivery was altered from an emphasis on the transmission of knowledge through a traditional lecture format, to rotating small group problem based sessions and the use of concept maps. Student feedback and higher grades achieved appear to demonstrate it was effective.

AB  - This book contains a compilation of papers presented at the International Psychological Applications Conference and Trends (InPACT) 2020, organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (W.I.A.R.S.), that this year had to be transformed into a fully Virtual Conference as a result of the Coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic. Modern psychology offers a large range of scientific fields where it can be applied. The goal of understanding individuals and groups (mental functions and behavioral standpoints), from this academic and practical scientific discipline, aims ultimately to benefit society. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the several areas within the Psychology field, new developments in studies and proposals for future scientific projects. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between psychologists, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in psychological issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement the view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons there are nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. InPACT 2020 received 240 submissions, from more than 45 different countries from all over the world, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Virtual Presentations and Posters. 75 submissions (overall, 31% acceptance rate) were accepted for presentation in the conference. The conference also included: - One keynote presentation by Prof. Dr. Michael Wang (Emeritus Professor of Clinical Psychology, University of Leicester; Chair, Association of Clinical Psychologists, United Kingdom). - One Special Talk by Prof. Dr. Matthias Ammann (PhD, Department of Social Sciences, Uminho; Psychotherapist and psychoanalyst at Equilibrium Oporto; Climate activist, Portugal). We would like to express our gratitude to our invitees. The Conference addresses different categories inside Applied Psychology area and papers fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. The conference program includes six main broad-ranging categories that cover diversified interest areas: (1) Clinical Psychology: Emotions and related psychological processes; Assessment; Psychotherapy and counseling; Addictive behaviors; Eating disorders; Personality disorders; Quality of life and mental health; Communication within relationships; Services of mental health; and Psychopathology. (2) Educational Psychology: Language and cognitive processes; School environment and childhood disorders; Parenting and parenting related processes; Learning and technology; Psychology in schools; Intelligence and creativity; Motivation in classroom; Perspectives on teaching; Assessment and evaluation; and Individual differences in learning. (3) Social Psychology: Cross-cultural dimensions of mental disorders; Employment issues and training; Organizational psychology; Psychology in politics and international issues; Social factors in adolescence and its development; Social anxiety and self-esteem; Immigration and social policy; Self-efficacy and identity development; Parenting and social support; Addiction and stigmatization; and Psychological and social impact of virtual networks. (4) Legal Psychology: Violence and trauma; Mass-media and aggression; Intra-familial violence; Juvenile delinquency; Aggressive behavior in childhood; Internet offending; Working with crime perpetrators; Forensic psychology; Violent risk assessment; and Law enforcement and stress. (5) Cognitive and Experimental Psychology: Perception, memory and attention; Decision making and problem-solving; Concept formation, reasoning and judgment; Language processing; Learning skills and education; Cognitive Neuroscience; Computer analogies and information processing (Artificial Intelligence and computer simulations); Social and cultural factors in the cognitive approach; Experimental methods, research and statistics; and Biopsychology. (6) Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytical Psychotherapy: Psychoanalysis and psychology; The unconscious; The Oedipus complex; Psychoanalysis of children; Pathological mourning; Addictive personalities; Borderline organizations; Narcissistic personalities; Anxiety and phobias; Psychosis; Neuropsychoanalysis. This book contains the results of the different researches conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to study and develop research in areas related to Psychology and its applications. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters that are hereby sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. We would like to thank all the authors and participants, the members of the academic scientific committee, and of course, to the organizing and administration team for making and putting this conference together.

AB  - Knowledge Translation (KT) is increasingly a requirement for scholars and non-academics working in applied settings. However, few programs provide explicit training in KT. In this article we systematically explore our experiences as a multi-disciplinary group of course facilitators and students in a newly redeveloped graduate course in Evidence Based Practice and Knowledge Translation. The course was designed to emphasize hands on learning, collaboration and community engagement. We reflect on the challenges we faced and the skills, knowledge and opportunities that students gained as they developed and implemented community-based KT strategies relating to refugee resettlement, young carers, and consumer attitudes, behaviour and values around food purchasing decisions. We conclude by providing recommendations for instructors and institutions for implementing learning experiences in KT that are designed for real-world impact.

AB  - This book focuses on the impact of sustained and evolving collaborations, showcasing research and scholarship in a faculty group--consisting of 28 professors from five regional universities--meeting and supporting each other since 2002. Originally an innovation introduced by Cheryl J. Craig and funded by a reform movement, the Faculty Academy continues to flourish in the fourth largest city in America long after the reform initiative abandoned its charge. Contributors to this volume represent all stages of careers, include all races and genders, and write from a multiplicity of disciplinary stances (literacy, mathematics, science, social education, multiculturalism, English as a Second Language, accountability, etc.). In addition to fascinatingly diverse perspectives on teacher education, the authors also investigate issues related to career trajectories--including experiences of vulnerability. The volume illuminates how the Faculty Academy works as a dynamic academic and social bond: not only as a glue that binds members in community, but also in rigorous intellectual commitments that fuel their collective knowing and advance their careers while providing leadership, mentorship, and modelling in up-close and timely ways.

AB  - This article highlights aspects of an interdisciplinary (chemistry-applied linguistics) English for Specific Purposes (ESP) course- and materials-development project. The project was aimed at raising genre awareness among chemistry students and faculty, in addition to improving students' disciplinary reading and writing. As part of the project, full-length chemistry journal articles were analyzed. We describe select results of this analysis and the prominent role played by chemists in the process. Emphasis is placed on the organizational structure of chemistry journal articles, focusing on the Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion (A-IMRDC) sections. Two predominant organizational patterns emerged from our analyses, specifically A-IMR[DC] and A-IM[R(DC)], with brackets signifying sections merged under one major heading. Move-analysis findings are converted into easy-to-interpret instructional tools labeled "move structures akin to flow charts" for two target audiences (chemistry students and faculty). The rhetorical structure of the chemistry journal article is then compared to journal articles published in biochemistry, an overlapping discipline. The article concludes with pedagogical implications and suggestions for ESP professionals engaged in genre analysis. (Contains 6 figures.)

AB  - Sound propagation is not easy for children to understand because of its abstract nature, often best represented by models such as wave drawings and particle dots. Teachers Rebecca Hendrix and Charles Eick wondered how science inquiry, when combined with an unlikely discipline like drama, could produce a better understanding among their fourth-grade students of how a sound wave travels through matter. Creative dramatics uses children's imagination, emotions, and movement to act through improvisation to learn academic material in the classroom. Creative dramatics helps children both retain academic ideas and learn them more deeply (Johnson 1998). Hendrix and Eick used creative dramatics as extensions in support of their children's ongoing inquiries in the Full Option Science Study (FOSS) module on the physics of sound. They found that children performed better on end-of-unit module tests when performing these extension activities integrated into their inquiry studies (Hendrix, Eick, and Shannon 2012). They used an adaptation of the Glasson Learning Cycle Model (Glasson 1993) to plan their sequence of drama activities for maximum effect into four phases or steps: Preliminary, Focus, Challenge, and Application. These steps mirror the 5E Learning Cycle steps of Engage, Explore, Explain, and Elaborate but with an emphasis on student dialogue on new learning in each phase. In this article, they describe a series of creative drama activities that they used with the module section How Sound Travels, including how the teacher facilitates the process.

AB  - Increasingly, STEM focused high schools are used prepare students for college STEM majors and launch them into STEM careers. Yet a new focus on STEM education at the elementary levels suggests that the importance of STEM education is much broader than a preparation for workforce needs in high school or college. This paper describes a case study designed to articulate the mission and design of an effective and nationally recognized STEM-focused elementary school. As described through the six most impactful components of STEM-focused elementary school design at Walter Bracken STEAM Academy, the case study emphasizes the school's strong and inclusive school leadership, with staff organized into grade level groups empowered to innovate and honing their teaching practices. External partnerships are leveraged to broaden student learning opportunities. Students at Bracken engage in active learning opportunities and multidisciplinary lessons where STEM is used as a way of thinking and as a way to coherently combine content into active learning opportunities that are engaging for learners. By organizing the structural components of an exemplary STEM-focused elementary school, we hope to deliver actionable reforms for elementary schools wanting to increase their STEM-focused offerings.

AB  - Community awareness must be increased for communities to play an effective role in the mitigation of disaster damage. Education is the most effective way to accomplish this. It is important for people to know that even though they cannot intervene or prevent such events, they can take precautionary measures to reduce  the damage caused by disasters. Therefore, the opinions of teachers in primary science education about these events and their risks are critical since they are responsible for teaching children about these important issues. The study group of  this research included science and technology teachers in 2011 in Kocaeli-izmit, and semi-structured interviews with teachers were conducted. This study was conducted with the working group of 20 volunteer teachers on their appointment dates only. First, the science teacher guidebooks published by the Ministry of National Education were examined. Units and learning outcomes about the risks created by natural disasters and "Safe Living and Disaster Prevention" interdisciplinary learning outcomes have been identified. According to the results, half of the teachers interviewed think that education about natural events and disasters should really be a part of the Primary Science and Technology Program, but that unfortunately it is not.

AB  - Due to increased need of professionals on the future labour market with competence in programming, many countries have integrated programming in kindergarten to grade 12 (K-12) education. In 2017, programming was integrated in Swedish primary and secondary school curriculum and the courses of Mathematics and Technology. Research has highlighted challenges in integrating programming and other new technologies, and the need for better teacher support. The aim of the study was to examine what programming affords secondary school courses in Mathematics and Technology according to teachers that use programming in these two courses. The study was conducted with a qualitative approach and collected data through interviews with 19 teachers that use programming in secondary school courses of Mathematics and/or Technology. Thematic analysis with inductive-deductive approach was used to analyse the collected data. Theory of Affordances was used to identify themes of interests in the collected material and group these into categories. Ten programming affordances are identified in this study: 1) flexibility, 2) creativity, 3) efficiency, 4) visualisation, 5) fun, 6) curiosity, 7) play, 8) holistic views, 9) fearlessness, and 10) interdisciplinary collaborations. Through discussion and comparison with previous research, these programming affordances are found to relate to three aspects of teaching and learning in secondary school Mathematics and Technology: A) support course content and learning, B) facilitate engagement and motivation, and C) foster developmental skills. The study concludes with a suggestion for a conceptual model on what programming can afford school courses in Mathematics and Technology, based on the findings of the study. Findings can be used by teachers, policymakers and other stakeholders in the integration and design of programming in secondary education.

AB  - In response to a paper calling for the re-engagement of agricultural education with the sciences and science education, this essay is supportive but argues to proceed with caution: one that at first does no harm. I offer a supplementary lens and story of change at Cornell University as a cautionary and motivational tale. I concur with the authors who want to redirect faculty, departments, and societies of agricultural educators to become more tightly aligned with the sciences. The need for and ability to better contribute to the critical discussions on contemporary agriculture issues (e.g., urban farming, GMOs, sustainability, local economies) is timely and important. The trick, however, is to do this without weakening the agricultural education community to the point of extinction. Drawing on Institutional Theory, I offer an enhanced perspective highlighting the importance of resource, conformity, and legitimacy. I explore the nature of competing pressures: the strong and restrictive ties to isolated communities and the pressure to reengage a community with a more socially and intellectually central world. I want to emphasize how these strong ties are typically beneficial to the organizations of interest, despite what it may look like to others outside that sector. It is argued that agricultural education will become increasingly "vulnerable and isolated" should it not cross the street and at least partially connect with contemporary science, social science, and new policy and ethical concerns.

AB  - This conceptual article examines the intersection between immigration law enforcement and education. We explore the following questions: How have immigration and education policy intersected in the last decade, and particularly after the 2016 presidential election? To examine this question, we make use of the interdisciplinary nature of our own academic backgrounds as a political scientist and an education policy scholar to ground our article using sociologist Herbert Blumer's sense of group position theory, Critical Race Theory (CRT), and Latina/o Critical Race Theory (LatCrit). Guided by this theoretical frame, we discuss the notion of education being used as a bargaining tool and a weapon with implications for Latino communities given the current political and anti-immigrant context. We highlight examples that represent various levels of government and that on the surface have a target population of immigrant adults or young adults--however, we argue that regardless of the target population, if a policy has direct implications for adult immigrants and immigration, it will have direct implications for educational institutions and the children of immigrants.

AB  - This paper reports on a funded collaborative large-scale curriculum innovation and enhancement project undertaken as part of a UK National Higher Education Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) programme. Its aim was to develop undergraduate curricula to teach appropriate skills for professional engineering practice more effectively. Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) led the project with Loughborough and London South Bank Universities as partners. Project advisers included Imperial College London and Coventry University. The four collaborative project objectives were to: develop an approach to interdisciplinary cross-year integration and professional team practice, project management, learning, teaching and assessment; develop cross-year student support systems to aid the above; develop the assessment of professional skills; and evaluate and disseminate the project outcomes to the wider STEM community. The activity allowed partners to trial and test a rounded implementation in each institution involving academic taught material, practical laboratory-based project work, together with an appropriate support structure for operation across a range of undergraduate courses.

AB  - This article presents the author's response to the article "Taking Stock: Existing Resources for Assessing a New Vision of Science Learning" by Alonzo and Ke (this issue), which identifies numerous challenges that the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) pose for large-scale assessment. Jill Werthem comments that among those challenges is how to create assessments that reflect the vision of science literacy outlined in the Framework. She writes that Alonzo and Ke identify the following challenge as the most salient for assessment: "The Framework emphasizes that learning about science and engineering involves integration of the knowledge of scientific explanations (i.e., content knowledge) and the practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. (NRC, 2012, p. 11). Wertheim responds that while addressing this point, Alonzo and Ke raise important questions about the recommendation made in the 2014 National Research Council (NRC) report that items developed for NGSS might comprise sets of questions, each of which measures a single dimension of a three-dimensional performance expectation. Although unidimensionality has long been standard practice for high-quality assessment, the NGSS is pushing this standard to change for state science assessment (Gorin & Mislevy, 2013). Wertheim remarks that If assessments are to serve the purpose of monitoring progress toward the vision of science literacy outlined above, they must provide the kind of information that teachers and students need to guide improvement toward those goals (Black and Wiliam, 1998; NRC, 2001).

AB  - Evolving digital technologies provide opportunities to engage students in activities that go beyond print-based reading and writing and help them develop skills for reading, writing, and communicating with digital technology. Virtual reality apps are a rapidly emerging form of digital technology that provides immersive experiences in real or imagined environments. Virtual reality creates sensory experiences that involve sight, touch, hearing, and motion to allow users to feel as though they are physically present in that environment. These types of immersive experiences can be used to engage learners in multimodal literacy practices as well as scientific practices such as forming hypotheses and interpreting data to inform courses of action. The author provides a classroom example of using virtual reality in an integrated science and literacy lesson to engage students in discovering, answering, and writing about questions they developed as they explored a virtual environment.

AB  - Science IDEAS is an evidence-based model that reflects interdisciplinary research findings that support the integration of literacy (e.g., reading comprehension) within science instruction in grades K-5. Presented is a framework for planning integrated science and literacy instruction in which six elements (hands-on investigations, reading, journaling/writing, propositional concept maps, application activities, prior knowledge/cumulative review) serve as a means of providing students with conceptually-coherent, in-depth science instruction. Reviewed is a multi-year Science IDEAS research initiative whose findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in engendering student science and reading achievement growth in grades K-2 and in grades 3-5 in a manner that facilitates positive transfer to grades 6-8. Based on the results presented and related research, curriculum policy changes that would increase the time allocated to science instruction in grades K-5 are suggested as a means of improving the present school reform movement.

AB  - Present and future social and ecological challenges are complex both to understand and to attempt to solve. To comprehend the complex systems underlying these issues, students need systems thinking skills. However, in science education, a uniform delineation of systems thinking across contexts has yet to be established. While there seems to be consensus on a number of key skills from a theoretical perspective, it remains uncertain whether it is possible to distinguish levels of systems thinking, and if so, how they would be determined. In this study, we investigated the impact of the specifics of a system on the skills and levels of systems thinking. We administered a 36-item multiple-choice test to 196 Grade 5 and 6 students. For our analysis, we followed a quantitative approach, applying a systems thinking model that incorporates the latest insights on the levels and skills of systems thinking in geography to the context of ecology. By following an Item Response Theory approach, we confirmed a set of systems thinking skills that are necessary to understand complex systems in ecology: identifying system organization, analyzing system behavior, and system modeling. We examined whether individual skill levels can be distinguished to determine whether a system's general principle or system-specific features cause difficulty for students. Our results indicate that system specifics, such as type of relation within ecosystems (e.g., predator-prey), appear to determine the formation of levels. Students struggled most with the difference between basic, direct cause-and-effect relationships and indirect effects. Once they understood the relevance of indirect relationships in moderately complex systems, a further increase in complexity caused little additional difficulty. Accordingly, we suggest that systems thinking should be examined from a variety of perspectives. To promote interdisciplinary learning, a systems thinking model that defines key commonalities across fields while leaving space for system specifics is needed.

AB  - The article builds on an empirical study of knowledge practices in international, interdisciplinary MA education, foregrounding the role of academic staff in identifying and explicating academic norms to students recruited from different subject areas and institutions. A central theme is transition, which refers to the state of liminality that postgraduates can experience when new to a discipline, institution and sociocultural context. I argue for lecturers as 'transition managers' who may ease students' transfer into an unfamiliar academic culture. This argument is explored in an analysis of interview data collected from four MA courses, which suggests that lecturers' transition management involves an awareness of classroom diversity, an acceptance of responsibility for academic socialisation and the development of new pedagogic practices.

AB  - There is a growing need for STEAM-based (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) knowledge and skills across a wide range of professions (Brazell 2013). Yet students often fail to see the usefulness of mathematics beyond the classroom (Kloosterman, Raymond, and Emenaker 1996), and they do not regularly make connections between mathematics and other fields (Kleiman 1991). Further, many students determine that mathematics is only for certain types of people and decide against pursuing advanced studies (Boaler and Greeno 2000). To make careers in STEAM fields tangible and accessible to their students, the authors of this article describe a lesson they developed to examine the multidisciplinary nature of game design and the role of mathematical reasoning in the process.

AB  - In this essay, we explore how sustainability is embodied in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), analyzing how the NGSS explicitly define and implicitly characterize sustainability. We identify three themes (universalism, scientism, and technocentrism) that are common in scientific discourse around sustainability and show how they appear in the NGSS. Taken together, these themes evoke a technology-centered perspective called ecological modernization that defines sustainability as a set of global problems affecting all humans equally and solvable through the application of science and technology. We argue that students who are taught to think about sustainability from this perspective will be less able to see its ethical and political dimensions and less prepared for the political realities of a pluralist, democratic society that must balance the needs of multiple groups and integrate science with other sources of knowledge to develop contextualized responses to sustainability challenges. One compelling alternative is a systematic collaboration between science educators and social studies educators, in which the complementary pedagogical strengths of both fields are combined to provide realistic and powerful preparation for future sustainability challenges.

AB  - As part of a Howard Hughes Program for Innovation in Science Education grant at Iowa State University, a series of interdisciplinary graduate teaching assistant learning communities (TALC) were developed. The purpose of these communities was to create an environment to facilitate teaching assistants' pedagogical development and training to enhance the implementation of inquiry experiences in the undergraduate laboratories. The TALC evaluated in this study were held for two consecutive semesters and included teaching assistants who facilitated multiweek course based research experiences in their respective STEM courses.Topics discussed during the TALC were based on the teaching assistants' concerns related to teaching this type of course. Evaluation consisted of weekly reflection responses, a pre- and postsurvey of instructional methods they consider to facilitate inquiry, pre-post definitions of inquiry-based instruction, and end-of-semester evaluations of the learning community experiences. This article outlines the development of the TALC and findings from the various forms of evaluation.

AB  - The content of the expertise which young natural scientists try to gain by doing science in research groups is a relatively little-explored subject. What makes learning in such settings challenging is that a central part of the expertise is tacit. This study employs empirical methods together with a contextualized approach and interdisciplinary cooperation in order to reveal practicing nanomodellers' (N = 10) perspectives on their knowledge-building expertise, and on young scientists' expertise education. Modelling in the virtual world plays a major role in the science of these nanomodellers, as it increasingly does in many fields of science. This study therefore adds to our understanding of the nature of recent scientific knowledge building and expertise development, which can be used in the education of the scientists of the future.

AB  - Graphene has opened up new opportunities for scientific and technological innovations because of its astonishing electrical, mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties. For instance, graphene-based nanocomposites have found extensive applications in Li-ion batteries (LIBs) as scientists and engineers seek to achieve superior electrochemical performances. The laboratory module reported herein includes both chemical fabrication and electrochemical characterizations of graphene nanosheets (GNSs). The GNS powders are fabricated through the chemical exfoliation of graphite, and the resulting morphological and structural changes are evaluated by means of scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Li storage electrochemical characteristics of GNSs are then assessed via galvanostatic chronopotentiometry and compared with that of graphite, a commonly used anode material in LIBs. This novel laboratory module, suitable for a wide range of students with a general chemistry background, has been successfully implemented in a multidisciplinary laboratory and lecture course entitled Experimental Nanomaterials and Nanoscience. Because the laboratory connects chemistry and materials engineering to a real-world application, it raises students' interest in and awareness of nanomaterials' contribution to the renewable and clean energy field.

AB  - Environmental education (EE) facilitates students' scientific and environmental literacy, and addresses content areas including sustainability, ecology, and civic responsibility. However, U.S. science content compartmentalization and EE's interdisciplinary nature historically made it a fragmented curriculum within U.S. schools. To gain a better understanding of effective EE instruction that can be transferred to traditional K-12 classrooms, we researched the interactions between a recognized environmental residential camp and students and teachers from six participating schools using grounded theory methodology. Our research identified the residential learning center's objectives, methods of instruction, and objectives' alignment to the delivered curricula. Data generated included lesson plans, survey responses, and interviews. Students (n = 215) identified wilderness and geology activities as the activities they wanted to experience more; they also identified developing curiosity and a sense of discovery as the most meaningful. Whereas most student-identified meaningful experiences aligned with the center's curricular objectives within the optional units, categories emerged that were not explicitly targeted in the unit activities but were embedded throughout the curriculum in sustainable practices, data collection, and reflections. We propose that embedded activities and implicit instruction can be included across content areas within K-12 classrooms. Teacher modeling and implicit instruction will require minimal classroom time, and facilitate students' scientific and environmental literacy in topics such as sustainability and citizen responsibility.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: Our research focuses on a unique group of students who study computer science (CS): ultra-orthodox Jewish men. Their previous education is based mostly on studying Talmud and hence they lacked a conventional high-school education. Our research goal was to examine whether their prior education is merely a barrier to their CS studies or whether it can be recruited to leverage academic learning. Background: This work is in line with the growing interest in extending the diversity of students studying computer science (CS). Methodology: We employed a mixed-methods approach. We compared the scores in CS courses of two groups of students who started their studies in the same college in 2015: 58 ultraorthodox men and 139 men with a conventional background of Israeli K-12 schooling. We also traced the solution processes of ultraorthodox men in tasks involving Logic, in which their group scored significantly better than the other group. Contribution: The main contribution of this work lies in challenging the idea that the knowledge of unique cultures is merely a barrier and in illustrating the importance of further mapping such knowledge. Findings: The ultraorthodox group's grades in the courses never fell below the grades of the other group for the duration of the five semesters. Due to their intensive Talmud studies (which embeds Logic), we hypothesized they would have leverage in subjects relating to Logic; however this hypothesis was refuted. Nevertheless, we found that the ultraorthodox students tended to recruit conceptual knowledge rather than merely recalling a procedure to solve the task, as novices often do. Recommendations for Practitioners: We concluded that these students' unique knowledge should not be viewed merely as a barrier. Rather, it can and should be considered in terms of what and how it can anchor and leverage learning; this could facilitate the education of this unique population. Impact on Society: This conclusion has an important implication, given the growing interest in diversifying higher education and CS in particular, to include representatives of groups in society that come from different, unique cultures. Future Research: Students' unique previous knowledge can and should be mapped, not only to foresee weaknesses that are an outcome of "fragile knowledge," but also in terms of possible strengths, knowledge, values, and practices that can be used to anchor and expand the new knowledge.

AB  - Groundwater contamination is a serious environmental problem, given that all living things depend on this essential resource. Groundwater represents less than 1% of all water found on Earth, but nearly 90% of the freshwater used comes from groundwater (USGS 2016). The problem-based activity described in this article actively engages students in real-world issues related to water. Considering water's unique combination of physical and chemical properties, ability to exist in multiple phases, and daily use in agriculture and industry, it is evident that concepts related to water are vital to many scientific domains, including Earth, physical, and life sciences. These activities also can be incorporated into an interdisciplinary unit (e.g., civics class). This lesson lasts approximately one week, including one day for each of the three sections of the lesson, class and independent time for designing students' solutions to a given problem, and at least one class period for presenting and defending the designs.

AB  - As a field of study, kinesiology is realized in different places and locations as a multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and, very rarely, transdisciplinary project. In the words of the American Kinesiology Association, it is an academic discipline that involves the study of physical activity and its impact on health, society, and quality of life. With varying intensities and emphases, kinesiology draws from biology, psychology, sociology, philosophy and includes multiple subdisciplinary areas (e.g., biomechanics, sport history, exercise physiology, sport pedagogy; Gill 2007). However, this is a far from integrated field. Indeed, with Andrews (2008), in its current iteration, kinesiology is a field fraught with hyperfragmentation and hyperspecialization in which there is instantiated an epistemological hierarchy that privileges positivist over postpositivist, quantitative over qualitative, and predictive over interpretive ways of knowing. In this article the authors argue that failure to fully acknowledge and support the contribution of social-, cultural-, philosophical-, and historical-focused research and understanding precludes the actualization of kinesiology's expansive intellectual promise, impact, and potentialities. The central thesis is that the lean and mean kinesiology presently operating within the (corporatized) academic jungle precludes the development of the field as a comprehensive and integrated approach to the study of human movement. The authors argue that it is explicitly clear to see ''whose knowledge counts'' (Ingham and Donnelly 1990) within the ''prestige hierarchies'' of the contemporary university and whose does not (see also Miller and Ahluwalia 2011). They argue further that this not only is damaging to the field--it is bound to suffer from the structural inadequacies and partialities that will become inherent within the discipline--but ultimately destabilizes the possibilities for higher education as a site of intellectual advancement, social justice, and critical and autonomous thinking. They argue that the epistemological hierarchy associated with a McDonaldized kinesiology is something that we all need to forsake, in favor of more epistemologically balanced, empirically wholesome, and intellectually stimulating kinesiological fare.

AB  - To bridge the gap for English language learners (ELLs) in science, hybrid language affords the opportunity for students to communicate through various modes, including natural language, visual representations, mathematical expressions, and manual-technical operations. The purpose of this study was to investigate how ELLs use hybrid language (a) to demonstrate their knowledge of science and (b) to engage in argumentation. ELLs participated in a summer enrichment program that integrated language, inquiry-based investigations on erosion, and mathematics. The research team qualitatively assessed 15 student notebooks to trace students' growth in science content as demonstrated by the integration of all 4 modes and the presence of argumentation with embeddedness. The results revealed that 8th-grade ELLs increased their use of each mode of hybrid language over time to communicate their understanding of erosion. As expected, some students integrated all modes of hybrid language more frequently than other students. In addition, argumentation became more evident toward the end of the experience as students used claims and evidence. Students who connected their written claims with visual representations (embeddedness) tended to construct stronger arguments than those who did not make connections between text and visuals. Implications for classroom practices and teacher preparation are discussed.

AB  - In today's dynamic global economy, integrated units of study are particularly important. Students who are fluent in several disciplines and comfortable moving among them can make meaningful connections and maintain enhanced understandings (Sias et al. 2016). This article shares an integrated STEAM unit that is grounded in the science disciplinary core idea that plants depend on animals for pollination or to move their seeds around. Over the course of three days, a group of second-grade children explored the life of bees: What is their purpose? How do they live? Why are they important? The unit integrates three threads of learning through integrated lessons using methodology from language arts, science, math, and social studies. Students explore first through a language arts lesson that focuses on bees and advocacy. Next, the students think like a bee as they use math and coding to navigate a bee to do its jobs while avoiding predators. Last, the students put all of their learning together as they experience bees from the perspective of an apiarist.

AB  - The integration of student research into a general chemistry laboratory and an environmental geology course has been evaluated for its effectiveness to improve (i) student attitudes about science and chemistry, (ii) student understanding of the nature of experimental science and the scientific method, and (iii) student perceptions of the application of science and the interdisciplinary nature of science. Students in introductory science courses frequently devote all or most of their time and effort to learning basic laboratory techniques by following predefined procedures that have intentionally predictable outcomes. Though this longstanding model of laboratory structure is an important means of effectively preparing students for future chemical study, it often neglects items i-iii. Students were guided through a research experience by an interdisciplinary team of faculty so that students could begin the research "and" bring it to an appropriate conclusion, including formal presentations, within a single semester. Evaluation of this instructional strategy indicated that students believed they were doing work similar to a research scientist, that they appreciated this opportunity to do research, that it increased how much they like science in general, and that they were more likely to consider majoring in chemistry. The advanced instrumentation, personal relevance of the research, and collaborations (within and outside the department) contributed significantly to the overall success of the project.

AB  - Information literacy (IL) is generally accepted as an important learning competency in undergraduate education and is directly and indirectly mentioned in many national accrediting bodies' standards. While information literacy has been seen as the sole domain of librarians, research shows that disciplinary faculty believe it is important and teach it in their classes. This study reports the findings from a survey conducted at California State University, Los Angeles on faculty's information literacy teaching practices. The results show that faculty take responsibility for teaching all areas of information literacy and do so in a variety of ways.

AB  - In this paper we highlight key conceptual, empirical, and theoretical contributions of the sociology of race and racism, particularly those relevant to education scholars. We suggest that educational researchers could benefit from incorporating some of the insights of sociological research on race and racism into their scholarship as such engagement would help to refine and deepen understandings of what race is and is not, how racial dynamics shape what happens in schools, and how schools matter for society. Similarly, studies of school processes, practices, politics, and outcomes can help us to understand more about the construction, negotiation, and transformation of racial knowledge, racial boundaries, and racial hierarchies. We thus advocate for more robust interdisciplinary exchange and believe that the potential benefits are substantial not only to academic fields but also to efforts to advance racial justice more generally. How we conceptualize race informs how we measure it and how we make sense of the pervasive racial inequity that defines our society and pervades educational institutions.

AB  - The relevance of the research problem is determined by the current discrepancy between the requirements of society to quality of students' training--future specialists with higher education, on the one hand, and level of training received by graduates on the other hand. The tendency of the discrepancies noted is a consequence of the properties of the inertia of the educational process that gives it stability, but also hindering rapid response to the recent changes in the sphere of science, production, culture, industry and other spheres of life. The current controversy requires scientific correction and rethinking of the methodology of quality evaluation of the educational process. In this regard, priority attention in this article is devoted to justification of qualimetric grounds for the projecting and implementation of monitoring technologies in the educational process of the University. A leading research method is a simulation method allowing justification of monitoring technologies as qualimetric bases of educational process of the University and rethinking their valuable content in the students' training. The article presents the discourse of the concept "monitoring technology"; it reveals the essence, structure and content of qualimetric grounds of the monitoring technologies in the educational process of the University; on the basis of the study's results conducted the elective interdisciplinary course "Qualimetric grounds of monitoring technologies" is justified. Productivity of its implementation is proven using the criteria: formation of knowledge of the content of studied course, of the experience in using the acquired knowledge in standard and non-standard situations in the educational process; the integrity of knowledge about the qualimetric basis of the monitoring technologies in the students' training; the students' readiness to be engaged professionally in any activity; formation of competences of the culture of mental labor in accordance with the personal position of the student in self-organization and self-transformation; the personal creativity of the student--future specialist, relevant to qualimetric objectives of the monitoring technology. The paper can be useful to teachers, methodologists, managers of the universities.

AB  - Diffusion is a truly interdisciplinary topic bridging all areas of STEM education. When biomolecules are not being moved through the body by fluid flow through the circulatory system or by molecular motors, diffusion is the primary mode of transport over short distances. The direction of the diffusive flow of particles is from high concentration toward low concentration.

AB  - Despite the poor outcomes for U.S. students on national writing tests, overall research on how to teach writing is sparse, and this scarcity is more pronounced in the early years of beginning to write. In this study 81,200 we present preliminary findings from Year 1 of a 3-year Institute of Education Sciences-funded Goal 2 project aimed at improving the writing performance of kindergarten children. We designed peer assisted writing strategies (PAWS) and tested its feasibility and promise. Participants for this study were 86 kindergartners ranging in age from 62 to 76 months, recruited from five classes in two different schools. It was feasible for research staff to deliver PAWS, which combined the need to focus early writing instruction on critical transcription skills with an effective learning pedagogy (i.e., peer-assisted learning). Lessons that targeted writing letters focused on formation and fluency, and lessons that targeted spelling focused on teaching letter sound correspondence for spelling decodable words and recognition and spelling practice for sight words. Results indicated that there were statistically significant differences between the PAWS participants and the control children on the alphabet fluency and essay post-test measures. Thus preliminary results indicate that PAWS instruction helped children, on average, improve early writing skills. Directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Information behavior, one of the central topics in information science research, holds a key position as a field of study of how people interact with information. As such it has many points of connection to a large number of neighboring fields from the study of human behavior to management and technical disciplines interested in developing technologies to support people in their endeavors. At the same time, information behavior researchers have a long tradition of self-critical debate on how to best engage with neighboring fields. As a part of the 2022 ISIC, the Information Behavior Conference, organized at the Berlin School of Library and Information Science at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, a panel session inquired into the interchange between information behavior research and neighboring fields (Huvila & Liu, 2022). The panelists participating in the discussion were professors Elke Greifeneder, Heidi Julien, J. Tuomas Harviainen, Christa Womser Hacker, Ying-Hsang Liu and Isto Huvila. The invited panelists and the audience that filled the room had a lot of hands-on experience on working with several neighboring fields. Greifeneder has conducted a lot of information behavior studies in the context of user experience research, Julien has worked extensively with professionals from a wide range of contexts whereas Harviainen's work covers design studies, interactive media and information practices. Womser Hacker's work span over information behavior, information retrieval and human-computer interaction communities. Liu's research lies at the intersection of information retrieval, knowledge organisation, and human information behavior, with a particular emphasis on the design and evaluation of interactive information retrieval systems. Huvila has worked extensively with archaeologists, library, archive and museum professionals and healthcare.

AB  - As is the worldwide trend, scientists in China face strong and increasing pressure to publish their research in international peer-reviewed journals written in English. There is an acute need for graduate students to develop the required language skills alongside their scientific expertise, in spite of the distinct division currently existing between English teaching and the other disciplines. Researchers in the workplace also need ongoing training, presenting a complex challenge for the sector. We present an analysis of data gathered as we have introduced, in Chinese science- and English teaching-based contexts, an approach to the development of international publishing capacity entitled CIPSE--Collaborative Interdisciplinary Publication Skills Education. This approach involves scientists and English language specialists working together on education programs adapted to fit local contextual constraints, and builds on collaborative approaches used extensively in ESP contexts elsewhere. Our analysis suggests some possible components of the multi-faceted strategy set that will clearly be required to address the challenges. We argue for changes to the teaching of English to research students in the sciences, including the development of a strong research base incorporating corpus linguistics, English for Specific Purposes pedagogy and interdisciplinary collaborative practice.

AB  - Engineering is increasingly expected in elementary classrooms now that the "Next Generation Science Standards" have explicitly identified engineering disciplinary core ideas as well as engineering practices. To incorporate engineering into their elementary classrooms, the authors used building blocks (i.e., LEGOS) to help students begin to understand engineered products and how engineers work while engaging them in learning about the structure of matter. By integrating the science content alongside engineering content, the authors hope the students will better understand and apply both sets of ideas. In the lessons described in this article, students are asked to make observations and construct scientifically accurate views that objects are made of smaller pieces and how those small pieces can be used to create a new object (NGSS Lead States 2013). The authors incorporate the K-2 engineering standard that states students will create drawings or make models to illustrate how the shape of an object helps its function (NGSS Lead States 2013). Students learn how to work with constraints when incorporating engineering practices. To further expand on student thinking, both the nature of engineering and the nature of technology are included in the lessons.

AB  - Over the past two decades, there have been calls to integrate Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) across all subjects in the primary and secondary curricula. However, researchers have argued that sustainability and mathematics education remain largely unconnected in actual classrooms. The question of what sustainable mathematics education could look like in the twenty-first century remains unanswered. There is a pressing need to rethink, re-envision mathematics teaching and learning for the twenty-first-century learning priorities. In this note, we first present a theoretical synthesis of the specialized literature on the learning and teaching of mathematics. We then attempt to contribute to this particular area by challenging the traditional boundaries of the philosophy of mathematics, followed by some thoughts on ESD in mathematics teacher education. In doing so, we seek to call attention to the need for integrating ESD into mathematics education. We hope, through our call in this note, that more researchers will be stimulated to revisit the integration of ESD into mathematics education, and, consequently, to conceptualize how, and where, efforts should be focused to integrate the aspects of ESD with mathematics teaching and learning in schools.

AB  - This article describes how for many college students the transition to college-level mathematics courses presents new challenges beyond those that were part of the high school experience. In this interdisciplinary study forty-four non-mathematics and non-science majors, enrolled in a retail-buying course, were studied to examine student confidence in performing applied mathematical tasks, mathematics achievement in college, and the relationship between predictors of college success (mathematics studied in high school, SAT/ACT scores, and mathematics courses taken in college). Measurements used for the study included a subset of items from the Mathematics Self-Efficacy Scale (MSES) on a 5-point Likert-type scale, course grades, number of years studying mathematics in high school and number of mathematics courses in college. Findings indicate that mathematics courses taken in college increased confidence in working mathematical tasks and were significant predictors of achievement in the retail course. In addition, SAT/ACT scores also were critical to the overall mathematics achievement.

AB  - What responsibilities do researchers of learning have in the wake of Trump's election and the proliferation of far-right, populist nationalism across the globe? In this essay, we seek to prompt and engage a dialogue about the political role and responsibilities of our field at this historical moment. First, we situate the social hierarchies that were most pronounced during this election within a longer history of U.S. policies and practices. We then examine the ostensible division between research on learning and the political contexts and consequences of learning. We argue for the need to address this false chasm and build on scholarship that has demonstrated the inextricable links among learning, power, and politics. We conclude by exploring how research on learning might more meaningfully engage with the political dimensions of learning through teaching, engaged research, publishing, professional forums, and service.

AB  - Dramatic shifts brought about by globalization, technological innovation, and data-driven decision-making practices are immensely reflected in the landscape of 21st century higher education. Learning Analytics or LA is an emerging multidisciplinary, technological practice with the ultimate goal of producing effective learning to improve students' achievement in the tertiary level. Applications of LA have not yet been fully managed to redeem its promises especially since it is still at the stage of infancy in Malaysia. Since optimizing the use of LA necessitates weighing its value embeddedness, this paper aims to explore practices in strategic direction and leadership, which are critical to ensure the sustainable success of LA programs. This study utilized a qualitative research design and an interpretive paradigm. Using purposive sampling, seven respondents were selected for this single case study. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews, focus group, and document analysis from a higher education institution in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The findings from the thematic analysis show the interlocking significance of policies, procedures, and practice; leadership practice; and recommended strategies contributing to its sustainability. Key issues lie in how to integrate strategies, policies, practices, and procedures that should be executed under the right leadership and recommended corporate strategies. Above all, this study can be used to guide successful LA initiatives and implementation in HEIs in Malaysia.

AB  - At first glance, science and art seem as likely companions as oil and water. Is there more to mixing them up than mere metaphor and a messy floor? In this article, Tom Pringle shares some ideas for powering up the classroom by turning STEM into STEAM by dipping the paintbrush of art into the pot of science. In both art and science pupils can experience unexpected moments of genuine discovery when they are supported in pursuing spontaneous investigations.

AB  - There is widespread agreement within the scientific and education communities that undergraduate biology curricula fall short in providing students with the quantitative and interdisciplinary problem-solving skills they need to obtain a deep understanding of biological phenomena and be prepared fully to contribute to future scientific inquiry. MathBench Biology Modules were designed to address these needs through a series of interactive, Web-based modules that can be used to supplement existing course content across the biological sciences curriculum. The effect of the modules was assessed in an introductory biology course at the University of Maryland. Over the course of the semester, students showed significant increases in quantitative skills that were independent of previous math course work. Students also showed increased comfort with solving quantitative problems, whether or not they ultimately arrived at the correct answer. A survey of spring 2009 graduates indicated that those who had experienced MathBench in their course work had a greater appreciation for the role of mathematics in modern biology than those who had not used MathBench. MathBench modules allow students from diverse educational backgrounds to hone their quantitative skills, preparing them for more complex mathematical approaches in upper-division courses.

AB  - Teaching and instructing is one of the challenging manifestations of informing, within which distance learning is considered harder than face-to-face instruction. Student retention is one of the major challenges of distance learning. Current innovative technologies enable widespread use of video lectures that may ease the loneliness of the distance learner and increase retention. This study explores the impact of video lectures on relatively senior students in a distance-learning environment. The study compares the retention and achievements of overseas students enrolled in a financial theory compulsory course, which is considered difficult. Students tend to study this course only after successfully completing other courses. The results indicate that before the introduction of video most of the students who failed the course dropped out immediately after failing, whereas afterwards nearly all the students who failed the course continued their studies. The main findings suggest that video lectures may increase senior students' retention, although their achievements were not found significantly better than those of distance learners that did not have video lectures available. This paper contributes to the informing science transdiscipline by demonstrating the importance of resonance for effective informing.

AB  - Relating mathematics learned in the classroom to real situations increases student motivation and enhances learning. In this paper, we provide an example of a classroom application of calculus to physiology in two courses: "Differential Equations" and "Calculus I for Biology and Medicine." We designed and implemented a project that uses calculus to model the volume, flow, and pressure of air inside the lungs of a patient receiving positive pressure ventilation. After comparing mathematical models to a mechanically ventilated high-fidelity breathing simulator, students reported heightened interest in, and a greater appreciation for, the relevance of the calculus in both courses.

AB  - Nanoscience and nanotechnology are two key areas in the development of new technologies. However, scientific advances in these fields are still far removed from the contents taught in schools. But what if basic concepts within these areas were introduced in secondary schools? We believe science is an essential facet of culture and the most recent scientific advances should be within everyone's reach. With this in mind, we have developed and tested an educational toolkit to transfer complex scientific concepts in classrooms. The toolkit is based on design and creative thinking methodologies, and graphene is used as an example of a subject that is challenging to communicate within the area of nanoscience. This paper highlights the development of the toolkit and it being tested out in a secondary school by 93 students between the ages of 11 and 13. The testing was carried out through the creation of a workshop called "Graphene in the Classroom." We determined five evaluation categories: Acquiring Knowledge, Satisfaction, Challenges, Teamwork, and Facilitator's Role. The results show that integrating scientific content and design methodologies is a complex yet profitable strategy. The toolkit demonstrated to allow the translation of a complex language into friendlier, more approachable, and easier language. The classroom climate was positive and the presence of a facilitator enhanced motivation, empathy, scientific rigor, and adequate adaptation of contents.

AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate the content of social studies textbooks, which are written and taught based upon the social studies curriculum adopted between 1968-2018, in terms of the curriculum and content designs, and some general educational principles. For this purpose, document analysis, one of the qualitative research methodology, was used in this study. Accordingly, 12 social studies textbooks for different levels of class written based upon the social studies curriculum adopted in 1968, are the primary document resources of the research. The curriculum, upon which the textbooks are based, was also used as resource. For data analysis, content analysis technique was used. The results obtained from the study show that the generally-adopted approach to develop the content of social studies textbooks was single-disciplinary approach before 2005; however it was replaced by interdisciplinary approach then, with the impact of changing curriculum. Another study result shows that the content of social studies textbooks was developed based upon the disciplines of history and geography in general, and also citizenship to a limited extent before 2005. However, as it is determined, many other disciplines such as psychology, sociology, economics, science and technology in addition to those specified above, have a major impact on the content of textbooks since this date. Also, the relevant results indicate that the knowledge content was much richer in textbooks before 2005; however, in the current social studies textbooks, the knowledge intensity has decreased as the knowledge variety has increased in time. It has been determined that the social studies textbooks are developed by considering the chronology and from near-to-far principles in general so far.

AB  - A growing number of organizations have launched social entrepreneurship competitions to help students develop the knowledge and skills to create sustainable solutions to the intertwined challenges of health and development. We conducted a program evaluation of the first 9 years of the Global Social Entrepreneurship Competition (GSEC) at the University of Washington to assess the outcome of participation. Method: We sent an e-mail survey to all GSEC participant finalists from 2005 to 2013. Responses to closed-ended questions were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and responses to open-ended questions were analyzed for major themes. Results: Of the 111 finalist teams, 46% responded to the survey. Motivations for participating included prestige (77%), networking (62%), and mentoring (49%). Of respondents, 76.4% indicated their teams were interdisciplinary, having backgrounds in business (78%), engineering (39%), and health sciences (22%). Of the 19 teams awarded a prize, 12 subsequently launched their businesses. Most respondents (81.4%) felt GSEC helped them become better global social entrepreneurs. Conclusion: Evaluation results suggest that networking and mentoring are key benefits of participation, and that more could be done to increase health sciences students' involvement. Further research is necessary to explore the global impact and social return on investment of these competitions.

AB  - This article has its roots in both literacy studies and environmental education. Beginning with a critical consideration of what it might mean to be 'literate' I argue that a re-evaluation of what it means to be "ecoliterate" is in order. I challenge current articulations of ecoliteracy, both in their relation to foundational literacy practices (such as reading and writing) as well as in how ecoliteracy has tended to be 'bounded' by the science of ecology. Wedding 'ecoliteracy' to ecological science restricts its potential--I argue--to be realized as a bone fide literacy practice. Historically the concept 'reading in the book of nature' had greater currency than it does today, evident in--for instance--the work of J.W. Goethe. Goethe's 'delicate empiricism' and his attention to the cultivation of 'exact sensorial imagination' warrant greater attention where ecoliteracy is being discussed.

AB  - This article presents a description of how an interdisciplinary network of academic researchers, community-based programs, parents, and state agencies have joined together to design, test, and scale a suite of innovative intervention strategies rooted in new knowledge about the biology of adversity. Through a process of cocreation, collective pilot testing, and the support of a measurement and evaluation hub, the Washington Innovation Cluster is using rapid cycle iterative learning to elucidate differential impacts of interventions designed to build child and caregiver capacities and address the developmental consequences of socioeconomic disadvantage. Key characteristics of the Innovation Cluster model are described and an example is presented of a video-coaching intervention that has been implemented, adapted, and evaluated through this distinctive collaborative process.

AB  - The objective of this research is to evaluate the process and school applicability of teacher training program designed and applied on Visual Culture Theory in visual arts courses in line with opinions of project participant teachers. In this research, we used the "holistic multi-stage" sampling since we examined visual culture studies in visual arts courses in line with the opinions of classroom teachers and visual arts teachers. The study group in this research consisted of a total of 508 teachers who participated in the teacher training workshop organized under TÜBITAK 4005 Science and Society Innovative Education Practices. We collected data using participant diaries and focus group interviews. The data were analyzed by content analysis and presented under five main themes formed by visual culture theory; "Learning Experiences", "Inquiries", "Concerns", "Needs" and "New Ideas for Learning and Teaching". Suggestions were presented on extending pre-service and in-service training programs to teach new approaches such as visual culture theory in art education and on increasing number of practices involving student-teacher and parent interaction taking such approaches in the scope of lifelong learning.

AB  - This article addresses the perceived gap between the humanities and social sciences, and the sciences in kinesiology faculties and departments as interdisciplinary pressures mount in an increasingly complex world. I use an historical lens to highlight past difficulties in working across the two solitudes and describe Stephen Jay Gould's efforts to mend the gap. Likening the humanities to the cunning fox and science to the persistent hedgehog, he argued that with care the two seeming opposites can be unified. I discuss how kinesiologists might follow his advice in developing more fertile collaborative interdisciplinary approaches in research, teaching, and professional training and provide some suggestions for mechanisms that might enhance the benefits of working together to bridge the divide. I conclude that we had better seek productive ways--in mutual respect and frequent conversations--to stick together in our broad and useful diversity. (Contains 13 notes.)

AB  - Liberal arts colleges produce a disproportionate number of PhDs in the sciences (National Science Foundation 2008), and knowledgeable observers praise the "cross-training" of these colleges' science majors (Cech 1999; Connell 2004; Ekman 2007; Pascarella et al. 2004; Steitz 2001; Tilghman 2010). While many of the positive outcomes of majoring in a STEM field at a liberal arts college are known, not much is known about how students integrate the content and skills from their nonscience courses into their majors. Drawing on interviews with STEM majors participating in a panel study at four liberal arts colleges, a typology based on patterns of course enrollment and orientation toward non-science courses that reflects increasing degrees of integration between science and non-science fields was developed. Four categories of STEM majors are identified and detailed descriptions of each are provided. Findings suggest that students with an intermediate or relatively small number of science courses were more likely to see explicit connections between their science and nonscience courses, thereby gaining insight into disciplinary methodologies and integrating knowledge and experiences across the curriculum. Results reveal that there are implications for faculty and administrators who seek to increase the integrative learning that graduates will need if they are to address complex global issues.

AB  - China International "Internet +" College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition is one of the important starting points for the country to cultivate innovative and entrepreneurial talents. After investigation and research, it was found that the proportion of liberal arts projects advancing to the national finals was much lower than that of science and engineering projects, and the degree of compatibility between innovation and entrepreneurship projects and competition requirements was relatively lower. Liberal arts college students have many pain points such as little interest in innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, low participation, solidification of innovative concepts, and insufficient innovation. Colleges and universities should pay attention to their core advantages in text expression, topic speeches, information collation and other core advantages when cultivating the ability of liberal arts students in innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, combined with the current political hotspots to cultivate awareness of problems. They can stimulate the innovation vitality of liberal arts students through educational means such as "practical" professional course learning, "cross-border" second classroom construction and "immersive" innovation and entrepreneurship guidance, and then inject new momentum into social innovation and entrepreneurship.

AB  - The purpose of this case study was to examine the phenomenon regarding agriculture education teacher's efficacy by integrating the Next Gen Science Standards and other content areas into their classroom teaching. This was a single case study with two units of analysis consisting of two agriculture education programs in the Eastern United States who resided and worked in a state that provided input and resources on the design and writing of the NGSS for future implementation. Monthly-recorded audio interviews using a semi-structured interview revealed that efficacy was a major factor in the teachers' ability to incorporate other subject matter in class and professional development needs to be tailored to their needs as mid-career professionals. The researchers recommend that ongoing professional development from the school and professional development organization be more deliberate and the integration of more science is necessary to keep agriculture education programs competitive as a valuable curriculum within the pre-k-12 system.

AB  - In today's complex world, there is a continued demand for recently graduated forensic chemists (criminalists) who have some background in forensic experimental techniques. This article describes modern forensic experimental approaches designed and implemented from a unique instructional perspective to present certain facets of crime scene investigation. Physical evidence collection, handling, and evaluation are reviewed, as are challenges associated with carrying out these tasks. The interrelation of the responsibilities of the crime scene investigator and criminalist also is addressed, as this can be highlighted in an instructional setting. If the investigator does not collect sufficient evidence or collects the evidence improperly, the criminalist will be unable to effectively interpret the data. In this report, the authors describe their experiences at a mock crime scene designed for investigation by undergraduate forensic science students. Key points that must be considered include evidence collection, analysis of the evidence, interpretation of the results, and drawing conclusions from those interpretations. We have presented the information in a way that may be beneficial to instructors looking to create or update existing forensic science courses, or scholars interested in the drawbacks of certain aspects of evidence collection.

AB  - Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is a new phenomenon in online learning which are held by higher education institutions and universities. MOOCs is larger than normal classes and it is free as well. The present study aims to specify the authors' structure of co-authorship and the required indicators in analyzing co-authorship, co-authorship network of countries, organizations and subject areas in MOOCs. All productions regarding scientific areas of MOOCs were extracted from the "Web of Science" from the beginning till 2016. There are 2195 extracted documents that were saved as txt and isi formats. Co-authorship drawing networks were prepared by website software CiteSpace version 5.1.R8 SE and Gephi version 0.9.2. MOOCs co-authorship network is regarded as spare that means the number of ties is less than nodes. This indicates that authors in this area have fewer tendencies for scientific relations. European countries play the main role in this area and their co-authorship is considerable. Harvard University has considerable co-authorship in this domain. According to the results of this study, MOOCs' network suffers from the lack of collaboration.

AB  - In this research, Entrepreneurship and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) activity has been established to the gifted secondary school students and to show their applicability. Entrepreneurship and STEM will be shortened as E-STEM. The activity of Colors was implemented at Inönü University Scientific and Technological Research Center (ISTRC) Laboratories and Inönü University Faculty of Fine Arts with gifted secondary school students. In the study, 14 gifted secondary school students were trained for a week based on the ESTEM approach. The students generated solutions to the problem statuses that were given to them using the components of science, technology, mathematics, engineering and entrepreneurship for a week. They developed products with a higher added-value by combining their imagination and creativity, and implemented studies to commercialize their products. The students designed their prototypes in three groups and then developed their designs by examining the dimensions of art and marketing. When examining the answers given by the students to open-ended questions in the activity evaluation form, it was determined that they thought that the E-STEM oriented activity developed their knowledge and skills in the areas of science, technology, mathematics, engineering, entrepreneurship and art.

AB  - This article presents the result of the study on the development strategy of local culture literacy (angklung) through cross-curricular learning by integrating indoor and outdoor environment. Designed through a case study as a qualitative study, this study involves 1 teacher and 24 4th grade students at Sekolah Dasar Laboratorium Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia. Data obtained from observations, field notes, interview, and document study were analyzed and interpreted in a continuous fashion to elicit conclusions. The result indicates that angklung local culture can be learned through mathematics, science, Indonesian, art, and social science subjects. In addition to classroom setting, Saung Angklung Ujo is also a great place to enrich angklung experience. The conclusion is that cross-curricular learning by integrating indoor and outdoor environment is a feasible learning strategy that has the potential to develop local culture literacy (angklung) in elementary school students. The result of this study is thus recommended as a learning alternative to introduce local cultures to elementary school students.

AB  - The article by Aileen Fyfe (this issue) raises a number of important issues about academic identity and the importance of the disciplinary community in the creation and maintenance of that identity. It also discusses some of the additional difficulties faced by interdisciplinary disciplines; lack of recognition (and thus institutional support), isolation of individual academics in "foreign" communities and a general anxiety and lack of self-confidence by the practitioners in that discipline as to the worth of their field. Finally, the article hints at the dangers these difficulties pose for the sustainability of the discipline--as lack of a clear identity and an institutionally marginal existence can make developing and attracting future practitioners difficult. In Fyfe's article, the focus was on the history of science. This article explores some of the many similarities, and differences, that exist for individuals in the field of economic history. For many economic historians, locating themselves within their discipline is still a major issue.

AB  - To assist learners in obtaining professional abilities, meet social demand for talent, and achieve favorable educational outcomes, academic courses generally have unique syllabuses, learning goals, and teaching purposes according to their characteristics and specialized knowledge and skills. Furthermore, it could help the students of Industrial Design enhance the connection with employment after the graduation when they understand the characteristics of auxiliary devices and equipment before entering workplaces. Meanwhile, the students being cultivated the design capability could improve and innovate tools, as the improvement of auxiliary devices and the practical design of innovative products and the functions from a professional engineer are close to the users' demands. In this study, the Delphi method, a group decision-making technique, and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) multiattribute decision-making function was adopted to establish a decision-making model for designing multifunctional products for assessing the students of Industrial Design in learning effectiveness in innovative engineering product design and development. In addition, a practical multifunctional product-design case was investigated to demonstrate the application of the model. This study found that integrating interdisciplinary courses and instruction by industry professionals and introducing industry-academia cooperation had a considerable influence on interdisciplinary teaching and learning.

AB  - The article considers the project technology as a way of forming the communicative competence in students during extracurricular activities connected with the Russian language, the importance of this pedagogical technology in the organisation of teaching and educational work that allows the teacher to deepen the knowledge and skills of students obtained during the lesson. The project technology has a wide educational impact on the student in extracurricular activities connected with the Russian language: they reveal individual characteristics and abilities of students; enrich personal experience of students and their cognitive interest and develops the desire to be involved in a productive activity approved by society. The use of project technology in extracurricular classes allows the teacher to consolidate the knowledge of students in the vocabulary and phraseology of the Russian language, expand the vocabulary of students; promotes the development of their speech, logical thinking, improving the skills of expressive reading and the implementation of interdisciplinary communications.

AB  - A promising approach to increase students' motivation for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is integrated STEM education (iSTEM). This is an instructional approach that emphasizes the deeper connections between the STEM disciplines by involving students in design challenges centered around real-world problems. However, the successful implementation of a new instructional approach, such as iSTEM, strongly depends on teachers' attitudes toward the innovation. Therefore, a deeper understanding of teachers' attitudes toward teaching iSTEM is necessary. This study uses a survey method to investigate the influence of teachers' background characteristics and school context variables on teachers' attitudes toward teaching iSTEM. To do so, a differential approach is used. Attitudes toward five key principles for iSTEM (integration, problem-centered, inquiry-based, design-based, and cooperative learning) are examined separately to get a more in-depth and nuanced insight into the factors influencing these attitudes. Results of the multiple regression analyses show that participation in professional development is positively linked to teachers' attitudes toward all key principles, whereas several other teacher and school context variables are positively correlated with attitudes toward one or two principles. Moreover, experience in mathematics and total years of teaching show a negative correlation with several aspects of teachers' attitudes toward teaching iSTEM. Findings of this study are valuable, since they not only provide insight into possible barriers to the implementation of iSTEM but also suggest opportunities for overcoming these barriers.

AB  - Allen Kent was a pioneer in many aspects of library and information science (LIS), and yet, as this author reads Kent's 1977 article, there is not much in it that has become ancient, irrelevant history. The questions he discusses are still alive in the discipline in 2014, whether it is called LIS (library and information science), information science, information studies, or an "iSchool education." In this article, the author provides a brief history of Allen Kent, and then discusses her reactions to his article on information science.

AB  - Public health has constituted itself as a distinct academic discipline. The present paper attempts to understand ontology of this discipline. A study has recently been carried out which concerns, first, conceptualization of ontology of public health, secondly, nature of public health, and thirdly, curriculum development. Ontology is a philosophical doctrine that refers to an understanding about the basic elements theorized about. As the paper unveils, the tenet of public health is that the health state is not a matter of "individual" only; rather this is a question of the "collective" too. Diverse aspects take forms of intellectual construction which are transformed into the subject of the discipline. They are categorized as worldview, theory, methodology, instrumentation, and application. The constructions are internalized in the discipline's nature to be "epistemic," "interdisciplinary" and "componential." In order to produce knowledge, the discipline involves an epistemic process consisting of "priori" and "posteriori" approaches. Public health, though the prevailing thoughts and practices are derived from biomedical paradigms, contains an interdisciplinary trait that draws from the fields of formal, organic, inorganic and social sciences. The discipline comes to be appeared as an integral whole being componential. The aforementioned categories of intellectual constructions are viewed as the basic elements of public health. Elements exist and operate in a center/periphery binary relationship. Center (worldview), while it holds the whole structure of the discipline together, limits the movement of rest elements and keeps them in the periphery. The paper concludes by pointing out few issues for developing curriculum for universities.

AB  - Successful research and teaching of discipline genres is based on collaboration among language and learning specialists with expertise in applied linguistics, and subject area specialists with expertise in the knowledge and communication practices of their disciplines. These interdisciplinary collaborations involve experts coming together around an area of shared interest in a community of practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991), where members are committed to building relationships to learn from each other, and in this process build new knowledge (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006). This paper aims to identify the kinds of knowledge building negotiations involving a team of discipline staff, academic literacy specialists, and e-learning specialists as they collaborate in the design of online learning materials to support students in writing the laboratory report genre in the discipline of physiology. The data consist of recordings of team members' spoken interactions, with or without other artefacts, such as storyboards, over a period of nine months as the design for the website evolved. Initial discourse analysis of transcripts, based on the metafunctions from Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) (Halliday, 1985a), is used to identify phases where the emphasis is on the negotiation of ideational, or content meanings, enabled by interpersonal and textual meanings. A sample of these phases is then analysed in detail using exchange structure (Martin, 1992) to identify possible genres which build new knowledge and embody it in the online resources.

AB  - This article aims to identify the challenges and opportunities in cross-program problem-based learning (PBL) in higher education, based on an Industry 4.0 case with undergraduate and graduate students studying for engineering degrees. The method for this research comprised a cross-program course structured to bring together undergraduate and graduate students using a PBL approach. Five Industry 4.0-related projects were developed in collaboration with four multinational companies. The authors present the results of the projects and feedback from students, professors and industry partners. The results and feedback led to empirical findings on the challenges and opportunities of cross-program PBL in higher education. The findings contribute to the design and implementation of teaching and learning practices and educational policies at undergraduate and graduate levels. In the approach adopted, the undergraduate students acquired hands-on experience while the graduate students had the opportunity to supervise applied research and practice. The study highlights practices that can help to better prepare future industry professionals.

AB  - The current study investigated the relations between gamified refutations of COVID-19 misconceptions and individuals' emotional reactions and knowledge retention within a large-scale public health education campaign. Refutations have a substantial body of evidence supporting their use to correct misconceptions, yet reduced efficacy has been observed for some topics that generate negative emotional responses. We tested whether gamification could mitigate these limits given that it capitalizes on positive affective engagement. From May to December 2020, approximately 200,000 individuals were recruited from social media in Canada to engage with a nongame interactive survey as a control or a fully gamified platform focused on correcting COVID-19 misconceptions. Gamification was associated with a greater number of happiness and anxiety responses and fewer responses of anger and skepticism in reaction to having misconceptions corrected by refutations. Further, participants who engaged with gamified refutations retained correct information after a brief period. Finally, happiness and anxiety were positively associated with and anger and skepticism were negatively associated with retention of refutation information and support for related public health policies. Implications for scaling up and reinforcing the benefits of refutations for public engagement with science are discussed.

AB  - Students of color remain severely underrepresented in many science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, including environmental fields. Although there is a growing body of research on predictors of selecting a STEM major, generally, much less is know about factors, especially at the program level, that predict the enrollment of students of color into specific STEM degree programs. Additionally, theoretical frameworks and higher education research on college major choice have yet to consider whether the climate for racial/ethnic diversity specifically within academic degree programs may affect the enrollment of students of color in those programs. Given this theoretical and empirical gap, this study set out to investigate whether an inclusive climate for diversity within a degree program may contribute to an increasing enrollment of students of color in interdisciplinary environmental and sustainability (IES) degree programs. Using a national sample of 343 IES degree programs and extending dimensions of an inclusive campus climate for racial/ethnic diversity to degree programs, findings show that IES degree programs with a more inclusive curriculum and greater student compositional diversity are significantly more likely to report an increasing enrollment of students of color. Implications of the findings for broadening participation and understanding diverse students' college major/career choice are examined.

AB  - This paper shows the scientific foundations of a natural phenomenon of undoubted interest and applicability in our day, fluorescence, and its possibilities for teaching at three educational levels: primary, secondary and university. It begins by describing the nature of the phenomenon and continues by explaining how we work with students of the levels mentioned. The method of teaching starts questioning them on fluorescent tubes and fluorescent material. These questions will lead to further research into three topics: 1) fluorescent materials; 2) features of the visual system; and 3) lighting systems, types of lamps and its characteristics. The work then demonstrates its usefulness as an interdisciplinary phenomenon and as a mean of motivating students' learning.

AB  - This article reviews 24 years of research focused on science education for students with learning and other disabilities. Our results are based on 53 articles from 2 relevant databases. We hereby present and discuss the results of the most popular topics investigated, which include: constructivism, exploratory learning, hands-on activities, cross-curricular projects, multiple means of representation, cognitive and social skills, group and peer learning, coursebooks, reading strategies, readability and students' assessment. Our results suggest that topics like teacher education, teacher/researcher co-operation, education policy, school administration and curriculum structure are scatteredly investigated. These experimental approaches and interventions may provide insight into teacher training in higher education and can explain controversial concepts regarding the question of "full inclusion, selective inclusion or excellency."

AB  - Academic programs and educators face numerous challenges related to teaching digital marketing. Today, the world of marketing is digital and marketing programs have struggled to maintain pace with the changes influencing marketing practice. The authors describe the M-School program at Loyola Marymount University, a program developed to address this challenge by placing digital marketing at the center of the curriculum. Through experiential learning and project-based learning, M-School courses expose students to real-life challenges involving ways in which companies and organizations generate consumer awareness, demand, and value given the significant digital shifts taking place in technology and consumer behavior. The authors highlight the creation of a "digital-first" curriculum that is aligned with industry practice and helps students develop the skills needed to become "future proof" and "real-world ready." Quantitative and qualitative assessment over a three-year period points to the success of the M-School program in preparing students for careers in marketing. Lessons for the development of marketing curricula include the role of new course development, the need to integrate digital within existing courses, the role of a project-based learning approach with measurable outcomes, and the potential for designing transdisciplinary courses to foster students' creative, critical thinking, communication, and collaborative skills.

AB  - This paper examines the possibilities and challenges presented by an interdisciplinary approach to the study of disruptive behaviour. It is argued that whilst such an approach is to be welcomed, work needs to be done in order to ensure that educational research joins the discussion as an equal partner. The paper begins with a demonstration of how big the gap is between different approaches through a consideration of studies in educational sociology that take a "soft" qualitative approach to research, and in neuropsychology, a "hard science". The degree of divergence between these two approaches is then highlighted through a discussion of the "medicalisation" of disruptive behaviour. The suggestion that educational research may be treated as a "poor relation", with a focus on the underlying epistemological issues, is then examined.

AB  - In recent years, Australian schools have become increasingly multilingual, with students needing targeted support to develop academic English, yet also bringing rich linguistic and cultural resources to the classroom. Policymakers have recognised the critical role of identifying and describing the language and literacy demands in all disciplines, highlighting an essential role for pre-service teacher training. This article presents various components of teacher learning made available to 11 Australian science pre-service teachers (PSTs) enrolled in a Masters language and literacy course, which included a practicum component and explicit training in elements of translanguaging pedagogy. It analyses the ways in which the training contributed to PSTs' developing scientific pedagogical language knowledge. In doing so, it charts their emerging professional identities as teachers as they are trained to analyse core scientific content for opportunities to provide targeted language and literacy support, as well as their growing understanding of the diversity of language and literacy strengths and challenges faced by their multilingual learners. Furthermore, this paper outlines PSTs' evolving self-reflection as they come to assume responsibility for their students' language and literacy development as a key way of facilitating their access to scientific curriculum content knowledge.

AB  - This study explored the organization of contents in the junior secondary science curriculum of Bangladesh. The research questions of this study focus on how science content is sequenced and integrated in the intended curriculum. Document analysis within a qualitative approach has been followed to conduct this study. Both junior secondary science curriculum and textbooks have been analyzed to address the research questions. This study finds that the current science curriculum at the junior secondary level is not well-organized in terms of sequencing and integration. No principle of sequencing content is followed in most cases. It is noted that in the case of intergrades vertical sequencing, "spiral sequencing" is partially followed in a few cases. This study also finds that the current science curriculum does not integrate the content adequately. Intradisciplinary integration, i.e. integrating different subdisciplines of science, has been tried but the level of integration is not adequate rather it is very low. This study recommends that curriculum developers make efforts to make the content better organized in both curriculum and textbooks by following the principles of sequencing and integration.

AB  - In response to the underrepresentation of minoritized groups employed in the computer science (CS) field, this study aims to enhance underrepresented minoritized (URM) students' motivation for CS through an intervention informed by culturally relevant pedagogy theory in a required high school mathematics course. This intervention integrated culture, art, geometry, and coding through the virtual presentation of a Native American star quilt design using Python coding language and a video of a CS role model of Latino descent. Participants were 133 URM high school students across six 10th grade geometry classes. Three of the six geometry classes were randomly assigned to receive the intervention. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis were conducted to assess the effects of this intervention. Results indicated that the intervention had a positive effect on the development of URM students' computer science-oriented possible selves. Moreover, several qualitative themes emerged in how URM students connected with the CS role model.

AB  - This study examined the effectiveness of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics) integrated approach via Scratch on five subconstructs of computational thinking (CT) among 29 male and 30 female students. A quasi-experimental design was employed in the research. The participants demonstrated the application of CT in designing games via Scratch during the intervention. The Computational Thinking Survey (CTS) was administered pre-CT and post- CT tests in measuring the five subconstructs of CT. Repeated multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) results showed that the intervention positively affected male and female students' comprehension concerning the five subconstructs of CT. The results were strengthened by the repeated measure of analysis of variance (ANOVA) with posthoc comparisons, indicating all five subconstructs of CT increased significantly (p < 0.05). Indirectly, this research introduced a new teaching methodology for students' CT level in the current electronic and technology-advanced era and increased concept manipulation capacity among male and female students.

AB  - Scientific reasoning and scientific argumentation are highly valued outcomes of K-12 and higher education. In this article, we first review main topics and key findings of three different strands of research, namely research on the development of scientific reasoning, research on scientific argumentation, and research on approaches to support scientific reasoning and argumentation. Building on these findings, we outline current research deficits and address five aspects that exemplify where and how research on scientific reasoning and argumentation needs to be expanded. In particular, we suggest to ground future research in a conceptual framework with three epistemic modes (advancing theory building about natural and social phenomena, artefact-centred scientific reasoning, and science-based reasoning in practice) and eight epistemic activities (problem identification, questioning, hypothesis generation, construction and redesign of artefacts, evidence generation, evidence evaluation, drawing conclusions as well as communicating and scrutinizing scientific reasoning and its results). We further propose addressing the domain specificities and domain generalities of scientific reasoning and argumentation as well as approaches for facilitation. Finally, we argue for investigating the role of epistemic emotions, the role of the social context, and the influence of digital technologies on scientific reasoning and argumentation.

AB  - Mathematics and Music are closely connected and their multifaceted relationship has been explored since ancient times. Pythagoras was one of the first who discovered and formalized one of those connections by studying the arithmetic of musical intervals, expressing them by numerical ratios and relating ratios to consonance/dissonance notions, being the Pythagorean tuning and scale based on arithmetic principles. Another interesting link between Mathematics and Music is the geometric approach to musical composition. Geometric patterns are present in different musical style compositions and some composing techniques, such as the 12-tone technique, use geometric transformations, involving also applications of modular arithmetic and set theory to Music. The aim of this work is to present existing relations between Mathematics and Music and to propose automatic exercise generation for exploring and studying those relations. The exercises are generated using the system MVGEN and the LaTeX package MusiXTeX. The generation process and the automatically generated exercises can be used for creating learning and assessment materials for education in Mathematics and Music, linking Science and Art.

AB  - The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) (2014) sets forth that children learning science and engineering practices in the early years lays "the foundation for a progression of science learning in K-12 settings and throughout their entire lives." So, it is important to build upon children's natural curiosities and expose them to thinking like engineers early on and long before college. The Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM) lesson plan presented in this article about matter was co-taught to a gifted and talented fifth-grade class by a university professor and an elementary classroom teacher. Collaboration among experts across fields resulted in the lesson design and incorporated science (metals and their properties), technology (using and understanding technology systems), engineering (the engineering design process), art (sculpture), and math (data and proportionality). The lesson resulted in students' greater understanding of matter (metals) through the roles of engineers and artists. The engineering aspect of this STEAM lessons lends itself well to fostering understanding of solid matter (such as metals) and its interactions.

AB  - Solutions to many environmental challenges now require geoscience expertise, knowledge of global interconnectedness, and an understanding of local cultural nuances, a combination for which geoscientists and our students may not be prepared. The Crow Indian Reservation and its borderlands are a microcosm of these challenges, where geoscience expertise must integrate modern science and local worldviews. We propose sense of place education alongside the use of a digital Earth tool in classrooms as a means of (1) engaging American Indian students and teachers in geoscience, (2) using technology to help students apply geoscience expertise to land management issues in their region, and (3) preparing students for an increasingly intercultural and interdisciplinary future. Developed through a collaborative effort among university geoscientists, tribal college faculty, K-8 teachers, and Crow cultural consultants, the Crow Country Digital Globe integrates the local and global, as well as the experiential and virtual, in geoscience teaching.

AB  - Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe risk their competitiveness if they fail to embrace digitalization. Indeed, SMEs are aware of the need to digitalize--more than one in two SMEs are concerned that they may lose competitiveness if they do not adopt new digital technologies. However, a key obstacle is related with decision-makers' lack of awareness concerning digital technologies potential and implications. Some decision-makers renounce digital transition simply because they do not understand how it can be incorporated into the business. Take into account this common reality, especially among SMEs, this research project intends to identify the skills and subjects that need to be addressed and suggests the educational methodology and implementation strategy capable of maximizing its success. Therefore, and supported by a focused group research methodology, an innovative training program, oriented to decision-makers, was designed and implemented. The program was conceived based on a self-directed learning methodology, combining both asynchronous lecture/expositive and active training methodologies, strongly based on state-of-the-art knowledge and supported by reference cases and real applications. It is intended that the trainees/participants become familiar with a comprehensive set of concepts, principles, methodologies, and tools, capable of significantly enhancing decision-making capability at both strategic and tactical level. The proposed programme with a multidisciplinary scope explores different thematic chapters (self-contained) as well as cross-cutting thematic disciplines, oriented to the Industry 4.0 and digital transformation paradigm. Topics related with Digital Maturity Assessment, Smart Factories and Flexible Production Systems, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence for Smarter Decision-Making in Industry and Smart Materials and Products, as well as new production processes for new business models. Each thematic chapter in turn is structured around a variable set of elementary modules and includes examples and case studies to illustrate the selected topics. A teaching-learning methodology centered on an online platform is proposed, having as a central element, a collection of videos complemented by a set of handouts that organize the set of key messages and take-ways associated with each module. In this paper, we present the design and practice of this training course specifically oriented to decision-makers in SME.

AB  - Integrating science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) education has become an emphasis in many countries' K-12 curricula. Design-based learning is an instructional approach that allows students to learn STEAM in more integrated ways than the traditional method. Using design thinking as a pedagogical framework, design-based learning engages students in designing solutions to real-life and human-centred problems. In this process, students must use creativity, visual arts, and design thinking as well as disciplinary knowledge and skills. Of great importance here is creative confidence -- a belief in one's own creative ability. However, research investigating the influence of design-based learning on students' creative confidence is still scare. This mixed-methods study examined 31 eighth-grade students' creative confidence before and after being challenged to design user-friendly tables. This design-based learning lasted for 12 50-minute periods that were scheduled over four weeks. We used a Likert-type questionnaire to collect quantitative data and recorded classroom discourse to gather qualitative data. Using non-parametric statistics, we found that the students significantly improved their creative confidence. Using a content analysis method, we identified crucial sources of this improvement and thus formed recommendations for how to foster students' creative confidence within the context of design-based learning.

AB  - Twenty-five years ago, the aspirational vision of a newly formed national SENCER initiative led one of the authors (Wood) to initiate a long-term relationship between the Smithsonian Institution and George Mason University, involving a residential, immersive approach to education focused on biodiversity conservation. In the Smithsonian-Mason Semesters, the authors made progress by transforming the curriculum and incorporating active learning around real-world problems with an interdisciplinary focus. Mason students began discovering ways to become knowledgeable about societies and, consequently, the Earth's capacious problems, through immersion in the complex realities of living in the Anthropocene. At Mason, the authors have grown wiser about incorporating TEK (Traditional Ecological Knowledge) and Indigenous thinking and values into education for all students. Using a holistic approach, the authors have hired Indigenous faculty, built an interactive community with students and local tribes, and collaboratively developed research and education opportunities. To date, nine deliverables have been produced and presented to the Chickahominy Tribal Council. These include biodiversity surveys, GIS maps important for planning related to food insecurity and environmental contamination, and cultural information useful for repairing eco-kinship relationships to promote universal healing. Initiatives between George Mason University and Tribal nation partners represent mutual respect and observance of moral principles grounded in reverence for the Earth and traditional knowledge. Faculty facilitate interactions among Indigenous students, community members, and locally residing elders from many Indigenous communities, promoting mutual respect through knowledge and wisdom transfer unparalleled in previous University activities.

AB  - Quality of science instruction is crucial at the college level due to the increasing demand of scientific literacy. Development of science education has been examined in this article through both contextual and comparative angles of college teaching. Different approaches have been analyzed to merge interdisciplinary efforts that articulate both artistic and scientific natures for the benefit of various constituencies. Suggestions have been provided to enhance the scholarship of science education as a subject within natural science departments. Similar to the industry partnership between R&D and customer service sectors, effective collaborations between scientists and science educators can facilitate recognition of the science education subject across the campuses of higher learning.

AB  - Young children love opportunities to build, discover, and solve problems. Teachers can take advantage of these natural tendencies by introducing students to aspects of engineering design while they engage in classroom activities. Engineering also lends itself to supporting students in developing disciplinary literacy practices such as learning from informational text read-alouds and engaging in structured writing and talking opportunities, which are part of the "Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts" (CCSS ELA; NGAC and CCSSO 2010). In this article the authors overview a coherent unit designed to support students in engaging in engineering practices to deepen their understanding of the kindergarten physical science performance expectations (PEs). Then they provide examples of key activities from the unit that supported the integration of science, engineering, and disciplinary literacy.

AB  - Students in computer science and information technology should be engaged in solving real-world problems received from government and industry as well as those that expose them to various areas of application. In this paper, we discuss interdisciplinary project experiences between majors and non-majors that offered a creative and innovative opportunity for collaborative learning. Active-learning exercises allowed students to express their creativity and apply concepts learned from each discipline. Feedback from this effort resulted in the development of the Seven C's (Competencies) for collaborative learning that were ascertained for successful completion of an interdisciplinary project. We feel that these interdisciplinary and collaborative efforts increased student appreciation, enhanced team skills, and created a positive learning environment for the application of concepts.

AB  - Problem-based learning (PBL) and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are two acronyms widely visible in education literature today. However, few studies have explored these in connection with one another, specifically with regard to teacher preparation. This study investigated how 47 prospective elementary teachers developed PBL units and how they integrated STEM and other disciplines into those units. It also addressed the affordances and constraints of integrated STEM as perceived by the prospective elementary teachers. Data sources in this multimethod study included PBL units and interviews. Findings revealed that all of the units integrated at least two of the STEM disciplines, as well as literacy, in a variety of ways. The prospective teachers articulated perceived benefits of integrated STEM, such as: making connections across content areas, preparing students for the real world, teaching students that failure is not a bad thing, and providing future opportunities. They also addressed perceived barriers of integrated STEM, such as: having limited experience with the content, diminishing the effect of individual content areas, and needing better curriculum alignment. Overall, this study provides evidence that PBL can be a pedagogical approach to integrate STEM. Implications for teachers, teacher educators, and curriculum specialists are discussed.

AB  - Across the United States, political leaders, educators, and business persons are issuing an urgent call for reform in STEM education (NGSS Lead States 2013). One important response to this call is Integrated STEM, which the National Governor's Association (2007, p. 7) says involves, "... an emphasis on design and problem solving in "intellectually messy" learning situations that weave together the disciplines… ." Weaving or connecting the instruction of two or more STEM disciplines together is a way to enhance the personal meaning students attach to learning in those disciplines. In order to illustrate how this is done, one of the authors, who is especially interested in the integration of engineering and science, starts by explaining that when designing instruction that meshes two scientific disciplines both of the disciplines should include three characteristics: (1) There should be a natural meshing of engineering and science inquiry processes without one discipline being subordinate to the other; (2) Second, authentic integration of science and engineering instruction occurs when the 5E Learning Cycle (Bybee et al. 2006) and the Engineering Design Cycle (ECDC; Asunda and Hill 2007) are integrated in a sensible way; and (3) The third characteristic of authentic science and engineering integration is a natural connection between the content of the science and engineering activities being integrated. This article then goes on to describe a fifth-grade integrated science/ engineering unit that was designed involving 5-ESS2-1: "Develop a model to describe the cycling of water through Earth's systems driven by energy from the Sun and the force of gravity." It reflects the belief of the authors that the integration of science and engineering instruction will enhance student learning in both domains. Developed in partnership with the group of co-authors, the article shares their experience implementing this fifth-grade integrated science/ engineering unit involving 5-ESS2-1: "Develop a model to describe the cycling of water through Earth's systems driven by energy from the Sun and the force of gravity." The unit reflects the authors' belief that the integration of science and engineering instruction will enhance student learning in both domains as it chronicles each day of the seven day unit's progress.

AB  - Much has been written in recent years about how historical scholarship can be used to shape practice in the classroom. As an historian of the medieval period now working as an history teacher, Dhwani Patel offers a fresh perspective on these debates. During her PGCE year, Patel found herself reflecting on how the lenses and methodologies that shaped her own practice as an historian could help her tackle the weaknesses she identified in her Year 7 pupils' understanding of how power functioned in the medieval period. In this article she shows how she drew on her research to plan an enquiry exploring the importance of rituals in establishing political authority, and evaluates the potential of using cultural history to build more secure, nuanced understandings of political history.

AB  - This study assessed the impact of science teaching laboratories designed with visual connections to spaces outside the laboratory, either to interior spaces or to the outdoors. Specifically, we assessed (1) student perceptions of interdisciplinarity, (2) the ability to stay focused, and (3) the environment for student learning. Student surveys were administered in 2008 in St. Olaf College's old Science Center (windowless teaching laboratories) and in 2009 in St. Olaf College's new Regents Hall of Natural and Mathematical Sciences (same time of year, same courses). Our results indicate that students in Regents Hall have a better appreciation of what happens in science labs in disciplines outside of their major, are more satisfied with the number of windows, have a greater sense of connection with the outside world, like coming to the laboratory more, are better able to stay focused, and are less anxious to leave the laboratory at the end of the lab session. However, we found no difference in the extent to which activities outside the laboratory interfered with student's ability to focus on their work. We therefore recommend visual connectedness within teaching laboratories as a useful strategy for those considering new or renovated science facilities. (Contains 3 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - This paper focuses on how wise humanising creativity (WHC) is manifested within early years interdisciplinary arts education. It draws on Arts Council-funded participatory research by Devon Carousel Project and University of Exeter's Graduate School of Education. It is grounded in previous AHRC-funded research, which conceptualised WHC in the face of educational creativity/performativity tensions. WHC articulates the dialogic embodied inter-relationship of creativity and identity--creators are "making and being made"; they are "becoming." The research used a qualitative methodology to create open-ended spaces of dialogue or "Living Dialogic Spaces" framed by an ecological model to situate the team's different positionings. Data collection included traditional qualitative techniques and arts-based techniques. Data analysis involved inductive/deductive conversations between existing theory and emergent themes. Analysis indicated that "making and being made," and other key WHC features were manifested. We conclude by suggesting that WHC can help develop understanding of how creative arts practice supports the breadth of young children's development, and the role of the creativity-identity dialogue within that, as well as indicating what the practice and research has to offer beyond the Early Years.

AB  - Students with disabilities perform below their non-disabled peers in science (National Science Foundation, 2015). The purpose of the exploratory research was to determine if informal science learning activities offered in Florida districts make a difference on the performance of students with disabilities (SWD) on the 2015 8th grade Florida science assessment using quasi-experimental research methods. After determining a statistically significant difference does exist on the difference between students with and without disabilities on the 8th Grade Florida Science Assessment, the researcher determined if STEM personnel track the number of students with disabilities who participate in STEM activities. The number and types of STEM activities were collected by district. Lastly, the researcher determined there was a small correlation between SWD performance on the Science assessment and the number of STEM activities offered in each district.

AB  - We contacted a random sample of 900 elementary teachers (grades K-5) in the United States to inquire about their use of writing to support students' learning of classroom content or concepts. Characteristics (i.e., grade level, public v. private school, school locale, school enrollment) of the 150 teachers who responded to our survey were not statistically different from the entire sample surveyed. More than two-thirds (67%) of responding teachers reported receiving minimal to no college preparation on how to use writing to support their students' learning. Although at least one-half reported using 30 of the 50 writing-to-learn activities included on the survey in at least one subject area, there were subject area differences. Teachers reported using a significantly greater number of writing-to-learn activities in English/language Arts (ELA) than in math, science, or social studies classes (all p < 0.001) and a significantly greater number of writing-to-learn activities in science compared to math (p < 0.01). The most commonly reported writing-to-learn activities involved little writing and little critical thinking or analysis. We further found that increases in teachers' grade level and educational level were associated with increased use of writing-to-learn activities in all subject areas. Teachers' beliefs about the use of writing to support learning in different subject areas was a significant predictor (p < 0.01) of their use of writing-to-learn activities in math and social studies, while their perceptions of having the skills and resources to use writing-to-learn predicted their increased use of writing activities in ELA and math (p < 0.05). Finally, we found that teachers commonly used best practices to directly teach their students to use writing-to-learn strategies. We discuss implications of our findings for both pre-service and in-service teacher preparation as well as classroom practice.

AB  - Biology in Context ("bik") is a project that aims to improve biology teaching in lower secondary schools in Germany. Based on a theoretical framework derived from the National Educational Standards, four competence areas should be fostered in biology education: subject knowledge; inquiry acquisition; subject-related communication; and valuing and decision making. Therefore, science education researchers and teachers work together in learning communities to transform theoretical competence models in teaching and learning practice using authentic contexts. Funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and the participating federal states, such learning communities were established. The accompanying formative evaluation research focuses on teachers' professional learning by analysing their attitudes, intentions and behaviour in implementing the "bik" project. The methodology involved questionnaires and structured interviews with teachers, science education researchers and coordinators in the initial phase, after one year of working together and finally at the completion of the "bik" project. The data show that the learning communities have inspired and supported the participating biology teachers to change their teaching towards a more competence-oriented and student-based teaching. The continuing study/work will now focus especially on interdisciplinary working in natural science context projects and in the development of diagnostic tasks to foster different biological competences.

AB  - Various studies have promoted instruction in the history and philosophy of science (HPS) in science classes, but the best way of putting this perspective into practice remains undetermined. To contribute to this issue, we developed a pedagogical project in some high schools in Brazil that aimed to present science content using an historical-philosophical approach focusing on the HPS from a social perspective. The content was developed broadly, highlighting the dialogues between science and the cultures in which scientific knowledge was accumulated. The results of the first stage of project implementation show that some strategies efficiently encouraged student discussion about science using an historical-philosophical approach. One successful strategy was the use of artistic material, such as movies and plays. The creative language and images in these elements allowed teachers to broaden historical-philosophical discussions without compromising science content. This project shows that a social approach to the HPS stimulates interdisciplinary discussions in science classes, enabling students to reflect on the nature of science.

AB  - Interprofessional education (IPE) aims to improve patient outcomes and the quality of care. Interprofessional learning outcomes and interprofessional competencies are now included in many countries' health and social care professions' accreditation standards. While IPE may take place at any time in health professions curricula it tends to focus on professionalism and clinical topics rather than basic science activities. However generic interprofessional competencies could be included in basic science courses that are offered to at least two different professional groups. In developing interprofessional activities at the preclinical level, it is important to define explicit interprofessional learning outcomes plus the content and process of the learning. Interprofessional education must involve interactive learning processes and integration of theory and practice. This paper provides examples of IPE in anatomy and makes recommendations for course development and evaluation.

AB  - Mercer University School of Medicine utilizes a problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum for educating medical students in the basic clinical sciences. In 2014, an adjustment was piloted that enabled PBL cases to align with their corresponding cadaver dissection that reviewed the content of anatomy contained in the PBL cases. Faculty had the option of giving PBL cases in sequence with the cadaveric dissection schedule (sequential group) or maintaining PBL cases out of sequence with dissections (traditional group). During this adjustment, students' academic performances were compared. Students' perception of their own preparedness for cadaveric dissection, their perceived utility of the cadaver dissections, and free-response comments were solicited via an online survey. There were no statistically significant differences when comparing student mean examination score values between the sequential and traditional groups on both multidisciplinary examinations (79.39 ± 7.63 vs. 79.88 ± 7.31, P = 0.738) and gross anatomy questions alone (78.15 ± 10.31 vs. 79.98 ± 9.31, P = 0.314). A statistically significant difference was found between the sequential group's and traditional group's (63% vs. 29%; P = 0.005) self-perceived preparedness for cadaveric dissections in the 2017 class. Analysis of free-response comments found that students in the traditional group believed their performance in PBL group, participation in PBL group and examination performance was adversely affected when compared to students with the sequential schedule. This study provides evidence that cadaveric dissections scheduled in sequence with PBL cases can lead to increased student self-confidence with learning anatomy but may not lead to improved examination scores.

AB  - To teach science writing effectively, scholars encourage combining writing to learn with applications of the science writing heuristic. How teachers learn to do so remains under-examined. This essay follows a cohort of ninth-grade science teachers who collaborated in a project to develop, test, and revise such a combination of writing prompts for physical science and biology in a high-poverty, urban school district. Students in the project acquired course concepts more readily. In standardized exams designed by the district, they also outperformed students enrolled in the same courses, using the same district curricula. Even special education students demonstrated better progress and retention. In addition, the exams enabled the science teachers to evaluate the curriculum and to consider how writing to learn could redress its weaknesses. Preliminary results of the project suggest that writing to learn--augmented by locally designed standardized tests--might not only transform student learning outcomes, but transform the development of secondary science curricula as well.

AB  - This study aims to explore students' argumentation and decision-making relating to an authentic socioscientific issue (SSI)--the problem of environmental toxins in fish from the Baltic Sea. A multi-disciplinary instructional module, designed in order to develop students' skills to argue about complex SSI, was successfully tested. Seven science majors in the final year of their upper secondary studies participated in this study. Their argumentation and decision-making processes were followed closely, and data were collected during multiple stages of the instructional module: group discussions were audio recorded, the participants wrote reports on their decision making, and postexercise interviews were conducted with individual students. The analysis focused on the skill of evaluation demonstrated by the students during the exercise and the relationships between the knowledge, values, and experiences that they used in their argumentation. Even though all of the students had access to the same information and agreed on the factual aspects of the issue, they came to different decisions. All of the students took counter-arguments and the limitations of their claims into account and were able to extend their claims where appropriate. However, their decisions differed depending on their background knowledge, values, and experiences (i.e., their intellectual baggage). The implication to SSI teaching and learning is discussed.

AB  - Integrated STEM education leverages interconnections between science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in order to reflect upon how each discipline operates within real world contexts. Students benefit from the integrated STEM approach because it values the real-life experiences of students along with the hands-on applications that mirror professional STEM work. Nevertheless, integrated STEM instruction remains ill-defined with many gaps evident in the existing research of how implementation explicitly works. The school setting central to this case study was a suburban public middle school that had sustained an integrated STEM program for a period of over 5 years. Through the use of phenomenological qualitative inquiry, we focused on both teachers' and students' experiences of participation in one integrated STEM model. Three major themes emerged as part of this inquiry. First, teachers engaged in continual reflection that along with district supports contributed to the durability of the model. Second, teachers and student engaged in dynamic learning transactions based on the particular task and concept covered. Third, science projects anchored learning opportunities deemed most successful by participants.

AB  - Ask many elementary school teachers or principals, and they will say that science and music are not the top priority in their classrooms. Teachers need to know "how" they can incorporate the necessary mathematics and reading goals and objectives while still engaging students in the critical and aesthetic thinking developed through science and music. It was this concern that brought the authors--science educators and a music educator--together to develop a lesson to integrate their subjects for classroom instruction. A natural link between science and music--sound--also provided a nice backdrop to highlight students' backgrounds. To integrate science, music, and culture may seem complex. However, one way that this may be accomplished is through a systems approach to teaching. A systems approach allows for a single system to be more fully examined in isolation. "A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts and Core Ideas" (NRC 2012) defines the "Systems and System Models" as a small group of related components that is isolated from the larger system. The focus of a systems approach is on the relationships and connections between the parts as applied to a specific context while moving away from focusing on the individual parts (Llewellyn and Johnson 2008). Taking a systems approach allows scientists and students to investigate a small portion of a concept to understand the forces acting on that system. The lesson described in this article demonstrates how sound waves can be seen as a subsystem of musical acoustics or the physics of music (Sullivan 2008). Within this system, sound waves are analyzed in terms of the pitch (high and low), loudness (loud or soft), and timbre (quality of sound). However, music is more than individual notes played in isolation. Music is organized notes in sequences that tell a story about the feelings and ideas the composer wants to invoke in the listener. It is this nature of music that makes it a cultural experience; each culture shares its own beliefs, ideas, and experiences through a variety of instruments and sounds. The objectives of the lesson described here are for fourth-grade students to learn about sound waves as created by a variety of musical instruments in order to develop a model of sound waves by recognizing the similarities and differences in patterns caused by a series of sounds. One of several goals is for students to develop a model of the relationship between loudness and pitch with respect to a stringed instrument (e.g., guitar) in order to apply this knowledge to building their own instrument. With regards to the National Standards for Music Education (MENC 1994), the teachers wanted their students to listen to, analyze, and describe music by identifying the properties of sounds created by a variety of instruments using appropriate terminology (i.e., "timbre" and "sound quality") in explaining the sounds heard as well as develop perceptual skills about music from various cultures. They also wanted to capitalize on the cultural diversity of students by highlighting each individual's unique experiences and knowledge of music. Building on the students' everyday context is important for providing a meaningful experience by celebrating the diversity among students in the classroom.

AB  - Health professions education scholarship units (HPESUs) are increasingly becoming a standard for medical schools worldwide without having much information about their value and role in actual educational practices, particularly of those who work in these units, the educational scientists. We conducted a linguistic analysis, called Membership Categorization Analysis, of interviews with leaders of recent curriculum changes to explore how they talk about educational scientists in relation to these processes. The analysis was conducted on previously collected interview data with nine change leaders of major undergraduate medical curriculum change processes in the Netherlands. We analyzed how change leaders categorize HPESUs and educational scientists (use of category terms) and what they say about them (predicates). We noticed two ways of categorizing educational scientists, with observable different predicates. Educational scientists categorized by their first name were suggested to be closer to the change process, more involved in decisional practices and positively described, whereas those described in more generic terms were represented in terms of relatively passive and unspecified activities, were less explicit referenced for their knowledge and expertise and were predominantly factually or negatively described. This study shows an ambiguous portrayal of educational scientists by leaders of major curriculum change processes. Medical schools are challenged to establish medical curricula in consultation with a large, diverse and interdisciplinary stakeholder group. We suggest that it is important to invest in interpersonal relationships to strengthen the internal collaborations and make sure people are aware of each other's existence and roles in the process of curriculum development.

AB  - Steven R. Forness is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). His research has primarily focused on early detection and eligibility of children with psychiatric disorders for special education services in public schools. As part of an ongoing oral history project, a conversation was held with Dr. Forness on the past, present, and possible future of the field of providing services to children with emotional-behavioral disorders. Dr. Forness stresses the increasing importance of providing an interdisciplinary approach to meeting these needs. Among the many topics discussed, Dr. Forness gives his views on (1) why he thinks that positive behavior support [PBS] has had positive impact on the field of educating children with emotional behavior disorders; (2) how teacher trainers can provide opportunities where team members can use that interdisciplinary model; (3) the components he would suggest be designed into a master's program to work with children with emotional-behavior disorders; (4) the negative influence of postmodernism; (5) the future for educators in this field; and (6) suggestions for those entering this field.

AB  - Three decades have passed since approximately 1,700 scientists signed the "World Scientists' Warning to Humanity" highlighting severe environmental problems and trends affecting local and global communities. To reverse the situation, their 1992 Warning argued we need to change our behaviour. In 2017, a larger group issued a second consensus statement warning that the direction and rates of environmental change had worsened and remained unsustainable. Neither document, however, identified "education" as a key strategy in supporting the necessary behavioural changes that could address such trends. With this in mind, in this essay we argue that to avoid imperilling our future and the planet's--and to achieve a just transition to sustainability--environmental education is a cornerstone for the social and environmental changes expected in such "Warnings." We also argue that consensus on our environmental predicaments is not simply a matter for scientists; it must be supported in multiple spheres. This includes the humanities, arts, and social sciences, and wider society. Only then will contemporary calls by organisations such as UNEP and UNESCO that 'environmental education be a core component of all education systems at all levels by 2025', have a chance of gaining the multilateral and multileveled support the situation so urgently requires.

AB  - The value of service-learning as a high-impact educational practice in college courses is further documented here through client-centered student projects seeking to increase SOLE food-- sustainable, organic, local, and ethically produced--on the Utah State University campus. Honors students enrolled in a Think Tank series of courses in Science, Social Sciences, and Arts/Humanities completed six cross-disciplinary projects focused on various aspects of dining services and food sources on campus, including recycling, food waste, food recovery, and local sourcing. Post-project student reflections indicate that students were much more aware of campus-wide sustainability issues and how they, as campus citizens, could contribute in meaningful ways. Student also demonstrated the ability to property design research projects and engage in data-informed problem solving as a result of their service-learning project. Students also learned to successfully work in groups and appreciate and encourage the strengths of each team member.

AB  - Young people now must compete in a global, knowledge-based, innovation-centered economy; they must acquire not just academic knowledge, but also character attributes such as intrinsic motivation, persistence, and flexibility. To accomplish these ambitious goals, the National Research Council (2012) of the United States recommends the use of "deeper learning" classroom strategies. These include case-based learning, multiple representations of knowledge, collaborative learning, apprenticeships, life-wide learning, learning for transfer, interdisciplinary studies, personalized learning, connected learning, and diagnostic assessments. Immersive media (virtual reality, multi-user virtual environments, mixed and augmented realities) have affordances that enhance this type of learning. EcoXPT is an inquiry-based middle school curriculum on ecosystem science that invites students into immersive experimentation with scaffolding tools that support deeper learning. This includes a "case-based approach" situated in an unfolding eutrophication scenario in which students learn new information from their observations over space and time, speaking with virtual characters in the world, and gathering information in the field guide and other sources. "Diagnostic assessments" of students' progress are based on multiple sources, including process data from various types of logfiles. "Multiple varied forms of representation" convey perceptual, graphical, and experimental data, enabling students to investigate relationships between variables. Students are "apprenticed" in the ways of knowing of ecosystems scientists, which involves "interdisciplinary knowledge." Students "collaborate" in teams of two, subdividing the tasks of gathering evidence.

AB  - Computer animation in the past decade has become one of the most noticeable features of technology-based learning environments. By its definition, it refers to simulated motion pictures showing movement of drawn objects, and is often defined as the art in movement. Its educational application known as educational computer animation is considered to be one of the most elegant ways for preparing materials for teaching, and its importance in assisting learners to process, understand and remember information efficiently has vastly grown since the advent of powerful graphics-oriented computers era. Based on theories and facts of psychology, colour science, computer animation, geometric modelling and technical aesthetics, this study intends to establish an inter-disciplinary area of research towards a greater educational effectiveness. With today's high educational demands as well as the lack of time provided for certain courses, classical educational methods have shown deficiencies in keeping up with the drastic changes observed in the digital era. Generally speaking, without taking into account various significant factors as, for instance, gender, age, level of interest and memory level, educational animations may turn out to be insufficient for learners or fail to meet their needs. Though, we have noticed that the applications of animation for education have been given only inadequate attention, and students' personality types of temperaments (sanguine, choleric, melancholic, phlegmatic, etc.) have never been taken into account. We suggest there is an interesting relationship here, and propose essential factors in creating educational animations based on students' personality types. Particularly, we study how information in computer animation may be presented in a more preferable way based on font types and their families, colours and colour schemes, emphasizing texts, shapes of characters designed by planar quadratic Bernstein-Bézier curves. The study has found out that both choleric-melancholic and phlegmatic-sanguine gained the lowest and the highest percentages in selection of different colour groups as cool, warm, and achromatic. We have experimentally confirmed the theory of Nabiyev & Ziatdinov (2014) which reports that planar quadratic Bernstein-Bézier curves with monotonic curvature function may be not aesthetic. Finally, based on the survey results, we have clarified how school students understand the fundamental principles of computer animation. We look forward that this study is likely to have wide benefits in the field of education. Developing educational materials with the aid of obtained empirical results, while considering the personality types of students' temperament, seems to be a promising avenue to improve, enrich and deepen the learning process in order to achieve its maximum effectiveness.

AB  - Traditional science instruction is typically reliant on visual modes of learning, such as textbooks and graphs. Furthermore, since science instruction is often heavily dependent upon visual cues, students with visual impairment often do not have access to the same educational opportunities in most science classes (Jones, Minogue, Oppewal, Cook, & Broadwell, 2006). However, advancements in tactile technology (haptics) are allowing individuals with visual impairments to discover science concepts in revolutionary ways. Haptic feedback devices allow users to experience computer simulations through tactile sensations. Students with visual impairments in science classrooms can now use haptic devices to "feel" objects and processes in science, such as exploring an animal cell's organelles (Jones et al., 2004). The study presented here explored the efficacy of the Novint Falcon haptic device from Novint Technologies, a USB-enabled haptic device that is designed to replace a mouse while a participant is utilizing the computer for simulations or gaming. Participants in the study used the Novint Falcon device with the instructional program ("Pollen Grain") which allowed them to maneuver and control an object (a pollen grain) that was constantly subjected to the random motion of surrounding particles in a closed system. The intensity of the force feedback depended upon the temperature and pressure settings in the simulation. When operating the haptic device along with the computer simulation, participants were able to "feel" the numerous particles randomly bombard the object they were guiding in the simulation. The concept of particle movement is crucial for individuals to understand various interdisciplinary science concepts, such as heat; the formation of viral capsids, proteins, and structures; and processes such as osmosis. The results of this pilot study suggest that the haptic technology and software program investigated support elementary and secondary students' learning about particle motion, temperature, and pressure. The results suggest that the Falcon haptic device has the potential to be a useful tool for students with visual impairments to learn science concepts and processes. Topics such as thermal energy and temperature are difficult for students to conceptualize (Harrison & Treagust, 1996), and the changes in the assessments showed that participants in the present study made gains in their understanding of these topics.

AB  - This study examined the efficacy of a shared book-reading approach to integrating literacy and science instruction. The purpose was to determine whether teaching science vocabulary using information text could improve low-income preschoolers' word knowledge, conceptual development, and content knowledge in the life sciences. Teachers in 17 preschool classrooms and 268 children participated; nine classrooms were assigned to treatment, eight to control. The treatment group received a science-focused shared book-reading intervention, 4 days a week, 12-15 minutes daily for 12 weeks, while the control group continued with business as usual. Results indicated statistically and practically significant effects on children's word, concepts, and content knowledge and knowledge of the information text genre compared to the control group. However, we recognize the potential confound of district with treatment condition as a major limitation of the study.

AB  - Science Without Borders is a unique interdisciplinary science course that uses group and active-learning strategies and is in high demand among nonscience majors at a masters-level university. Registrar data showed that nonscience majors were far more likely to choose this course compared with other, discipline-based science courses. In an investigation of course catalogs of 60 randomly selected institutions of higher learning, only 5% offered a similar course. In this paper, we describe the course's unique structure and successful administration. In addition, pre- and postcourse surveys were administered to over 200 students in 10 different sections over the course of one academic year. These data showed that students demonstrated modest increases in science competency, but perceptions of science were unchanged. (Contains 3 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - This paper develops the structure for an integrative model information systems curriculum on Accounting Analytics, which affords students the opportunities to develop domain knowledge along with application of data analytics. As industry experiences rapid technological change, university curricula must remain current in order to be effective. Curriculum content is further advanced and established with input from industry organizations that employ graduates of the programs. The paper output includes a curriculum review of top accounting programs, course curriculum map, accounting data skills matrix, and professional opportunities. The curriculum review utilizes an empirical text analytics methodological approach to extract patterns and develop additional insights for the advancement of accounting information systems research. To minimize curricular disruption, existing courses can be utilized as core curriculum, enhancing key courses to complete undergraduate, graduate, or certificate programs. The Accounting Analytics customized curriculum provides students an opportunity to take advantage of the growing interdisciplinary field and student interest among accounting and analytical career paths. The integrative curriculum is developed to better prepare graduates with the critical knowledge, skills, and abilities to excel in this new-age workforce.

AB  - This article outlines a research study focused on the connections between natural science and art. In the instructional unit designed for the research study, multiple art forms were utilized, in order to reach multiple types of learners. Interdisciplinary, or integrated art instruction is a way to enhance understanding of and the connections between dominant subjects, while targeting many of the varying types of intelligence. As children engage in the creative process through artwork linked with other branches of study, they will make newfound discoveries and connections. When students view art through the lens of a "big idea" and multiple art forms, multiple connections come to light, creative explorations deepen, and definitions of art expand.

AB  - The Faculty of Natural and Applied Sciences at Notre Dame University--Louaize, conscious to the need of experts in the emerging field of sustainability and to the role that an educational institution plays for the service of the community, introduced into the university curricula a major in environmental science. This paper will present the programme's components, goals and implementation. The curriculum encompasses natural, social and managerial sciences, given the interdisciplinary nature of environmental science. Topical courses on water, soil and air pollution, environmental impact assessment and environmental ethics were designed, which integrate theory and practice. The graduates are prepared for managerial, communication and, most importantly, ethical competences to be able to implement best practices in environmental protection and play an active role in the community, especially the public, private, industrial and educational domains. At an inter-faculty level, the programme was successful in offering general education requirements courses on environment, sustainability and ethics, which helped in raising sustainability awareness among the students' population and strengthened the inter-faculty community relationships. To the present, the main focus of the programme was on education and preparation of graduates for the job market. Research, community outreach and campus sustainability practices need to be further addressed. Therefore, primary efforts should be exerted to improve the outcomes at these domains, especially that the university now joined the international educational programme: RUCAS--Tempus project, which emphasises development and improvements at all the institution sectors.

AB  - With the continuous growth of cyberinfrastructure throughout modern society, the need for secure computing and communication is more important than ever before. As a result, there is also an increasing need for entry-level developers who are capable of designing and building practical solutions for systems with stringent security requirements. This calls for careful attention to algorithm choice and implementation method, as well as trade-offs between hardware and software implementations. This article describes motivation and efforts taken by three departments at Rochester Institute of Technology (Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Software Engineering) that were focused on creating a multidisciplinary course that integrates the algorithmic, engineering, and practical aspects of security as exemplified by applied cryptography. In particular, the article presents the structure of this new course, topics covered, lab tools and results from the first two spring quarter offerings in 2011 and 2012.

AB  - With integrated curricula and multidisciplinary assessments becoming more prevalent in medical education, there is a continued need for educational research to explore the advantages, consequences, and challenges of integration practices. This retrospective analysis investigated the number of items needed to reliably assess anatomical knowledge in the context of gross anatomy and histology. A generalizability analysis was conducted on gross anatomy and histology written and practical examination items that were administered in a discipline-based format at Indiana University School of Medicine and in an integrated fashion at the University of Alabama School of Medicine and Rush University Medical College. Examination items were analyzed using a partially nested design [sx(i:o)] in which items were nested within occasions (i:o) and crossed with students (s). A reliability standard of 0.80 was used to determine the minimum number of items needed across examinations (occasions) to make reliable and informed decisions about students' competence in anatomical knowledge. Decision study plots are presented to demonstrate how the number of items per examination influences the reliability of each administered assessment. Using the example of a curriculum that assesses gross anatomy knowledge over five summative written and practical examinations, the results of the decision study estimated that 30 and 25 items would be needed on each written and practical examination to reach a reliability of 0.80, respectively. This study is particularly relevant to educators who may question whether the amount of anatomy content assessed in multidisciplinary evaluations is sufficient for making judgments about the anatomical aptitude of students.

AB  - The curriculum for undergraduate Agricultural Engineering does not usually include much laboratory practice. In order to address this, here we propose the design of a practical class on legume-rhizobia symbiosis, using an interdisciplinary approach that takes elements from botany, agriculture, and microbiology. The students perform an assay to stimulate nodulation in chickpea seedlings through inoculation with "Mesorhizobium" strains recommended as commercial inoculants, and evaluate improvement in plant growth as a result of nitrogen fixation. The experiment could serve as a springboard to discuss the importance of plant-bacteria interactions in the cultivation of a regionally relevant crop. It may also encourage the use of abilities of different kinds, including the appropriate manipulation of lab materials, the active engagement of scientific thought, the application of knowledge to specific real world scenarios and collaborative teamwork, all of which will be of paramount importance throughout the students' careers. The class can be easily adapted for other degrees connected to environmental microbiology, as well as for other symbiotic pairs that may include significant crops from other regions around the world.

AB  - Improving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education (STEM) is an international imperative as countries work to improve life and prospects for their people. Countries recognize that to improve economic prosperity and national security, their citizens should be prepared to work in a global society that is characterized by digital, technological, and scientific literacy and requires divergent, flexible creative thinking. In today's market, almost 100% of jobs require critical thinking and active listening, 70% require mathematical knowledge, and 60% require oral comprehension and expression. Many educators and researchers are now calling for STEA(arts)M education to be the approach of choice through which teachers may facilitate growth in habits of mind and practice that are characteristic of a globally literate citizen. Based on the fact that both art and engineering are based in similar processes of design, this educational choice may be the key to unlocking more equitable access to global literacy

AB  - A unique undergraduate team that spans five different engineering disciplines, chemistry, biology, and mathematics was formed. The team was formed to promote cross-disciplinary learning, to improve retention, and to prepare the students for the kind of problems they will face in their careers. This paper describes the variety of activities used over 2 years to tie the team together, as well as afford opportunities to develop team-building skills. The activities described highlight the critical elements of a faculty leader whose own work is interdisciplinary, correct balance of disciplines in the team, and sufficient time for team development. The use of external feedback was essential for all activities. Clearly defined goals and hard deadlines were critical for the completion of individual activities, as well as developing a healthy team environment. Although the student cohort has learned from the activities, more time is needed to assess whether the students have become a fully efficient team. Furthermore, an additional cohort would be needed to assess whether the approach was able to assist with student's interest in STEM and their desire to help other people.

AB  - A new vision of science learning described in the "Next Generation Science Standards"--particularly the science and engineering practices and their integration with content--pose significant challenges for large-scale assessment. This article explores what might be learned from advances in large-scale science assessment and accountability systems, and in our understanding of students' engagement with the science and engineering practices, to inform such efforts. We highlight promising examples from current large-scale assessment programs, an alternative national accountability model, and cutting-edge research and offer several cautions to the field.

AB  - Jamestown is at the heart of any teaching and learning of colonial American history. Stories of John Smith and Pocahontas are learned by elementary and secondary students across the United States. In Virginia, Jamestown is first taught in third grade and revisited five more times from historical, political, economic, and geographic perspectives. However, the history of Jamestown is taught principally as a place, a series of events, and people from long ago with little consideration of its place in the world today. The reality is that Jamestown Island, the location of the first permanent English settlement in the Americas, is today part of a thriving metropolitan area of approximately 1.7 million people. By examining a local policy issue such as plans to build power transmission lines across the James River in Virginia, students can investigate significant questions related to urban sprawl and the environment.

AB  - Current educational reform mandates the implementation of school-based models for early identification and intervention, progress monitoring, and data-based assessment of student progress. This article provides an overview of interdisciplinary collaboration for systems-level consultation within a Multi-Tiered System of Support (MTSS) framework. The roles of school psychologists and school-based administrators are presented in relation to the implementation of MTSS practices within an implementation science model. The training and expertise of each discipline are highlighted related to respective aspects of implementation drivers (i.e., competency, organization, leadership). Functions of principals and school psychologists during team-based, problem-solving MTSS practices are described based on a problem-solving framework consistent with school-based consultation. Future directions for graduate training of school psychologists and principals and directions for consultation research are provided.

AB  - An upper-division undergraduate chemistry experiment is described which utilizes DigiSim software to simulate cyclic voltammetry (CV). Four mechanisms were studied: a reversible electron transfer with no subsequent or proceeding chemical reactions, a reversible electron transfer followed by a reversible chemical reaction, a reversible chemical reaction followed by a reversible electron transfer, and a reversible electron transfer followed by a reversible chemical reaction followed by a reversible electron transfer. The experiment concludes with a student discussion of three journal articles that contain CV data. In addition to introducing students to the theory of CV, the experiment also reinforces the physical chemistry concepts of equilibrium and rate of reaction. Thus, it is suitable for a physical chemistry, instrumental analysis, or integrated/interdisciplinary laboratory experiment.

AB  - Much educational neuroscience research investigates connections between cognition, neuroscience, and educational theory and practice without reference to the body. In contrast, proponents of embodied cognition posit that the bodily action and perception play a central role in cognitive development. Some researchers within the field of Mind, Brain, and Education (MBE) explore this theory by researching the impact of sensorimotor activity on academic competencies such as language comprehension, mathematics, and scientific thinking. In this article, I call for this work to be highlighted more centrally in MBE training programs. Toward this end, I model an investigation of the concept of embodied cognition that can be used in MBE curricula with a dual purpose: to train future practitioners in the seminal metaphor of mind as an embodied system, and to demonstrate effective interdisciplinary research, which is critical to advancing the field of Mind, Brain, and Education.

AB  - Interdisciplinary teaching is a great way to focus on overarching concepts and help students make connections across disciplines. Historically, art and science have been connected disciplines. The botanical prints of the 18th and 19th centuries and early work with microscopes are two examples of a need for strong artistic skills in the science community. The study of cells and the use of microscopes are often taught in middle school using traditional methods. Although schools with the resources to purchase microscopes provide the requisite hands-on experience, the lessons are typically formulaic and allow for little student creativity. This article describes a miniunit that supplements a unit on the study of cells and the use of microscopes, which introduces the fundamentals of cellular biology. The miniunit promoted an inquiry approach to learning and was closely connected to the science and art content being addressed in both subject areas. (Contains 5 figures and 1 resource.)

AB  - Non-mathematics specialists' competence and confidence in mathematics in their disciplines have been highlighted as in need of improvement. We report from a collaborative, developmental research project which explores the conjecture that greater integration of mathematics and biology in biology study programs, for example through engaging students with Mathematical Modeling (MM) activities, is one way to achieve this improvement. We examine the evolution of 12 first-semester biology students' mathematical discourse as they engage with such activities in four sessions which ran concurrently with their mandatory mathematics course and were taught by a mathematician with extensive experience with MM. The sessions involved brief introductions to different aspects of MM, followed by small-group work on tasks set in biological contexts. Our analyses use the "theory of commognition" to investigate the tensions between "ritualized and exploratory participation" in the students' MM activity. We focus particularly on a quintessential "routine" in MM, "assumption building": we trace attempts which start from ritualized engagement in the shape of "guesswork" and evolve into more productively exploratory formulations. We also identify signs of persistent "commognitive conflict" in the students' activity, both "intra-mathematical" (concerning what is meant by a "math task") and "extra-mathematical" (concerning what constitutes a plausible solution to the tasks in a biological sense). Our analyses show evidence of the fluid interplay between ritualized and exploratory engagement in the students' discursive activity and contribute towards what we see as a much needed distancing from operationalization of the commognitive constructs of ritual and exploration as an unhelpfully dichotomous binary.

AB  - With the evolution of the surrounding world market, engineers have to propose innovations in products and processes. Industrial innovation frequently results from an improved understanding of basic physics. In this paper, an approach to accelerate inventive preliminary design is presented. This method combines the main advantages of CBR (Case Based Reasoning) and TRIZ (Russian acronym for Theory of Solving Inventive Problem) to   transfer physics to industrial technology. Based on this synergy, interactive web-based environments are developed. These systems are intended not only to enhance students to become familiar with basic physics, but also to support students in building meaningful links between basic physics and industrial technologies. The evaluation was conducted in a "Special Project Design" course requiring students to design a robot that could carry out several functions. Robotics, an interdisciplinary engineering subject, has been a recurring theme in engineering education. Project-based learning provides opportunities for interdisciplinary learning. With project-based learning approaches, planning activities and investigations play a critical role in the project process. Through the web-based environments, students can explore the essence of basic physics, design technologies, and the integration of mechatronics. Further, web-based reasoning and meaningful learning modules are developed to scaffold creative design and to enhance student participation, motivation, and learning effectiveness. Quantitative and qualitative methods such as questionnaires and interviews were used to evaluate the effects of the developed system. Findings showed that inquiry modules were able to facilitate investigation and planning activities in product design stages. The responses obtained were very encouraging. Students in the course were appreciative of these on-going changes and indicated that these were indeed helping them to develop their engineering thinking and design skills, increasing their motivation to study.

AB  - For many, the dominant model of curriculum development in science includes generating a topic, clarifying science content, identifying activities associated with the topic, and figuring out an assessment. Unfortunately, this approach tends to overemphasize activities and underemphasize mastery of science concepts and the process of scientific inquiry. The National Standards for Science Education should stand as the learning outcomes for any science curriculum. However, educators also need to focus on how students learn; on integrating laboratory experiences with other activities in the classroom; and on ensuring rigorous, focused, and coherent content in the context of a curriculum that focuses on the process of scientific inquiry and the acquisition of conceptual knowledge. The Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS), with funding from the National Science Foundation, offers an effective alternative to the traditional high school sequence of biology, chemistry, and physics. Each year begins with a two-week Science as Inquiry unit, followed by three core units that last eight weeks each in physical science, life science, and earth-space science. The last unit of the year is multidisciplinary and examines compelling issues in science and society. Students who used the program showed average gains in science understanding of 20-25 percent.

AB  - Even though many educators are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math), science often does not receive the attention in elementary school that it should. One way to ensure that elementary school children have the science experiences they need and deserve is to use it as a context to teach math and other subjects. When students have concrete experiences (such as a science activity), abstract ideas are more easily understood. The 5-day life science activity using M&M's that is presented in this article is one that the authors have implemented using the 5E instructional model with third graders is an effective way to have children explore adaptations of organisms and mathematical concepts.

AB  - A multidisciplinary experiment for advanced undergraduate students has been developed in the context of extractive metallurgy. The experiment serves as a model of an important modern industrial process that combines aspects of organic/inorganic synthesis and analysis. Students are tasked to prepare a salicylaldoxime ligand and samples of the corresponding copper and nickel complexes, before performing test extractions and UV-vis spectroscopic analysis. The oxime ligand demonstrates a clear preference for extraction of Cu[superscript 2+] in the presence of Ni[superscript 2+] from aqueous solution under the conditions described. It is also possible to demonstrate that the ligand can be recovered and reused. The experiment has successfully been employed in a final year project-based laboratory course involving small groups of students.

AB  - This paper describes a project undertaken as an interdisciplinary effort among four science departments, two disabilities services offices, and special education personnel to investigate the use and success of assistive technology devices as well as other equipment modifications in an attempt to transform science laboratories into environments where students with disabilities can function independently. The methods were developed and tested for entry-level science courses in chemistry, biology, geology, and physics, and could also be applied to other disciplines. Students with a wide variety of physical or visual disabilities were recruited to perform lab skills typically used in science experiments. Equipment evaluated ranged from high-end computerized magnification systems to glassware easily modified by the lab instructor. Because chemistry labs present significantly more safety issues than the other science disciplines, special attention was given to how students were able to perform tasks without endangering themselves or others. Results of the project emphasize the importance of identifying each student's type and degree of disability in order to effectively determine the equipment requirements.

AB  - An integrated science curriculum assists pupils to retain learnings better than to separate academic disciplines. Too frequently, science teachers teach each academic discipline as separate entities. However, there is much correlating of science with language, for example which might well be implemented in teaching and learning situations. Thus, reading, writing, and listening skills need developing in order to strengthen the science curriculum.

AB  - This paper explores how to practice posthumanism in everyday life. This idea has increasingly come under scrutiny by posthumanist theorists, who are addressing fundamental ontological and epistemological questions in regard to defining an essential "human," as well as the elastic boundary work between the human and nonhuman subject. Posthumanism is essential for considering today's environmental problems and environmental science education. This paper then has three goals: developing posthumanist ontology, exploring methodology, and investigating whether environmental science education and practices can help students, teachers, and community in learning, teaching, and practicing processes. I demonstrate the complementary contributions from two Indigenous communities' field studies that can be made when a researcher moves beyond an exclusive focus on western interests and considers participants as co-researchers. This paper concludes with a discussion of implications for this field.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the varied roles played by the University of Lódz (UL) in maintaining and restoring the natural capital of a city as a driver for sustainable city development. The higher education institution can be perceived as visionary, originator and executor of natural capital projects. Design/Methodology/Approach: The paper analyses three cases performed by the Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, UL, in the city of Lódz. The activities are based on different scales ranging from city-wide to local, e.g. river and green infrastructure, and which vary in character from policy planning to implementation. Findings: Natural capital projects influence city development on different levels: by the initiation of legal protection, by the implementation of rehabilitation concepts for rivers and by influencing the strategic documents for mid-term and long-term urban development. Originality/Value: The university has the potential for multidisciplinary engagement in the development of urban sustainability. In large-scale projects, academics play a more conceptual role, in capacity building and knowledge transfer, while in local-scale implementations, their role includes innovation, know-how and technology transfer. Moreover, it may act as a reinforcement hub, by safeguarding and strengthening the natural capital of the city.

AB  - As perhaps the most encompassing idea in biology, evolution has impacted not only science, but other academic disciplines as well. The broad, interdisciplinary impact of evolution was the theme of a course taught at Marian College, Indianapolis, Indiana in 2002, 2004, and 2006. Using a strategy that could be readily adopted at other institutions, professors from other, non-biological disciplines were asked to speak with the class regarding the impact of Darwin specifically or evolution more broadly on their field of study. A political scientist, literature expert, language professor, historian, theologian, art historian, and sociologist have all participated in this course. Student comments have been overwhelmingly positive and suggest the course format affected their thinking with respect to both the humanities and the science of evolution.

AB  - Due to its haptic and interactive nature, virtual anatomy provides an opportunity for small-group learning, enabling students to develop their group work skills before they graduate. However, there is currently little practical guidance supported by pedagogic principles detailing how to incorporate it into curricula. Anatomy educators at the University of Plymouth conducted action research aiming to capture students' overall perceptions of the virtual anatomy platform Anatomage. Questioning the benefits and challenges students face while interacting with Anatomage prompted the creation of evidence-based interventions to be later evaluated. Although a plethora of themes were identified, this report specifically examines those relating to group work. Thematic analysis of initial focus group data found group size and group dynamics impacted students' experience with the platform. Following the implementation of interventions to resolve these issues, a questionnaire and second series of focus groups were conducted to determine whether they were successful. Additional subthemes found from these data included facilitation, social pressure, peer learning and working with friends. This study contributed to the improvement of small group learning and integration of virtual anatomy into curricula based on student and staff feedback. As such, these data support the development of effective group working skills which are fundamental for healthcare professionals and widely recognized by regulators such as the General Medical Council and Health and Care Professions Council. In this report, the authors provide practical advice informed by pedagogy and principles from management and psychology to provide a multidisciplinary perspective.

AB  - The National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project "Mathematics, Science, and Technology Partnership" (MSTP) developed a multidisciplinary instructional model for connecting mathematics to science, technology and engineering content areas at the middle school level. Specifically, the model infused mathematics into middle school curriculum through the alignment of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curriculum, creating a mathematics infused curriculum planning template for teachers, and the implementation of connected STEM professional development workshops in middle schools. Through data collected from teachers, administrators, and faculty members involved in these activities, it was found that all involved were satisfied with connected curriculum, STEM teachers were able to successfully increase their own mathematics pedagogy and content knowledge, and students were able to grasp mathematical concepts when they were applied in science, technology, or engineering content areas.

AB  - Is in-depth political learning possible in college-preparatory courses known for curricular breadth at an accelerated pace plus a high-stakes exam? A multidisciplinary research team conducted design-based implementation research (DBIR) for seven years across three school systems for the purpose of achieving deeper learning in an 'advanced' high school government and politics course. This article reports findings from the final year of research and development. The design centres on cyclical learning, projects (simulated political processes) and strategic use of texts as resources for learning the curriculum. Quantitative analysis shows comparable achievement to students in traditional classrooms on the high-stakes summative assessment despite the dramatic departure from test-prep instruction. Qualitative analyses focus on two of the design elements: learning from simulations and learning from text. The first allowed students to 'experience' political beliefs, institutions, and conflict, although simulated; the second required students to learn subject matter not only from simulations and teacher lectures but from texts, too. The discussion shows how these two in combination with cyclical learning required skilful attention to content selection. We conclude that when deeper learning is the goal, content selection cannot be elided or presumed, particularly with respect to the articulation of depth and breadth in curriculum and instruction.

AB  - In this plenary address, I suggest that Complexity Theory has the potential to contribute a transdisciplinary theme to applied linguistics. Transdisciplinary themes supersede disciplines and spur new kinds of creative activity (Halliday 2001 [1990]). Investigating complex systems requires researchers to pay attention to system dynamics. Since applied linguists study language systems that change (for example, as they develop in learners), this is a useful perspective to bring to bear on many of our concerns. To introduce Complexity Theory, I list twelve principles undergirding this perspective and elaborate on three of them: those to do with dynamism, complexity, and the role of context. I then discuss several studies of L2 development that have been informed by the perspective. I conclude by suggesting that the ultimate promise of Complexity Theory is the help it provides in humanizing science. (Contains 1 footnote.)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the role that a collaborative teaching approach, referred to as a community of practice (CoP), had on a team of four second grade teachers' implementation of a science-based interdisciplinary curriculum. Data was collected in the form of extensive observation notes gathered over 10-weeks of twice weekly team meetings and two 45 minute interviews with each participant. From the field notes developed two vignettes for the purpose of illustrating the members CoP in action. Combining my analysis of the vignettes and the interviews resulted in three emergent themes: 1) benefits, 2) contributions, and 3) their commitment to professional development. From this study I learned that establishing a CoP was viewed as a necessary component of the team's implementation of their science-based interdisciplinary curriculum. Implications for encouraging preservice and inservice elementary teachers to develop CoPs to support science teaching, specifically interdisciplinary teaching, are discussed.

AB  - This paper describes how an interdisciplinary design team used the Four-Component Instructional Design (4C/ID) model and its accompanying Ten Steps design approach to systematically design a professional development program for teaching differentiation skills to primary school teachers. This description illustrates how insights from a cognitive task analysis into classroom differentiation skills were combined with literature-based instructional design principles to arrive at the training blueprint for workplace-based learning. It demonstrates the decision-making processes involved in the systematic design of each of the four components: learning tasks, supportive information, procedural information, and part-task practice. While the design process was time and resource-intensive, it resulted in a detailed blueprint of a five-month professional development program that strategically combines learning activities to stimulate learning processes that are essential for developing the complex skill "providing differentiated instruction in a mathematics lesson."

AB  - In this article, the underlying logic of experimentation is exemplified within the context of a photoelectrical experiment for students taking a high school engineering, technology, or chemistry class. Students assume the role of photochemists as they plan, fabricate, and experiment with a solar cell made of copper and an aqueous solution of sodium chloride. This multidisciplinary activity enables students to examine principles of chemistry, photonics, and electricity while reflecting the "Standards for Technological Literacy" and the "National Science Education Standards."

AB  - The authors collaborated on hosting a "Spring Inspire Day." planned and delivered by preservice elementary teachers as a social studies/science methods project. Projects that have authentic application opportunities can make learning meaningful for prospective teachers as well as elementary students. With the impetus for an integrated methods focus in place, the authors chose the concept of "change" to organize the two content areas. From this broad concept, they chose Farming Communities as the "topical theme" to begin developing social studies and science lessons. Preservice teachers broke into trios and were responsible for writing a proposal to submit for "Inspire Day" lessons using the theme while weaving both the "Next Generation Science Standards" (NGSS) and National Council of Social Studies (NCSS) Standards into the lessons. This article describes how fifth graders take an interdisciplinary field trip to a farm and learn science and local history in the process at "Spring Inspire Day."

AB  - There is increasing enthusiasm for teaching approaches that combine mathematics and biology. The call for integrating more quantitative work in biology education has led to new teaching tools that improve quantitative skills. Little is known, however, about whether increasing interdisciplinary work can lead to adverse effects, such as the development of broader but shallower skills or the possibility that math anxiety causes some students to disengage in the classroom, or, paradoxically, to focus so much on the mathematics that they lose sight of its application for the biological concepts in the center of the unit at hand. We have developed and assessed an integrative learning module and found disciplinary learning gains to be equally strong in first-year students who actively engaged in embedded quantitative calculations as in those students who were merely presented with quantitative data in the context of interpreting biological and biostatistical results. When presented to advanced biology students, our quantitative learning tool increased test performance significantly. We conclude from our study that the addition of mathematical calculations to the first year and advanced biology curricula did not hinder overall student learning, and may increase disciplinary learning and data interpretation skills in advanced students.

AB  - Children with intellectual disabilities have difficulties in language acquisition and learning in general and therefore demands specialized and effective instructional strategies. For this reason, the purpose of this study was to examine effectiveness of integrating drawing, as a specialized instruction, in teaching English Language to children with intellectual disabilities. Quasi-experiment was employed with which pre-test and post-test of both control and experimental groups were analyzed. The results saw the experimental group performing better in the post-test results as compared to the control group, proving that integrating drawing in teaching English Language is an effective instructional strategy. Therefore, the researchers recommend that teachers and other educational implementers working with children with intellectual disabilities should consider integrating drawing in teaching and learning of English Language.

AB  - The pandemic has had a significant impact on the work of many family and consumer sciences (FCS) professionals and those in related fields across the world, including college student interns. Across disciplines, it is well established that quality internships can help students enhance their professional development, networking, and multicultural skills; internships also can enhance university-community partnerships (Horney et al., 2016; Simons et al., 2012). Yet, during the pandemic, many students who had secured internships, including in essential work fields, found themselves struggling to secure sites. At the same time, many students needed the internship to graduate on time; thus, we knew we needed to create an internship pandemic plan. FCS is an applied science (AAFCS, n.d.), therefore many of us have been trained to think creatively about how to relay research-based information to community audiences. Similarly, it is in our backgrounds to create opportunities for university-community partnerships and to train students to do the same. In this paper, we focus on the ways the pandemic pushed us to come together as applied scientists and educators to create virtual internships and train students to be applied scientists.

AB  - This article draws on a pedagogical case study in order to reflect on the value of using a Humanities disciplinary practice (the "close reading" of literary studies) as a method of educational enquiry and to provide a worked example of this approach. We explore the introduction of a pedagogic strategy--students writing abstracts for essays and sharing them in advance of group discussion--into the tutorial at the University of Oxford, and an evaluation of it. We then read the student "texts" (written abstracts and evaluation forms) more closely, to problematize the initial evaluation findings and reveal hidden aspects of student learning and the teaching relationship. We reflect upon our approach and suggest some of the difficulties and advantages of "close reading" student texts while achieving scholarly "distance" as a pedagogic research practice. In addition, we explore further the relations between social science and humanities approaches to educational enquiry.

AB  - In the difficult current socio-economic context, overqualified graduates are increasingly facing challenges in terms of entering the job market and finding jobs which fit their levels of qualifications and satisfaction. Grounded in an auto-ethnography approach, this paper reflects on the challenges that the author (a young female European PhD graduate) experienced when she entered the job market. The ultimate aim is to contribute to the understanding of some aspects of the current situation of numerous overqualified young people, especially in social sciences and the humanities, who have difficulties in terms of simply finding jobs or jobs which fit their levels of qualifications and salary expectations. In this regard, it highlights the responsibility of higher education policies and academic institutions for contributing to the degradation of PhDs' unemployment and overskilling. Ultimately, it points out possible some solutions such as the potential of interdisciplinary academic research (including higher education and gender research) to successfully inform higher education policy in view of tackling the issue of the labour market relevance of PhDs' skills and attributes.

AB  - This study seeks to explore what factors influence students' ICT use and web technology competence. The objectives of this study are the following: (a) To what extent do certain elements of Rogers' (2003) Diffusion of Innovations Theory (DOI) explain students' ICT use, (b) To what extent do personality characteristics derived from the Big Five approach explain students' ICT use, and (c) To what extent does motivation explain students' ICT use. The research was conducted in Israel during the second semester of the academic year 2013-14, and included two groups of participants: a group of Educational Technology students (ET) and a group of Library and Information Science students (LIS). Findings add another dimension to the importance of Rogers' DOI theory in the fields of Educational Technology and Library and Information Science. Further, findings confirm that personality characteristics as well as motivation affect ICT use. If instructors would like to enhance students' ICT use, they should be aware of individual differences between students, and they should present to students the advantages and usefulness of ICT, thus increasing their motivation to use ICT, in the hopes that they will become innovators or early adopters. Appended are: (1) ICT Questionnaire; (2) Attitude Questionnaire; (3) The Big Five Questionnaire; and (4) Motivation Questionnaire.

AB  - We describe a third-year undergraduate course that focuses on multiscale modeling and protein folding and has as its primary goal the encouragement of students to integrate thinking across and beyond disciplinary boundaries. The ability to perform innovative and successful research work in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields is often dependent on being aware of the multiple connections between the sciences, but how to develop such an integrated perspective is rarely taught in college classes. Designed for STEM majors, the course combines laboratory sessions and lectures, assessed through student journals and oral presentations. We report on some of the activities we developed for this course and on the associated outcomes. A syllabus, an assessment, and interview questions, as well as examples of student responses, are provided as supplementary materials. The course topics discussed in this article include an analogy between desiccated corn starch and basaltic columns, a discussion of the size of trees, diffusion at the microscopic and macroscopic levels, and computational aspects of protein folding. Teaching materials, including handouts, experimental methods, and MATLAB codes, as well as student journals, are available from the course website.

AB  - Background and Context: Computational Thinking (CT) has been recently integrated into new and revised Digital Technologies content (DTC) in the Technology learning area of the New Zealand School Curriculum. Objective: To aid this change, this research examined how CT supports learning outcomes in both music and programming with the Sonic Pi platform. Method: A mixed-methods case study designed by the researcher was developed and trialled in a regular middle school classroom. The design of instruments and analysis utilised a widely used CT assessment framework at a school level. Findings: Many successes and challenges not reported in the literature on how CT can support learning outcomes in music and programming were revealed. Implications: Provided some significant limitations are considered, the major implication of the results suggest educators can use Sonic Pi to support many learning outcomes in music and programming for interested students.

AB  - Using socio-ecological theory, this study explores best practice (educational practices correlated with higher student performance) in middle-school science. Seven schools with consistently higher student performance were compared with three demographically similar, average-performing schools. Best practice included instructional approaches (relevance and engagement, inquiry, differentiated instruction, collaborative work, moderate amounts of homework, and integration of language literacy and science) and administrative practices (nurturing a climate of opportunity to succeed in science, offering professional development based on data and dialogue, engaging teachers in standards-based curriculum revision and alignment, and recruiting the right fit of teacher). It is argued that best practice entails multiple levels of teaching and administrative praxis that together form a school-wide socio-ecological system conducive to higher performance.

AB  - Early elementary teachers are under great pressure to teach all children to read and write at highly proficient levels while simultaneously emphasizing STEM instruction to prepare students for the 21st century. Traditionally, literacy skills are taught in isolation from science instruction. However, reading and writing are the perfect tools to use for inquiry and reasoning, for creating a hypothesis, and for gathering, evaluating, and analyzing data. In this article, the authors describe how literacy and science instruction can be merged to create innovative, stimulating, and enriching learning experiences for young children.

AB  - As pandemic lockdowns creep onwards to the end of 2020 many of my higher education students have become disempowered and despondent. In a bid to revive their agency and resilience a postgraduate class was offered this essay for critique. Karma is examined from contemporary understandings, and historical, and spiritual contexts, including some specifics from a Buddhist perspective where the intentions that impel actions become the prime determinants of resulting effects. Agentic attention to causality, interconnection and intention, endemic in global epistemologies, is presented as an empowering consideration regarding individual and collective activities to future researchers in the human sciences.

AB  - The relevance of the problem under study is based on the necessity to achieve effectiveness of the learning process aimed at forming a competent specialist and ensuring the quality of training of vocational teacher of a certain subject (design). The aim of the article is to provide theoretical substantiation, to elaborate and to test the structural-conceptual model of forming artistic-design competency of vocational design teacher which is important for successful professional activity within the mobile environment of modern production and learning process. The leading approach to studying the problem is the system approach which allows to review the learning process in interdisciplinary interaction that ensures integration of educational subjects' content into a united professional field of activity to contribute to formation of professional competencies of vocational teacher. The structural-conceptual model of forming artistic-design competency of vocational design teacher is presented and includes the following blocks: scientific-methodological which includes fundamentals of social, historical and natural sciences, and practice-oriented including educational activity determined by specific features of designer's activity which requires knowledge and process algorithms that ensure execution of certain artistic and design-creative tasks. The structural-conceptual model is aimed at forming the artistic-design competency of vocational design teachers, ensures effectiveness and quality of students' education, as well as their adaptation to changing environment of professional activity. The materials can be useful for academic researchers and practitioners in the sphere of professional and vocational education, as well as for candidates for a master's degree and students of vocational universities, institutes and faculties.

AB  - A new, interdisciplinary, team-taught course has been designed to educate students in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) so that they can respond to global and urgent issues concerning computer control systems in nuclear power plants. This paper discusses our experience and assessment of the interdisciplinary computer and nuclear energy course, which was developed and offered primarily to ECE students at Howard University. A unique team-teaching model utilized with ECE professors and nuclear field experts was applied to teach the two diverse subjects: computer safety and nuclear energy. The survey result from the first offering of the course showed a very positive response from the majority of the students about the team-teaching method and the knowledge acquired on the two subjects.

AB  - Effective instructional materials can be valuable interventions to improve student interest and achievement in science (National Research Council [NRC], 2007); yet, analyses indicate that many science instructional materials and curricula are fragmented, lack coherence, and are not carefully articulated through a sequence of grade levels (AAAS, 2001; Schmidt et al., 2001). In order to improve student achievement in science, school districts need evidence about the efficacy of instructional materials so they can make sound decisions about their science programs. In addition, science education researchers and curriculum developers can benefit from a better understanding of the characteristics of instructional materials and PD that promote student achievement. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of an intervention that consists of research-based multidisciplinary science curriculum materials for high school students and curriculum-based professional development (PD) for teachers using the materials. The study took place in traditional high schools the state of Washington. Approximately half of the schools were in rural settings in central Washington, the other half were in suburban settings in western Washington. The study sample included nearly 4,000 ninth and tenth grade students nested within 18 high schools. The teacher sample within these 18 schools included 54 teachers. Ninth and tenth grade science teachers in nine treatment schools received curriculum materials and seven days of curriculum-based professional development for each of two years. Teachers in nine comparison schools continued to use extant instructional materials and receive extant professional development (i.e., business-as-usual). A cluster-randomized trial design (Raudenbush et al., 2002) was used where schools were randomly assigned to treatment conditions. Findings showed that research-based science instructional materials with supporting curriculum-based PD have a strong positive effect on classroom instruction and a modest but noteworthy effect on student achievement. One figure is appended.

AB  - Extra credit assignments are often viewed with disdain by educators as opportunities to earn points for students that lack the study skills to do well on exams and quizzes. However, these assignments can serve as a platform for students to apply the course material to their own lives, optimizing their strengths and creativity, and encouraging them to take ownership of their learning. In this paper we discuss how we used extra credit assignments in a two-semester Human Anatomy and Physiology course to develop community outreach, art exhibits, and education events to empower our students and make science accessible to the public.

AB  - This research was carried out to understand the role of visual arts in the teaching and learning of science among Grade 3 teachers and students. A mixture of qualitative and quantitative research design was used to discover the different perceptions of both teachers and students on the role of visual arts in science. The data for the research was obtained from an international school in Malaysia through a survey distributed to the teachers and students. The researchers identified how the usage of visual arts motivated students to learn science. The research was supported with literature reviews of various educationists. The study found that children's mental and physical development was not merely enhanced and stimulated through the learning of science alone but with the integration of visual arts which aids their growth and progress. The findings also indicated that almost all teachers and students gave positive views for the integration of visual arts in science lessons. Teachers noticed positive changes among their learners as they enjoyed the freedom of choosing their preferred form of art to express their learning of science. Teachers also noticed that integrating visual arts as a medium to teach science motivated students to attain a higher level of achievement. Finally, it is concluded that visual arts play a useful role in the teaching and learning science. Since visual arts has been proven to play an important role in the development of individuals, the researchers advocate for its integration in science lessons at all levels of study to promote higher order thinking skills and abilities to survive in the 21st century.

AB  - This paper proposes social living labs for informed learning as an innovative approach to interprofessional and community education. It presents a new conceptual model and practice framework suited to rapidly changing, information-intensive work and social environments. The proposed approach is theoretically informed and evidence based. It integrates concepts from three complementary fields: Informed learning as information literacy pedagogy that enables using information critically and creatively to learn (information science); interprofessional education as a professional learning model with a cross-disciplinary and community reach (health sciences/medicine); and social living labs as informal learning context and problem-solving process (community development). After reviewing relevant literature, the paper introduces the concepts and research that underpin social living labs for informed learning. Then it presents a new conceptual model and a practice framework to guide their design and implementation. To illustrate the practical application of this approach, a hypothetical scenario envisages health practitioners, librarians and community members collaborating in a social living lab to address health and social challenges related to child obesity. The paper concludes by discussing anticipated benefits and limitations of the approach and possible wider application. As a contribution to theory, the paper uncovers a previously unrecognised synergy between the principles of informed learning, social living labs and interprofessional education. Supporting information literacy research and practice, the paper identifies a significant role for informed learning in community and professional education, and a novel strategy for health information literacy development. The paper is of interest to educators, researchers, and practitioners across information literacy, community development, healthcare, and other professional fields.

AB  - This essay introduces and analyzes a one-class role-play simulation during which students engage in stakeholder negotiations on how to respond to a large flow of refugees between two fictional African countries. Participants acquire an in-depth knowledge of arguments regarding granting and restricting refugees' freedom of movement and civil and economic rights. Contributing to the expanding literature on active and interdisciplinary teaching strategies, this content-oriented simulation teaches public policy, as well as humanitarian and development responses in the wake of a large influx of forced migrants in a developing country. The simulation thus addresses questions related to courses on development, conflict and refugee studies, international organizations, human rights, and international relations. Based on six iterations of the simulation, the essay discusses specific design decisions in the preparation, interaction, and debriefing stage and their impact on the simulation, as well as principal learning outcomes. This includes detailed discussions of briefing memos, role sheets, role selection, and key questions during the debriefing session.

AB  - This practical lesson on greenhouses implements standards of the Next Generation Science Standards ("K-2 ETS I-2"; "K-LS1-1") and the preschool objectives from the Teaching Strategies GOLD. Teaching Strategies GOLD is an assessment tool available online and in print that can be used with any developmentally appropriate early childhood curriculum. The lesson structure follows the 5E's Learning Cycle Constructivist Model for teaching and the project-based, hands-on approach to learning. The preschool-aged children went on a field trip to a working greenhouse and then collaborated in groups to produce a three-dimensional model of a greenhouse as arts integration into this science project. The children affixed photo stickers from their greenhouse visit onto a recycled plastic container to make the greenhouse building. They used clay, toothpicks, and colored paper leaves to recreate models of plants they had seen and then planted real seeds. The following lesson on plants and greenhouses serves as a successful example of positive arts-integrated science; the children worked together with enjoyment and took pride in their work while the teacher evaluated it as rewarding.

AB  - The purpose of this meta-analysis is to combine the results of experimental research completed between 2012 and 2022 and to examine the effects of different integrated STEM approaches on the attitudes of elementary school children. In the meta-analysis for the study on the effects of several integrated STEM approaches on the attitudes of elementary school children, five studies were selected based on particular criteria. The study included subgroup analyses in addition to exposing the overall effect of various integrated STEM approaches on the attitudes of elementary school children. According to the research findings, the Hedges g value, which is calculated to be 0.279 for the total effect size of diverse integrated STEM approaches on the attitudes of elementary school pupils, shows a small influence. In addition, the results of the analysis revealed that the impacts of different integrated STEM approaches on the attitudes of primary school pupils did not differ according to grade levels, but differed according to attitude area and integration.

AB  - Project/problem-based learning (PBL) can provide an effective model for school reform when implemented with fidelity. In the report, "Rising Above the Gathering Storm," it was recommended that if the U.S. is to remain competitive in the 21st-century economy, there must be a serious effort to "enlarge the pipeline of students who are prepared to enter college and graduate with a degree in STEM" (National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, & Institute of Medicine, 2007, p. 6). The report included the recommendation that states develop statewide specialty STEM high schools (National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, & Institute of Medicine, 2007, p. 6). In 2010, the Texas Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Academy (T-STEM) initiative was implemented to develop specialty STEM schools similar to those described in "Rising Above the Gathering Storm." The primary instructional strategy of T-STEM academies is problem- and project-based learning. In the STEM context, PBL is well suited as a primary pedagogy for STEM learning. This paper examines the following questions: What outcomes occur when PBL is implemented in a low performing school district? What is the role of PBL in school improvement? What are the challenges to implementing PBL with high fidelity?

AB  - The Federal University of São Paulo, Baixada Santista Campus was founded in 2006 with five degree-granting programs in physical education, physiotherapy, nutrition, psychology, and occupational therapy. The guiding principle behind the programs' educational mission was centered on the development of health care professionals capable of working in interdisciplinary teams with an emphasis on holistic patient care. This pedagogical structure required peer-mentoring programs in order to integrate different areas of knowledge and to improve learning strategies among new generations of students. The authors' objective in the present report is to discuss the strategies and activities of the peer-mentoring program in histophysiology and gross anatomy in an interdisciplinary and interprofessional curriculum. Evaluations by students, mentors and professors are presented, along with a statistical analysis of variance comparing student performance in the module assessments according to their participation in the peer-mentoring activities. The results demonstrated that students who participated in peer-mentoring activities enjoyed a higher rate of academic success than those who did not participate. In addition, student and mentor evaluations of the peer mentoring program were highly positive. The program enabled mentors to gain a deeper knowledge of the subjects addressed in the learning modules, as well as to develop intrinsic teaching skills during their time as mentors. In short, the authors believe that the peer-mentoring program has been validated for its effectiveness in raising student academic performance.

AB  - If the true efficacy of preservice programs in the overall development of science teachers is to be accurately assessed, researchers and practitioners must work toward establishing a solid research base that critically examines the linkages between teacher preparation, classroom instruction, and pupil learning, to act as a lens to guide practice and feed information back into existing teacher education programs to improve their quality. The U.S. NSF-funded IMPPACT Project represents a multi-university, collaborative research study that was developed in response to the need for empirical evidence regarding the efficacy of science teacher preparation programs. The purposes of this longitudinal, mixed methods study were to: 1) better understand secondary science teachers' learning of content and pedagogy over time as a result of key interventions within these preparation programs; 2) assess the subsequent impact of this learning on their classroom teaching and student achievement; and 3) determine what factors significantly influenced these teachers' beliefs and classroom practices following graduation. Interdisciplinary research teams at each university were responsible for collection and analysis of data, while a panel of experts provided the research team with technical assistance. Key research findings and their implications for preservice teacher education programs are highlighted.

AB  - Students at Iowa State University had the opportunity to enroll in a two-year National Science Foundation (NFS) Scholarship for Service (SFS) leadership development program, in addition to their work within their majors. This interdisciplinary program included faculty and students in computer engineering, computer science, mathematics, political science, management information systems, and education. The expected learning outcomes for this interdisciplinary effort were focused on "learning in community," specifically to develop professionals and citizens who will continue learning for life while consistently supporting and encouraging the growth of others. The purpose of this phenomenological research study was to examine students' experiences of learning in community in the SFS program. Participants identified a definable developmental process where students' experiences moved from resistance to the interactive and participatory nature of the class, to reluctance to step outside comfort zones, to reliance on others within the community, to assuming responsibility for self and others in the community.

AB  - This article discusses three kinds of mobility among early stage researchers: geographical mobility, mobility between disciplines -- or interdisciplinarity -- and cross-sectoral mobility. It focuses on how PhD fellows engage with and negotiate experiences of mobility. These types of mobility have largely been presented as inherently beneficial in mainstream policy discourse, but this article presents a more nuanced picture of mobility, showing the challenges of mobility, as experienced and articulated by PhD fellows and some of their supervisors. The research is based on twenty-six interviews with PhD fellows and principal investigators involved in two types of flagship doctoral programmes: the ITN in Europe, and the IGERT in the United States. The main finding is that PhD fellows associated all three types of mobility with feelings of homelessness.

AB  - The purpose of this case study was to create information about the employment of Cooperative Learning Groups (CLG) to enhance the science integrating learning objectives utilized in secondary CTE courses. The objectives of the study were to determine if CLGs were an effective means for increasing the number of: a) science integrating learning objectives utilized in CTE courses; and b) science integrating learning objectives that require higher levels of cognitive processing in CTE courses. The findings revealed that the CLG process lead to an increase in the total number of science integrating learning objectives and number of science integrating learning objectives requiring higher levels of cognition. Matched-sample t tests revealed that the increases in the number of science integrating learning objectives and objectives that require higher levels of cognition were statistically significant. It is recommended that researchers investigate further methods for improving cooperation between CTE and science teachers.

However, service learning has not been extensively assessed in courses based in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This article provides a case study of how incorporating service learning through a community outreach project can increase student engagement, enhance the depth of understanding of a given topic, build communication and teamwork skills, and contribute meaningfully to the students' community. This article shares how the instructor of a natural hazards, vulnerability, and risk course implements service-learning through a community outreach project and provides evidence for how such outreach can enhance student learning and address the common problem of student apathy and disengagement. Through this case study, the authors design, implement, and test a new model for community outreach-based service learning and discuss the transferability of this model to other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and social science courses.

AB  - We welcome you to the International Conference on Education and New Developments 2014, taking place in Madrid, Spain, from 28 to 30 of June, 2014. Education, as an important right in our contemporary world, began since we exist. Knowledge and skills were passed by adults to the young, and cultures began to extend their experiences through various forms. Schools and academies were formed since the most ancient civilizations. Although between innumerous difficulties, these experiences were capable to teach us how to develop better formative effects and to turn education a generalized and global right. Formal education and other educational practices are used by all of us in the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. This international conference seeks to provide explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. Our goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2014 received over more 292 submissions, from 40 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. It were accepted for presentation in the conference, 83 submissions (28% acceptance rate). The conference also includes a keynote presentation from the distinguished Professor Hanna David, Tel Aviv University (Emerita), Israel, to whom we express our most gratitude. This volume is composed by the proceedings of the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2014), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (W.I.A.R.S.) and co-sponsored by the respected partners we reference in the dedicated page. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. To develop the conference program we have chosen four main broad-ranging categories, which also covers different interest areas: (1) In TEACHERS AND STUDENTS: Teachers and Staff training and education; Educational quality and standards; Curriculum and Pedagogy; Vocational education and Counseling; Ubiquitous and lifelong learning; Training programs and professional guidance; Teaching and learning relationship; Student affairs (learning, experiences and diversity; Extracurricular activities; Assessment and measurements in Education. (2) In PROJECTS AND TRENDS: Pedagogic innovations; Challenges and transformations in Education; Technology in teaching and learning; Distance Education and eLearning; Global and sustainable developments for Education; New learning and teaching models; Multicultural and (inter)cultural communications; Inclusive and Special Education; Rural and indigenous Education; Educational projects.

AB  - Computing education in schools faces several problems, such as a lack of computing teachers and time in an already overloaded curriculum. A solution can be a multidisciplinary approach, integrating the teaching of computing within other subjects, creating the need to motivate teachers from other disciplines to teach computing in middle school. Therefore, the motivation and training of in-service teachers becomes crucial, as they need to have computing content and technological knowledge as well as pedagogical content knowledge. Yet, so far there exist very few training programs. Thus, as part of a comprehensive outreach program, we present a study on a one-day taster workshop for middle school teachers on physical computing education. Participants learn computer programming practice and computational thinking by programming an interactive robot. The workshop also approaches pedagogical aspects for teaching computing and technical issues regarding the installation and preparation of the required hardware/software. Preliminary results of its application with public school teachers in Florianopolis/Brazil are positive, motivating the majority of participants to introduce computing into their classes. However, our results also highlight that in order to enable teacher to apply the workshops effectively, longer training courses and ongoing support is required.

AB  - In a world where people interact across countries, citizens need to find their role in the global community; therefore, global citizenship (GC) has become an influential theme in higher education. Due to its various interpretations and modes of action, in this paper GC is addressed as a floating signifier. Our main data comes from interviews with ten academics from five UK universities that host internationalization programmes. The respondents were asked about the signified (in the Saussurian sense) that they attribute to GC, what skills are necessary to be a global citizen, and how the sciences contribute to the articulation of GC. Although showing different approaches to GC, academics agreed that the university is its main discursive context and that projects and programmes must involve all sciences in interdisciplinary relations.

AB  - The interdisciplinary nature of biochemistry courses requires students to use both chemistry and biology knowledge to understand biochemical concepts. Research that has focused on external representations in biochemistry has uncovered student difficulties in comprehending and interpreting external representations in addition to a fragmented understanding of fundamental biochemistry concepts. This project focuses on students' understanding of primary and secondary protein structure and drawings (representations) of hydrogen-bonding in alpha helices and beta sheets. Analysis demonstrated that students can recognize and identify primary protein structure concepts when given a polypeptide. However, when asked to draw alpha helices and beta sheets and explain the role of hydrogen bonding their drawings students exhibited a fragmented understanding that lacked coherence. Faculty are encouraged to have students draw molecular level representations to make their mental models more explicit, complete, and coherent. This is in contrast to recognition and identification tasks, which do not adequately probe mental models and molecular level understanding.

AB  - The problem of the research is due to the need to realize the didactic and interdisciplinary potential of mobile applications which are able to support the quest technology. Teachers have to understand peculiarities of organizing such a game form of activity in a digital school. The purpose of the study is to theoretically prove and experimentally test the effectiveness of using mobile game applications in the "quest" genre in order to form necessary competencies of future specialists in a digital school environment. The research methodology is the analysis and synthesis of psychological and pedagogical work, methods of mathematical statistics, and methods of psychodiagnostics. The pedagogical experiment of the study is the assessment of the formation of basic competences which provide the base in the field of computer science, cybernetics and artificial intelligence required by the state and society. Results of the study. The study proves the didactic potential of mobile applications which are able to support the quest technology in order to achieve high-priority objectives in the project "Digital School". The authors describe ideas of the methodical approach, which reflect the necessary changes in the support of students' cognitive activity through mobile game applications in the quest genre. The study shows levels of differentiation of education depending on the individual and age characteristics of students and the choice of digital means. The authors prove that the "quest" technology, focused work to solve education tasks, motivates future professional activities, and also with the help of modern digital means, contributes to the development of such necessary cross-professional competencies of future specialists as project activities, systems thinking, interaction and interindustry communication. In conclusion, the authors confirm that the inclusion of mobile game applications in the "quest" genre in education activities will help to form key competencies and skills that meet the priorities of the digital school and are most in demand by society.
