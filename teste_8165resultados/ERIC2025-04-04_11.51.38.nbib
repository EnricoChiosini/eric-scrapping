AB  - A readily implemented procedure is discussed for interval estimation of indexes of interrelationship between items from multiple-component measuring instruments as well as between items and total composite scores. The method is applicable with categorical (ordinal) observed variables, and can be widely used in the process of scale construction, revision, and development in social, behavioral, educational, and biomedical research. The approach can also be used for testing conventional or nontraditional hypotheses about these indexes. The procedure is illustrated with a numerical example.

AB  - This article reported and discussed the evaluation of a lecture, designed to change university students' values related with sustainable ways of living. The outcomes of the study were those obtained from the evaluation of the course titled "Education and Awareness for Sustainability", which has been offered for three years in the Department of Elementary Education, Middle East Technical University-Ankara (Turkey). The study was realized with the participation of 85 students from different faculties (faculty of education, economy, administration and engineering). The study comprised three steps: need assessment (NA), formative evaluation (FE) and summative evaluation (SE). The evaluation model of DIPO emphasizing needs-objectives relationship was used for evaluation. Analyzes, on the other hand, were realized by the use of both qualitative and quantitative research techniques. It was concluded as a result of the study that integrating real life cases with the issues in the course makes students feel comfortable about the course and feel themselves sensitive and responsible.

AB  - We examined students' understanding of the causes of a scientific phenomenon from a multiple-document-inquiry unit. Students read several documents that each described causal factors that could be integrated to address the given writing task of explaining the causes of change in average global temperature. We manipulated whether the document set included a document that took a position on climate change policies and whether a reading/writing prompt focused only on understanding the causes ("explain how and why recent temperature changes are occurring") or also included a solution-related addendum ("and what we can do about it"). The results suggest that including a policy-related document can lead to poorer learning outcomes for the causes of climate change, with evidence that students focused on policy in lieu of, rather than in relation to, a causal understanding of the issue.

AB  - One way in which university faculty members' professional lives have become more complex with the advent of contemporary university research centers is that many faculty have taken on additional roles. The authors' concern in this article is to determine the extent to which role strain is experienced by university faculty members who are affiliated with a university research center but who have academic appointments in university departments. The study is based on intensive interviews with 21 academic scientists and engineers affiliated with either NSF Engineering Research Centers (ERC) or Science and Technology Centers (STC) as well as with traditional academic departments. The NSF centers are of especial interest not only because they require a tenure-eligible appointment in an academic department or program but also because they are among the most complex of university research centers. The theoretical approach of the study draws from role theory and particularly concepts pertaining to role strain, as initially developed by Merton (1957a, 1957b), Goode (1960), and Kahn, Wolfe, Quinn, Snoek, and Rosenthal (1964). The study provides evidence of role strain. The authors' conjecture is that role strain, despite the recompense of added resources, sometimes takes a toll on the individual faculty researcher as well as on the supervisors who must adapt to the multiple allegiances and crosscutting duties of their charges. University centers have provided much institutional innovation. Perhaps it is now time to focus a bit more on the personnel management and policy issues those innovations have spawned.

AB  - The BSc in computer aided product design (CAPD) course at the University of Wolverhampton was conceived as a collaborative venture in 1989 between the School of Engineering and the School of Art and Design. The award was at the forefront of forging interdisciplinary collaboration at undergraduate level in the field of product design. It has integrated engineering design from the former with industrial design from the latter, developing a mixture of traditional, technical and design skills using the computer. The current paper discusses the use of formal methods of delivery on the CAPD course together with the integration of industrial product design and engineering design from a case study and project approach. It progresses from a formal approach through a transitional stage to an innovative method of delivery and assessment. In providing the framework to this innovative approach the paper utilizes examples of students' case studies, projects and design competitions that rely upon the use of three-dimensional (3D modelling) and both traditional prototyping and rapid prototyping techniques in developing the product design artefact. Combined with this is the utilization of a design process model that combines both product design and industrial design methodologies. The changing attitude of staff in the education of CAPD students, with respect to the integration of formal methods and innovative methods in case study and project scenarios, is also discussed.

AB  - Several medical schools have recently described new innovations in interprofessional interactions in gross anatomy courses. The Frank H. Netter MD School of Medicine at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, CT has developed and implemented two contrasting interprofessional experiences in first-year medical student gross anatomy dissection laboratories: long-term, informal visits by pathologists' assistant students who work with the medical students to identify potential donor pathologies, and a short-term, formal visit by fourth-year dental students who teach craniofacial anatomy during the oral cavity dissection laboratory. A survey of attitudes of participants was analyzed and suggest the interprofessional experiences were mutually beneficial for all involved, and indicate that implementing multiple, contrasting interprofessional interactions with different goals within a single course is feasible. Two multiple regression analyses were conducted to analyze the data. The first analysis examined attitudes of medical students towards a pathologists' assistant role in a health care team. The question addressing a pathologists' assistant involvement in the anatomy laboratory was most significant. The second analysis examined attitudes of medical students towards the importance of a good foundation in craniofacial anatomy for clinical practice. This perceived importance is influenced by the presence of dental students in the anatomy laboratory. In both instances, the peer interprofessional interactions in the anatomy laboratory resulted in an overall positive attitude of medical students towards pathologists' assistant and dental students. The consequences of these interactions led to better understanding, appreciation and respect of the different professionals that contribute to a health care team.

AB  - Investigating local watersheds presents middle school students with authentic opportunities to engage in inquiry and address questions about their immediate environment. Investigation activities promote learning in an investigations interdisciplinary context as students explore relationships among chemical, biological, physical, geological, and historical characteristics of the watershed. This helps them to understand changing trends in water quality, which can encourage students to formulate conclusions about the impact of land and water use and habitat issues. In addition, historical research of a watershed may help students understand changes and develop possible solutions to protect their watershed. Students can use web-based learning resources to assist them in their watershed investigations. This article describes the specific project design and provides guidelines for teachers considering  conducting their own watershed investigations.

AB  - The current wave of school reform, with its emphasis on assessment of basic reading, writing, and math skills, has resulted in a diminished role for other core subjects. In the United States, the No Child Left Behind Act calls for the addition of assessments in science, but it seems that social studies will be a core discipline that is left behind. Already, time devoted to social studies instruction in elementary schools has been reduced--a development that has no small number of educators worried. This article makes the case for preserving social studies instruction by focusing on the content literacy skills taught in reading and language arts. The authors question which skills are necessary for effective social studies learning. It is their belief that reading and comprehension strategies are central to the development of social studies concepts. The authors describe crosscurricular ways to use vocabulary development, writing, and story mapping so that language arts can help bridge the divide between social studies and the other core subjects emphasized in current school reform initiatives.

AB  - "Integrating Writing, Academic Discourses, and Service Learning: Project Renaissance and School/College Literacy Collaborations" discusses a year-long general education program for first-year students that integrated disciplinary learning with a pen pal project in light of the goals of critical pedagogy and service-learning. The program aimed at providing connecting students' lived experiences in the pen pal project with academic knowledges in order to increase their critical awareness of literacy as a complex social ability that is highly implicated social formations, such as individual opportunity and equity. The pen pal project, which involved a group of first-year college students at a northeastern state university and kindergarten, first, and second graders from a local public elementary school, helped ground the academic concepts studied in three disciplinary modules (biology, sociology, and philosophy) in experience through the college students' interactions (face-to-face and text-mediated) with their pen pals. College and elementary students, alike, found increased motivation toward literacy through the pen-pal exchanges. Additionally, this team-taught, writing-intensive year-long course encouraged the college students to write "with" the local community and to work towards developing a critical consciousness of the world around them.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of task relevance instructions and topic beliefs on reading processes and memory for belief-related text. Undergraduates received task instructions (focus on arguments for vs. against) before reading a dual-position text. In Experiment 1 (n = 88), a reading time methodology showed no differences in reading time for task-relevant and task-irrelevant text, but participants recalled task-relevant text better than task-irrelevant text independently of whether the information was consistent with their topic beliefs. In Experiment 2 (n = 76), a think-aloud methodology showed that participants engaged in confirmation strategies when reading belief-consistent text and disconfirmation strategies when reading belief-inconsistent text, independently of whether the information was relevant to their task instructions. Nonetheless, participants recalled task-relevant text better than task-irrelevant text. The results indicate that task relevance instructions affect memory independently of beliefs but that beliefs affect processing independently of task relevance instructions. Thus, moment-by-moment reading processes and memory for text can operate differently as a function of topic beliefs.

AB  - The social benefits expected from academia are generally identified as belonging to three broad categories: research, education and contribution to society in general. However, evaluating the present situation of academia according to these criteria reveals a somewhat disturbing phenomenon: an increased pressure to produce articles (in peer-reviewed journals) has created an unbalanced emphasis on the research criterion at the expense of the latter two. More fatally, this pressure has turned academia into a rat race, leading to a deep change in the fundamental structure of academic behaviour, and entailing a self-defeating and hence counter-productive pattern, where more publications is always better and where it becomes increasingly difficult for researchers to keep up with the new research in their field. The article identifies the pressure to publish as a problem of collective action. It ends up by raising questions about how to break this vicious circle and restore a better balance between all three of the social benefits of academia.

AB  - The author mentions some of his recent works that he values and uses, without becoming a kind of academic costermonger cataloguing all the produce for sale in the shop. At the same time, he suggests some substantive things, while not falling prey to mere rant. In his books, the author discusses the characteristics of Native American Studies (NAS). One of the things, in fact, that marks the "discipline" of NAS is its "interdisciplinary" character. A second characteristic of NAS is that it is "comparative" in nature. Third, NAS is more than any text or class about Indians or in which Indians play a part. Fourth, NAS involves a commitment to Native American community. Finally, the best trend in NAS is viewing it as a borderless discourse, encompassing all the Indigenous peoples of the hemisphere. In this article, the author discusses the current state of NAS. He says that this field is a mess. There is much more poor and sloppy scholarship being produced than solid, thoughtful, and innovative work. The graduate students often have trouble finding jobs. There is careerism. There are silly rivalries and petty jealousies. If the people in NAS are committed to Native community, if they want to be relevant to Native peoples on the ground, if they want to understand and explain the world as it really is, they must deal with these realities. Only then will they stand a chance of consistently generating more light than heat. (Contains 40 notes.)

AB  - Promoting and sustaining effective discussion--that which contributes to learning--is a skill that eludes many instructors (Darling-Hammond, 2008; Ge, Yamashiro, & Lee, 2000). This study explored the role and strategies of an expert instructor in an online advanced instructional design (ID) course that utilized a case-based learning (CBL) approach. Discussion posts, as well as interview data, were analyzed and coded to explore how the instructor utilized three strategies noted as being critical to students' learning during problem-centered discussions: social congruence, cognitive congruence, and content expertise (Schmidt & Moust, 1995; Yew & Yong, 2014). Results showed that facilitation choices were made with course goals in mind: modeling the case analysis process and improving students' ID problem solving. All three strategies were used frequently during discussion facilitation. Strategies tended to be implemented in clusters, with social congruence strategies appearing in every post but four. Implications are discussed for utilizing a combination of these facilitation strategies, in a dynamic manner, within a case-based context.

AB  - Building on the tradition of agricultural extension, this article discusses several changes in thinking regarding the relations between communication and innovation. Starting from the idea that network building, social learning and conflict management are key processes to be supported by communication professionals, the article makes critical observations regarding dominant forms of participatory practice, innovation policy and privatisation of research and extension. Subsequently, the paper discusses the implications of the proposed modes of thinking for the role of scientists in innovation processes. It is argued that a key role of scientists is to explicate implicit assumptions, claims and knowledge gaps in social learning processes, and to engage in collaborative research with societal stakeholders on a coherent set of natural and social science questions. The proposed conceptual models and observations eventually lead to the formulation of a research agenda for the field of Communication and Innovation Studies. (Contains 1 figure and 1 note.)

Being able to examine trends in reading achievement at the 4th grade over such a long period and relate these to policy changes during that time span is an attractive idea. However, this work brings to the fore many thorny issues that should be considered in linking together several disparate assessments, and the technical complexities involved in using IRT scaling to analyze trends in large-scale international assessments.

AB  - In a digital era in which technology plays a role in most aspects of a child's life, having the competence and confidence to use computers might be a necessary step, but not a goal in itself. Developing character traits that will serve children to use technology in a safe way to communicate and connect with others, and providing opportunities for children to make a better world through the use of their computational skills, is just as important. The Positive Technological Development framework (PTD), a natural extension of the computer literacy and the technological fluency movements that have influenced the world of educational technology, adds psychosocial, civic, and ethical components to the cognitive ones. PTD examines the developmental tasks of a child growing up in our digital era and provides a model for developing and evaluating technology-rich youth programs. The explicit goal of PTD programs is to support children in the positive uses of technology to lead more fulfilling lives and make the world a better place. This article introduces the concept of PTD and presents examples of the Zora virtual world program for young people that the author developed following this framework.

AB  - In the lesson on which this practical article is based, third grade students constructed a "lift-the-flap" page to explore food webs on the prairie. The moveable papercraft focused student attention on prairie animals' external structures and how the inferred functions of those structures could support further inferences about the animals' diets. In general, most students made simple causal connections between an animal's observable characteristics and the food it would probably eat. Some students were also able to make multi-agent connections to develop a more complex mental model of a food web. Ultimately, the lift-the flap project was engaging to students and motivated them to focus their attention on the characteristics of animals of different ecosystems to infer their probable diets.

AB  - This article describes a new and unique context for integrating STEM and literacy instruction--Novel Engineering. Oftentimes, STEM design challenges are focused on developing solutions to the big problems that humans face such as cleaning up oil spills or contrived situations in which children are tasked with building solutions to hypothetical problems such as creating bridges or towers for the purpose of the challenge only. Though these types of learning experiences have merit and benefit students by developing problem-solving skills and bringing awareness to global issues, they are sometimes disconnected from the world outside the classroom. This article focuses instead on using conflicts within the storyline of children's books as the problem-solving context and has benefits for children in both language arts and STEM learning. We offer suggestions that classroom teachers across the K-6 spectrum could use to implement Novel Engineering in their own classrooms.

AB  - This article describes a one-year study of 120 fifth grade students whose teachers participated in a program entitled Project SMILE (Science and Mathematics Integrated with Literary Experiences). The purpose of the study was to determine the extent to which the classroom implementation of Project SMILE positively influenced the classroom environment and student attitudes toward reading, writing and mathematics. This was accomplished by, first, facilitating a series of professional development workshops with the teachers and, subsequently, asking these teachers to use the strategies with their students in their elementary school classrooms. The research represents one of the relatively few studies that have employed learning environment dimensions as criteria of effectiveness in the evaluation of educational innovations. Methodologically, our study supported previous research that successfully combined qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection. The learning environment and attitude scales exhibited satisfactory internal consistency reliability and discriminant validity and, additionally, the actual form of most learning environment scales was capable of differentiating between the perceptions of students in different classrooms. The implementation of SMILE was found to have a positive impact on the students of the teachers who participated in the inservice program in that students' attitudes to mathematics and reading improved and there was congruence between students' actual and preferred classroom environment on the scales of satisfaction and difficulty. As well, prior research was replicated in that students' satisfaction was greater in classrooms with a more positive learning environment, especially in terms of student cohesiveness. Finally, qualitative data-gathering methods were used to construct a case study of the mathematics classes of a teacher who attended the SMILE professional development. This case study supported and illuminated the results from the questionnaire survey concerning the effectiveness of Project SMILE in terms of student attitudes and classroom environment.

AB  - Volunteers monitor watershed health in more than 700 programs in the US, involving over 400,000 local stakeholders. New Mexico Watershed Watch is a student-based watershed monitoring program sponsored by the state's Department of Game and Fish which provides high school teachers and students with instruction on methods for water quality monitoring, riparian habitat evaluation and watershed planning. Schools monitor small watersheds, assessing watershed health and water quality with an interdisciplinary approach that identifies impacts of land use. Students learn scientifically credible field methodologies to create long term databases on watershed health for use by state and federal agencies. Maps of land use, land ownership, soil stability, topography and human impacts are used in an overlay format to identify priority problem areas. Watershed plans are formulated to improve water quality and restore degraded riparian and upland sites.

AB  - Use of mathematics-related literature can engage students' interest and increase their understanding of mathematical concepts. A quasi-experimental study of two second-grade classrooms assessed whether daily inclusion of geometry-related literature in the classroom improved attitudes toward geometry and achievement in geometry. Consistent with the hypothesis, only the students in the classroom with a strong emphasis on geometry-related children's literature showed a significant improvement in their attitudes about geometry over time. While both classes improved their geometry performance over the 4 weeks of the study, the class with a strong emphasis on geometry-related literature improved significantly more (51.2%) than the control class (33.47%). Children's literature can provide a useful and interesting context in which students can develop their understanding of geometry.

AB  - In contemporary life and education, the local is marginalized in favor of large-scale economies of consumption that are indifferent to ecological concerns. The consequences of neglecting local human and natural communities include a degraded habitat, loss of wilderness, alienation, rootlessness, and lack of connection to communities. Critical place-based pedagogy provides a robust framework for the theory and practice of art education that is concerned with ecological issues. This article locates art education within a critical pedagogy of place as a prelude to describing contemporary art and art education that is engaged with ecological issues. (Contains 1 footnote.)

AB  - "Foods and Literature of the World" is a dual class taught at Bismarck High School in Bismarck, North Dakota. There are two components of the class--English and family and consumer sciences (FCS). (The English component fulfills the 12th grade English requirement.) Culture is explored through class discussion, essay writing, research, and oral reports as well as the reading of one particular novel chosen to represent the culture itself. The literature selected compliments the units from the Foods portion of the class. The Foods portion of the class is taught by an FCS instructor. Foods students prepare recipes from countries around the world using traditional ingredients and cooking utensils while learning about the culture and how it affects food preparation. Even though it is an elective, however, the Foods class cannot be taken without the English. The class is usually a two-section class, with the first period English moving to second period Foods, and vice versa. When the student leaves "Foods and Literature of the World," they have a good "taste" of different foods, culture, and literature.

AB  - The target article seems to provide yet another illustration of the classic "It don't make no nevermind" principle in statistical analysis. In particular, relatively simple measures appear to do approximately as well as more complex measures do, even including indicators that represent nonlinear transformations of the simpler measures. The authors of the target article admit that their validity tests are limited--confined to correlations with career age and departmental reputation. At the very least, alternative citation measures must be tested against eminence measures, including awards and honors. Because the latter can be stratified into degrees of distinction, such measures can be highly discriminating with respect to citation impact. In this commentary, the author emphasizes a different form of validation, namely, using citation indicators of impact as criteria or dependent variables in predictive regression equations. A rather extensive body of research has accumulated that identifies dispositional traits and developmental events most strongly associated with scientific achievement. The dispositional traits include both cognitive and personality variables, whereas, the developmental events include such factors as family background, formal education, and direct mentoring. The question then arises: Which of the alternative impact criteria is most strongly predicted by the relevant dispositional and developmental variables? For instance, if the "h" index is the most predictable of all candidate citation criteria, and if the same measure correlates most highly with eminence and awards, then the case for its assessment superiority could not be stronger. The index would boast both psychological and sociological validity. In contrast, if it should prove the case that log-transformed citation counts (or some other alternative) are more strongly associated with both (a) award and eminence evaluations and (b) dispositional and developmental predictors, then th the "h" index would be weakened. One has no guarantee that one specific impact measure will emerge victorious. Indeed, some degree of divergence might be expected given that the various measures place somewhat different emphases on the relative contributions of quantity (publications) and quality (citations) and that these two components can have contrasting correlations with other variables, whether eminence criteria or dispositional and developmental predictors. Nevertheless, if a choice has to be made among competing measures, optimal solution would probably be to pick that indicator that correlates most strongly with substantive variables. In any event, it should be clear that the current comparative inquiry represents just a first step toward a more complete evaluation.

AB  - To keep up with rapidly advancing technology, numerous innovations to the electrical and computer engineering (ECE) curriculum, learning methods and pedagogy have been envisioned, tested, and implemented. It is safe to say that no single approach will work for all of the diverse ECE technologies and every type of learner. However, a few key innovations appear useful in keeping undergraduate students motivated to learn, resilient to technology evolution, and oriented amid the overload of new information and ECE applications. Engineering clinics, similar to their medical clinic counterparts, provide project-based experiences within the core of an ECE education that enable transformation of the entire curriculum toward an outcomes-oriented, student-centered, total-quality environment. Clinics and project-based learning approaches build skills that give the students confidence and motivation to continuously self-learn and adapt as the technologies around them give way to new, more effective paradigms. Perhaps more importantly, engineering clinic experiences provide numerous opportunities for students to experience the holism of true engineering problem-solving approaches and the ranges of potential technology solutions. This paper reviews the clinic innovations that will enable ECE education to become more effective in the midst of the present plethora of information and technology. Assessment results are provided and are very encouraging. This paper concludes that agile learning environments, created to graduate engineers who can be rapidly productive in the professional and research worlds, are enhanced by clinic and/or project-based learning experiences in the ECE curriculum.

AB  - This article describes the following aspects of teaching biochemistry in undergraduate health courses: objectives, number of hours, time in which the subject is studied, selection of content, teaching strategies, and evaluation methodologies used. Fifty-three courses distributed in 13 areas within the health field and offered by 12 institutions were analyzed for this matter. An exploratory research was developed, with data obtained from documentation analysis, form completion, and interviews with teachers involved. For the analysis of data, both quantitative and qualitative approaches were used. The analysis of teaching plans for the subjects under investigation shows that their inclusion in the curriculum occurs early in the professional education. The subject focus is intradisciplinary, and there is a great diversity in terms of number of hours, even if one looks at the same professional field. There is a tendency to standardize objectives, centralizing the teaching in "biochemical knowledge," which is frequently not related to the specific proposal of professional education. We also noticed that there is a certain degree of similarity in the contents, even though some specific content is seen in the courses of dentistry and veterinary medicine. From the value given to lectures, one could see an evidence of transmission of pre-established content. Thus, there seems to be a need to stimulate the use of more active learning methodologies. As for evaluation, this study suggests an increased emphasis on the formative approach to assessing students. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - Background: Inclusive STEM high schools employ a variety of instructional strategies, including PBL (problem and/or project-based learning) experiences, with the goals of building students' 21st century skills, facilitating long-term academic success, and encouraging pursuit of STEM careers. PBL approaches are central to the goals of inclusive STEM schools; however, at this writing, no description of the implementation of PBL at these schools exists. Material and Methods: The current study draws on classroom observations and teacher interviews to describe PBL implementation across schools and classrooms. We describe specific instructional practices and classroom behaviors that teachers and students engage in during PBL. Results: Results highlight the multifaceted and multidimensional nature of PBL implementation, and that consistencies in practice do exist across inclusive STEM schools. Additionally, quantitative results show increased use of particular strategies in PBL experiences, as compared with non-PBL classes. Conclusions: This paper provides an in-depth look at instructional practices used in PBL approaches at inclusive STEM schools across the country, and findings have implications for how researchers and practitioners understand and use PBL going forward.

AB  - In this paper, we present a collaboration between writing professors and an information systems (IS) professor to scaffold case analysis writing at an American English-medium branch campus in the Middle East. We describe our process for revising the professor's writing assignment to make his expectations more explicit and for creating scaffolding materials that we delivered in classroom workshops to assist students' pre-writing. We provide insights about the positive impact of the writing workshops on students' writing from an end-of-semester interview with the professor and from interviews with students about their perceptions of the workshops and the personalized feedback they received.

AB  - Implementing inquiry in the outdoors introduces many challenges for teachers, some of which can be dealt with using mobile technologies. For productive use of these technologies, teachers should be provided with the opportunity to develop relevant knowledge and practices. In a professional development (PD) program in this design-based research, 24 teachers were involved in adaptation of a learning environment supporting inquiry in the outdoors that included the use of mobile technologies. They first experienced the learning environment as learners, then adapted it for their own use, and finally, enacted the adapted environment with peers. We examined the scope and character of teacher involvement in adaptation, and the consequent professional growth, by analyzing observations, questionnaires, interviews and the adapted learning-environments. Findings indicate that all teachers demonstrated change processes, including changes in knowledge and practice, but the coherence of the learning environments decreased when substantial adaptations were made. Some teachers demonstrated professional growth, as reflected by their implementation of ideas learned in the PD program in their daily practice, long after the PD program had ended. This study demonstrates how the Teachers as Designers approach can support teacher learning and illustrates productive use of scaffolds for teacher growth and professional development.

AB  - The role of motivation and collaboration in STEM learning and performance is paramount. A learning community represents an educational approach that can engage students in learning in a motivated, thoughtful, active, and collaborative way. The focus of this article is on the nature of students' interest, attitudes, learning experiences and motivation in STEM as a result of participating in linked classes as part of the Learning Communities for STEM Academic Achievement (LCSAA) initiative at two historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Quantitative and qualitative data demonstrate a positive influence of learning communities on students' attitudes, learning experiences and intrinsic motivation in STEM.

AB  - One of the strong trends in medical education today is the integration of the humanities into the basic medical curriculum. The anatomy program is an obvious choice for using the humanities to develop professionalism and ethical values. They can also be used to develop close observational skills. Many medical schools have developed formal art observation training in conjunction with nearby art museums to enhance the visual diagnostic skills of their medical students. We report here on an art and anatomy workshop that paired medical and art students who did drawing exercises from plastinated anatomical specimens and the animated face to hone observational skills. Each member of the pair brought a different perspective and expertise to the work that allowed each to be a mentor to the other. The workshop had three sessions: the first involved drawings of plastinated specimens that allowed an intimate experience with authentic human material; the second involved drawings of the human face; and the third included examination of anatomical texts of important anatomist-artists, a lecture on contemporary artists whose work involves anatomy, and a film demonstrating the facial muscles. We propose workshops such as these will help students increase their ability to detect details. This will assist the medical student in developing diagnostic skills for identifying disease and the art student in using the human body as subject. We further propose that these programs will help students develop humanistic sensitivities and provide an outlet for expression of the emotional aspects of dealing with disease and mortality.

AB  - A didactic discussion of a latent variable modeling approach is presented that addresses frequent empirical concerns of social, behavioral, and educational researchers involved in longitudinal studies. The method is suitable when the purpose is to analyze repeated measure data along several interrelated dimensions and to explain some of the associated patterns of change in terms of other developmental patterns via regressions among random effects. The procedure utilizes the framework of latent variable modeling and in addition is readily applicable when not all subjects provide complete records on all assessments and variables. The approach is illustrated with data from a cognitive intervention study.

AB  - Visual databases are increasingly important resources through which individuals and groups can undertake species identification. This paper reports research on the collaborative processes undertaken by pre-service teacher students when working in small groups to identify birds using an Internet-based taxonomic resource. The student groups are conceptualised as "knowledge-building communities" working in a "joint problem space" comprising the collective knowledge of the participants interacting with the taxonomic database. Collaborative group work and associated dialogue were recorded with digital video. The recordings were analysed for the categories of dialogue and the categories of knowledge used by the students as they interacted with the taxonomic database and how they drew on their previous experiences of identifying birds. The outcomes are discussed in the context of the interplay of individual and social processes and the interplay between abstraction and lived experience in the joint problem space.

AB  - Students with learning disabilities have been reported to have difficulty in a number of different executive function processes that affect their academic performance (Singer & Bashir, 1999). Executive function difficulties for students with learning disabilities have been implicated as the reason why these students struggle with complex academic tasks such as reading, writing, and note-taking (Denckla, 2007). This mixed-methods study explored the extent to which a strategic note-taking intervention encouraged more efficient employment of executive function in middle school students with learning disabilities. This paper draws on interviews, students' notes, and pre- and post-intervention assessments to present case studies of three student participants. Results indicate that the strategic note-taking intervention served as a scaffold, opening up new pathways for struggling students to access executive functions and flexibly deploy cognitive strategies. Importantly, "how" each student did so and "what" each student learned about her/himself as a learner in the process were dependent on the specific challenges presented by her/his learning disability. These cases shed light on the potential for cognitive scaffolding to help students actively improve their own executive functioning in complex tasks such as note-taking

AB  - In the context of research universities, what kind of places and spaces can we create for ourselves that foster a holistic vision of learning and community, a vision that is responsive to the shifting social and ecological landscapes of the Anthropocene? How can these spaces simultaneously address the need to nurture both personal and cultural change? How do the frames we create enhance or limit our place-making? This paper offers one situated response to such questions as it theorizes and describes the arts integrated emergence of the Centre for Place and Sustainability Studies at Lakehead University. Drawing from critical cultural and ecological studies, we problematize creating spaces in both centers and margins, and offer an arts integrated vision of a space for diverse and evolving approaches to sustainability work: a meeting ground characterized by a commitment to parallax and embodied aesthetic wholeness.

AB  - During the preschool years children develop many new skills, including gross motor abilities, which serve as a foundation for school readiness skills in areas such as language, socialization and cognition. Like other domains, motor skill development does not happen without practice opportunities. That is, it requires multiple opportunities whereby children engage in physical activities to become proficient at skills such as marching, climbing, and throwing. The purpose of this article is to describe strategies that teachers can use to encourage and facilitate all children's participation in motor activities within inclusive preschool settings.

AB  - Interest in the American Indian in West Germany is high. Romantic notions, derived from the novels of 19th century German writer Karl May and American westerns shown on German television, combined with a subtle anti-Americanism might be responsible for the American Indian Movement (AIM) support groups that have been forming among students and bringing American Indian issues into the arena of world affairs. While this enthusiasm for AIM among students has not generally been shared by academicians, recent scholarly interdisciplinary research in American Indian Studies has been conducted by anthropologists associated with the Center for North American Studies (ZENAF) at the University of Frankfurt. The topic of ethnic identity and cultural resistance has produced several case  studies on cultural change and has stimulated an evaluation of fiction written by Native Americans in the context of a struggle for ethnic identity. The scholarly evaluation of AIM in the context of the long history of Indian resistance has also begun. Citations for 26 ZENAF publications on American Indian Studies (most written in German) are provided. (NEC)

AB  - Background: This introductory guide presents the main two analytical approaches used by molecular geneticists: linkage and association. Methods: Traditional linkage and association methods are described, along with more recent advances in methodologies such as those using a variance components approach. Results: New methods are being developed all the time but the core principles of linkage and association remain the same. The basis of linkage is the transmission of a marker along with a disease within families, whereas association is based on the comparison of marker frequencies in case and control groups. Conclusions: It is becoming increasingly clear that effect sizes of individual markers on diseases and traits are likely to be very small. As such, much greater power is needed, and correspondingly greater sample sizes. Although non-replication is still a problem, molecular genetic studies in some areas such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are starting to show greater convergence. Epidemiologists and other researchers with large well-characterized samples will be well placed to use these methods. Inter-disciplinary studies can then ask far more interesting questions such as those relating to developmental, multivariate and gene-environment interaction hypotheses.

AB  - Celebrating 100 years of the National Communication Association necessitates that, as we commemorate our past, we also look toward our future. As part of a larger conversation about the future of instructional communication, this essay reinvestigates the importance of integrating biosocial approaches into instructional communication research. In so doing, a biosocial approach is defined, and the benefits of such an approach are discussed. We then set an agenda for how biosocial research can be conducted in instructional communication, focusing largely on salivary hormone studies examining stress. Examples are offered surrounding student-based outcomes, teachers' roles in affecting student outcomes, and instructional communication processes in nontraditional classrooms. The essay concludes with suggestions for additional resources and the encouragement of cross-disciplinary research.

AB  - It is time for new ideas and models for art education. Current developments in contemporary art, learning theory and in art education itself demand new approaches and provide inspiration and guidance for change. Each area brings particular components to the table but they all have one primary element in common: a call for art education that is better connected to the concepts and ideas behind art and art practice, and to areas of inquiry outside of art. In this article, the author proposes an art education that is built on these broad and deep connections. She calls it "substantive art integration" and believes it to be a core principle of an exemplary art education. A summary of the foundations of this approach, an explanation of substantive integration and a sample project that demonstrates how it plays out in practice are presented.

AB  - In usual understandings of learning, youths' development in classrooms is portrayed as a move from being a novice to an expert. However, findings of the present anthropologically framed study support us to argue that learning, rather, can be characterized as youths' simultaneous occupation of novice and expert roles. We refer to this simultaneous occupation as "mutual reliance." We make this assertion within the context of a multilingual, transnational classroom, where the presence of heightened diversity led teachers to put in place a structure ("autonomous learning groups") that supported youth to rely on one another to learn. In a video-based case study that tracks one group of students over 33 hours and engages micro-ethnographic analysis of a student named Liana, we found that autonomous learning groups created a democratization of the learning space--everyone contributed from his or her knowledge base because no single person, including the teachers, could ever be an expert.

AB  - Many teachers bring caterpillars into their class for their students to see the transformation from caterpillar to butterfly. This is exciting and educational, but more can be done using Monarchs across the curriculum. This article describes an integrated butterfly unit for students in grades four to six that starts with identifying the Monarch host plant (milkweed) and extends to include math, language arts, and social studies. A Monarch project has numerous opportunities for performance-based assessments, as students identify milkweed and Monarch eggs and caterpillars; care for the Monarchs; measure larvae, pupae, and butterflies and construct data tables and line graphs; and observe and record significant events in the Monarch's life cycle.

AB  - Leonardo Pisano, the son of Guilielmo Bonacci, was  born in Pisa, Italy, around 1175. He is better known as Fibonacci, a shortened version of "filius Bonacci" ("son of Bonacci"). He travelled with his father and during these travels, he learned about the enormous advantages of the mathematical systems used in the countries they visited. These systems, which were based on the "Indians' nine symbols", had not yet been introduced in Europe. What was significant, which Fibonacci noticed immediately, was within the Hindu--Arabic system--only the digits 1 to 9. By spending time determining how the sequence has developed, children should begin to see an emerging sequence where the next number is the sum of the previous two numbers, and so can carry on for as long as they and their teacher wants. The use of Fibonacci sequence in school can be truly cross-curricular, with links to a number of different subject disciplines. For a long time mathematicians and scientists have noticed that the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence appear in many different patterns in nature. By examining flowers, seeds, fruits, and so on, and making their own "flowers," children can learn a lot about the sequence while having fun. (Contains 5 figures and 2 boxes.)

AB  - The author purports that the humanistic approach to environmental education is essential. Environmental problems arise because man is somewhere in the picture making use of an environment to maintain or improve his way of life, therefore, an environmental crisis is a crisis of the human spirit. The author cites many pieces of literature which illustrate man's involvement in the environment. (BR)

AB  - Various strands of research in educational, social and organizational psychology focus on structures of collectively created meaning that emerge in and coordinate activities of groups. Despite expanding, this field still lacks conceptual clarity, enhanced by the multitude of terms used, such as common ground, shared understanding, collective mind, team mental models, and distributed cognition. We conducted a review of the conceptual frameworks being used in empirical studies, focusing on the premises of the conceptualizations. Therefore, we connected these conceptualizations to either cognitive or socio-cultural perspectives on the social nature of cognition. Some studies are identified as representing initial ways of boundary crossing between these perspectives. To conclude, we explore ways for boundary crossing and cross-fertilization in future research. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - Purpose: In conjunction with curricular changes, a process to develop integrated examinations was implemented. Pre-established guidelines were provided favoring vignettes, clinically relevant material, and application of knowledge rather than simple recall. Questions were read aloud in a committee including all course directors, and a reviewer with National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) item writing and review experience. This study examines the effectiveness of this process to improve the quality of in-house examinations. Methods: Five hundred and twenty items were randomly selected from two academic years for initial comparison; 270 from 2000 to 2001, and 250 from 2001 to 2002. The first set of items represented the style, content and format when courses and tests were departmentally/discipline based, assembled by course directors, and administered separately. The latter group represented similar characteristics when courses and tests were organ-system-based, committee-reviewed and administered in an integrated examination. Items were randomized, blinded for year of origin, and rated by three NBME staff members with extensive item review experience. A five-point rating scale was used: one indicated a technically flawed item assessing recall of an isolated fact; five indicated a technically unflawed item assessing application of knowledge. To assess continued improvement, a follow-up set of 250 items from the 2002 to 2003 academic year was submitted to the same three reviewers who were not informed of the purpose or origin of this set of test items. Results: The mean rating for items from 2000 to 2001 was 2.51 plus or minus 1.27; analogous values for 2001-2002 were 3.16 plus or minus 1.33, (t = 5.83; p less than 0.0001), and in 2002-2003; 3.59 plus or minus 1.15 (t = 10.11; p less than 0.0001). Conclusion: Pre-established guidelines and an interdisciplinary review process resulted in improved item quality for in-house examinations.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to illustrate discourses on globalisation and world society and to disclose the commonalities and differences of both scientific debates. In particular, it draws attention to theoretical concepts of globalisation and world society. This is considered fruitful for comprehending the complex mechanisms of sociological theory-building in a globalised world. Design/methodology/approach: The article first contextualises the multi-dimensionality and ambiguity of globalisation. It then reflects on the consequences of globalisation for socio-scientific considerations. The third part of the paper highlights scientific discourses on world society and globalisation, especially illustrating the commonalities and differences of both debates. In the concluding remarks of the article, discourses on world society are presented as a seismograph of contemporary socio-scientific debates encountering processes of globalisation. Findings: The paper does not simply present scientific discourses as isolated from a globalised world, but discloses the challenges of socio-scientific disciplines facing the global frame of reference for research. To balance the research analyses of scientific discourses, those on globalisation and world society are illustrated. Originality/value: The interplay between discourses on globalisation and those on world society is rarely reflected upon in publications. This paper provides insights into how, on the one hand, scientific debates on globalisation and on world society act together as part and parcel of the overall global frame of reference for research, yet it also shows, on the other hand, how different the discourses are. Furthermore, it highlights the prospective role of socio-scientific disciplines in a globalised world.

AB  - In this design case, we present an instructional design project that resulted in a French language learning game development system. What we describe here is not the game itself, but rather the pedagogical intervention that created what the design team termed a mobile "application farm," which in turn produced the game. The term "farm" was used due to the perspective of the designers to create a sustainable system rather than a single design. This design case also has another purpose beyond presenting precedent in instructional design; we interrogate the interview process and the protocol we used while documenting this project. We present the outcome of our interrogation in reflection notes posted throughout this design case. We do this because we believe that there is a value and need for design cases created by someone outside of the design arena but with access to members of the design team, in order to elicit where precedents might be found within complex designs.

AB  - Through a comparative case study, Sheridan and colleagues explore how makerspaces may function as learning environments. Drawing on field observations, interviews, and analysis of artifacts, videos, and other documents, the authors describe features of three makerspaces and how participants learn and develop through complex design and making practices. They describe how the makerspaces help individuals identify problems, build models, learn and apply skills, revise ideas, and share new knowledge with others. The authors conclude with a discussion of the implications of their findings for this emergent field.

AB  - This article is about whalesongs, hearing, musical brains, and a number of other topics explored over the past 35 years. Previous research is reviewed briefly, and more attention is given to recent efforts with an emphasis on collaborative research conducted with many wonderful colleagues. First is a brief account of the Institute for Music Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio, followed by more details on current projects at the Music Research Institute (MRi) at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Research at the MRi is divided into six topics: BioMusic, Music-Related Hearing Loss, Music Education, Music Performance, Ethnomusicology and Ecocriticism, and Neuromusical Research. The second half of the article is devoted to neuromusical research. This line of research includes earlier studies of pianists, conductors, and singers and more recent work on multisensory processing in musicians. (Contains 7 figures.)

AB  - Biological problems in the twenty-first century are complex and require mathematical insight, often resulting in mathematical models of biological systems. Building mathematical-biological models requires cooperation among biologists and mathematicians, and mastery of building models. A new course in mathematical modeling presented the opportunity to build both content and process learning of mathematical models, the modeling process, and the cooperative process. There was little guidance from the literature on how to build such a course. Here, I describe the iterative process of developing such a course, beginning with objectives and choosing content and process competencies to fulfill the objectives. I include some inductive heuristics for instructors seeking guidance in planning and developing their own courses, and I illustrate with a description of one instructional model cycle. Students completing this class reported gains in learning of modeling content, the modeling process, and cooperative skills. Student content and process mastery increased, as assessed on several objective-driven metrics in many types of assessments. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - This paper reports on the cross-disciplinary research that resulted in a decision-support tool, Team Machine (TM), which was designed to create maximally diverse student teams. TM was used at a large United States university between 2004 and 2012, and resulted in significant improvement in the performance of student teams, superior overall balance of the teams as well as overwhelmingly favorable reactions from stakeholders. An empirical study is conducted comparing the performance of teams created by TM compared to teams manually allocated by a subject matter expert. The findings show that optimally balanced teams perform better than those created manually. TM serves as a broad-based example of how to integrate business analytics into interactive search by conflating human judgment with algorithmic efficiency in the context of team formation. The contribution of this research to the academic community is a model and solution method which can be easily implemented to solve a very important and recurring issue faced by many MBA programs and empirical evidence of its value. The outcomes of this study include empirical evidence of increased team performance, significant administrative time savings, improvement to team diversity, and increased satisfaction from students and administrators with the team formation process.

AB  - As teachers of political theory, our goal is not merely to help students understand the abstract reasoning behind key ideas and texts of our discipline. We also wish to convey the historical contexts that informed these ideas and texts, including the political aims of their authors. But the traditional lecture-and-discussion approach tends to obscure the historical and political dimensions of political theory. "Reacting to the Past" historical simulations provide a powerful tool for remedying these shortcomings. The simulations foster three kinds of lessons that are difficult to impart with more traditional approaches. First, they help students see the intimate and reciprocal connections between politics, history, and political philosophy. Second, the simulations bring to light the inherently political dimensions of interpreting key political ideas. Finally, drawing upon the ideas of Hannah Arendt, we argue that the simulations educate students about the nature of freedom and political action. (Contains 2 tables and 5 notes.)

AB  - Forestry and agricultural education programs need to increase their public communication and cross-disciplinary activities. In this article we present a technique, Cross-Disciplinary Peer Education (CDPE), which allowed forestry students to teach student peers from other disciplines about basic forestry principles. Cross-Disciplinary Peer Education is an innovative way to give natural resource and agriculture students (peer educators) the opportunity to educate students from other disciplines (peer learners). In our exploration of CDPE we found (i) peer learners gained exposure to different disciplines and perspectives of the world, and (ii) peer educators improved their communication skills. The primary challenge of CDPE is the additional time required by faculty instructors to prepare for the CDPE experience. (Contains 1 table.)

Little attention was paid to how several variables might work together and there is little discussion regarding how they might work together. The author stresses that there are reasons why a comprehensive, coherent, and unified modeling and testing process can be applied to achievement production. The purpose of this article is to identify these reasons. (Contains 5 endnotes.)

AB  - This report synthesises prominent issues found in the literature related to the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in collaborative learning. It evaluates the most widely employed methodological approaches and reviews the most influential disciplines in the area of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). The purpose of this evaluation is to identify gaps as well as opportunities in current research efforts to guide further investigation into the nature, theory and practice of CSCL. It is argued that there is a genuine need for cross-disciplinary research and a holistic methodological approach which will allow researchers to study technology-enhanced collaborative learning from multiple perspectives. Such an approach should incorporate social, cognitive and technological perspectives towards understanding real--as opposed to experimental--pedagogical contexts. This can help forward-thinking researches, educators, and designers find innovative solutions and practical ideas for addressing the challenges and capitalising the visions of ICT in education.

AB  - This article describes the design and delivery of a program, "Global Business in a Digital World." The program integrates the use of social media technologies and business applications in a series of courses that include short-term study abroad components that focus on emerging markets. The objectives are to: (1) provide additional options for study abroad; (2) broaden the scope of the international business program to include more emphasis on emerging markets; (3) provide integration across business and liberal arts; and (4) integrate social media technologies into the study abroad experience. To achieve these objectives, students study business in the host country, interact with local company executives, and experiment with social media and related technologies. A conceptual framework describes the course structure and its relationship with the four categories of social media classified as 4Cs: Communication, Connection, Cooperation, and Collaboration (Cook, 2008; Enterprise 2.0. Burlington, VT: Gower Publishing Limited). Conclusions reveal improved student learning outcomes after exposure to the study abroad, but also suggest the study abroad experience requires specific skill development. A research framework gives direction for future work.

AB  - While the ready-made Lego[TM] Robotics kits are popular in schools and are used by students at both primary and secondary year levels, using the Picaxe microcontroller (chip) to create simple electronic devices, including robotic devices is less popular. The latter imposes an additional challenge as a result of the need to construct the universal board with the chip in it--a challenge embraced in the cross-disciplinary mechatronics program in this study. This paper reports on how teachers from five Australian secondary schools put into practice technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) developed from expert-led workshops and explores factors (intrinsic and extrinsic) that influenced the implementation. The results show that different strategies were adopted by the schools in implementing the programs. While teacher attitude played an important role in influencing the program's success, being able to identify where the program sits within the curriculum and planning around timetable and facility constraints were also important factors to consider. The research indicated that teachers' TPCK was most challenged in non-obvious areas such as diagnosing where faulty soldering joints were.

AB  - This paper illustrates an approach used to enhance student learning outcomes in a combined cross-listed Systems Analysis and Design (SA&D) course and examines benefits perceived by students through analysis of assessment and students feedback. The SA&D course is a required course in both the Management Information Systems (MIS) major and the Applied Computer Science (ACS) major. The SA&D course was taught to a combined cross-listed class of MIS and ACS students over a period of two years. Two strategies were adopted to make the course a worthwhile learning experience for students in both majors. The first was to extend the scope of the course within the System Development Life Cycle spectrum to include planning before analysis and implementation (prototype) after the design. The second strategy was to have a running group project as the main assessment (accounting for 50% of the course grade) where each group had at least one student from each of the two majors. These groups carried out a system development project with four phased deliverables: system proposal, requirements specifications, design specifications and a working prototype with emphasis on user interfaces. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of how the combined cross-listed course was designed, delivered and refined for future offerings. It also examines the value of teamwork using students' feedback. The students' experiences were studied over a two-year period. Two different instruments were used to gather feedback and to analyze the effectiveness of the combined cross-listed strategy: a qualitative study and a quantitative study concerning student perception on learning enhancement. Initially a qualitative study with open-ended questions was carried out to identify areas for improvement and to examine how well these strategies had worked. The three problems identified were lack of sufficient time for the last phase (working prototype), lack of time for team meetings, and lack of a comprehensive example case. These problems were addressed in subsequent course offerings. The study also revealed that about 80 percent of the students liked working in a mixed group setting on the extended course project, and 75 percent of the students indicated that working on the mixed group project offered them real-world experience. Encouraged by such positive observations, a quantitative study was conducted on students' perceptions concerning specific learning outcomes for carrying out the various system development tasks and the development of skills (including soft skills) among and between the two majors. The results indicated that the students from both majors perceived more than average learning outcomes and skills development. It also indicated that while the ACS students claimed to have learned relatively more on feasibility analysis and information gathering, the MIS students claimed to have learned relatively more on user interface design and architectural design. However, the results indicated that the perceived differences in the learning outcomes between the two majors were not significant. The analysis confirms an enhanced learning outcome for both the ACS and the MIS majors due to knowledge sharing made available through teamwork. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)
