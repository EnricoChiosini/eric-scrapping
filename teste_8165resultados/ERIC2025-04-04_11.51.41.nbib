AB  - Children from two primary schools--one a state primary and the other a private school--have been involved for some eight years with planning, making and maintaining a conservation area beside the River Thames in Berkshire. The work is part of the curriculum and involves habitat studies, identification of local species and learning about animal behaviour. The project also involves art, maths and geography. The children gain experience in practical conservation and develop communication skills as they work with children from other schools and local volunteers. (Contains 3 figures and 2 tables.)

AB  - An animatronic robot was designed and constructed for the 2003 Annual Student Robotic Technology and Engineering Challenge organized by the Robotics International (RI) association of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME). It was also the senior capstone design project for two of the design team members. After a thorough study of body and biomechanics of polar bears, the skeleton and limbs of a polar bear robot were designed to scale. The design was complemented with the drive train and DC electric motors as actuators. A microcontroller, a LEGO controller, was utilized to control the motions of the bear. Design experience included artistic design of the bear and its shell for placement of fur, mechanism design for the body and its limbs, the design of power train, selection of the electric actuators and control circuit design, and programming of the microcontroller. Most mechanical and electrical components were obtained through recycling of old robots and equipment from laboratories.

AB  - The emerging sub-field of world history is all about connections and interactions. It challenges the received treatments of history which have focused on specific regions and civilizations as if they had been discrete realities unto themselves, and reminds people that nothing happens in a vacuum. But to date world historians have not taken this approach far enough, since their work continues to focus almost exclusively on interactions and connections between humans. People should remind themselves that humans interact not only with each other, but in all times, places and contexts with the non-human world as well. All human actions take place within the context of ecosystems, and are affected by them in ways that differ enormously over time and space. In this paper, the author argues that the call for integrating environmental history with world history has an urgency beyond mere scholarly thoroughness. The theme of interactions, which lies at the heart of world history, offers a corrective to the fragmented approach of the knowledge system which has become dominant in the modern age. Fragmented thinking enables everyone falsely to perceive human activities as somehow disembedded from any physical context. So world history, if done properly--that is, expanding the theme of interactions to include all actors, not just human ones--is not only good scholarship, it may be vital to saving the planet!

Selective, academic boarding schools continue to be an option. A survey of rural households found community satisfaction and improved student outcomes as a result of this compromise. (SV)
