AB  - This descriptive research study aimed to assess the management of the existing policies, guidelines, and procedures on the implementation of the interdisciplinary approach in performance-based assessment (IAPA) before and during Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a basis for proposing improvements for its implementation in the "new normal". 30 senior high school science teachers and school leaders from 5 private and 5 public schools in Metro Manila, Philippines, participated in this study. The participants assessed the management of existing policies, guidelines, and procedures on the IAPA's implementation using a survey questionnaire and identified its strengths and weaknesses using an interview guide. The researchers developed the instruments used for data collection but subjected to experts' validation and reliability test. Results reveal that the management of IAPA was effective and that it benefits students and teachers in many ways. However, it has also weaknesses, which are associated with the role of school leaders in the implementation of the policies, guidelines, and/or procedures, especially during the new normal education setting. The study provides suggestions for improving IAPA implementation in the new normal covering both the face-to-face and online learning modalities.

AB  - This paper explores how social justice orientated education research might engage with emerging ideas and approaches from the new biological sciences, and suggests a biosocial future for empirical education research that connects molecular biology--epigenetics, nutrigenomics and neuroscience--with sociology of education. In beginning to consider what the biosocial means for education the paper works through two pressing questions "what happens when we learn?" and "are relationships important in the classroom?", bringing together emerging evidence across sociology, pedagogy, molecular biology and neuroscience. The paper shows how what we ask, how we go about doing research, and the sorts of answers that we might offer all shift with a biosocial orientation. While valid concerns continue to be raised by critical education researchers over some of the directions of research in the biological sciences and the policy uses of this, this paper advocates collaborative, inter-disciplinary research across social and biological sciences. Such biosocial research, it is argued, has the potential to develop hybrid conceptual frames; pose new types of questions; envisage research methodologies and methods in new ways; and offer profound new insights into the making of inequality.

AB  - Preparing science and engineering students to work in interdisciplinary teams necessitates research on teaching and learning of interdisciplinary thinking. A multidimensional approach was taken to examine student interdisciplinary learning in a master course on food quality management. The collected 615 student experiences were analysed for the cognitive, emotional, and social learning dimensions using the learning theory of Illeris. Of these 615 experiences, the analysis showed that students reported 214, 194, and 207 times on, respectively, the emotional, the cognitive, and the social dimension. Per learning dimension, key learning experiences featuring interdisciplinary learning were identified such as "frustrations in selecting and matching disciplinary knowledge to complex problems" ("emotional"), "understanding how to apply theoretical models or concepts to real-world situations" ("cognitive"), and "socially engaging with peers to recognise similarities in perceptions and experiences" ("social"). Furthermore, the results showed that students appreciated the cognitive dimension relatively more than the emotional and social dimensions.

AB  - The integration of mathematics and science in teaching facilitates student learning, engagement, motivation, problem-solving, critical thinking, and real-life application. Although curriculum integration is theoretically desirable for many educators, what to integrate and how to integrate are often the big questions facing teachers working within education systems premised on a culture of segregated subject delivery. This quasi-experimental study reports on a 2-week inquiry of the implementation of an integrated unit of learning on motion problems, within upper secondary education in Turkey. In order to reveal the effect of the instruction on students with different mathematics achievements, the study was conducted with 131 students in two different schools. In the design of the integrated unit, continuum model of learning and four-stages of learning model were employed. The study employed a quantitative approach and examined the key aspects of the practice of the integration of mathematics and science teaching. In light of the data obtained, it was concluded that teaching the subject Motion Problems through an integrated design had a positive effect on students' learning for the experimental groups in each school.

AB  - The goal of this qualitative study is to provide theoretical knowledge and design principles for a creative educational environment characterized by simultaneous study and exploration of science or math, and the arts: Write a Science Opera (WASO). To do so, we used a theory of creativity in education which links collaborative co-creation in creative activity, and identity: Wise Humanizing Creativity (WHC). Data were collected from teachers in interventions during which the WASO environment was implemented in two Norwegian primary schools. The topics of study were the multiplication table at the first school, and temperature at the second. Data relating to these participants' experiences and perceptions were coded and analyzed in order to articulate the kind of creative activity witnessed. The data, which consisted of interviews and reflective notes, were analyzed based on Educational Design Research (EDR) theory in order to explore design principles which could enrich WASO in the future, as well as to provide theoretical knowledge to other educational researchers.

AB  - The current study presents an evaluation of the laboratory instructional tasks prepared based on innovative teaching approaches (research-inquiry, problem solving, project, argumentation and web-based interdisciplinary learning approaches) designed to enhance science teachers' biotechnology knowledge, awareness and laboratory experiences. The laboratory instructional tasks developed by the researchers aim to improve the laboratory experiences, as well as support the teaching of biotechnology through innovative teaching approaches. For this purpose, in-service training course titled Biotechnology Education Practices was conducted with the voluntary participation of science teachers (n = 17). The current study employed the embedded design. The quantitative part of the embedded design is designed as the single group pretest-posttest model and the qualitative part of it is designed as the case study. The data of the current study were collected through the Biotechnology Awareness Questionnaire, Biotechnology Evaluation Questions, The Laboratory Self-Evaluation form and worksheets. The results obtained from the analyses revealed that the instructional tasks conducted within the context of the Biotechnology Education Practices resulted in significant effects on the science teachers' biotechnology knowledge and awareness and that the innovative teaching approaches were effective in developing the science teachers' laboratory experiences. It would be useful to use laboratory instructional tasks enriched with innovative teaching approaches in teaching biotechnology subjects.

AB  - Despite elementary teacher education programs preparing preservice teachers in the main content areas of literacy, math, science, and social studies, few elementary school classrooms teach all four content areas on a regular and thorough basis. Therefore, elementary education teacher preparation programs should be redesigned to support an integrated teaching model of all four content areas in order to better prepare preservice teachers (PST) to serve elementary students. The main research question for this study was "How does a collaborative and integrated elementary education program impact PSTs' knowledge and understanding of an integrated K-6 elementary classroom?" The sample included 12 preservice education students at a Midwest, private liberal arts university. The study occurred over three semesters in a newly developed integrated elementary education program. Data tools collected included: field experience lesson plans, preservice classroom observations, a survey of experiences, video-recorded lessons, and the edTPA. When looking at the different types of integration, the most common was interdisciplinary teaching where one content area supported the work of another. The lack of integration may be due to limited or no tools available to support preservice teachers to teach in this fashion. To answer the research question, it was found that the PSTs graduated from the preservice program and entered their own classrooms with a vague understanding of integrated teaching. Although our program was integrated in the delivery of content and field experience, the transparency was not revealed to the PSTs during their methods classes and field work.

AB  - While teachers and practitioners are increasingly expected to conduct research on their own practice, there is a lot of educational research that is not directly involved in practice. This often leads to unilateral research perspectives on educational practice. Therefore, this article calls for an alternative model of researching educational practice, summarised through the term 'pedagogical science'. We argue that practical and normative theories that seek to improve educational practice should be combined with theories that aim to describe and explain. It is further argued that the combination of such perspectives and theories, a so-called stereoscopic point of view, can allow for a thorough and holistic investigation of educational practice. As part of this argumentation, the article addresses critical questions of various theoretical models of educational research, models that are being used in Scandinavian, European and Anglo-American research on educational practice. With reference to interdisciplinary models of educational research, such as educational sciences, learning sciences and "Bildungswissenschaften," there are trends in which pedagogy is marginalised. Thus, the second argument of the article calls for placing pedagogy at the centre of knowledge production in a broad sense, after which pedagogy is made into a source of knowledge for pedagogical science, which sets forth to test and provide empirical support for pedagogy-based knowledge.

AB  - In today's information-driven society, the Japanese government envisions the next societal revolution as "Society 5.0," where advanced technologies and service platforms integrate with and empower individuals in a human-based society. While Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education has traditionally focused on technical skills and knowledge in isolation, this paper will look at the potential role and benefits of incorporating liberal arts education into these technical studies. This concept of integrating the liberal arts into STEM education is known as STEAM. The purpose of the study is to create a foundation for clarifying the role of interdisciplinary education in overcoming the vertical division of academic disciplines and restoring the "integrated nature" of scholarship. This study seeks to show how the humanities, social sciences, and arts can be used to enhance STEM education, and, furthermore, how this STEAM approach to education is key to enabling Japan's vision for Society 5.0.

AB  - English learner (EL) students face the challenge of learning a new language while simultaneously learning other subjects. Similarly, English as Second Language (ESL) teachers have the added responsibility of teaching academic language in STEM subjects to EL students, in addition to language teaching. This article explores how a participant researcher as an ESL teacher collaborated with two mainstream teachers and a science teacher, to enhance EL's language and STEM literacy. Four teachers participated in the study, with one science graduate and one participant researcher, an ESL graduate student, working in a public middle school to co-design and co-teach science lessons. The study analyzed the effectiveness of their semester-long collaboration on the learning of domestic and EL students using mixed methods, such as observations and surveys. The results indicate that ESL teachers and students benefit from the support of pre-service teachers for both STEM content and language. This suggests that placing STEM major graduate students in ESL classrooms and ESL major graduate students in STEM classrooms for their practicum can re-connect language to content literacy development for EL students.

AB  - In this study, the implementation of a STEAM project was critically examined, with constructivist grounded principles utilized to inform the perspective of both a learner and a STEAM practitioner. A comprehensive project plan was devised that incorporated CAP domains through the integration of the STEAM praxis with peer and self-assessment strategies for school-level science education. This innovative approach, aimed at nurturing the aesthetic value in arts and the evaluation process, led to the creation of a unique methodology for assessing students' cognitive and psychomotor skills. The framework for accessing students' peer/self-evaluation via meticulously designed rubrics is further highlighted. The implementation of a project plan proved to be an interactive and insightful process, fostering a profound understanding of students' concerns and interests. This study underscores the transformative potential of the STEAM approach in educational settings, highlighting its role in promoting critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills among students.

AB  - This paper uses the reflections of a recent workshop on biology and the humanities subject areas to consider the potential for designing a first year interdisciplinary module that brings together teachers and learners in the Biosciences with their counterparts in English and History. It considers three building blocks of module design: aims and objectives; teaching and learning strategies; and assessment; and provides a commentary on the discussion of interdisciplinarity in the broader literature. The authors argue that interdisciplinary teaching and learning must be transformative, but not in the way many previous advocates of interdisciplinarity have assumed. Rather than transcending disciplines, the authors contend that the aim should be to enhance disciplinary understanding. Learners should emerge from the interdisciplinary module not having lost their identity as biologists, but having enhanced it. They should have become "better" biologists in the sense of having developed a broader, critical understanding of the precepts of their discipline, as a first step to an understanding of biology inflected with a literary and historical awareness.

AB  - The term "ocean literacy" originated in the early 2000s from American ocean science researchers and educators to strengthen ocean science education in the national curriculum. Worldwide, it has been adapted to reflect a more multidisciplinary approach to understanding humans' relationships with the ocean. Research from the Understanding Ocean Literacy in Canada national study (2019-2020) (Ammendolia et al., 2020; Glithero, 2020; Hoover, 2020; MacNeil, 2020; Ostertag & Ammendolia, 2020; Yumagulova, 2020) identified ocean literacy as a limiting term, unable to capture the scope of Canadian experiences with the ocean continuum (land, freshwater, coastal areas, sea ice, open ocean), and inadequate in encapsulating different worldviews and across different linguistic communities. We discuss the challenges of contextualizing an international term within Canada and present ideas to move toward more inclusive terminology, examining the challenges still ahead in developing relevant terminology and bridging with international initiatives.

AB  - From a Nordic and British perspective, the history of education is a vibrant field of knowledge production. It invites scholars from the humanities and social sciences to investigate the continuities and changes in education over time, as well as "Bildung," nurturing, learning, and teaching. By underlining the breadth of the history of education and using Nordic and British examples, I argue that the field is not shrinking but growing. A broader definition of the field expands the field's scope beyond historical studies of formal schooling. It also enhances the field's significance and reveals how it has a meaningful role in research policy, and practice.

AB  - An interactive, field-based course on the environmental aspects of natural water was developed as part of STEM initiatives at a comprehensive university in the United States. The project is funded by the National Science Foundation. The course is focused on two fundamental student skills, such as hydrologic field procedures and analytical methods. For field procedures, an area watershed was delineated as a natural laboratory and integrated into the course curriculum by designing creek-side learning activities. For analytical methods, instrumental setup and analysis for water and soil samples were designed to cover core concepts in hydrology. The primary goal of the course is to portray water's important role in the natural environment. Exercises are written in an interdisciplinary setting making sure that students can identify real-life environmental problems and offer realistic solutions to them. By taking part in this project, students gained new knowledge on stream gauging, groundwater simulations, ion chemistry, GIS applications, bio-pollutants, wastewater treatment, hydrologic systems, and sampling protocol. Students also gained important skills in handling state-of-the-art equipment, including ion chromatograph, spectrophotometer, sediment analyzer, data-logger, and well purging systems. Outcomes assessment indicates that students who took the new course are more efficient in data collection, compilation, and interpretation associated with the availability, movement, and impairment of natural water. They are able to think more critically about the aquatic environment and the interrelationships among its components. Overall, the students view this course as one that has improved their learning in water sciences. Hands-on activities were very useful to critically think about natural processes that impact the water environment. They better understood how field and laboratory research data are used to implement water policies.

AB  - This paper explores the processes involved in developing, embedding and sustaining an ECCE practitioner capacity building programme in the community through an interagency approach, which utilises mentoring and coaching strategies for increased knowledge and skills uptake. There is now conclusive international evidence that early childhood care and education (ECCE) is vital in children's learning and development, and that the benefits are long-lasting, and are more cost-effective than educational investments and remedial interventions later in life. This signifies the importance of high quality ECCE for development and learning, and highlights the potential impact of early childhood intervention programmes. This paper explores the implementation of a quality improvement strategy in seven ECCE centres to improve child-outcomes as part of the Young Knocknaheeny Area Based Childhood Programme (YK). Utilising evidence-based programmes, practitioners from a range of disciplines, working in a low-income community with high levels of adversity, are immersed in an environment of continuous learning in line with best practice implementation science. The core elements of the quality improvement strategy focused on language supports for staff (Hanen Learning Language and Loving It™ training), curriculum enhancement ("HighScope" curriculum training), onsite mentoring for staff, and an Environment Enhancement Fund for each centre. The implementation of a Mentoring Programme involved weekly site visits by a specialist onsite mentor in which the implementation of curriculum content and the suggested environmental changes and teaching strategies were overseen and supported. Pre and post Environmental Rating Scale (ERS) assessments; ITERS-R (crèche) and ECERS-3 (pre-school); showed significant improvements in the quality of ECCE services in the YK catchment area following ECCE practitioners participation in the quality improvement initiative. Pre-school rooms across the seven ECCE centres experienced an overall improvement of +2.5 on the ERS scales, and crèche rooms experienced an overall improvement of +2.4. Approximately 700 children aged 1 to 5 years indirectly benefitted from YK-delivered curriculum and language training programmes in their ECCE settings.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) is no longer a surprisingly novel technology. Most art educators have heard about VR, although they may not have a detailed knowledge of or experience with it. However, as VR has become commercialized, education researchers have also looked at using VR for teaching, and they have discussed its effects on students' learning. Here, the authors discuss how to adopt VR in art education and the important role of the arts in VR and VR-integrated lessons. This study proposed a new method of conducting arts-integration lessons using VR technology and shared the process and results of lessons with students who experience VR-, visual arts--, social studies--, and science-integrated lessons. This study also described how to effectively convert personal and transient VR experiences into sharable, everlasting forms of educational performance through visual arts creation. The authors provide art educators with the possibilities for immersive learning by integrating VR technologies with visual arts and other subjects. In addition, the study explains how students' experiences can be materialized within virtual and real spaces through VR visual arts integration.

AB  - A crucial skill for researchers in inter- and transdisciplinary environmental projects is the ability to be reflexive about knowledge and knowledge production. Few studies exist on the operationalization of reflexive skills and teaching and learning strategies that help students master these skills. This research aims to contribute in this direction. We distinguished two components of reflexive skills: (i) assessing the relative contributions of scientific disciplines and non-academic knowledge in addressing environmental issues; (ii) assessing the role of norms and values in research. We developed a framework for teaching and learning reflexive skills and evaluated this framework within a quasi-experimental educational setting involving 3 groups of 30 students. Students' reflexive skills were assessed quantitatively using a pre- and post-test questionnaire. Moreover, students' reflection papers were analysed to get a better understanding of their perspectives on the teaching and learning framework. We show that it is possible to train students in reflexive skills, but it requires a well-designed learning setting.

AB  - Digital tools have evolved into a way of life, and as a result, they have become a growing area of interest for academics who research teaching and learning. Scholars increasingly agree that because digital tools affect human-to-human connection, a greater emphasis on understanding their function in engagement from an interdisciplinary viewpoint is required. However, there does not appear to have been much research on how these tools facilitate social engagement, especially in teaching and learning. This mixed methods study employs a case-study design and explores how digital tools help or hinder social engagement in teaching and learning at a South African-based tertiary institution. A questionnaire consisting of open and closed questions was used to collect data from 88 students from four academic departments at a University of Technology (UoT): Media, Retail and Business Management, Entrepreneurship, and Food Science. Based on the concept of social engagement and the uses and gratifications theory, this interdisciplinary project examines how different fields employ digital tools for social engagement. Some of the findings are that of the communication technologies considered, WhatsApp (97%), video conferencing via Blackboard Collaborate (96.6%) and blackboard course content (95.5%) were the top three ranked tools. Further, WhatsApp was the preferred digital tool for communication with lecturers and peers, while Blackboard was the preferred platform for accessing course materials such as readings and videos. Other than video conferencing platforms such as Zoom, Blackboard Collaborate and YouTube, students use digital tools for engagement with peers. For example, around a quarter of students who used Blackboard Discussion Forums reported engaging with each other. From the qualitative reflections, the study found that students were communicating more with their lecturers through digital tools. Despite having access to lecture recordings, there was still a sense that the educational experience was not as engaging as students wanted it to be because of the lack of in-person engagement.

AB  - This paper aims at highlighting initiatives in developing future statisticians directed at high-school and university levels in Niger. More specifically, it focuses on collaborations, partnerships, outreach initiatives and supporting mechanisms, which may contribute to increase engagement and interest in and attraction to the field of statistics in the era of data science and data-driven innovations. Providing sufficient exposure to modern statistical analysis, computational and graphical tools, written and oral communication skills, and the ever-growing interdisciplinary use of statistics are key activities for building future generations of statisticians. Furthermore, current curricula as well as pedagogical approaches, teaching materials, and assessment methods need to be re-thought in order to meet the requirements of the skills needed in the 21st century ensuring effective interaction with scientists, public institutions, industry, civil society, and policy makers.

AB  - Moreover, the cross-curricular integrative writing approach implemented by the instructors of these courses (the authors) provided students enrolled in the Colleges of Education and the College of Social Sciences, Arts, & Humanities a unique opportunity to become actively engaged in a multidisciplinary approach to learning. The assignment not only enhanced students' writing proficiency but also broadened their exposure to content area knowledge, afforded students an opportunity to synthesis materials across disciplines, and allowed for critical analysis relative to an action-based, translational RE. The collaborative research assignment entailed two major objectives: the developed project was to (1) improve elementary education preservice students' lesson plan writing and implementation proficiency and (2) develop emerging psychology students' ability to produce and implement an action-based research project within the realm of Social Psychology. Students enrolled in RED3013 (Teaching Reading and Diagnosing its Growth) and SOP3003 (Social Psychology) worked collaboratively to complete the course requirements. Throughout the chapter, the authors describe how this teaching approach aided in faculty and student development. The narrative elaborates on tenure-earning elements of teaching and service via peer collaboration. Additionally, the authors highlight the scanty resources that create pitfalls for affording students opportunities to develop as researchers.

AB  - The MicRoboCop project introduces chemistry students to the concepts and protocols of synthetic biology. MicRoboCop is a biosensor that has been designed for unique applications in forensic chemistry. The lab is carried out in collaboration with an instructor teaching a genetics course. Students in the biology course synthesize biosensors using "Escherichia coli" ("E. coli"), and students in the chemistry course evaluate the effectiveness of the biosensors using analytical chemistry methods. Chemistry students learn basic microbiological techniques to culture the bacteria, and they analyze the expression of red fluorescent protein (RFP) using fluorescence spectroscopy. Students in upper-division (third- and fourth-year) chemistry courses evaluated one part of the MicRoboCop system for its response to arsenic(III) and antimony(III) ions using fluorescence spectroscopy. The limits of detection for the biosensor were estimated using a spectrofluorimeter fitted with a 96-well plate reader, and were found to be less than 1 ppb for antimony and arsenic. Additionally, the biosensor was shown to respond similarly to both antimony and arsenic. Several different variations on the analysis of RFP expressing biosensors are presented, as well as different instrumental options for fluorescence analysis.

AB  - The aims of this study are to reveal how science teachers integrate science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) in their lessons and their opinions regarding the advantages and disadvantages they have identified while integrating STEM in their lessons, as well as what kind of difficulties they encounter in the implementation process. For this purpose, a semi-structured interview form was developed and qualitative research method was used. STEM is based on a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to the four disciplines rather than the independent teaching of these four disciplines. The study group comprises 12 science teachers in the province of Mugla in the 2017-2018 academic year. Research findings show that science teachers generally have a positive attitude towards using STEM-based activities but are not able to implement STEM-based activities in an appropriate, complete and accurate way because of difficulties in terms of 'physical conditions' and 'time management'. Teachers stated that STEM education encourages students to do research.

AB  - The aim of this study is to construct a STEM competencies assessment framework and provide validity evidence by empirically testing its structure. Common interdisciplinary assessment frameworks for STEM seem to be scarce in the literature. Many studies use students' mathematics or science scores obtained from large-scale assessments or exams to assess STEM achievement. In the current framework, the multidimensional and integrated structure of the STEM competencies was addressed by taking into account science, technology, engineering, and mathematics domains. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics-related problems that required mathematical calculations were used as a medium to develop an assessment tool for this framework. A test was developed based on this assessment framework and items were calibrated using the item response theory. We tested the structure of the framework through confirmatory factor analysis by collecting data from 8th grade students. The empirical findings supported the structure of the STEM assessment framework.

AB  - Space-related activities remain a fertile environment for classroom applications of chemistry through both traditional lecture styles and through collaborative learning projects. With the resurgence of lunar exploration and the expansion of the commercial space sector, serious scholarship, planning, and resources have been focused on extracting and using lunar materials to sustain activity in space. In this work, several interdisciplinary general chemistry topics and assessment activities are explored through the lens of lunar resource formation, identification, extraction, purification, and employment. Four applications of chemistry are presented: the formation of lunar water via reduction of ores by solar wind, identifying likely locations of lunar water via spectroscopy, extracting water from the lunar regolith for use as fuel, and the extraction, purification, and use of materials from the lunar regolith. A variety of traditional general chemistry topics are explored through these applications, to include light, energy, unit conversions, equilibrium, phase diagrams, oxidation--reduction, and semiconductors.

AB  - In this critical literature review, we seek to understand why multidimensional, psychological measures of human emotion that have been popular in the study of emotion and learning to date, may not yield the statistical power or construct validity necessary to consistently explain or predict human learning. We compare competing theories and conclude that educational studies tend towards use of multi-dimensional models of human emotions which, while useful in educational psychology and therapeutic practice, suffer from psychometric flaws and generate lower power when used as empirical research constructs compared with the "basic emotion" models and their derivatives popular in the neurobiological, cognitive, and social sciences. Based on our review, we conclude that more extensive use of physiological measures and analysis of spontaneous emotion language, both rooted in the basic emotions tradition rather than continued psychological measurement of multi-dimensional emotions, may yield more consistent and significant results and reduce education researchers' reliance on self-report measures. Findings from the review may advance the selection of operational definitions and formulation of research questions for new empirical studies of the intersections between emotion and learning.

AB  - This book contains the full text of papers and posters presented at the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2022), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (WIARS). Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2022 received 790 submissions, from more than 45 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. The conference accepted for presentation 263 submissions (33% acceptance rate), from which, 233 submissions are published in full text in these volumes. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. This is the Volume 2 of the book Education and New Developments 2022 and it contains the results of the research and developments conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to promote growth in research methods intimately related to teaching, learning and applications in Education nowadays. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, who will extend our view in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues, by sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This second volume focus in the main areas of Projects and Trends and Organizational Issues. [For Volume 1, see ED622189. This document contains the proceedings of END 2022: International Conference on Education and New Developments (Madeira, Portugal, June 18-20, 2022).]

AB  - This article showcases STEM as an interdisciplinary field in which the disciplines strengthen and support each other (not as separate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines). The authors focus on an open-ended, complex problem--water quality--as the primary teaching and learning task. The participants, middle school female students (aged 9-15 years), interacted in an informal educational setting (i.e., Girl Scouts) on a research project investigating river quality following the river's restoration. The community, including Girl Scout participants, leaders, parents, university faculty, graduate students, and others, utilized an action research (AR) approach when interacting with the participants. Methods such as observational field notes, focus groups, and collected artifacts were commonly employed. The authors describe the history of STEM and AR leading to authentic science research projects through eight engineering skills/practices (incorporating science, technology, and mathematics) and showcase participant interactions, implementation, and community engagement in the STEM water quality river project. Findings indicate that informal engineering based projects can serve as opportunities for participants to connect with integrated STEM. Implications include the need for engaging participants in informal authentic science to support traditional school STEM learning and encouraging community engagement in integrated STEM to support traditional K-12 classroom instruction.

AB  - What role does advertising play in product development as part of owned media? For three years, a capstone advertising campaign course collaborated with STEM courses to form interdisciplinary teams composed of advertising, engineering, and computer science. The study provides insight into how teams can be more entrepreneurial by building on the strengths and techniques advertising students possess. Students, faculty, and external partners all saw the experiences as rewarding and valuable. Incorporating scrum project management gave more agency to advertising students while exposing them to product development processes commonly used by those who create technology. STEM students benefited from in-depth research to inform the products and see how advertising techniques can influence their development process. An overview of the approach, scrum project management, technology, assessment tools, lessons learned, and strategies to accomplish meaningful learning throughout the campaign collaborations with STEM students are provided.

AB  - Within cross-curricular literacy (CCL) initiatives at colleges and universities, there still remain challenges in preparing and supporting instructors from different disciplinary backgrounds. This small, exploratory study investigates the ways that literacy experiences and disciplinary backgrounds shape the teaching practice of five science writing instructors, three with English/Writing Studies backgrounds, and two with science backgrounds. Findings show that, for instructors in our discipline-linked program, disciplinary background shapes their course goals, their need for cross-disciplinary mentoring, and their levels of confidence in teaching science writing. Reflections for CCL leaders conclude the article.

AB  - This study aims to compare and contrast the connotations of the concepts of "science" and "history" that were formed in the minds of students attending both Faculty of Science and Letters, History Department and Faculty of Education, Science Education Department at Agri Ibrahim Çeçen University. The participants of the study are 173 students from the History Department, including the whole education level of the department and 71 students from Science Education Department including all classes. The participants were asked what they mean by the concepts of "science" and "history" and what connotations they made. Survey method is used in a descriptive research model. The Word Association Test (WAT) related to history and science has been utilized as a data collection tool. According to findings received after the analysis, it is found that there was no significant difference between cognitive sentence structures of the students, who are attending different disciplines, towards both the concept of history and science. As a result of the Word Association Test, although there are some differences according to the departments of education, many concepts in general are similar. When examining the cognitive sentence structures for the concepts, there is a need for research on the interrelationship of basic concepts with special areas. Thus, this research gains more importance.

AB  - Although Machine Learning (ML) is found practically everywhere, few understand the technology behind it. This presents new challenges to extend computing education by including ML concepts in order to help students to understand its potential and limits and empowering them to become creators of intelligent solutions. Therefore, we developed an introductory course to teach basic ML concepts, such as fundamentals of neural networks as well as limitations and ethical concerns in alignment with the K-12 Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence. It also teaches the application of these concepts, by guiding the students to develop a first classification model of recycling trash images using Google Teachable Machine. In order to promote ML education, the interactive course is available online in Brazilian Portuguese to be used as an extracurricular course or in an interdisciplinary way as part of science classes covering recycling topics. The course was applied and evaluated through a series of exploratory case studies with a total of 108 middle and high school students. The results of the evaluation show that middle and high school students were able to understand ML concepts and develop an image classification model. No substantial difference with regard to the educational stage, gender and instructional mode was observed. The course was also perceived as an enjoyable learning experience motivating students to learn more about ML.

AB  - A curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (called STEM education) has been implemented in K-12 schools in the United States for several years. The purpose of this article is to explore the further integration of issues-based art education into STEM education (hereafter-called issues-based STEAM education) to expand the benefits of STEM education for school children. Adopting issues-based art education into STEM education provides students with a more authentic learning experience because its interdisciplinary pedagogy emphasizes inquiry-based, real-world learning, and critical thinking. In this article, we discuss the recent educational movement from STEM to STEAM, followed by an introduction to issues-based STEAM education. We then provide a relevant lesson implemented in a Hong Kong high school to shed light on the significance of issues-based STEAM education and as rationale for the importance of issues-based STEAM education that engages art students by exploring social issues.

AB  - A biochemistry class was transformed to implement student-centered, active-learning pedagogies to help improve competencies associated with the scientific method. In responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, the course content switched from the biochemistry of nucleic acids to the science of the newly discovered virus, SARS-CoV-2. This provided a unique opportunity to model authentic science inquiry through cycles of questioning, investigating, assessing, and critical thinking on a rapidly evolving, interdisciplinary topic. This learning experience helped enhance science literacy, supported self-directed learning and curiosity, and emphasized the importance of evaluating information sources to recognize misinformation.

AB  - While many studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between learning in the arts and students' critical thinking disposition, few studies have investigated the influence of an interdisciplinary art-related teaching approach and its correlation with academic student behavior confidence in anatomy and physiology (A&P). Therefore, this study aims to demonstrate the impact of an interdisciplinary approach -- reading, discussion, and drawing on students' academic confidence in undergraduate A&P. The investigation utilized a self-reported pre- and post-survey design to explore the change in confidence in A&P between course entry and exit. Sixty undergraduate students completed surveys while taking an elective course called Medical Literature, Anatomy, and the Arts, at a public state university in Southwest Florida. Results indicate a statistically significant difference in student-reported confidence levels in knowledge and experience of A&P. Additionally, the students' perceptions of the course were positive, citing more engagement and better support from peers and instructor as a result of this interdisciplinary approach. These outcomes suggest that teaching undergraduate students in A&P using medical arts enhances student academic confidence. This study provides encouraging support to existing scholarly work on higher education course design and instructional methods relative to improving student confidence and class engagement in A&P.

AB  - The inclusion of engineering practices poses a challenge for many science teachers trying to meet the expectations of the Next Generation Science Standards because they lack formal training in engineering. This, however, may provide an opportunity for science teacher educators striving to improve the use of learner-centered teaching practices by science teachers. The exploratory study in this article describes the impact to teachers' practices of a professional development program on the inclusion of engineering in high school chemistry. Survey data and a case study of 1 of the participants were used to assess the professional development program. By the end of the program, teachers described using engineering activities in their classroom along with more general changes to other aspects of their teaching. The subject of the case study included new student-centered teaching methods in his teaching practice in the year following the professional development. In line with conceptual change theory and transfer of learning theory, the results of this study led to the hypothesis that learning to include engineering in their classrooms may improve secondary science teachers' use of learner-centered practices throughout their teaching.

AB  - The worldwide scientific community has been promoting science communication from colleges and universities to schools, and different tools for communicating scientific discoveries have been created. Among this variety of tools, our choice fell on a storybook. The book, entitled "The Curious Case of Ants That Live in Galls," is directed at 8-to-12-year-old children, and its use is suggested for literature and science classes. We propose either reading the text with the students or individual reading, followed by a debate and retextualization exercise. Also, the teacher can use the story as a motivation to address the science content and to discuss the scientific method. We observed the emergence of new questions, teaching methodologies, and didactic resources capable of amplifying the scientific context and, consequently, the student's motivation.

AB  - In this paper we highlight the issues and opportunities of a participatory action research (PAR) and co-design project, currently being undertaken as engaged research between academics at Durham University and practitioners at the UK's International Centre for Life in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne (CfL; see creativescienceatlife.com for more information and developments). The focus is on the use of PAR to enable university researchers and Science Centre professionals to co-design Informal Science Learning exhibits that enhance creativity and innovation in young people. We define the principles of PAR and explore reasons for adopting the approach. An account is provided of the iterative co-design and piloting of a novel exhibit within a new exhibition space at the CfL. Reflections collated independently by the practitioners and the academics involved highlighting the development of ideas and insights over the course of the PAR process. We discuss how PAR enabled effective engagement with and creation of enriched knowledge, and innovation, in both the academy and science-learning professionals. The added value of PAR and co-production to our project aligns with current calls for a redefining of how societal impact of academic research is considered.

AB  - The potential of the arts and sciences for economic and social development is under conceptualized. However, the recent development of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), justifying increased support for training in the sciences, shows a parallel pathway forward for the arts. The arts are increasingly relevant to the economy, amenable to policy influence as well as an area of human activity in their own right. The authors posit a unified arts framework: PAVAM (performing arts, visual arts, and music), complementing STEM as the basis for a strategy of arts-based interdisciplinary "industrial" policy making. The growing salience of the arts as an industrial sector in the UK and USA is shown. By identifying sources and pathways of value creation from the arts, clear entry points for policy action become identifiable to promote innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic development. Comparative case studies suggest a typology of the arts' potential as sources of creativity, innovation, and regional economic development.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to introduce a comprehensive instructional model that takes into consideration three frameworks for designing instruction (Universal Design for Learning, Understanding by Design, and the 7E Learning Cycle) and incorporates Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge and Mindset (attitudes, beliefs, dispositions toward teaching and learning) that serves to advance STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) instruction with pre-service teachers. The proposed model will be used in teaching pre-service prek-12 teachers in the following courses: Mathematics Methods, Science Methods, Human Development and Learning Theory, and Classroom Management. It explores how the frameworks, TPaCK, and Mindset can be integrated to form a holistic and interdisciplinary model for designing instruction, particularly in STEM courses. Each framework has a different focus, which is discussed, along with how TPaCK and Mindset can influence how one uses the framework to design instruction. Among these frameworks, there exists a convergence of pedagogy, instructional design, planning, and strategic use of technology that provides an opportunity for a holistic, interdisciplinary approach to designing instruction that serves both teacher and student: teachers in becoming more effective instructors, and students in becoming more effective learners. A brief review of each framework, TPaCK and Mindset is included as well as the description of The Oswald-Gentile Model of Instruction, a holistic approach to designing instruction that takes into consideration both the learner and the teacher.

AB  - Purpose: The present paper aims to examine the concept of "plant blindness" in the context of current sustainability debates. "Plant blindness" was the term introduced in 1999 by the botanists and educators James H Wandersee and Elisabeth E Schussler to describe what they saw as a pervasive insensitivity to the green environment and a general neglect of plants on the part of biology education. Design/methodology/approach: The fundamental importance of plants for life on Earth and the socio-educational challenges of redacted awareness of this importance are considered. Also, the diverse physiological, psychological, philosophical, cultural and geopolitical origins and consequences of indifference to plants in relation to aspects of sustainability agendas are examined with special reference to education. Findings: An examination of the outcomes of a range of research and practical initiatives reveals how multidisciplinary approaches to education and public engagement have the potential to address the challenge of "plant blindness". The need for these opportunities to be reflected in curriculums is not widely appreciated, and the socio-economic forces of resistance to confronting plant neglect continue to be formidable. Originality/value: Plant blindness is a relatively new field of research, and the full breadth of its implications are only gradually becoming apparent. If the present paper contributes to positioning plants as an essential element in sustainability education and practice, it will have met its objective.

AB  - This article shifts from the formal learning spaces of school and university to an Australian public swimming pool to playfully engage some of the dilemmas that recent theory poses for curriculum studies. The article enacts multiple diffractions (Barad, 2007) as theory becomes swimming and swimming becomes theory, and ideas and movements are themselves diffracted or changed by the writing of a poem. "What does the pool teach us?" "What is learnt at the pool?" "How does learning emerge at the pool?" Physics, chemistry, biology, and artistry combine, as multiple human and non-human bodies intra-act (Barad, 2007), calling each other into being in this exploration of how distributed agencies and fractal causalities (Bennett, 2010) change how learning might be thought, represented, and swum. The poem incorporated here serves as provocation and inspiration for other scholars struggling with these educational dilemmas and interested in arts-based research.

AB  - Active learning research emerged from the undergraduate STEM education communities of practice, some of whom identify as discipline-based education researchers (DBER). Consequently, current frameworks of active learning are largely inductive and based on emergent patterns observed in undergraduate teaching and learning. Alternatively, classic learning theories historically originate from the educational psychology community, which often takes a theory-driven, or deductive research approach. The broader transdisciplinary education research community is now struggling to reconcile the two. That is, how is a theory of active learning distinct from other theories of knowledge construction? We discuss the underpinnings of active learning in the geosciences, drawing upon extant literature from the educational psychology community on engagement. Based on Sinatra et al. engagement framework, we propose a model for active learning in the geosciences with four dimensions: behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and agentic. We then connect existing literature from the geoscience education community to the model to demonstrate the current gaps in our literature base and opportunities to move the active learning geoscience education research (GER) forward. We propose the following recommendations for future investigation of active learning in the geosciences: (1) connect future GER to our model of active learning in the geosciences; (2) measure more than content learning; (3) document research methods and outcomes with effect sizes to accumulate evidence; and (4) prioritize research on dimensions of active learning essential to the geosciences.

AB  - Background: Preparing today's undergraduate students from science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and related health professions to solve wide-sweeping healthcare challenges is critical. Moreover, it is imperative that educators help students develop the capabilities needed to meet those challenges, including problem solving, collaboration, and an ability to work with rapidly evolving technologies. We piloted a multidisciplinary education (ME) course aimed at filling this gap, and subsequently assessed whether or not students identified achieving the course objectives. In the course, undergraduate students from engineering, pre-nursing (students not yet admitted to the nursing program), and pre-professional health (e.g., pre-med and pre-physician's assistant) were grouped based on their diversity of background, major, and StrengthsFinder® proficiencies in a MakerSpace to create tangible solutions to health-related problems facing the community. We then used qualitative content analysis to assess the research question: what is the impact of undergraduate multidisciplinary education offered in a MakerSpace on student attitudes towards and perceptions of skills required in their own as well as others occupations? Results: We discovered these students were able to identify and learn capabilities that will be critical in their future work. For example, students appreciated the challenging problems they encountered and the ability to meet demands using cutting-edge technologies including 3D printers. Moreover, they learned the value of working in a multidisciplinary group. We expected some of these findings, such as an increased ability to work in teams. However, some themes were unexpected, including students explicitly appreciating the method of teaching that focused on experiential student learning through faculty mentoring. Conclusions: These findings can be used to guide additional research. Moreover, offering a variety of these courses is a necessary step to prepare students for the current and future workforce. Finally, these classes should include a focus on intentional team creation with the goal of allowing students to solve challenging real-world problems through ethical reasoning and collaboration.

AB  - Extensive literature within the learning sciences addresses the phenomenon of online engagement and strategies that support online learning. However, for academics, there is limited guidance to support them in the processes of reflecting on efforts to facilitate online learner engagement and, ultimately, to use those reflections to redesign approaches to teaching and learning. This paper reports on findings from an international case study that involved a group of interdisciplinary academics engaged in a process of critical reflection, which aimed to increase their understanding of the ways in which online engagement is supported in higher education. Findings from the current study suggested that reference to an online engagement framework heightens the effectiveness of critical reflection by elucidating an awareness of learning about ways of supporting student learning and online engagement to improve student success. The paper offers implications related to reflection on and of practice.

AB  - Background: Service learning has been studied and applied in diverse educational settings for the past seven decades. While several research reviews have explored service learning from varied perspectives, none have employed bibliometric methods to investigate its evolution as a "knowledge base." Purpose: This review documents the evolving landscape and analyzes the intellectual structure of research on service learning. Methodology/Approach: The review analyzed 5,815 Scopus-indexed documents on service learning using descriptive statistics and science mapping. Findings: The review found that service learning constitutes a mature, rapidly expanding interdisciplinary field, with over 75% of the documents published since 2010. Despite its global scope, the literature remains concentrated in Western, economically developed nations. The intellectual structure of the literature encompasses four interconnected schools of thought: Service Learning Designs and Effects, Theory and Research, Implementation, and Engineering Education. Implications: The review highlights the importance of cross-pollination of theoretical perspectives and empirical findings in service learning research and practice. Subsequent research should prioritize the exploration of service learning in developing countries, the evaluation of diverse theoretical perspectives in studies of service learning designs and effects, and the use of mixed research methods in exploration of cultural, social, and political influences on service learning outcomes.

AB  - Growing research evidence indicates student learning gains from guided representation construction/invention in school science and mathematics. In this inquiry approach, students address challenges around what features of a phenomenon/problem to attend to, what data to collect, how and why, and make collective judgments about multimodal accounts of phenomena. However, researchers to date have tended to focus on student learning rather than on the teacher's role in guiding various phases of inquiry. In this paper we report on (a) analysis of Grade 1 students' engagement in interdisciplinary mathematics and science inquiry practices in a classroom sequence in ecology; (b) the teacher's role in guiding such inquiry; and (c) interpretation of these practices in terms of support of student transduction (connecting and remaking meanings across representations in different modes). Data from our study included video capture of two case study teachers' guidance of tasks and classroom discussion and student artefacts. We examine the classroom processes through which the teachers used students' invention and revision of data displays to teach the concepts of living things, diversity, distribution and adaptive features related to habitat in science. Mathematical processes included constructing and interpreting mapping, measurement and data modelling, sampling and using a scale. The analysis offers fresh insights into how teachers support student learning in these two subjects, through discrete stages of orienting, representation challenge, building consensus and applying and extending representational systems.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the examination of the researches about the use of technology by fine arts teachers. The study was conducted according to the content and citation analysis model. In this context, Web of Science (WOS) Core Collection indexes were included. In the document scanning in the WOS environment, the keywords 'Fine arts', 'Teachers' and 'Technology' were searched. In total, 169 documents were examined and analysed one by one. They were analysed according to year, document type, WOS content category, country, source title, organisation and citation, authors, publication language and categories. As a result of this research, the first study was conducted in 2004, while the most studies were conducted in 2016. It was concluded that the published studies had the most Proceedings papers as the document type. The area where the studies of fine arts teachers on the use of technology are mostly carried out is Education Educational Research, according to the Web of Science content category. The most researched title in the distribution according to the Source Title field is 'International Multidisciplinary Scientific Conferences on Social Sciences and Arts.' The university with the most studies is Kazan Federal University. The 19 authors who conducted the studies have a large number of studies in this field. It was concluded that other authors had only one study in the field. Again, when we look at the distribution of the countries and documents according to the language of writing, the country with the most studies is China and the language of the documents is English. The area continues to evolve.

AB  - Drawing on case study evidence, this article explores the development of compulsory courses in a China's high-level comprehensive university, which has achieved good results in the procedure of Quality Assessment of Undergraduate Education (QAUE) and China Discipline Ranking (CDR) issued by Ministry of Education (MOE). The general undergraduate majors of this university are classified into 5 categories, namely, journalism and communication, economics and management, science and engineering, foreign language and literature, humanities and social science. The research scope is from grade 2007 to 2017, 2007 fall to 2018 spring semester, respectively. According to the requirements of MOE, the compulsory courses are divided into two parts: public and professional. The public part mainly refers to the courses of physical education, ideological and political and elementary computer science, while the professional part is mostly relevant to the courses associate with the major. The laws of two parts are studied by utilizing the features of course name, course ID, credits and appropriate semester. The conditions of characteristic development, the workload of teachers and students and the interdisciplinary platform, which are universal in Chinese Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), are mentioned.

AB  - Bioprocess engineering is a highly interdisciplinary field of study which is strongly benefited by practical courses where students can actively experience the interconnection between biology, engineering, and physical sciences. This work describes a lab course developed for 2nd year undergraduate students of bioprocess engineering and related disciplines, where students are challenged with a real-life bioprocess-engineering application, the production of recombinant protein in a fed-batch process. The lab course was designed to introduce students to the subject of operating and supervising an experiment in a bioreactor, along with the analysis of collected data and a final critical evaluation of the experiment. To provide visual feedback of the experimental outcome, the organism used during class was "Escherichia coli" which carried a plasmid to recombinantly produce enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) upon induction. This can easily be visualized in both the bioreactor and samples by using ultraviolet light. The lab course is performed with bioreactors of the simplest design, and is therefore highly flexible, robust and easy to reproduce. As part of this work the implementation and framework, the results, the evaluation and assessment of student learning combined with opinion surveys are presented, which provides a basis for instructors intending to implement a similar lab course at their respective institution.

AB  - Purpose: The study investigated how various school subjects can be integrated into archaeology teaching and how this could lead students towards empathy and a more sustainable worldview. Design/methodology/approach: To meet the purpose of this multiple-case study, optional archaeology course development (2011-2019) and students' questionnaires and feedback group A (2018) and group B (2019) and various empirical material, was analysed in cross-case methods. Findings: Archaeology interdisciplinarity and analysing long-term human behaviour supports an understanding of human nature, emphasizes empathy and tolerance, and encourages social cohesion. Research limitations/implications: The study was carried out in Estonia as a multiple-case study and further research, especially in the empathy part, is needed for further conclusions. Practical implications: Archaeology is interdisciplinary and therefore as a school subject it links together various and sometimes abstract subjects. It gives an understanding of long-term human behaviour, which allows developing students' empathy and tolerance.

AB  - Integrating physiology core concepts into the clinical years of medical education has been challenging despite efforts. This article describes a fourth-year medical school elective, Advanced Physiology in Critical Care Medicine, that focused on integrating physiology core concepts in a case-based learning approach. The elective used interdisciplinary faculty in a virtual forum. Senior students were asked to generate mechanism of disease (MOD) maps, highlight the physiology core concepts associated with paper cases of critically ill patients, and discuss with faculty the relevance of the underlying basic science. The weekly footprint consisted of a student-led session presenting MOD maps for three cases, which examined aspects of core physiology concepts, and, later in the same week, student presentation of order sets for the management of the cases. Students ended the 4-wk elective with a mini-grand rounds presentation on a topic of their choice incorporating the core concept paradigm. Student perception data and faculty reflections of the elective course are included. Student data and faculty observations suggest that students appreciate and can apply physiological core concepts to patient care. Faculty experience in the course suggests that this senior elective helped them better approach all preclinical teaching with the Core Concepts framework in mind.

AB  - Fostering students' competence in applying interdisciplinary knowledge to solve problems has been recognized as an important and challenging issue globally. This is why STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) education has been emphasized at all levels in schools. Meanwhile, the use of robotics has played an important role in STEM learning design. The purpose of this study was to fill a gap in the current review of research on Robotics-based STEM (R-STEM) education by systematically reviewing existing research in this area. This systematic review examined the role of robotics and research trends in STEM education. A total of 39 articles published between 2012 and 2021 were analyzed. The review indicated that R-STEM education studies were mostly conducted in the United States and mainly in K-12 schools. Learner and teacher perceptions were the most popular research focus in these studies which applied robots. LEGO was the most used tool to accomplish the learning objectives. In terms of application, Technology (programming) was the predominant robotics-based STEM discipline in the R-STEM studies. Moreover, project-based learning (PBL) was the most frequently employed learning strategy in robotics-related STEM research. In addition, STEM learning and transferable skills were the most popular educational goals when applying robotics. Based on the findings, several implications and recommendations to researchers and practitioners are proposed.

AB  - In a constantly and rapidly changing social world, students from all disciplines ought to attain a rounded education within the tradition of a "Liberal Arts and Sciences" (LAS) context. Students outside of the natural sciences must be encouraged to appreciate the place of those sciences in their lives. Conversely, students in the natural sciences must be encouraged to envision the role of other subjects in their lives. In order to accomplish this, however, we need to go beyond basic instructional approaches by applying alternatives such as using magazines and newspapers. This paper reports students' reflections on the use of newspapers as supplementary instructional materials to enhance learning. Data were collected from an introductory liberal arts physics course using a survey instrument. The survey had five descriptive measures: student perceptions; creativity based on activities learned; ability to link concepts learned in class to articles in the news journal; ability to impart knowledge acquired; and identifying lessons based on a case study of a selected news article from the newspaper. Student reflections indicate that magazines can effect a positive learning experience and stimulate curiosity to read. It is concluded that this approach can be used to enhance student motivation and persistence in introductory classes, particularly in schools where resources are limited.

AB  - This article outlines the theoretical rationale and process for an integrated-science approach to teaching sensation and perception (S&P) to undergraduate psychology students that may also serve as an integrated-science curriculum. The course aimed to introduce the interdisciplinary evolution of this psychological field irrespective of any presumed distinctions between hard and soft science. The class began with perceptual science's foundations in Fourier decomposition and culminated in more recent developments with the perceptual science's interest in pattern-formation phenomena from fluid dynamics, and class illustrated this transition with various applications in music, art, and materials science. Post-course responses to the Research on Integrated Science Curriculum survey demonstrated that our students made significantly large gains in course elements, specifically making the most of the students pre-existing experiences. We find that students are ready and willing to engage in the study of S&P by setting aside neuroscience's sometimes constraining assumptions.

AB  - This article details the aim, development, and implementation of the Chemistry-Genetics Course Collaborative (CGCC), a cotaught offering of a human genetics course with an honors introductory chemistry course. The CGCC was formed to fully integrate the two courses, along with the associated chemistry lab, to create an interdisciplinary scientific community among the students and their professors. The design of the courses was purposefully aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards, incorporating its interwoven strands of disciplinary core ideas, scientific practices, and crosscutting concepts. This article represents Part I of the research and contains the original interdisciplinary plan for the semester, along with the revised schedule after repeated, unified, and purposeful attempts by both faculty members to encourage students to buy into the course design were largely unsuccessful. Detailed descriptions of course assessments and rubrics, issues to be considered in designing such a nontraditional course structure, and reflections on the experience of implementing one are also included. Part II of the research, to be published separately, will focus on the analysis of assessment, attitude, and interview data.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the educational benefits and challenges of introducing natural science students to on-campus and off-campus sustainability research projects as an approach to education for sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: The course "Science and Sustainability" at the University of Leuven is a stand-alone course that aims at providing master students in the natural sciences, education for (the benefit of) sustainability action. It was launched in 2016-2017 and has been running for two years now. The first year focused on getting students acquire a similar level of knowledge in sustainability, while, on a higher level, the experiential learning phase (project work) was supported with specific reflection assignments. In the second year, more specific attention was directed toward allowing students to get acquainted with systems thinking and deal with inter- and transdisciplinary issues by approaching problems from a multi-stakeholder view. Insight in the impact and the appreciation of the setup of the course was obtained from a series of questionnaires offered to all participating students at the beginning, about midway, and again at the end of the course. Findings: Analysis of the students' self-reported sustainability competence development shows a clear positive impact for almost all students who participated. A clear relation between the observed change and the students' self-rating and attitude at the start, as well as with their discipline, is observed. Originality/value: Information is gained on a number of factors of importance to impact the students' attitude toward action for sustainability, and how this can be further improved.

AB  - For the purpose of introducing the trends and development of science teacher education in Taiwan, three stages of teacher education were explored in this study: the distant past (DP)--1949 to 1994; the immediate past (IP):1994 to 2017; and the present and future (PF): 2018 and beyond. Each of the three stages has had a different emphasis on science teacher education. In the DP stage, science teacher education in Taiwan focused mainly on preparing elementary and secondary school science teachers with sufficient science knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge and to be good role models in the classroom. During the IP stage, the "Teacher Education Act" [TEA] was enacted in 1994, and the teacher education system in Taiwan changed from a centralized system to a decentralized one. Multiple channels were opened for teacher preparation. In this period of time, the purpose of science teacher education shifted from providing good role models and sufficient science knowledge to developing competency-based professional science teachers. All teacher education programs in Taiwan could offer science teacher education training courses for pre-service science teachers. In addition, the teaching internship duration was reduced from 1 year to one semester. Teacher certification became a dominant focus in each county or school. During the PF stage, an amended TEA was implemented in 2017, and 12-year continued curriculum standards were officially implemented in the public school system in 2019. The 12-year continued curriculum standards address inquiry, practices and cross-discipline instruction. Science teachers need not only to teach science content knowledge, but also to integrate content knowledge, inquiry competence and other discipline areas into their teaching. The demand for good science teachers is increasing. Meanwhile, the low recruitment rate for science teachers impedes the public's willingness to enroll in teacher education programs. Few teachers with bachelor degrees can pass the teacher certification exam necessary to be hired in teaching positions. Although the conditions for pre-service science teachers are harsh, there is demand in our teacher education system to recruit science teachers with talent and passion.

AB  - It has been recognised for some time by Science and Engineering departments that students are entering Higher Education illequipped in terms of their mathematical skills, despite having in many cases, attained good grades at Higher/A level (The Engineering Council 2000; Fry, Ketteridge & Marshall 1999; Score Education 2009). In an attempt, therefore, to ensure that all students progressing on to Chemistry degrees are equally prepared (in terms of ability and confidence) to attempt the more mathematical aspects of our courses, the School of Chemistry has over recent years been sequentially introducing mathematics support into the curriculum.As part of the School's ongoing mathematical support provision, the aim of this project was two-fold: 1) to assess the popularity and effectiveness of tailored maths support sessions and 2) in relation to the teaching of mathematical concepts to science students, collate examples of existing appropriate open educational resources to provide additional support to facilitate student learning such as RSC Discover Maths for Chemistry and Math Centre (Royal Society of Chemistry; MathCentre 2016). A pilot project has been carried out during the academic year 2015-2016, where support sessions were delivered in tutorial format by the Maths Adviser. Although the sessions were open to all 3rd year students studying on chemistry degree programmes, the expectation was that they would mainly be attended by students with little formal mathematics training and those who are less confident about their abilities.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented amounts of information communicated to the public relating to STEM. The pandemic can be seen as a 'wicked problem' defined by high complexity, uncertainty and contested social values requiring a transdisciplinary approach formulating social policy. This article argues that a 'Critical STEM Literacy' is required to engage sufficiently with STEM knowledge and how science operates and informs personal health decisions. STEM literacy is necessary to critique government social policy decisions that set rules for behaviour to limit the spread of COVID-19. Ideas of scientific, mathematical and critical literacy are discussed before reviewing some current knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to aid interpretation of the examples provided. The article draws on experience of the pandemic in the United Kingdom (UK), particularly mathematical modelling used to calculate the reproductive rate (R) of COVID-19, communication of mortality and case data using graphs and the mitigation strategies of social distancing and mask wearing. In all these examples, there is an interaction of STEM with a political milieu that often misrepresents science as activity to generate one dependable truth, rather than through careful empirical validation of new knowledge. Critical STEM literacy thus requires appreciation of the social practices of science such as peer review and assessment of bias. Implications of the pandemic for STEM education in schools requiring critical thinking and in understanding disease epidemiology in a global context are discussed.

AB  - Due to a lack of science instruction and a need to serve an increasing number of students identifying as Emerging Bilingual, one school district in Oregon sought to develop a new method of integrating science and language instruction. In the model, all teachers taught science with embedded language instruction, three to four days a week, to every K-5 student, during a specific, dedicated time of the school day. This initiative sought to build science content knowledge and language proficiency simultaneously through science investigations that put language as the integral component to learning. The research was designed in collaboration with a local university as part of a long-term research-practice partnership with the goal to understand, refine, and repeat the initiative using a reflective, triangulated case study approach. The partnership utilized three rounds of teacher surveys, teacher interviews, and quantitative analyses of student science standardized test scores to understand how science investigations could build science content knowledge and language proficiency simultaneously. Results showed that the innovative initiative increased the quantity of science teaching in the district, may have increased students' science knowledge, but results also showed that improvements to the model are needed.

AB  - In a year-long undergraduate research program, life science majors were paired with majors in the other STEM disciplines of computer science, engineering, mathematics and physical sciences, to work on interdisciplinary life science projects. Typical teams had one undergraduate in a life science and one from another STEM discipline, along with faculty and graduate student mentors from each of those disciplines. In a survey at the end of the program, undergraduates indicated their career plans: 74% staying in STEM, 26% moving to non-STEM, with most of the latter in healthcare. In the summer phase, the average and range of the total number of interactions between undergraduates and all of their mentors was about the same for students in both career groups. However, students differed in whether they tended to interact more frequently with mentors in their own discipline, or to interact with closer to equal frequency with mentors in both disciplines. Binary logistic regression analysis showed this differential frequency of interaction with mentors by discipline to be predictive of students' career decisions, with students in the non-STEM career group interacting much more within their own discipline and the students in the STEM career group tending to interact almost as frequently with mentors in both disciplines. Analysis also showed that, compared to students who planned on non-STEM careers, those who planned on STEM careers self-reported lower ease of communication with team members but higher ratings for their program experience. Consistent with national data, the student's area of study was predictive: 56% of the life science and 91% of the other STEM majors planned for STEM careers. However, inconsistent with the predominance of men in the STEM workforce, in our program where there were almost equal numbers of men and women in both the life sciences and other STEM fields, there was no gender difference in career choice: 72% of the men and 76% of the women indicated their intention to pursue careers in STEM.

AB  - Traditional teacher professional development (PD) programs frequently lack sufficient face-to-face preparation time to adequately support the implementation of evidence-based pedagogical strategies in classrooms, with teachers citing insufficient preparedness and training time for new methods. To investigate potentials for online PD methods to effectively address these issues, while increasing sustainability, this study examined teachers in Title-I elementary schools spanning multiple school districts participating in a large-scale online PD certificate program preparing teachers over 10 instructional weeks to implement Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) (S)cience, (T)echnology, (E)ngineering, (A)rts, (M)ath (STEAM) curricular instruction with goals of increasing teachers' science content knowledge, self-efficacy to implement STEAM instruction, and STEAM teaching perceptions. Paired sample t-tests indicate teachers' life science content knowledge, self-efficacy, and STEAM perceptions increased significantly after completing the online PD. Multiple regression analyses identified teachers' science content knowledge and STEAM perceptions as statistically significant predictors of teachers' self-efficacy to implement STEAM instructional strategies. Teachers' posttest course evaluations were gleaned, highlighting three emergent themes: learning experience design, modality, and online teacher collaboration. Utilizing a mixed method approach, these qualitative insights corroborated the quantitative trends, describing how specific aspects of the pedagogical learning experience design (LXD) framework operationalized in the online course fostered a practitioner development learning environment, focused on supporting teachers' learning needs. Results suggest practical design implications for sustainably increasing the efficacy of PD through online teacher training developed in conjunction with LXD models for iterative improvement and design of high-quality online instructional PD programs.

AB  - Information and communications technology (ICT) shapes life and work in every educational system. Where to place ICT in the pedagogical process and how it affects students' psychosocial and cognitive abilities are questions that do not have one definitive answer. The research addresses the intense introduction of ICT that accords with educational trends and the requirements of today's society, but sometimes neglects social competences and any potential psychosocial effects. A need for new and effective methods in upbringing and education to offer everyone, equal opportunities become more and more important in the "world of the 21st century". The research also proved that innovative didactic methods of teaching (4.0) using a transdisciplinary model and supported by state-of-the-art information and communications technology as well as cooperative learning, have a positive psychosocial effect on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) students. Students who experience innovative didactic teaching supported by ICT reach higher taxonomic, cognitive and social standards of competence and are thus better prepared for the challenges of future society.

AB  - In many countries' policy documents and curricula, teachers in the subject areas of science, social science and language are encouraged to collaborate on cross-curricular issues such as sustainable development (SD). This study is conducted in secondary schools (compulsory years 7-9) in Sweden and investigates the similarities and differences in the responses of ten teacher groups (forty-three teachers in total) to questions about their teaching contributions in their own subject areas to education for sustainable development (ESD). The overall aim is to understand how teachers of these three subject areas can contribute to cross-curricular teaching in teacher teams in the context of ESD. This is done by analysing the group responses from data collected in group discussions concerning the teaching dimensions "what" (content), "how" (methods) and "why" (purposes) in relation to ESD. We first analyse the teacher group responses and arguments regarding their contribution to ESD teaching from each subject area separately. Thereafter, we comparatively analyse how the different subject areas' contributions overlap or complement each other in a potential collaborative ESD teaching. The results show that teachers from different subject areas stress different yet complimentary dimensions of teaching and perspectives of ESD. The implications for cross-curricular teaching in ESD are also discussed.

AB  - Scientific modeling and coding are critical skills to be integrated into K-12 instruction. Research has shown that preservice teachers are often ill-prepared for teaching scientific modeling, and lack opportunities to learn coding within teacher education programs. The present study reports the implementation of an instructional module and online system, called Coding in Scientific Modeling Lessons (CS-ModeL), which was designed to scaffold preservice science teachers' learning to code simulations and design scientific modeling lessons that feature simulation coding. In this study, we examined preservice teachers' epistemic discourse during simulation coding, perceptions of coding for future teaching, and coding-enhanced scientific modeling lessons. This was a qualitative single case study that involved six participants enrolled in a science teacher education course. Participants worked in pairs during scientific modeling activities, and each pair was considered an embedded unit within the single case. Data sources included transcripts of screen recordings captured during simulation coding, transcripts of individual semi-structured interviews, and lessons in which participants used simulation coding as part of scientific modeling activities. Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted. Findings revealed that participants' epistemic discourse led to correction of science misconceptions. However, lack of debugging and conflict argumentation skills detracted from their epistemic discourse quality. Participants perceived coding as a beneficial skill for K-12 students though they voiced concerns about teaching with coding unassisted. Participants failed to design truly interdisciplinary and authentic scientific modeling activities including simulation coding. Study limitations and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Agricultural and Life Science (AgLS) research tends to focus on the need for a globally competent workforce prepared to work with diverse populations. However, as AgLS education mirrors society, minoritized populations in AgLS are marginalized and othered. Further, AgLS curricula continues to frame agriculture through a white male lens; consequently, current and prospective students note the lack of educational curricula focused on the experiences of marginalized populations. The purpose of this single-case study was to explore students' learning experiences in a new interdisciplinary social justice-based graduate course focused on historical and contemporary diversity, equity, access, and inclusion (DEAI) issues in AgLS. Findings are organized into four areas: (1) what students enjoyed most in the course, (2) race and representation, (3) students' perceptions of learning experiences and outcomes, and (4) suggestions for improvement. Students reported most positively on the readings, class discussions, and assignments (i.e., op-ed and social justice initiative). Regarding race and representation, students reported taking the course because they were seeking perspectives outside of the whitestream perspectives they had previously been exposed to, and because Black students were seeking agricultural diversity courses taught by Black faculty. Students reported positively regarding their experiences and learning outcomes. Last, students gave suggestions regarding the final research paper, course topics, and the number of weekly readings required. This study illuminated the need for AgLS educators to better address and embed DEAI in agricultural contexts, decenter whiteness in AgLS curricula, and work harder to diversify their faculty ranks.

AB  - Developing immersive learning systems is challenging due to their multidisciplinary nature, involving game design, pedagogical modelling, computer science, and the application domain. The diversity of technologies, practices, and interventions makes it hard to explore solutions systematically. A new methodology called Multimodal Immersive Learning Systems Design Methodology (MILSDeM) is introduced to address these challenges. It includes a unified taxonomy, key performance indicators, and an iterative development process to foster innovation and creativity while enabling reusability and organisational learning. This article further reports on applying design-based research to design and develop MILSDeM. It also discusses the application of MILSDeM through its implementation in a real-life project conducted by the research team, which included four initiatives and eight prototypes. Moreover, the article introduces a unified taxonomy and reports on the qualitative analysis conducted to assess its components by experts from different domains.

AB  - With the rapidly growing field of nanotechnology, there has been a pressing need to teach non-science undergraduate majors how to critically interpret science in popular media and news sources. The present work introduces students to chemistry concepts through the lens of relatable nanotechnology applications, including electronics, medicine, sports, and the environment. The course was organized in six modules: (1) Basic chemistry principles were established using group problem-solving sessions. (2) Nanotechnology applications were used to increase engagement levels with course content. (3) Characterization methods were presented as processes we use to "see" nanomaterials. (4) Lab exercises represented the hands-on learning aspect of the course. (5) The applied project presented an opportunity for students to go deeper with the chemistry content correlating to the real-world context. (6) The discussion with science fiction and ethics challenged students to question and/or support the validity of the technology under question. Overall, the course was designed to promote critical thinking and integrative learning skills while introducing students to the chemical principles behind nanotechnology.

AB  - The professionalization of teachers is a fundamental and decisive issue for all education systems. This text presents a qualitative research on an original experiment in training future primary school teachers in the nature of science (NOS) and its transposition into teaching practice. It is a script for reading the children's book, "7 souris dans le noir" (Young, 1995), (This is the French translation of the original title "Seven Blind Mice" (Young, 1995). Even though I presented the English version to the students, the training focused on the French version. It is the French title that will be cited in the text) (Reader probably needs to have this storybook (visible on the web in both French and English versions) to better situate himself in the different events of the story, and consequently better share with me the richness of this experience of its exploitation for training in NOS) described as realistic fiction. Thus, the story is transformed from an object of entertainment into a serious problematic situation that presents an enigmatic reality with an important educational advantage. The students, playing the role of blind mice, must plan and carry out an authentic scientific approach similar to that of scientists when faced with matter or living things, in order to solve the conundrum. Different epistemological concepts are brought into play, such as hypothesis, experimental protocol and result, and analyzing and interpreting data, in order to construct explanations and design an acceptable representation (as a model) of the stranger thing. Cross-curricular learning is also targeted, such as collaboration, debates and refutations, consensus, and the nature of the resulting knowledge. While experimenting with this approach, students are invited to navigate explicitly between the position of researcher and that of teacher to glimpse the potential for transposing this type of approach with children's books in pupils' scientific education and developing an attitude of a reflective practitioner.

AB  - Reconceptualized Family Resemblance Approach to Nature of Science (RFN) explains science as a cognitive, epistemic, and social institutional system. The aim of this study is to examine the inclusion of Nature of Science (NOS) in the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th grade Turkish middle school science textbooks. The "content," "activity," and "assessment" sections of each science textbook were traced based on RFN categories which are "aims and values (AV)," "scientific practices (SP)," "methods and methodological rules (M)," "scientific knowledge (SK)," and "social institutional systems (SI)" through content analysis. As a result, the total frequency value of the codes regarding RFN categories was found to be 196 in the 5th grade, 548 in the 6th grade, 284 in the 7th grade, and 427 in the 8th grade science textbooks. Most references to NOS were found in the "activity" sections of the textbooks. Although there are some references to NOS in each textbook, some of the RFN categories in the whole textbooks are missing. Furthermore, a consistent progression for the frequency of NOS related keywords was not found throughout the grade levels. In conclusion, there is a need to integrate NOS into science textbooks holistically and in a balanced way to provide a vertical articulation throughout the grade levels.

AB  - Advances in graphing technologies and learning sciences pedagogy have the potential to equitably support students when exploring complex systems depicting dynamic relationships across multiple disciplinary topics in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). We report on the cumulative impact of science units designed in a Research Practice Partnership (RPP) that leveraged Knowledge Integration (KI) pedagogy to support middle school students to generalize insights to new graph representations and science topics. Teachers across 11 schools incorporated the graph-science units into their curriculum plans. We analyzed [approximately] 8000 responses to validated and reliable graph-science KI assessment items administered before the first year and after one, two, or three years of instruction aligned with KI pedagogy. With random coefficient, multi-level, mixed-effect regression modeling, we analyzed performance after one-, two-, and three-years of graph-science KI instruction. We also analyzed the growth trajectories of subgroups, i.e., multilingual learners. Data suggest two years of graph-science KI instruction is needed to make significant impacts on student learning and ameliorated the disparity between students with different native language fluencies. These results illustrate the value of technology-enhanced, pedagogically aligned K-12 science instruction that is designed to support connecting diverse graph data and science knowledge comprehensively and cumulatively.

AB  - Learning is a complex phenomenon where a learner constitutes a system operating at neural, physiological, cognitive and social levels, with interactions between and across processes and levels, effecting neural to cognitive to social levels and vice versa. In tracing historical paradigms, theories of learning have been traditionally fragmented in nature, typically focusing on sub-process or sub-levels of the system. For example, theories of cognitivism focuses on internal processes and connections that take place during learning, negating observed behaviours or outward behaviours of learning, while theories of social constructivism place strong emphasis on human development and knowledge construction that is socially situated, with less attention paid to individual differences and variations. In recognizing inherently complex interrelated learning systems, a more integrated and comprehensive understanding of learning is necessary. Such an understanding entails research endeavours that can harness multiple, complex parameters of the learner system through mapping and understanding interactions between and across learning processes and levels. Such endeavours entail the use of multiple sources of scientific evidence, across multi-modal data capture modes and multi-levels of analyses, informed by multi-disciplinary theoretical framings. In this paper, we argue that an overarching scientific ethos towards learning optimizations need artful implementations of pedagogies and interventions that close the circle--from scientific findings translated into practical applications in education and back to addressing problems in education as impetus for evidence-informed theorizations of learning.

AB  - HCI and Industrial Design are both disciplines that are currently experiencing radical transformation in terms of their identity and scope. HCI has moved beyond its origins in human factors and cognitive psychology towards the proactive and generative design of experience. Industrial Design has similarly evolved from a concern with physical form and function-giving solutions to the holistic design considerations of the user's experience. Given the complexity and scale of this shifting design landscape, the response of design education must shift in methods and learning and teaching objectives. This paper provides the Design and Technology Education community with a research case study of innovation within HCI education, here situated within the broader context of Industrial Design education. We present a novel pedagogy for designing digital touch communications, developed through an interdisciplinary collaboration of HCI, Industrial Design, and Social Science academics, and advanced through a coursework assignment for 64 undergraduate Industrial Design and Technology students undertaking a User-Experience Design module at the School of Design and Creative Arts, Loughborough University (UK). We discuss the role of low-fidelity experience prototyping of digital touch interactions beyond screens, and the limitations of such an approach when engaged with by novice designers with entrenched material science understanding. We conclude the paper with a call for new educational 'tools' to support and scaffold both the learning and teaching of design for digital touch experiences within a User-Experience Design context, and we offer our development of a Designing Digital Touch Toolkit as one such tool.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore how undergraduate college students formed partnerships in informal educational teams to design and build an interdisciplinary, ill-defined, integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) project and translate it to lessons taught to a pre-collegiate student (e.g., K-12 in the US) audience. The authors pursued two research questions: (a) How does an authentic research project provide space for integrating STEM disciplines? (b) How does an authentic research project impact partnerships among team members? Nine undergraduate college students were accepted into the 2020 cohort, forming three teams of three undergraduates each. Teams were roughly composed of one engineering major, one science major, and one education major. Methods of data collection included interviews and field notes. Data were analyzed by assessing the level of partnership achieved based on an already established model. Results indicate that all teams progressed through pre-partnership to at least the partnership (little p) level. Two partnership dimensions achieved the highest (big P) level: one of perception of benefit and one of products and activities. The results have implications that integration of STEM disciplines and forming partnerships could be related, and that building teamwork skills results in products of higher quality. The results are linked to previous research and recommendations for more effective partnerships are provided.

AB  - The implications of how teacher development courses (TDCs) should be designed for integrated STEM education are essential for in-class STEM education practices. This study compares the three TDCs accomplished to support teachers' professional development (PD) for integrated STEM education in terms of pedagogical knowledge, technological knowledge, and strategy. A holistic multiple-case study design was used in this study. Each TDC was considered a case study, and case-specific analyses were made. The findings obtained for each case were then compared. The first TDC included only computer science teachers and showed us the necessity of interdisciplinary work to enhance integrated STEM education. The second TDC demonstrated that this work could be accomplished by combining the content knowledge of teachers from various disciplines; however, the second TDC's drawbacks included identifying real-world problems, a lack of response to the engineering approach for science and mathematics teachers, and the rigidity of the collaborative working strategy. Then, we focused on the role and purpose of "T"echnology. Finally, we gave the teachers learning tasks to work collaboratively with teachers in their disciplines first and teachers from other disciplines later. This study shows how a TDC should be designed effectively to support teachers' PD for integrated STEM education.

AB  - We developed a course, as part of our institution's core program, which provides students with a foundation in academic literacy in the social sciences: how to find, read, critically assess, and communicate about social science research. It is not a research methods course; rather, it is intended to introduce students to the social sciences and be better consumers of social science research. In this article, we describe the key learning objectives of this course, the basic content areas, and some of the innovative teaching and learning strategies used in the course. We also provide empirical evidence of the effectiveness of the course in meeting its learning objectives and of student responses to the course. Finally, we discuss some of the challenges in developing interdisciplinary core courses and offer suggestions for best practices for teaching social science literacy as part of the core curriculum.

AB  - Fostering interdisciplinary learning in biology will require significant changes in the way one teaches science to K-12 students. The perspective on interdisciplinary biology teaching and learning in this essay is based on the author's experiences as a former research cell biologist, high school science teacher, and developer of secondary science curricula and teacher professional development programs used in a variety of school districts nationwide. On the basis of these experiences, the author is enthusiastic about the importance of preparing students for the interdisciplinary nature of modern biology, yet concerned about the challenges faced by teachers and school districts as they move toward a modern curriculum. Transforming interdisciplinary biology teaching at the secondary level must include changes in curriculum, instruction, assessments, and teacher professional development in order to support teaching for conceptual understanding and for making cross-disciplinary connections. To prepare students for the nature of modern biology, biology educators must provide them with frequent opportunities to engage in studying interdisciplinary scientific questions or problems. Students will need sufficient time and support to explore, analyze, and reflect on the contributions of various disciplines to advances in modern biology.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to introduce a methodology for analyzing the complex configurations emerging in students' speech and drawing activities, having consequences for how and what students learn and make meaning of in science. Accordingly, we launch a methodology to unfold the multidimensional communication as to deepen the analysis of the science epistemic discourse. We present an empirical account of students' explorations through different signs to demonstrate the construction of the methodology step-by-step. This methodology, a "seven-concept-assemblage," is rooted in Dewey's pragmatism and Deleuze's experimentalism broadening teachers' and researchers' possibility to target students' science explorations and meaning-making crosscutting different domains. The methodology diminishes the risk of interpretation when grasping unspoken messages and meanings. Empirical data were collected in an elementary school exemplifying the methodology and consist of audio recordings, photographs, fieldnotes, and students' drawings. The result reveals that the methodology in use exposed "what" and "how" students explored and learned cognitively and aesthetically. Imagination fertilized the process throughout. Learning then is suggested as a transductive meaning-making process shaped through oral and pictorial relations--always from a purpose.

AB  - Contribution: This article presents an engineering outreach activity that aims to teach K-12 students how to develop a tendon-based soft robotic finger. The primary objectives of this STEM activity are to introduce students to the fundamentals of soft robotics, its interdisciplinary nature, and to offer them a hands-on and engaging learning experience using the project-based- learning approach. Background: Soft robotics, an interdisciplinary field combining chemistry, materials science, and robotics, has the potential to revolutionize the design and development of robots. However, introducing the fundamental concepts of soft robotics to K-12 students can be challenging since traditional robotic activities often require complex programming, technical expertise and expensive equipment and software. Intended Outcomes: Increasing the students' understanding of soft robotics principles, materials, and polymer processing. Positively impacting students' perception of engineering as a potential career path by enhancing their attitudes toward STEM. Application Design: Students could develop manually actuated soft robotic fingers within a 45-min workshop by utilizing 3-D printed molds, rapidly curing elastomeric materials, and the basic mold casting method. The outreach activity is intentionally designed to simplify the technology used by eliminating the need for complex programming, and to focus on utilizing novel materials and basic concepts to construct actuating soft robots, providing an effective and engaging STEM activity for K-12 students. Findings: The success/effectiveness of the activity was evaluated in three ways: 1) through direct inspection on the performance of the student-fabricated soft finger during the workshop; 2) through the pre- and post-tests to evaluate the learning outcomes; and 3) by conducting a STEM outreach survey to gather student feedback on the quality of the outreach activity and their attitudes toward STEM. During the workshop activities, the students were able to effectively follow the instructions, construct a tendon-based soft robotic finger, and manually actuate the finger using the tendon. According to the results of pre- and post-tests, the students increased their understanding regarding the principles of soft robotics, materials and polymer processing. Furthermore, the STEM outreach survey of IEEE powered "TryEngineering Portal" revealed that the developed outreach activity enhanced the achievement of pedagogical and quality outcome goals and measures, as well as program targets and objectives.

AB  - As change agents at our university, we sought to facilitate a transition within our STEM college toward more extensive use of evidence-based instructional practices (EBIPs) that promote student-centered learning. We sought a multifaceted approach for this challenge, with the goal of achieving lasting change among the faculty, resulting in the creation of the STEM Faculty Institute (STEMFI). Supported by multiyear funding from the National Science Foundation, STEMFI provides instruction on EBIPs through a summer workshop, along with yearlong support in redesigning curriculum through one-to-one mentoring of each faculty participant. The first cohort of STEMFI participants has been successful, with most faculty showing significant shifts toward more student-centered practices in their teaching. Feedback on the post-workshop survey indicated participants considered the material helpful and engaging, encouraging a shift in their attitudes toward supporting EBIPs in their own classrooms. This article describes factors critical to the STEMFI approach and reports on the initial effectiveness observed.

AB  - Reform to the Chilean educational system seeks to improve public education, adapting the school curriculum to new technologies and the information revolution. Our study focused on highlighting potential issues with environmental and technological education, offering opportunities to complement the current Chilean curriculum with an interdisciplinary approach. During a five-week period interspersed through the school semester, 115 underprivileged children in seventh grade from five public schools of southern Chile participated in workshops based on Arduino technology to address current environmental problems caused by global change and anthropization. Surveys were conducted to participating students and included both open and closed-ended questions, which measured attitudes and perceptions towards science and the use of technology in classrooms and daily lives. Surveys were analysed quantitatively with basic statistics and qualitatively by building semantic networks of the relationships between different concepts expressed by the students. Results did not show significant changes in attitudes towards science or technology before and after the workshops but students reported mixed feelings about science. Indifference and fear emerged, coupled with the need for more interactive experiences. Curiosity and enthusiasm also surfaced when students were using new technologies. Since the school curriculum is generally focused exclusively towards the completion of specific curricular aims, highly vulnerable schools in Chile have few opportunities to access interactive, hands-on activities. Low-cost, emergent technologies, such Arduinos, have a high potential for improving student's attitude towards science and technology and their use should be considered when tailoring school curriculum in Chile and elsewhere.

AB  - Background: Although sound is an everyday phenomenon that we hear about constantly, numerous studies have reported that students often exhibit learning difficulties in understanding this subject. Only a few studies have proposed programs involving practical learning experiments to provide students with solid conceptual knowledge. Moreover, little research to date has dealt with the topic of sound from the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) perspective. Purpose: The need for this research is rooted in the general lack of learning materials developed according to integrative STEM and in the shortage of interdisciplinary contents that specifically address the subject of sound. The Sound, Waves and Communication Systems (SWCS) program was developed in Sakhnin in Israel to integrate the learning of science and technology through the extensive use of Information and Computer Technologies (ICT). The study aimed at exploring middle school students' achievements and motivation in learning the program and discovering the factors that might affect these elements. Sample: The participants in the study are 120 middle school students (7th-graders), divided into six separate groups: two groups (40 students) participated in the pilot study, whereas four groups (80 students) took part in the main study. Methods: The study adopted a mixed method research design, and combined quantitative and qualitative methods that included observations in class, administering a students' motivation questionnaire before and after studying the course, giving achievement exams, and analyzing the students' projects. Results: The findings showed that despite difficulties in learning the subject, the students eventually managed to gain a conceptual understanding and their self-efficacy significantly increased. Conclusions: The flexible integration of the teachers' instruction, the hands-on lab work, the use of ICT, and project-based learning all contributed to the participants' success and motivation in learning the current course.

AB  - The article is devoted to the issues of teaching mobile application development and, as a consequence, training of highly qualified in-demand mobile developers. Nowadays, training professional mobile developers is a crucial task all over the world. The researchers emphasize the complexity of mobile application development associated with its multidisciplinarity, the mobile device hardware limitations, the necessity of object-oriented programming in the mobile development. Due to the complexity of the mobile development field and the gap in programming knowledge of first-year students, there are fears that prepare highly qualified mobile developers during undergraduate education is impossible. In this regard, the article proposes a spiral model teaching mobile application development with the aim of effective training of mobile developers. The spiral model covers all levels of teaching programming from high school to higher education with aim to develop knowledge from introductory programming to mobile application development. The offered spiral model suggests the continuity in the content and overcoming the gap in programming knowledge between high school and higher education. Such a model is the most appropriate for the training of highly qualified mobile developers in the context of Kazakhstan's education system.

AB  - As the popularity of ethnographic research methods grows across and beyond the social sciences, it is of paramount importance that practitioners reflect on how to best teach participant observation to increasingly diverse and interdisciplinary audiences. While available literature stresses the importance of learning-by-doing to develop students' ethnographic sensibility, I argue that these techniques neglect the development of students' ethnographic imagination, which is necessary to prepare first-time fieldworkers to face the unpredictability of research. To remedy this training shortcoming, I then propose that we turn to reading ethnographies in the classroom as a collective, critical and participative practice that can help students picture 'what really happens' during fieldwork, inspire their research design, and prepare them for the unpredictability of participant observation.

AB  - As the importance of interdisciplinary studies is on the rise, countries have developed innovative educational approaches. One of these innovative approaches is STEM. STEM focuses on interdisciplinary cooperation, systematic thinking, openness to communication, ethical values, research, production, creativity and problems, focusing on the intersection of knowledge and skills in science, technology, mathematics and engineering, it is a new learning teaching approach that aims to gain the ability to solve. In this context, the aim of this study is to evaluate the attitudes of the pre-service teachers towards STEM and STEM's sub dimensions. Therefore; it was used as a data collection tool from attitude scale for Stem and Stem's sub dimensions developed by Keles, Kiremit and Aktamis (2017). In the data collection tool, 5 scales were developed in order to reveal the existence of the relationship between pre-service teachers' attitudes towards STEM and their attitudes towards; science, technology, mathematics and engineering. The related scale was applied to 204 pre-service teachers in various departments of the Faculty of Education at Sakarya University. In the research, the necessary correlations were made by considering the demographic characteristics such as gender, age and class of teacher candidates. The overall average and standard deviation values are taken into account, when explaining the data differences for the sub-dimensions of the scale. According to the results obtained from the relevant data collection tool, when pre-service teachers' attitudes towards STEM and STEM sub-dimensions were evaluated; especially in the Mathematics and Engineering dimensions, it was revealed that their attitudes were more positive and they were indecisive in other dimensions (Science and Technology). As a result, it is thought that the acceptance of STEM method by teacher candidate, which is an innovative educational approach of the research results, will contribute to the literature and the future studies in this field.

AB  - As we have come to accept the duality of physical and virtual learning spaces as a permanent feature of our educational landscape, we begin to question its validity. Is this really a dichotomy, or is it a continuum? Should this be the primary dimension around which we cluster educational experiences -- how does it intersect and interact with other axes, such as formal-informal, vocational-recreational, open-closed, teacher-student? How do we adapt, as teachers, learners, designers, policy makers, to this changing landscape? How do we shape it to offer an optimal learning experience? Such questions led us to conduct a series of academic and professional events on the theme of Hybrid Learning Spaces (HLS) -- spaces which challenge and defy the dichotomies above. This edited book collates some of the products of that endeavor, offering a multi-vocal, interdisciplinary approach to hybridity in education. It connects practical examples, design directives and theoretical analysis, combining perspectives from technology research and development, educational theory and practice, architecture and space and product design. This book addresses researchers, practitioners, innovators and policy makers in education, technology and design, offering broad perspectives and then distilling practical insights in the form of design principles and patterns, pedagogical models, and predictions of future trends.

AB  - Educational techniques that improve student engagement have repeatedly been shown to improve performance at the class level at many institutions and in multiple disciplines. However, knowledge of engagement in individual activities in large first-year classes, where there may be several subpopulations of students in different programs reflecting varied interests, is limited. In this study, we examined two large, lecture-based, introductory first-year biology classes to determine whether there were any relationships between specific learning activities and student engagement and performance, both at the class level and as broken down by program of study. Surveys were used to quantify the level of student engagement through four activities: (a) student response systems (clickers), (b) in-class discussions and activities, (c) lab and seminar activities, and (d) interdisciplinary learning. Engagement scores were then compared to students' final grades. Students in all majors who reported higher levels of participation in most activities studied also reported feeling more engaged overall and achieved higher grades than their less-engaged peers; however, students in non-biology majors demonstrated notably weaker relationships between their engagement and performance in biology courses, where such relationships existed at all. In this paper, we discuss the learning activities which are associated with the greatest performance increases in both biology and non-biology majors and suggest how these results may be used to inform instructional techniques to benefit all students, regardless of major, in future course offerings.

AB  - This study attempted to scrutinize the disciplinary and cross-disciplinary generic variations of textbook introductions in humanities and basic sciences with reference to the onion model. The data included a sample of 60 introductions (i.e. ten each from applied linguistics, sociology, and psychology within humanities, and ten each from biology, agriculture, and geology within basic sciences). Humphrey and Economou's (2015) onion model of discourse analysis was adopted, and MAXQDA 10 software of qualitative analysis was used for coding. The findings revealed similarities and differences not only within but also between the two disciplines, which can be attributed to the nature of disciplines as well as the generically accepted conventions in each discipline. Moreover, the results of the study highlighted the predominance of descriptive and analytical phases in textbook introductions not only in isolation but also in establishing more complicated genres like persuasion and critique. The study highlights the importance of teaching which is concerned with learners' rhetorical consciousness-raising of the disciplines as well as the discipline-specific lexico-grammatical features in expert texts.

AB  - This study focused on the analysis of Grade-12 (Senior) students' sociocultural constructivist interactions using Web 2.0 applications during a geographical research process. In the study methodology context, a transdisciplinary case study (TdCS) with ethnographic and research action data was designed, implemented and analyzed in real teaching conditions for this study. The goal of the research process was students to integrate into authentic activities that that relate to their experiences and create a learning community, developing cognitive geographic knowledge. The study reveals a need to: a) design and implement transdisciplinary actions to create more learning incentives, exchange ideas and collaborate, for the geographical science issues study, b) shape new ways of interacting and operating social structures in the context of geographical research process, c) promote the skills that students need in real life, as participatory interaction, interpersonal communication, spatial thinking and high cognitive functions (cooperation, crisis, feedback and empathy, among others), and d) use Web applications in learning practice, shaping new methods of processing, sharing and exploiting information and produced products from the students' study.

AB  - We developed a summer research experience program within a freestanding comprehensive cancer center to cultivate undergraduate students with an interest in and an aptitude for quantitative sciences focused on oncology. This unconventional location for an undergraduate program is an ideal setting for interdisciplinary training in the intersection of oncology, statistics, and epidemiology. This article describes the development and implementation of a hands-on research experience program in this unique environment. Core components of the program include faculty-mentored projects, instructional programs to improve research skills and domain knowledge, and professional development activities. We discuss key considerations such as fostering effective partnership between research and administrative units, recruiting students, and identifying faculty mentors with quantitative projects. We describe evaluation approaches and discuss post-program outcomes and lessons learned. In its initial two years, the program successfully improved the students' perception of competence gained in research skills and statistical knowledge across several knowledge domains. The majority of students also went on to pursue graduate degrees in a quantitative field or work in oncology-centric academic research roles. Our research-based training model can be adapted by a variety of organizations motivated to develop a summer research experience program in quantitative sciences for undergraduate students.

AB  - GlobalEd 2 (GE2) is a set of technology-mediated, problem-based learning (PBL) simulations for middle-grade students, that capitalises on the multidisciplinary nature of the social sciences as an expanded curricular space for students to learn and apply scientific literacies and concepts, while simultaneously also enriching their understanding of the social sciences. This paper reports the results of an implementation of the GE2 curriculum focused on water resources with 535 seventh and eighth grade students from both suburban and urban school systems. The results indicate positive changes in students' writing self-efficacy, interest in pursuing future science educational opportunities and the quality of their written scientific argumentation after participation in a GE2 simulation. Curricular implications and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Aim and background: The aim of this study was to investigate students' attitudes, rationales, and approaches to making open educational resource (OER) videos (a form of OERs) on sustainable development (SD) in order to identify students' competencies and effective pedagogical designs. Method: Students registering for a teacher training course were invited to design and create pedagogies, make OER videos, and share the videos on YouTube on five SD topics: sustainable lifestyle, campus, community, enterprise, and earth development. The students provided their weekly journals and a final reflection on the whole process of making the OER videos on SD. This study used qualitative data analysis and text mining methodologies to analyse students' process data of making OER videos on SD. Results and discussion: The analysis results revealed that making OER videos on SD needed students' ideational, inquiry, societal, and disciplinary competencies. Inferred pedagogical suggestions for practitioners to support students in making digital products on SD are to follow a linear pathway from ideational creation, inquiry process, societal transformation, to transdisciplinary reflection.

AB  - Health Informatics is an emerging interdisciplinary subject of Health Sciences and Information Systems, which aimed to cater for both the educational and professional needs within the Health and Informatics fields. Even though there has been increasing interest in health informatics discipline, challenges continue to exist, particularly in developing countries such as Namibia. One of the main challenges in the discipline is shortage of skilled personnel, which is primarily caused by institutions of higher learning not producing enough graduates in the discipline. This results from the fact that many of the institutions do not offer or have curriculum for the course. Thus, this research examines how health informatics curriculum is developed at institutions of higher learning, to offer insight on the influencing factors. The qualitative methods and interpretive approach were employed in the research. This is an applied research that was carried out at the Namibia University of Science and Technology. The data was analysed by following the interpretive approach. Based on the analysis, a process-oriented approach is proposed. The approach identifies key stakeholders, and how different parties can contribute to a successful health informatics curriculum at institutions of higher learning. The framework may be of interest to health practitioners and academia in the area of health informatics.

AB  - Preschool STREAM education is a philosophy and guiding principle. It is a way of thinking towards multidisciplinary approach, in which Science, Technology, Reading, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics are integrated in the early childhood programme to provide the young children with a well-rounded education and equipped them with the 21st century skills. In this aspect, preschool teachers' perceptions towards the implementation of STREAM education are crucial for the sustainability of STREAM education now and then. In this study, the objectives are to investigate preschool teachers' perceptions towards STREAM implementation, the challenges of implementing STREAM education, as well as to examine the differences between pre-service and in-service teachers' perspectives towards the implementation of STREAM education. For this study, a quantitative research design was adopted. The data was collected through a questionnaire survey and analysed using SPSS software, which was used to obtain descriptive statistics and perform t-tests. The participants involved 80 preschool teachers (40 pre-service; 40 in-service) in Petaling Jaya, Selangor. A questionnaire of 35-item was used. The result revealed that most participants have positive perceptions towards preschool STREAM education approach. However, the report indicated that there are differences between in-service and pre-service teachers in regards of the challenges in implementing preschool STREAM education. Moreover, the lack of teachers' expertise and professional training to integrate and implement STREAM learning activities are the main issues and concern of the in-service teachers. These findings suggested that teachers need training with relevant resources and effective materials for easy integration of content teaching and learning to sustain STREAM education as a frame of mind for effective implementation and desired learning outcomes.

AB  - In contrast to a macroscopic solid, the color and spectroscopic properties of gold nanoparticles change with size. Here, we propose a teaching platform for high school students (hereafter defined as students, attending secondary school in Europe, preparatory high schools in the US, or any educational institution of a comparable level) that explains the relationship between the perceived color of colloidal solutions and their physicochemical properties. For this aim, an open-source code, based on Mie theory and colorimetry, was developed to link the perceived colors to the plasmonic effects. Moreover, a set of such nanoparticles, varied in diameter, was created to support the theoretical description. The employed seed-mediated synthesis approach provides sufficient spherical roundness that is crucial for color matching. The proposed teaching platform is available online and can be linked to an outreach activity or practical laboratory course. Furthermore, we illustrate the linkage of nanoscience concepts to real-world examples (e.g., stained church glass), which can be used for promoting the potential of nanotechnology in other fields, including electronics, optics, and biomedicine adding to the interdisciplinarity of the teaching platform.

AB  - Preparing 21st century learners is the goal of both the "Common Core State Standards" ("CCSS") and the "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS"). These two sets of standards jointly illuminate the need to teach scientific and literacy skills that will more appropriately prepare elementary students to successfully participate in science education. One way to meet this challenge is through interdisciplinary instruction. Interdisciplinary instruction prepares students to meet the "CCSS" and "NGSS" by creating a specific purpose for developing and using literacy skills This column provides ideas and techniques to enhance science teaching. This month's issue shows how teachers can use literature and higher-level thinking questions to enhance science instruction.

AB  - This study investigated the sustainability of an integrated STEM education program. Two US high school science teachers and an engineering technology teacher sustained implementation of an integrated STEM curriculum after the conclusion of the funded program, TRAILS. Class observations were conducted to examine how the teachers implemented the integrated STEM curriculum and how they maintained integrated STEM teaching in a science and engineering technology education (ETE) teacher pair using science and engineering technology shared practices. After the integrated STEM lesson, their students' academic achievements were compared to those of the students who previously participated in the project. The results reveal that the students showed no difference from the previous TRAILS students in terms of academic achievements as measured by STEM knowledge test scores, which may indicate that the teachers successfully maintained consistency and effectiveness of the implementation. Additionally, a twenty-first century skills survey was newly conducted to examine students' growth in confidence in twenty-first century skills after they were taught the integrated STEM lesson. The students showed increased confidence in critical thinking, which indicates that the students benefitted from the teachers' instructions even after the conclusion of the funded program and the absence of support. Based on the findings from the teachers' experiences of multiple years of integrated STEM teaching, the study discusses how to better support teachers for the successful implementation of an integrated STEM curriculum as a sustainable education program in secondary schools.

AB  - Citizen science, research in which members of the public actively contribute scientific data, has recently evolved as a means to support scientific inquiry in the classroom, particularly in fields related to ecology and environmental science. Our research focuses on a collaborative project with teacher candidates, a science education professor, and a social studies education professor at a Canadian university. Teacher candidates were engaged in the classroom and beyond as they explored topics related to civics education and evidence-based decision making. Our findings demonstrate the potential effectiveness of a citizen science lens for science, social studies, and generalist teachers.

AB  - Inspiring children to pursue a career in science is a worthy pursuit for many reasons. One way to achieve this is to actively engage children in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning from an early age. However, it is not always possible to integrate all the STEM fields in one activity. Rather, careful consideration of the discrete disciplines of science, technology, engineering and mathematics and their appropriateness for the given activity may be preferable to full, transdisciplinary integration. This report describes a research project designed to support primary school children in their appreciation of scientific research through use of the 5E Instructional Model -- Engagement, Exploration, Explanation, Elaboration, and Evaluation --while applying the complementary elements of a mathematics-based statistical investigation to pose questions, collect data, represent, analyse, and interpret the data, as well as reach informed conclusions

AB  - Diagnostic molecular biology is a fast developing discipline of laboratory medicine widely used in numerous medical branches such as oncology, hematology, immunology, internal medicine, or infectious diseases, which will certainly have a major impact on clinical medicine in the near future. Nowadays, educational process is forced to face the quickly growing overflow of easily accessible data and properly guide the students not to be lead astray in the information chaos. Hence, in view of the foregoing, it appears obvious that modern medical education should put particular stress on selective acquiring, interpreting, and applying integrated multidisciplinary knowledge rather than on just absorbing and memorizing huge amount of scattered information. The presented case study aims at familiarizing the students with basic molecular biology techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Importantly, it is not limited only to discussing and learning the principles of the assays mentioned earlier, but it also shows their practical application in a particular diagnostic process and give the guidelines on how to explain and interpret exemplary results. In parallel, the way the case study is constructed allows a tutor to lead students into discussion on clinical aspects related to HIV infection what should eventually create complete picture of a HIV diagnostic process, thereby integrating basic knowledge of molecular biology laboratory techniques, HIV biology, and immunological response.

AB  - Generations of students are graduating from secondary school disinterested in post-secondary study of science or pursuing careers in science-related fields beyond formal education. We propose that destabilising such disinterest among future students requires science educators to begin listening to secondary school students regarding their views of how science learning is made interesting within the science classroom. Studies on students' interest in response to instructional strategies applied in the classroom communicate the opinions (i.e. the "voice") of students about the strategies they believe make their classroom learning interesting. To this end, this scoping study (1) collects empirical studies that present from various science and non-science academic domains students' views about how to make classroom learning interesting; (2) identifies common instructional strategies across these domains that make learning interesting; and (3) forwards an instructional framework called TEDI ([T]ransdisciplinary Connections; Mediated [E]ngagement; Meaningful [D]iscovery; and Self-determined [I]nquiry), which may provide secondary school science teachers with a practical instructional approach for making learning science genuinely interesting among their students within the secondary school science classroom context.

AB  - This bibliometric analysis investigates the impact of Project-Based Assessments (PBAs) on conceptual understanding in STEM education from 2019 to 2024. By examining a dataset of 996 publications, the study highlights significant fluctuations in research outputs and the evolving focus on educational methodologies, particularly noting an intensification of activity during the COVID-19 pandemic 2021. The publication trends show an increase from 184 documents in 2019 to a peak of 263 documents in 2021, followed by a gradual decline to 30 documents in 2024, suggesting shifts in research priorities or the field's maturation. Through detailed citation patterns and publication metrics analysis, the research elucidates the effectiveness of PBAs in enhancing student engagement and interdisciplinary integration while improving pedagogical practices. Key findings indicate that PBAs significantly improve students' understanding of complex STEM concepts through hands-on, real-world problem-solving and enhance educators' capabilities in delivering innovative instruction. Additionally, the study explores the role of technological advancements, such as 3D printing, in PBL, assessing their impact on the teaching and learning processes. By synthesizing information across various studies, this research provides a comprehensive overview of the educational outcomes associated with PBL. It offers insights into its long-term efficacy and adaptability in diverse educational settings. This analysis presents valuable perspectives for educators, policymakers, and researchers, aiming to optimize STEM education practices globally.

AB  - Multidisciplinary practice has become an accepted approach in many education and social and health care fields. In fact, the right to a multidisciplinary assessment is enshrined in the United Nations Convention of the Rights for Persons with Disabilities (United Nations, 2007). In order to avert a "one size fits all" response to particularly heterogeneous diagnoses, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD), the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends multidisciplinary input. Yet, multidisciplinarity lacks empirical evidence of effectiveness, is fraught with conceptual difficulties and methodological incompatibilities, and therefore there is a danger of resorting to an ill-defined eclectic "hodgepodge" of interventions. Virtually all evidence-based interventions in autism and intellectual disabilities are behaviourally based. Not surprisingly, therefore, professionals trained in behaviour analysis to international standards are increasingly becoming key personnel in multidisciplinary teams. In fact, professionals from a range of disciplines seek training in behaviour analysis. In this article we brought together a multidisciplinary group of professionals from education, health, and social care, most of whom have a dual qualification in an allied health, social care, or educational profession, as well as in behaviour analysis. Together we look at the initial training in these professions and explore how behaviour analysis can offer a common and coherent conceptual framework for true multidisciplinarity, based on sound scientific knowledge about behaviour, without resort to reifying theories. We illustrate how this unifying approach can enhance evidence-based multidisciplinary practice so that "one size" will fit all.

AB  - School science continues to alienate students identifying with nondominant, non-western cultures, and learners of color, and considers science as an enterprise where success necessitates divorcing the self and corporeal body from ideas and the mind. Resisting the colonizing pedagogy of the mind-body divide, we aimed at creating pedagogical spaces and places in science classes that sustain equitable opportunities for engagement and meaning making where body and mind are enmeshed. In the context of a partnership between school- and university-based educators and researchers, we explored how multimodal literacies cultivated through the performing arts, provide students from minoritized communities opportunities to both create knowledge and to position themselves as science experts and brilliant and creative meaning makers. Four theoretical perspectives (social semiotics and multimodality; dramatizing and the embodied mind; dismantling master narratives for minoritized peoples; and the relationship of knowledge production and identity construction) framed this multiple case study of classes of elementary and middle school students who made sense of and communicated science concepts and practices through embodied performances. The study provided evidence that embodied science representations afford students abundant opportunities to construct science knowledge and positionings that support engagement with science, whether performed on a small scale in classrooms, or for the whole school through a large-scale science play. Embodied dramatizing led to opportunities for collective meaning making as student-performers coordinated across various movements and modes in order to represent ideas. Multiple enactments of the same concept nurtured the development of multi-dimensional scientific, sociocultural, and sociopolitical meanings. During embodiments, students positioned themselves and others in ways that allowed expanded science identities to become possible, intertwined with other salient identities. By treating children's bodies as sites of knowledge, imagination, and expertise, integrating performing arts and science has the potential to facilitate the development of connections among ideas and between self and ideas.

AB  - There is an increasing interest in design and creative thinking processes in the Sciences, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and health education disciplines. Many new degree programs are integrating design thinking into their syllabi, with the intention of bringing creative problem-solving methods to these disciplines. In reality, the exposure these students get is minimal, and it does not provide enough foundation for them to use the knowledge and apply the process(es) in real-life situations. There is an increased awareness of the importance of design thinking in the innovative process. More and more STEM, business, and health establishments are embedding trained designers into their research teams -- yet many designers are not equipped to work on interdisciplinary teams. Design students tend to approach problems more intuitively, opportunistically, and build on creative leaps of imagination whereas, STEM and health disciplines are often more algorithmic, systematic, and rationale. This can often generate tension in interdisciplinary teams, especially when traditional disciplines (e.g., Engineering, Sciences) are integrating relatively newer thinking (e.g., design thinking). In this paper, we share the outcome of a phenomenological study on a high-functioning interdisciplinary team working on a health innovation project focused on aging with a disability. This case study illustrates the skill set needed for designers, health and technology professionals to make a significant contribution to its overall outcome. We identified key attributes that contribute towards being an effective member of interdisciplinary teams. Based on this study, we propose a pedagogical approach to better equip design, STEM, and Health students to be more competitive in changing economic expectations and ensure more impactful design outcomes.

AB  - Background: The Next Generation Science Standards accentuate engineering design along with scientific inquiry, emphasizing the relationship between scientific investigations and engineering design in solving problems and devising new ideas and technologies. The goal is for students to realize the importance of science and engineering in innovation and in solving many of today's challenges. The Next Generation Science Standards contends that a working knowledge and practicality of engineering design prepares students for embracing the challenges of the future. To support students in developing these capabilities, teachers are tasked with the responsibility of facilitating science instruction that integrates science and engineering practices. This is a challenge since a majority of them have little to no understanding of engineering applications. Results: An interdisciplinary team, consisting of science education and mechanical engineering faculty and doctoral students from each discipline, and science, mathematics, and career and technical curriculum supervisors, collaborated with middle school science, mathematics, and career and technical education teachers to develop a framework for integrating engineering practices into their curricula. The exploratory nature of the project, and instructional outcomes with their students, supported teachers in developing an understanding and value for science and engineering practices. As a result, they were motivated to critique and revise their practices, aiming to develop and implement instruction that they perceived as beneficial to their students. Conclusion: With the surge in emphasis on preparing K-12 students for the STEM workforce, initiatives devoted to exposing teachers and students to STEM applications have also increased. The findings from this study could be useful for informing these initiatives, since they reveal the learning experiences of the teachers while processing instructional strategies for integrating science and engineering practices into their curriculum. The findings highlight factors that motivated these teachers to reform their instructional practices, as well as their deliberations while endeavoring to assimilate the strategies into their curricular activities.

AB  - A laboratory experiment introducing the concept of chemical bioconjugation of proteins to undergraduate students in a therapeutically relevant context was developed. Initially, students installed an aldehyde functionality into a protein via the oxidation of the N-terminal threonine residue of the cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) protein, which was followed by subsequent modification via hydrazone addition under mild conditions with a chromophore bearing a distinct UV-visabsorption peak. Students determined the yield of the reaction to be ca. 11% by HPLC coupled to UV-vis spectroscopy and developed key skills such as preparation of stock solutions, chemical manipulation of proteins, and analysis via HPLC. The reported experiment can be readily adapted for use with other proteins and may contribute to enhancing constructive alignment in interdisciplinary degree programs at the chemistry-biology interface.

AB  - Over the past decade, mechanistic cross-linking probes have been used to study protein-protein interactions in natural product biosynthetic pathways. This approach is highly interdisciplinary, combining elements of protein biochemistry, organic chemistry, and computational docking. Herein, we described the development of an experiment to engage undergraduate students in multidisciplinary research that leverages mechanistic cross-linking probes to study protein conformations and protein-protein interactions. This experiment provides students with a platform to learn chemoenzymatic synthesis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, biochemical assays, and computational docking, all while exploring a contemporary biochemical topic.

AB  - Purpose: Collaboration between universities and industry is increasingly perceived as a vehicle to enhance innovation. Educational institutions are encouraged to build partnerships and multidisciplinary projects based around real-world open problems. Projects need to benefit student learning, not only the organisations looking for innovations. The context of this study is a multidisciplinary innovation project, as experienced by the students of an University of Applied Sciences in Finland. The purpose of this paper is to unfold students' conceptions of the learning experience, to help teachers and curriculum designers to organise optimal conditions and processes, and support competence development. The research question was: How do students in higher professional education experience their learning in a multidisciplinary innovation project? Design/methodology/approach: The study took a phenomenographic approach. The data were collected in the form of weekly diaries, maintained by the cultural management and social services students (n=74) in a mandatory multidisciplinary innovation project in professional higher education in Finland. The diary data were analysed using thematic inductive analysis. Findings: The results of the study revealed that students' understood the learning experience in relation to solvable conflicts and unusual situations they experienced during the project, while becoming aware of and claiming their collaborative agency and internalising phases of an innovation process. The competences as learning outcomes that students could name as developed related to content knowledge, different personal characteristics, social skills, emerging leadership skills, creativity, future orientation, social skills, technical, crafting and testing skills and innovation implementation-related skills, such as marketing, sales and entrepreneurship planning skills. However, future orientation and implementation planning skills showed more weakly than other variables in the data. Practical implications: The findings suggest that curriculum design should enable networked, student-led and teacher supported pedagogical innovation processes that involve a whole path from future thinking and idea development through prototyping to implementation planning of the novel solution. Teachers promote deep comprehension of the innovation process, monitor and ease the pain of conflict if it threatens motivation, offer assessment tools and help in recognising gaps in individual competences and development needs, promote more future-oriented, concrete and implementable outcomes, and facilitate in bridging from innovation towards entrepreneurship planning. Originality/value: The multidisciplinary innovation project described in this study provides a pedagogical way to connect higher education to the practises of society. These results provide encouraging findings for organising multidisciplinary project activities between education and working life. The paper, therefore, has significant value for teachers and entrepreneurship educators in designing curriculum and facilitating projects. The study promotes the dissemination of innovation development programmes in between education and work organisations also in other than technical and commercial fields.

AB  - Co-operative education (co-op) programs enable students to gain real-world experience by alternating work and study terms. Understanding employers' expectations of students in different disciplines is therefore critical for success. To do this, the relationships between co-op job postings, required skills, and academic backgrounds can be modeled using graphs. This study proposes a novel graph methodology for analyzing employer expectations of co-op students by grouping academic backgrounds and either co-op job titles or required skills into graph clusters. A case study is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology. Over 13,000 co-op job postings are used to uncover key differences in employer expectations for students in each program, including the importance of communication for arts students who are expected to fill interdisciplinary roles and the prevalence of data science and highly specific technical skills in many academic programs.

AB  - Physics offers a cross-discipline perspective to understanding other subjects. The purpose of this paper is to provide examples of physics in literature that physics and astronomy teachers can use to give students an indication of the relevance of science as depicted in the humanities. It is not possible to cite the thousands of examples available. I have tried to select authors whom students would be reading in high school and in college undergraduate English classes: in particular Joseph Conrad, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Shakespeare, H. G. Wells, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Norman Mailer, and an author currently in vogue, Dan Brown. I am sure many reading this article will come up with their own examples.

AB  - Statisticians and data scientists have been called upon to increase the impact they have through their collaborative projects. Statistics and data science practitioners and their educators can achieve and enable greater impact by learning how to create shared understanding with their collaborators as well as teaching this concept to their students, colleagues, and mentees. In this article, we explore and explain the concepts of common knowledge and shared understanding, which is the basis for action to accomplish greater impacts. We also explore related concepts of misunderstanding and doubtful understanding. We describe a process for teaching oneself and others how to create shared understanding. We conclude that incorporating the concept of shared understanding into one's practice of statistics or data science and following the steps described will result in having more impact on projects and throughout one's career.

AB  - Phosphates are essential components of any efficient fertilizer. Natural phosphate rock is, however, not available in every part of the world. According to the European Commission, phosphate rock has high economic importance as well as a certain supply risk--at least for Europe. For these reasons, environmental technology research has received a great attention from the stakeholders that provided support in developing processes for recovering phosphate from wastewater and sewage sludge to help to close the phosphate cycle and reduce potential risks, including eutrophication and its influence on the environment. In this paper, we present a design case study of integrating the idea of phosphate recovery into chemistry education via a nonformal learning experience for high school students in Germany. The paper discusses a series of experiments and shows how they were embedded through interdisciplinary curriculum development.

AB  - The teaching of STEAM has been gaining ground in the world of education for some years now. This article presents two fundamental contributions to STEAM literature. The first contribution is the detailed description of a STEAM work experience with secondary school students using Project Based Learning, in which the disciplines of science and art are connected and integrated. To achieve this, connections established among the disciplines corresponding to S, T, E, A and M are analysed. The second contribution presented in this paper is the study of the relationships established between the members of the educational community and the external educational agents (artists, researchers and research centres) involved in the project. These relationships among all the educational agents give rise to important connections relevant to STEAM education. Additionally, an increase in performance and interest in science and technology manifested by the students is analysed in a quantitative way. The students perceive an improvement in certain skills, such as teamwork, creativity, communication and self-evaluation. [Translation from Spanish by Jennifer Martin.]

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this article is to give a bird's eye view of the main issues surrounding the teaching of economic and social sciences in the French high school Approach: This article is based above all on a synthesis of the existing primary and secondary literature on Economic and social sciences ("sciences économiques et sociales") teaching in France and the controversies surrounding it. Findings: This text gives a general overview of the situation of SES teaching in France, by going back to the original intentions of its authors; by analysing curricular developments, which show a progressive distance from them; and finally by highlighting the main collective actors involved (SES teachers and other neighbouring disciplines, national education hierarchy, academics, political actors, employer lobbies, etc.). Practical implications: Beyond the French situation it presents, this article raises a number of more general questions about the objectives that can be assigned to social science teaching in high schools, the opportunity to mix several academic disciplines and the pedagogical methods that can be implemented.

AB  - The literacy design collaborative (LDC) was created to support teachers in implementing college and career readiness standards. Teachers work collaboratively with coaches to further develop their expertise and design standards-driven, literacy-rich writing assignments within their existing curriculum across content areas. The current paper reports on early student academic outcome results from a multi-year mixed methods study of the implementation and effect of LDC using a quasi-experimental design, as implemented in one large urban school district. We found LDC had statistically significant effects on Cohort 2 middle school students' English language arts (ELA) performance, an effect size of (d = 0.15) for students receiving LDC instruction in the three core content areas LDC focuses on: ELA, science, and social studies/history.

AB  - At the end of 20th century and especially in this century the education field is undergoing a significant change not only as a result of technological innovations but also pedagogical innovations on the bases of artificial intelligence (AI), cognitive science and neuroscience. What interested us was the attitude of students and teachers towards these changes. In the research the participating students were arranged in two groups, the control group (CG), where conventional lessons were carried out and the experimental group (EG), in which teachers used a transdisciplinary cognitive neuroeducation model. The performance data for the both groups was acquired via questionnaire adopted from TIMSS research. The teachers' attitude towards these changes was mostly monitored via qualitative research. As is apparent from the results, a positive shift can be seen in the students' attitude towards school. And this positive attitude towards school can create in students the suitable motivation, which is the first and most important step towards quality knowledge. A positive shift was also made in the minds of the teachers.

AB  - The need for employees in the exact and natural sciences sector with both work experience and academic qualifications, especially combined with an entrepreneurial mindset, is rising. The University of Groningen offers an alternative Master's program entitled Science, Business and Policy (SBP). SBP combines entrepreneurship education with the integration of a disciplinary science domain and thereby prepares students in science advising. This includes a work placement of 6 months, provided by companies, policy organisations and NGOs. To examine the impact of work placements from the perspective of the employer, this article analyses 20 semi-structured interviews with providers of placements. The results show that employers judge students who have undertaken a work placement as attractive future employees, and the quality of science advice given by students is seen as high. From a work floor perspective, work placements are a strong component in the optimal education of future employees. Integrating academic theory and experience in practice contributes to the employability of science students. The impact of work placements goes further than employability, since employers also indicate a direct effect on work dynamics and see the direct impact of advice reports in their organisation. The work-based learning approach chosen to achieve this specific entrepreneurship education fits the need of industry and other non-academic employers.

AB  - Thanks to the development and deployment of federally funded satellite-, buoy-, and aircraft-based remote sensing instruments, continuous streams of Earth and space data are publicly available via online databases. This accessibility provides flexibility to explore geoscience data that are interesting and relevant to students--keystone components of the "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS") (Achieve 2013a). In this article, the author outlines activities that leverage archived geoscience data, and describe design considerations for a new 11th-grade interdisciplinary science course that draw on education research and practice. Through pairing of design considerations and application in the context of an urban under-resourced technical high school, the author illustrates ways geoscience databases can be used to realize "NGSS" vision, as well as expand possibilities.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to identify vocational teachers' experiences with interdisciplinary team teaching (ITT). Participants were five teachers from a science and technology-based vocational high school in Thailand. Qualitative data collection involved focus groups, interviews and observations. Findings were grouped into the following categories: teaching across disciplines; supportive and sharing relationships and roles; communication and decision-making; benefits; and challenges. Findings suggest that the interdisciplinary aspect may be achieved through engagement in project-based learning (PBL). The PBL approach can provide both a shared purpose and a framework and guidelines to support teachers' planning. Findings also point to the value of shared decision-making and leadership, and to the need for supportive relationships that take into consideration professional and personal issues. Implications relate to the need for open forms of communication that reflect trust, support and respect. Use of social media to support communication and collaboration should be accompanied by guidelines and rules established in advance by team members.

AB  - Aesthetic education can be integrated into students' everyday lives and into different learning areas. Its integration into science education is also valued in schools. Using mixed methods, this study investigated young children's science and aesthetic learning in a science aesthetic thematic curriculum in a preschool classroom in Taiwan. The participants were two preschool teachers and 24 five-year-old children. Data sources included the children's pre-test and post-test assessments, observations, interviews, children's worksheets and artwork, and teaching reflection notes. The preschool teachers applied Dewey's aesthetic experience to organise the thematic curriculum. The results showed that the curriculum had significant positive influences on the children's science cognitive abilities and aesthetic abilities. Most of the children increased their interest in science learning. This study provides a lens through which to examine children's science and aesthetic learning in a thematic curriculum, and also a reference for early childhood science education.

AB  - Background: The American Psychological Association has identified information literacy as a crucial component to undergraduate education. One major barrier to comprehensive information literacy instruction has been a lack of guidance integrating this into survey courses, particularly with reduced pedagogical resources available. Objective: This research evaluates the effectiveness of a scaffolded information literacy curriculum that may be integrated into psychology courses. Method: Students in introductory psychology courses were taught with either an information literacy curriculum or the typical science-focused curriculum. Information literacy knowledge was evaluated using a multiple-choice test. Results: Students who received the specialized curriculum demonstrated significant improvements on an objective information literacy test by the end of the course, while students in the control group did not. Conclusion: Evidence suggests that this easily adaptable information literacy curriculum is effective in meeting psychology information literacy goals, more so than the traditional science-focused curriculum taught in introductory psychology classes. Teaching Implications: Instructors and faculty should be encouraged to utilize this adaptive curriculum, available on Open Science Framework, as a way of improving information literacy. Other implications, including feasibility and content, are discussed.

AB  - The pervasive digitization of society underscores the crucial role of data and its significant impact on decision-making across various domains. As a result, it is essential for individuals to acquire competencies in handling data. This need is particularly pertinent in K-12 education, where early engagement with data and statistics can lay a foundational understanding for future academic and professional endeavors. Additionally, K-12 education should provide students with critical skills necessary for navigating the complexities of daily life and making informed decisions in a data-rich society. This systematic review examines the state of research on statistical and data literacy in K-12 STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education. It focuses specifically on cognitive, affective, and behavioral metrics and pedagogical approaches empirically investigated in this context. Using a rigorous selection process, we identified and synthesized 83 original empirical papers. Additionally, we invited the authors of these studies to share their perspectives on future strategies for addressing statistical and data literacy. The results indicate that the included studies primarily focus on the construct of statistical literacy, which is operationalized through a diverse array of metrics, predominantly within the context of mathematics education. We identified effective pedagogical approaches, such as authentic problem-solving and the integration of real-world data. The researchers surveyed emphasized the importance of interdisciplinary teaching, adapted curricula, and improved professional development for pre- and in-service teachers. Our findings underscore the growing relevance of this field, but suggest that integrated perspectives on statistical and data literacy within STEM subjects are limited.

AB  - This research is about developing stochastic worldview formation among high school students (grades 10 and 11) based on integrating scientific approaches, namely, information and technology, interdisciplinary, system, and activity approaches. Developing the structural components of a stochastic worldview, such as motivation--value relations, intuitive--figurative perception, and rational--logic acceptance, determines the most effective way for students in grades 10 and 11 to form a worldview when teaching stochastics. The research site was School Gymnasium No. 11 in Yelets, located in the Lipetsk region. Tests, questionnaires, and documentation were used as data collection methods. The methodology of data analysis included descriptive statistics. According to Fisher's angular transformation criterion (phi), the validation of the experimental data confirmed the research efficiency. This study showed that the proposed tool improves students' motivation, value, and worldview constructs, guiding them to understand the stochastic component of the world around them. The results complement the methodological and methodical features of math education, which aims to develop helpful worldview qualities of students. These results can be beneficial for methodical science since, with their help, it specifies the known approaches, ideas, methodological means in mathematics education, and upbringing of high school students.

AB  - This study investigates teachers' perceptions and practices of designing and teaching transdisciplinary STEAM curriculum using online authentic assessment. Aligning the transdisciplinary STEAM curriculum to authentic assessment is a conceptual framework that guided this study to focus on the three learning domains (cognitive, psychomotor, and affective). The participants are middle and high school teachers (n = 37) in a private school in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). An exploratory mixed method was adopted as a research design. The qualitative data (document analysis) was gathered through analyzing STEAM lesson plans. An online questionnaire was used to collect the quantitative data from teachers. The study's results reveal that teachers' perceptions and practices about the design of STEAM curriculum using authentic assessment were positive with regards to the three learning domains (cognitive, psychomotor, and affective). The highest agreement of teachers' responses was found to be in the affective domain.

AB  - It is theoretically acknowledged that needs assessments generally present holistic views in new, quality improvement or extension of projects. Although previous studies demonstrated the significant contributions of approaches and methods, reviews of the literature on needs assessments describing formal and non-formal technical and vocational higher education were excluded. Therefore, a thematic review of patterns and trends concerning on the needs of needs assessments in technical and vocational higher education between 2016 and 2020 was reported. Guided by the systematic review process and thematic analysis by using ATLAS.ti of Scopus, ScienceDirect and EBSCOhost identified 21 related articles. Further review of these articles produced conceptual framework with two main themes: i) "What is?" and "what should be?" to the project; and ii) Needs of needs assessment including input of needs assessment (experts, resources, time, innovative approaches, knowledge and authentic data) and method of needs assessment as preliminary studies tools, needs identification tools, evaluation tools and decision-making tools. Conceptual framework that synthesizes and uses the findings in organizing and categorizing the needs of needs assessment. Significant contributions for practical, multidisciplinary approaches in technical vocational education were presented as implications for prospective research.

AB  - This study proposes employing "linguistically responsive instruction" (LRI) in transnational higher education such as international branch campuses (IBCs). It sheds light on the beliefs and practices of content instructors teaching in English-medium IBCs, in terms of supporting students' academic language development. Previous studies have shown how content instructors, particularly in STEM fields, do not see teaching language as part of their role in the classroom and do not attach importance to it. However, students in IBC contexts often need more language support. 101 IBC instructors from various disciplines completed a survey regarding their beliefs about providing language support for students. A purposeful sampling of 6 engineering, science, and liberal arts instructors were also video-recorded teaching their classes and then interviewed about LRI practices using stimulated-recall techniques. Findings show that while STEM instructors tended to align less with LRI than liberal arts instructors on the surveys, they employed multiple LRI practices while observed teaching. The study shows the importance of going beyond just attitudinal surveys when it comes to understanding STEM instructors' dispositions toward teaching language, and it is proposed that IBCs create dialogic, multidisciplinary faculty learning communities on academic language development and meaning making resources.

AB  - Purpose: Microteaching is a teacher training method based on microclasses (groups of four or five students) and microlessons lasting no more than 5-20 min. Since it was first explored in the late 20th century in experiments at Stanford University, microteaching has evolved at the interdisciplinary level. The purpose of this paper is to examine the networks found via an analytical bibliometric study of the scientific output related with microteaching in teacher training, through a study and examination of the Web of Science database. Design/methodology/approach: This research was conducted with the VOSviewer tool for content analysis through data mining and scientific network structure mapping by means of the normalisation technique. This technique is based on the association strength indicator, which is interpreted as a measurement of the similarity of the units of analysis. Findings: Two hundred and nine articles were thus obtained from the Web of Science database. The networks generated and the connections among the various items, co-authorship and co-citation are presented in the results, which clearly indicates that there are significant authors and institutions in the field of microteaching. The largest cluster is made up of institutions such as Australian Catholic University. The most often-cited document is by Rich and Hannafin. Allen (1968), who defines microteaching as a technique based on microclasses and microlessons, is the author most often cited and has the largest number of connections. Research limitations/implications: This research's limitations concern either aspects that lie beyond the study's possibilities or goals that have proved unattainable. The second perspective, which focuses on skill transfer, contains a lower percentage of documents and therefore has a weaker central documentary structure. Lastly, the authors have also had to bear in mind the fact that the scientific output hinges upon a highly specific realm, the appearance and/or liberalisation of digital technologies and access to those technologies in the late 20th century. Originality/value: This research shows that microteaching is a promising area of research that opens up vast possibilities in higher education teacher training for application in the realm of technologies. This paper could lead to several lines of future research, such as access to and the universal design of learning from the standpoint of different communication and pedagogical models based on microteaching.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to understand how the creativity of pupils and teachers is nurtured through the use of a virtual world (VW) within a sociotechnical network affecting pupils' learning in a pilot secondary school. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is the result of a pluri-disciplinary systemic analysis involving didactics, sociology, psychology and management science on an individual, collective and systemic scale. This participatory action research is based on interviews and systematic observations in class, in-world and in the global ecosystem. Linguistic and multimodal analysis is applied to the data, through teacher monographs that hint at the teachers' activity. Findings: Pupils' and teachers' creativity appeared to be anchored within four main interdependent nurturing conditions the personal inclinations and professional interactions in the sociotechnical network sustaining the VW; a creative regulation allowing compromises with the institutional constraints of pedagogical control; avatars and 3D boundary objects that act as a motor of teachers-pupils inquiry and creativity; the sociotechnical network that contributes, through the actors' play, to bringing the organisational rules of the school towards an innovation trajectory, that in turns mediates success in the use and the adoption of the new technology. Research limitations/implications: Although this is a study within a specific school, the findings can be put to use by other pedagogical teams who would wish to integrate a VW to re-engage pupils. Practical implications The participatory design processes taking place within a sociotechnical network support teachers in the building of Virtual World scenarios negotiated with researchers and start-up developers. Social implications: The pedagogical use of a virtual world opens new learning engagement opportunities for the pupils through enhanced experiential learning and sustains the transformation of teachers' professionality. Originality/value: The authors' approach differs from the previous educational VW literature, in that they integrate the teachers' creativity and their pedagogical scripts into their study, within a systemic approach, thus requiring a wider theoretical framework, necessary for understanding the building of strategies and knowledge that foster teachers' and pupils' creativity in educational settings using a VW.

AB  - Advocacy of STEM curricular approaches is based on a concern to engage students in authentic disciplinary and interdisciplinary practices in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) disciplines, and the need to promote participation in STEM pathways. The "STEM Academy" professional learning program was developed to support teachers to engage and motivate students by creating real-world, challenging problems. The initiative involved interdisciplinary teams of secondary STEM teachers attending workshops and working with university experts to design, implement and evaluate STEM curricular experiences. This paper focuses on case studies undertaken in two of the twelve schools involved in the initiative, using interview data from teachers and students, to explore the nature of their programs and their experiences. We investigate key features of these two schools' approaches, using a conceptual framework for integrated STEM, and explore the challenges and benefits of different features of integrated STEM that promote different dimensions of engagement in learning mathematics. We explore how the framework characteristics can be reframed into four dimensions that promote mathematics engagement in integrated STEM education--design thinking in authentic contexts, content integration, STEM practices and 21st Century skills, and exposure to professional practice.

AB  - There is growing attention to student assessments designed to reach beyond the classroom, including assessments with an immediate or future audience. The impact of audience, however, has not been examined in multimodal assessments across continents, institutions, disciplines, and teaching contexts. Using qualitative data, this article examines the impact on student learning of incorporating audience and awareness of audience in diverse settings through multimodal projects. These include a core assignment in an interdisciplinary, semester-long graduate class in the United States, a year-long capstone project for geography undergraduates in Northern Ireland, and a supplemental assignment for graduate and undergraduate biology students in Norway. This article investigates the impact of audience through multimodal assessments across these three settings and concludes that it can positively influence student learning, motivation, and skill development.

AB  - The ability to conduct interdisciplinary research is crucial to address complex real-world problems that require the collaboration of different scientific fields, with global warming being a case in point. To produce integrated climate-related knowledge, climate researchers should be trained early on to work across boundaries and gain an understanding of diverse disciplinary perspectives. This article argues for social breaching as a methodology to introduce students with a natural science background to the social sciences in the context of integrated climate sciences. The breach of a social norm presented here was to ask people whether the experimenter could ride on an elevator alone. We conclude that the approach is effective in letting students with a natural science background explore and experience the power of social reality, and is especially suitable for a small-sized introductory class.

AB  - Here, we systematically review research on teaching knowledge in the context of undergraduate STEM education, with particular attention to what this research reveals about knowledge that is important for evidence-based teaching. Evidence-based teaching can improve student outcomes in undergraduate STEM education. However, the enactment of promising evidence-based teaching strategies depends greatly on the instructor and potentially on the teaching knowledge they are able to deploy. The review includes an overview of prevalent teaching knowledge theory, including pedagogical content knowledge, mathematical knowledge for teaching, and pedagogical knowledge. We compare and contrast teaching knowledge theory and terminology across STEM disciplines in order to build bridges for researchers across disciplines. Our search for peer-reviewed investigations of teaching knowledge in undergraduate science, engineering and mathematics yielded 45 papers. We examined the theoretical frameworks used in each study and analyzed study approaches, comparing across disciplines. Importantly, we also synthesized findings from research conducted in the context of evidence-based teaching. Overall, teaching knowledge research is sparse and siloed by discipline, and we call for collaborative work and better bridge-building across STEM disciplines. Though disciplinary divergences are common in discipline-based education research, the effect is magnified in this research area because the theoretical frameworks are themselves siloed by discipline. Investigations of declarative knowledge were common, and we call for increased attention to knowledge used in the practice of teaching. Finally, there are not many studies examining teaching knowledge in the context of evidence-based teaching, but the existing work suggests that components of pedagogical content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and content knowledge influence the implementation of evidence-based teaching. We describe implications for future teaching knowledge research. We also call on those who develop and test evidence-based strategies and curriculum to consider, from the beginning, the teaching knowledge needed for effective implementation.

AB  - This article raises questions and concerns regarding students from the sciences working with faculty in the humanities in interdisciplinary settings. It explores the experience of two English professors facing the privileging of "facts" and a science-based understanding of the world in their own classrooms. It poses both questions and pedagogical possibilities for addressing conflicts around epistemologies, scholarship, and teaching and learning.

AB  - The focus on STEM has centered on knowledge use across multiple disciplines. However, there currently exists limited understanding of the relationship between the cognitive practices utilized across these disciplines as a function of performance on standardized assessments. Focusing on science and mathematics, we investigated the direct and indirect relationships between science and mathematics reasoning practices. The TIMSS 2011 cognitive practices were adopted to establish a hypothesized model representing these relationships. We employed the generalized DINA (deterministic inputs, noisy "and" gate), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM) to 2287 fourth-graders' responses to standardized mathematics and science assessments. The findings show positive relationships among science reasoning, mathematics reasoning, and mathematics applying. However, we also found a significant indirect effect from science reasoning to mathematics reasoning through mathematics applying. This result calls for a need to shift the focus of interdisciplinary efforts to emphasize cognitive practices that students use in learning mathematics and science as suggested in the Next Generation Science Standards and the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics.

AB  - Spatial ability is a powerful systematic source of individual differences in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and technology (STEM). Abundant research has evidenced that psychometrically assessed spatial ability is a strong predictor of STEM achievement. However, its underlying cognitive process and relevant role in STEM education are unknown. From the perspective of cognitive neuroscience, spatial ability is also considered a human intelligence deriving from the cognitive processing of spatial information in the brain. With the help of the cognitive neuroscience paradigm of spatial navigation, in the present work, we investigate the spatial cognitive process among STEM students and its role in STEM education. A total of 172 undergraduates majoring in veterinary science participated in a spatial navigation test. Participants attempted to return a toy to its original place in an arena when given either internal self-motion cues only, external landmark cues only, or both in a spatial navigation task. Modelling analysis of 172 participants' spatial navigation behaviours showed that all the participants' spatial cognitive processes featured navigation cue integration. The results of the different tests showed that students with higher levels of navigation cue integration had better academic performance in STEM learning. The results also indicated that, surprisingly, better academic performance in science and mathematics relied more on the use of internal self-motion cues, while better academic performance in engineering and technology relied more on the use of external landmark cues. This study sheds some light on the spatial cognitive process and its role in STEM education from the cognitive neuroscience perspective, thus deepening the functional understanding of spatial ability as a systemic source of individual differences for STEM education, and provides an empirical reference point for interdisciplinary studies on the role of cognition in the context of STEM education. Implications on STEM learning design and STEM teaching were discussed.

AB  - This study explores disciplinary literacy instruction integrated within an elementary engineering unit in an urban classroom. A multidisciplinary team of university literacy and engineering educators and classroom teachers served as the research team for this case study. A social semiotic language theory (systemic functional linguistics) and a framework of mechanistic reasoning informed the instruction and analysis of classroom discourse and student writing. The study illustrates how a flexible set of disciplinary language choices functioned to support students' evolving reasoning as part of the engineering design process. These findings provide insights into synergy between language and reasoning as a habit of design. These findings also inform calls to align science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) literacy and core disciplinary practices within both Common Core State Standards for (English language arts) ELA and Next Generation Science Standards.

AB  - The Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is a socio-technical, ideological, and rhetorical construction rooted in the neoliberal discourse that reflects key tenets of global capitalism, is believed to have considerable implications for the development of employees in advanced manufacturing environments. This paper aims to explore the ways in which the learning needs of employees in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution could be appropriately identified and how employees could further develop their skills through the design of suitable development curricula. To this end , the paper seeks to interrogate the ways in which the employees' learning needs are likely to be identified in the middle-range future, and problemate the focus of highly specialised and exclusively focused on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) curricula that are likely to be designed to help employees respond to the perceived demands of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The paper further seeks to explore a preferred liberal future, drawing on the work of Martha Nussbaum, to create the possibility for an alternative future guided by a more holistic conception of employee development through the establishment of learner-centred, liberal -- and liberating -- interdisciplinary Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) curricula.

AB  - Written corrective feedback in Second Language Writing is one of the most important parts in L2 Acquisition and Language Teaching. CiteSpace is a convenient and effective bibliometric analysis tool which is widely used by researchers to explore the development tends of a certain field. The Web of Science core collection database was used as the primary source for data collection. There were 272 effective articles were selected from 2001 to 2021. The hot research topics in recent 20 years and emerging trends were showed. It was found that the research of written corrective feedback has entered a period of rapid development after the accumulation of basic knowledge in the early stage. Many empirical studies have been carried out. The distribution, cooperation, development trends and hotpots of current research are presented through visual map analysis in this study. In the future, the written corrective feedback research could try to concentrate on the psychological process and feedback providers, and it is also suggested to combine interdisciplinary knowledge such as education, psychology, neurology, etc., and use new research and measurement methods to promote the development of written corrective feedback.

AB  - The addition of the arts to STEM education, now known as STEAM, adds a new dimension to problem-solving within those fields, offering students tools such as imagination and resourcefulness to incorporate into their designs. However, the shift from STEM to STEAM has changed what it means for students to learn within and across these disciplines. Redesigning curricula to include the arts is the next step in preparing students throughout all levels of education. "Challenges and Opportunities for Transforming From STEM to STEAM Education" is a pivotal reference source that examines the challenges and opportunities presented in redesigning STEM education to include creativity, innovation, and design from the arts including new approaches to STEAM and their practical applications in the classroom. While highlighting topics including curriculum design, teacher preparation, and PreK-20 education, this book is ideally designed for teachers, curriculum developers, instructional designers, deans, museum educators, policymakers, administrators, researchers, academicians, and students. Chapters in this book include: (1) Designing STEAM Learning Environments (Haidee A. Jackson, James D. Basham, Kelli Thomas, and Cassandra L. Hunt); (2) Tools to Mediate Learning and Self-Assessment in a STEAM Unit of Work (Kate Thompson, Susan Narelle Chapman, and Harry Kanasa); (3) Artistic Biotechnology: A Design Thinking Platform for STEAM Praxis (Krista Marie Stith and Rachel Louise Geesa); (4) Science Cartoons (SciToons): A Model for Integrating Arts with STEM (Oludurotimi Adetunji and Roger Levine); (5) Becoming STEAM: Perspectives From School Leaders (Kelli Thomas and Douglas Huffman); (6) Making Success: Researching a School District's Integration of the Maker Movement into Its Middle and High School (Keith W.

AB  - The beginning of modern science is marked by efforts of pioneers to understand the natural world using a quantitative approach. As Galileo wrote, "the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics". The traditional undergraduate course curriculum is heavily focused on individual disciplines like biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics rather than interdisciplinary courses. This fragmented teaching of sciences in majority of universities leave biology outside the quantitative and mathematical approaches. The landscape of biomedical science has transformed dramatically with advances in high throughput experimental approaches, which led to the huge amount of data. The best possible approach to generate insights into the biological problem using this huge amount of collected data is to employ the strength of mathematics. Since the people trained only in either biology or mathematics will not be of great help in this pursuit, there is a great demand to prepare trained workforce in the interdisciplinary field of mathematical biology. With this aim, we developed and offered a four hundred level interdisciplinary undergraduate course on mathematical biology at the University of Dayton. The results from exit surveys of the students who participated in the course are promising. They strongly felt their experience was conducive to learning and strongly evoked their interest in the study of science. Here we present the details of the course and its outcome on student enquiry and learning habits. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - There has been a national call to transition away from the traditional, passive, lecture-based model of STEM education towards one that facilitates learning through active engagement and problem solving. This mixed-methods research study examines the impact of a supplemental Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) program on knowledge and skill acquisition for students in introductory biology, chemistry, calculus and applied statistics courses. Results indicate program participants reliably outperform their matched pairs in courses that emphasize quantitative reasoning. Moreover, program participants report acquiring important insights about learning, collaboration, and engagement in undergraduate STEM education. These results are consistent with previous findings on PLTL and also provide insight into the roles of course context and student population on program outcomes.

AB  - A team of literacy, science, and theatre educators have been working to engage children in an urban public school system in the United States through embodied performances, where students embody and dramatise science ideas. This study focuses on one fourth-grade classroom when instruction was done remotely due to Covid-19. Children in the class were asked to compose videos of themselves acting out and/or exploring science phenomena and concepts, and we analysed the affordances of these multimodal compositions. We situate the need for this study in claims from the Next Generation Science Standards that literacy skills are necessary to build and communicate science knowledge. In doing so, we center social semiotics perspectives that conceive of composition broadly as production-oriented processes drawing from various semiotic resources. The multimodal compositions in Mr. M's science class included both primarily embodied compositions and primarily digital compositions, and we elaborate on one focal example of each in the findings. Intertwined affordances of the focal children and their classmates' multimodal science compositions include opportunities to creatively engage with and negotiate science ideas, to draw from personal and social knowledge during meaning-making, and to intentionally make rhetorical choices.

AB  - This activity report describes two cases of Language teaching for degree students in the University of Oulu with new pedagogical approaches aiming towards authentic working life skills. Co-creation, collaborative learning and cooperation across borders are the building blocks for these innovative language teaching projects. Case 1 describes Entrepreneurial Language Studies in English and Swedish courses, co-created with the Ministry of Culture and Education Key Projects, which aim for fostering entrepreneurial culture and creating entrepreneurial learning environments at universities. Case 2 is about Teaching English and Course Cooperation in English language between the students of Information Processing Science in Finland and Russia. In both of these cases, students have been challenging themselves with new ways to learn the language and at the same time acquire important skills for working life, virtual learning, presentations, communication, problem solving and business idea creation. What unites these cases is the emphasis on authentic language learning, creativity and self-efficacy. Because career paths today are increasingly complex, multidisciplinary and diverse, the ability to adapt, innovate and be flexible is vital in evolving and collaborative working environments.

AB  - Recently, two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures, such as graphene and few-layer MoS[subscript 2], have been applied to wide fields based on their intriguing performances, and they contribute to developments of clean energy, biomedicine, and environmental protection. The synthesis of 2D nanostructures involves chemistry, materials, and biology-associated interdisciplinary knowledge. Nevertheless, desired strategies that can be comprehensively and safely achieved by undergraduates or academic trainees are largely restricted considering the uses of toxic and pyrophoric reagents, high-risk manipulation, expensive instruments, and a time-consuming test period. Herein, chemically fundamental experiments are integrated with scientific frontiers, achieving the development of undergraduate's experimental projects based on up-to-the-minute academic results. In order to promote the high-efficient study and eliminate the risks among our learners, the virtual simulation courses are well-integrated, and students can independently complete the synthesis of 2D MoS[subscript 2] nanomaterials without the face-to-face guidance of mentors. Significantly, several characteristics are equipped in this project: (1) Students can master the uses of oxygen-sensitive, moisture-sensitive reagents and skills for operating high-risk reactions via the virtual system; (2) Universal preparation approaches of 2D nanomaterials, based on the Schlenk technique, are presented; (3) Students' understanding of MoS[subscript 2] monolayer characterization, properties, and applications is remarkably increased. This project aims at inspiring students' understanding for scientific frontiers, improving their academic and innovative skills, as well as expanding their advanced perspective.

AB  - Educational data science is an emerging transdisciplinary field formed from an amalgamation of data science and elements of biological, psychological and neuroscientific knowledge about learning, or learning science. This article conceptualises educational data science as a biopolitical strategy focused on the evaluation and management of the corporeal, emotional and embrained lives of children. Such strategies are enacted through the development of new kinds of digitally-mediated "biopedagogies" of body optimisation, "psychopedagogies" of emotional maximisation, and "neuropedagogies" of brain empowerment. The data practices, scientific knowledges, digital devices and pedagogies that constitute educational data science produce new systems of knowledge about the child that are consequential to their formation as "biodigital" subjects, whose assumed qualities and capacities are defined through expert practices of biosensing, emotion analytics, and neurocomputation, combined with associated scientific knowledges. The article develops the concept of transcoding to account for the processes involved in the formation of the biodigital child.

AB  - Nursing, dance and studio-based arts, engineering, and athletic therapy are viewed as practice-oriented professions in which the teaching and situated learning of practical skills are central. In order to succeed, students must perform a series of performance-based assessments, which seemingly require an "able" body to enact complex tasks in situated and/or simulation-based contexts (for example, "safe nursing practice"). Our interdisciplinary research seeks to intervene within the culture of professional learning by investigating what we know about the use of smartphone video recording for situated, practice-based learning, and for supporting interactive video-based assessment as a means of accommodation and extending access for students, including students with performance anxiety,mature students, ESL learners, students with disabilities, and students in remote communities. In this paper we employ a scoping review methodology to present our findings related to students' and instructors' perspectives on the use of smartphone video to demonstrate and document practical knowledge and practice-oriented competencies across fields in the arts and sciences. We also examine broader research, as well as the ethical and design implications for the development of our technology-based toolbox project -- an online resource created to advance pedagogies deploying smartphones as tools for practical skills acquisition -- and for accommodation -- within multidisciplinary practical learning environments.

AB  - Long-standing calls have been initiated to attend to equity in student achievement in and through science. Science teacher educators can aid these efforts by identifying effective science teaching strategies and supporting K-12 science teachers in integrating those into their practice. Scholars argue for an equity-driven lens to be central in teacher education for reform efforts to be fully effective in ensuring high quality education for all students. The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) undergird current U.S. reform efforts and are noted for more explicitly addressing issues of equity than past standards, but still noted as limited as equity is not sufficiently central. Additionally, "reflexivity" is encouraged with reforms, where thorough understanding is derived of effectiveness and challenges of past and current practices before implementing changes. Altogether, these issues inform the current study: an exploration of the ways in which science teachers work to implement NGSS-aligned instruction within a professional development context where an equity-driven lens is not explicit, seeking to identify evidence of how current practice facilitated or aligned with equity-driven practices. This inquiry will serve to guide future efforts to build on and transform current practice to more centrally address equity in science education.

AB  - Since contemporary learning theories, strategies and models offer the interdisciplinary approach, educators need new pedagogical alternative ways to attain it in practicum. For this reason, the current research aimed to illustrate how to intertwine mathematical modeling with an environmental issue that recruits waste management (e.g., reuse-recycle-reduce) to live an environmentally friendly lifestyle. Through a case study research, 6 seventh-grade students (3 females and 3 males; aged 13-14) voluntarily participated in the research. The researchers videotaped and analyzed all interactive learning processes to elicit the students' environmental dialogues. The results indicated that the interdisciplinary mathematical modeling afforded the students to acquire the targeted environmental concepts/issues and somewhat supported their arguments. Since the current research illustrates an alternative pedagogy to integrate science/environmental education into mathematics, it may be used to facilitate dissemination and applicability of the STEM education.

AB  - Multidisciplinary field investigations courses offer exciting alternatives to traditional learning. They offer a more holistic view of Earth and an opportunity for students to experience the relationships between all of the different elements instead of just one individual segment. We designed a multidisciplinary field investigations course for upper division students of the earth sciences. The course provides an opportunity for geology, environmental science, environmental studies, and geography students to collaborate on projects while learning about the interconnections between geology and geography as they shape unique landscapes. We use the field investigations courses that we have taught in the Greater Yellowstone region, Pacific Northwest, and Southwest United States as case studies to demonstrate the advantages of combining disciplines into a single course. We collected voluntary course evaluations from the student participants of these courses to evaluate the course and learn the benefits of field experiences in the geosciences. These data along with faculty experience and observation suggest that a holistic approach in undergraduate field courses broadens student experiences, enhances peer-based and collaborative learning, builds team-working skills, and fosters a curiosity about the natural environment.

AB  - Powerful knowledge facilitates students' access to profound understanding and abstract thinking. In this study, disciplinary knowledge practices and their curricular capacity are examined in regions, i.e. interdisciplinary and professionally oriented degree programmes. Interview data on curriculum knowledge were analysed drawing on Basil Bernstein's conceptual framework, and the disciplinary knowledge and curriculum structures' potential to provide access to powerful knowledge were analysed. Interviews were carried out with 26 teachers from two region cases, one representing humanities, arts, and social sciences and the other representing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The results show how the disciplinary knowledge practices create different bases for the curricular capacity available. To enable access to powerful knowledge in regions, assertion of the value of traditional disciplines, or vocationally relevant cumulative knowledge is not enough; attention is needed to the simultaneous growth of conceptual and contextual complexity, and the cumulative coherence of curriculum, also in curriculum implementation.

AB  - While much is known about teacher learning of nature of science (NOS) concepts, less is known about how teachers develop an understanding of how to effectively teach NOS or how instructional views might differ across levels of the Family Resemblance Approach (FRA) wheel. Therefore, this study investigated the NOS instructional views related to different levels of the FRA wheel of preservice secondary science teachers as they completed a semester-long NOS course. At four times during the semester, data was collected through written documents and interviews about NOS instructional views. Participant NOS instructional views were evaluated in terms of three aspects of NOS teaching: explicit, reflective, and role of context (McComas et al., 2020). In terms of the explicit and reflective components of NOS instruction, participants generally progressed from utilizing inaccurate representations of NOS to inclusion of accurate implicit messages, and finally to explicit reflective instruction often mimicking course activities. As the semester progressed, their questioning also moved toward targeting more specific NOS aspects. As far as the role of context, participants moved from treating NOS as its own topic to a more embedded approach. Other findings include that preservice teachers tended to use more abstract and contextualized activities for social institutional aspects of NOS as opposed to concrete and moderately contextualized activities for cognitive-epistemic NOS. Features of the NOS course may account for some aspects of the learning progressions observed.

AB  - Through a bibliometric analysis, this study aimed to uncover the connections between technology, digital and visual literacy, and education. By examining the Web of Science database, we were able to gain insight into the scope of the topic and interdisciplinary trends in the literature. Our analysis revealed that journals such as the "Nordic Journal of Digital Literacy," "Computers & Education," and "Education and Information Technologies" are important and frequently cited resources in this area. Notable researchers such as Buckingham, D., McGrew, S., and Coiro, J. were identified through our author analysis. Our trend analysis demonstrated the growing importance of digital literacy, technology, and education. Through cluster analysis, we were able to identify relationships and topics between keywords. Our findings suggest that digital literacy education should be prioritized, technology should be more widely utilized, and teachers should be trained to collaborate and share. This study provides helpful guidance for educators and researchers and can inform future studies. Our goal is to encourage the development of effective strategies for technology and digital literacy in education. Further research should focus on improving students' digital skills, increasing the impact of technology in education, and enhancing learning experiences.

AB  - This article contributes to the debate on the growing number of interdisciplinary study programs in learning and technology, and aims to understand the diversity of programs as well as curricula structure in an international landscape. Scientific fields share their knowledge and recruit young researchers by offering discipline-specific study programs. Thus, study programs are a reflection of the fields they represent. As technology-enhanced learning is considered to be particularly interdisciplinary and heterogenous, it is important to better understand the landscape of study programs that represents the field. This article presents an analysis of master programs in technology-enhanced learning. A systematic review and analysis of master programs offered in English has been conducted and further used as input for hierarchical cluster analysis. The study identified general characteristics, curricula structure, and organization of topics of these programs. Hierarchical cluster analysis and qualitative content analysis helped us to identify the major types of curricular structures and typical topics covered by the courses. Results show that most study programs rely on interdisciplinary subjects in technology-enhanced learning with a considerable number of subjects from education, learning and psychology. Subjects related to technology, information and computer science appear in such programs less frequently.

AB  - Recent times have seen the growth in the number and scope of interacting professional reform movements in science, centered on themes such as open research, research integrity, responsible research assessment, and responsible metrics. The responsible metrics movement identifies the growing influence of quantitative performance indicators as a major problem and seeks to steer and improve practices around their use. It is a multi-actor, multi-disciplinary reform movement premised upon engendering a sense of responsibility among academic evaluators to approach metrics with caution and avoid certain poor practices. In this article we identify how academic evaluators engage with the responsible metrics agenda, via semi-structured interview and open-text survey responses on professorial hiring, tenure and promotion assessments among senior academics in the United States--a country that has so far been less visibly engaged with the responsible metrics reform agenda. We explore how notions of 'responsibility' are experienced and practiced among the very types of professionals international reform initiatives such as the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) are hoping to mobilize into their cause. In doing so, we draw on concepts from science studies, including from literatures on Responsible Research and Innovation and 'folk theories' of citation. We argue that literature on citation folk theories should extend its scope beyond simply asking researchers how they view the role and validity of these tools as performance measures, by asking them also what they consider are their professional obligations to handle bibliometrics appropriately.

The authors recommend using this investigation in conjunction with other activities focusing on chemical change as a step toward fulfilling the "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS") performance expectation 5-PS1-4: "Conduct an investigation to determine whether the mixing of two or more substances results in new substances" (NGSS Lead States 2013). The investigation leverages the overlapping practices of art and science, including observation, experimentation, and the creation of solutions to design problems, as students use chemical reactions to develop a multicolored palette for painting. Using acids and bases to change the color of red cabbage pigments, students explore the disciplinary core idea that mixing substances can result in chemical reactions that form new substances with different properties.

AB  - With the highly interdisciplinary nature of biochemistry, and the diverse range of students taking introductory biochemistry courses, it can be difficult to incorporate authentic applications of course content that appeal broadly to students. However, it is important to engage students' learning at the affective level. One mode to achieve this goal is by incorporating assignments that support students in identifying the relevance of course content and the skills they are learning. In this study we incorporated an assignment that placed students in the role of science communicators, where they attended a research seminar and then wrote a summary of the research, connecting it to course content. We interviewed students about their experiences with the assignment to identify the ways in which it appealed to them affectively and influenced their perceived learning. Our results indicate that both components supported students to identify the relevance of biochemistry on a personal and societal level, as well as supported students' perceived understanding of biochemistry concepts. Thus, incorporating assignments that encourage students to build their own connections with biochemistry content can be beneficial to their affective learning.

AB  - The Green Ninja Film Academy (GENIE) is an interdisciplinary curriculum development project that examines the efficacy of combining climate science concepts and practices with digital storytelling for middle school youth. We present findings from iterative enactments of this design-based research project in 2017 (N = 296) and 2018 (N = 539). On average, youth increased scores on assessments of science content and practices while demonstrating competencies in filmmaking and science explanations. Further, an inverse correlation was seen between initial identification with the environment and change in environmental identification throughout the unit. Results suggest that integration of creative filmmaking into a climate science curriculum aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards can increase engagement and science proficiency particularly for youth who initially show less engagement in environmental science.

AB  - We present two simple, one-dimensional, stochastic models that lead to a qualitative understanding of very complex systems from biology, nanoscience and social sciences. The first model explains the complicated dynamics of microtubules, stochastic cellular highways. Using the theory of random walks in one dimension, we find analytical expressions for certain physical quantities, such as the time dependence of the length of the microtubules, and diffusion coefficients. The second one is a stochastic adsorption model with applications in surface deposition, epidemics and voter systems. We introduce the "empty interval method" and show sample calculations for the time-dependent particle density. These models can serve as an introduction to the field of non-equilibrium statistical physics, and can also be used as a pedagogical tool to exemplify standard statistical physics concepts, such as random walks or the kinetic approach of the master equation.

AB  - Background: Despite its obvious relevance to computer science, computational thinking (CT) is transdisciplinary with the potential of impacting one's analytical ability. Although countless efforts have been invested across K-12 education, there is a paucity of research at the postsecondary level about the extent to which CT can contribute to sustainable learning outcomes. Objectives: The current study examines how a series of Arduino-based robotics learning activities capture the fuller essence of concepts related to CT. Methods: College students (n = 50) completed a series of six robotics learning activities. Think-alouds, student reflections and performance scores were used to assess students' CT through a robotics challenge in virtual and physical learning environments. Results and Conclusions: Students verbalized CT concepts related to algorithmic thinking much more than abstraction, problem decomposition and testing and debugging. Students exposed to active learning performed better in a virtual robotics challenge compared to their peers in a traditional-oriented classroom. Students' scores on the physical robotics challenge increased as a function of the number of references they made to CT concepts during the think-alouds. It is possible to design pedagogical experiences that tap into various dimensions of CT at incremental levels of complexity through a series of Arduino-based robotics activities. With the integration of an online simulation, students can visualize and transfer their CT skills between a virtual and physical learning environment, thus leading to more sustainable learning outcomes.

AB  - This work developed the Flint, Michigan water crisis as a modular case study for teaching traditional analytical chemistry concepts through the medium of environmental justice, power, and equity. An interdisciplinary framework was used to design, implement, and assess the case study in an effort to understand how the deliberate presence of emotional and human-centered content can impact student perceptions of learning analytical chemistry concepts. The six complementary modules of the case study included (1) a guided discussion of water, power, and privilege in Flint, (2) an in-class guided inquiry exercise introducing chemical concepts key to the water crisis, (3) a hypothesis-driven laboratory analysis of real Flint waters, (4) a statistical data validation exercise, (5) an introduction to software-based chemical equilibrium modeling, and (6) multiple modes of scientific translation to nonscientists. Specific analytical chemistry concepts covered in the case study included systematic treatment of multiple equilibria, activity, solubility, and Pourbaix diagrams. Students were also exposed to a variety of wet-chemical and instrumental analysis techniques. Student-collected data were vetted and validated through guided statistical and error analysis, and later constructed into a software-based chemical equilibrium model. Finally, students synthesized and translated these multiple knowledge forms into a communication medium accessible by both the Flint community and the Karegnondi Water Authority. By framing the chemistry in a real-world setting, the case study exemplified both the challenge and importance of chemical measurement and error analysis in scientific translation and communication to real people. Student survey data indicated that the interdisciplinary nature of the case helped students emotionalize and humanize the abstract chemical content. Overall, the case elicited strong positive feedback from student participants in three pilot versions of the case study to date.

AB  - Statistics and data science are especially collaborative disciplines that typically require practitioners to interact with many different people or groups. Consequently, interdisciplinary collaboration skills are part of the personal and professional skills essential for success as an applied statistician or data scientist. These skills are learnable and teachable, and learning and improving collaboration skills provides a way to enhance one's practice of statistics and data science. To help individuals learn these skills and organizations to teach them, we have developed a framework covering five essential components of statistical collaboration: Attitude, Structure, Content, Communication, and Relationship. We call this the ASCCR Frame. This framework can be incorporated into formal training programs in the classroom or on the job and can also be used by individuals through self-study. We show how this framework can be applied specifically to statisticians and data scientists to improve their collaboration skills and their interdisciplinary impact. We believe that the ASCCR Frame can help organize and stimulate research and teaching in interdisciplinary collaboration and call on individuals and organizations to begin generating evidence regarding its effectiveness.

AB  - Enterprise education is a policy-driven, cross-curricular phenomenon on many Western countries' educational agendas. The expectation is that it will be implemented in different school subjects, but bridging enterprise education and different school subjects has proven to be a challenge. This article explores whether and how open-ended investigations in science education in secondary schools can be viewed as a form of enterprise education. We identify several points of contact, illuminating the premises on which enterprise education can be integrated into science education. Thus, the results contribute to the under-researched field of bridging enterprise education with school subjects in secondary education.

AB  - Bibliometric reviews of research have gained increased popularity since the mid-2010s. Yet, many readers may be uncertain as to the purpose and method of bibliometric reviews. This article provides an introduction to bibliometric reviews, clarifies their purpose, and elaborates on methods of data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The latter half of the article is devoted to an illustrative, state-of-the-science, bibliometric review of research on problem-based learning (PBL). In this illustrative review, the author applied descriptive statistics, citation analysis, and co-citation analysis to a database of 5,764 Scopus-indexed documents on problem-based learning published between 2017 and 2022. The analyses found increasing diversity of the PBL knowledge base with respect to geographical sources, subject area origins, and focus of the research compared with findings reported in past reviews. Author co-citation analysis visualized the intellectual structure of the recent PBL literature revealing four dominant schools of thought: Interdisciplinary PBL Theory and Practice, Active Learning, Social and Experiential Learning, and PBL Process. The findings highlight the continuing growth and spread of PBL, as well as a trend of integration with other methods of experiential and active learning.

AB  - Collaboration has the potential to strengthen both professional learning and well-being for teachers. However, it can also bring problematic aspects, such as increased workload and conflicts. The purpose of this study was to explore biology teachers' experiences of collaboration to better understand how upper secondary school organisations can support teachers to obtain valuable collaborations. By analysing accounts of biology teachers' experiences of collaborations perceived as valued and less valued, I investigate how benefits and difficulties of the collaborations relate to organisational and situational conditions. Benefits and difficulties in different types of collaborations associated with high and low perceived value from collaborations can help identify ways to lower the cost and increase the gain for teachers in collaborations. The results showed that the chosen valued collaborations were often initiated by the teachers and typically involved benefits relating to both teacher "and" student learning. In the less valued collaborations, benefits were narrower, impacting teachers "or" students. The importance of structure was emphasised in most collaborations but management support appeared more important in interdisciplinary collaborations involving more than three teachers, while personal affinity between collaborators appeared more important in collaborations involving two or three teachers. Continuity was emphasised in order to give time for consensus and structure to develop, or to sustain discussions on important issues. Overall, this study shows that while continuity appeared important for developing valued collaborations, it can be difficult to obtain. Focusing on biology teachers' experiences of benefits and difficulties in relation to more or less valued collaborations can help school organisations prioritise support, time and resources for professional development to allow for continuity in valuable collaborations that can strengthen the quality of biology education.

AB  - While cheminformatics skills necessary for dealing with an ever-increasing amount of chemical information are considered important for students pursuing STEM careers in the age of big data, many schools do not offer a cheminformatics course or alternative training opportunities. This paper presents the Cheminformatics Online Chemistry Course (OLCC), which is organized and run by the Committee on Computers in Chemical Education (CCCE) of the American Chemical Society (ACS)'s Division of Chemical Education (CHED). The Cheminformatics OLCC is a highly collaborative teaching project involving instructors at multiple schools who teamed up with external chemical information experts recruited across sectors, including government and industry. From 2015 to 2019, three Cheminformatics OLCCs were offered. In each program, the instructors at participating schools would meet face-to-face with the students of a class, while external content experts engaged through online discussions across campuses with both the instructors and students. All the material created in the course has been made available at the open education repositories of LibreTexts and CCCE Web sites for other institutions to adapt to their future needs.

AB  - Systems biology is frequently taught with an emphasis on mathematical modeling approaches. This focus effectively excludes most biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology students, who are not mathematics majors. The mathematical focus can also present a misleading picture of systems biology, which is a multi-disciplinary pursuit requiring collaboration between biochemists, bioinformaticians, and mathematicians. This article describes an authentic large-scale undergraduate research experience (ALURE) in systems biology that incorporates proteomics, bacterial genomics, and bioinformatics in the one exercise. This project is designed to engage students who have a basic grounding in protein chemistry and metabolism and no mathematical modeling skills. The pedagogy around the research experience is designed to help students attack complex datasets and use their emergent metabolic knowledge to make meaning from large amounts of raw data. On completing the ALURE, participants reported a significant increase in their confidence around analyzing large datasets, while the majority of the cohort reported good or great gains in a variety of skills including "analysing data for patterns" and "conducting database or internet searches." An environmental scan shows that this ALURE is the only undergraduate-level system-biology research project offered on a large-scale in Australia; this speaks to the perceived difficulty of implementing such an opportunity for students. We argue however, that based on the student feedback, allowing undergraduate students to complete a systems-biology project is both feasible and desirable, even if the students are not maths and computing majors.

AB  - Background: A faculty development program was implemented over four years at a 4-year regional comprehensive university and two partnering community colleges. This project was focused on improving student learning in introductory Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) courses at each institution, by helping faculty adopt inclusive, student-centered pedagogies. Survey data were combined with data from classroom videos, faculty interviews, and student questionnaires collected during the first two years of the project to give insight into how faculty initially implemented the theory and strategies they learned and how the students perceived instruction from participating faculty. Results: These data sources were combined to generate four overall themes to characterize our project and guide future projects. These are: (1) implementation of student-centered learning took a variety of forms; (2) quality implementation of student-centered teaching practices lagged behind understanding of the theory behind those practices; (3) the most robust perceived barriers to implementation of student-centered teaching stayed constant, while more moderate barriers were ranked differently from year 1 to year 2; and (4) faculty perceptions of student-centered learning practices were not always the same as students' perceptions. These themes build from the extant faculty development literature in that they are drawn from the unique context of a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional project, and that they represent an "on the ground" perspective from case studies combined with "big picture" findings from surveys. Conclusions: This paper describes the faculty development project, as well as our collection and interpretation of data from surveys and case studies, to ultimately develop the four themes. Recommendations deriving from these themes are also described. These include modeling a variety of pedagogies; adopting realistic expectations for faculty change; institutionalizing faculty development so it can take place over multiple years; being transparent with faculty about known barriers and aligning supports with those barriers; and helping faculty develop strategies for transparency with students about student-centered pedagogies.

Our research model was based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and the data were analyzed by partial least squares-structural equation modeling. The present study aims to identify factors that play an important role in students' ability to integrate STEM knowledge and skills. Results: Data were collected from participants who had won awards in local contests and represented their regions in a national technology competition. The reliability and validity of our instrument, the Students' STEM Integration Scale, were verified. The findings demonstrated that students' intentions to integrate STEM knowledge and skills to solve complex problems can be predicted by their attitude and perceived behavioral control. Conclusions: This work highlights factors which are associated with students' intentions to integrate interdisciplinary knowledge and skills, and serves as a reference for research on the gap between intentions and actual behavior. The findings could help teachers and instructors design STEM-based activities to enhance students' attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and intentions, to improve their ability to integrate STEM knowledge and skills.

AB  - In this article, we argue that engagement with authentic science is a means to mediate trust and motivation in those who are learning about climate change. To illustrate the argument, we provide a curricular example that focuses on authentic climate science data. We conclude with an example of how researchers from multiple disciplines can use model-based reasoning to collaboratively design educational experiences.

AB  - Transdisciplinary research (TR) is a growing field in a myriad of subject domains ranging from sustainability to education. The idea is to solve complex problems through the collaborative participation of academic actors, community stakeholders, governments, and other leaders to jointly define the problem and find solutions. To accomplish such complex projects, one of the main tools is an efficient technology platform. The need for an efficient technology platform, in turn, leads to a need for an evaluation tool to determine which is the most suitable for a given transdisciplinary research situation, however, a literature review confirms that research on such evaluation tools is scarce. The goal of this paper is to improve the evaluation of technology platforms for individual TR projects, based on the characteristics of that specific TR. The research question is "Can TR characteristics be used to construct an evaluation tool for technology platforms?" The specific aims used to answer the question were: the following: (1) to define the characteristics (core activities and skills) of TR and (2) to construct a tool for evaluating technology platforms for use in TR. Methodology: For the first specific aim, a literature meta-analysis was used; the second specific aim was addressed following a newly developed methodology, including elements of the technology acceptance model and elements of a standard technology evaluation process. Results: A chart for defining the core activities and skills in TR was developed, and a tool was constructed for evaluating technology platforms that could be used in TR.

AB  - Purpose: Distance learners are expected to actively participate in online learning settings to improve their cognitive level and promote more meaningful learning. However, without specific teaching skills and competencies from the instructors together with belief and capability of the distance learners themselves, their engagement in online learning would not be achieved. Limited studies have examined the extent of self-efficacy in encouraging student engagement in learning, especially within online learning settings. Thus, this study examined self-efficacy as a moderator to test its influence on the relationship between online teaching competencies and student engagement. Methodology: This quantitative research was conducted using the purposive sampling technique. This study involved 321 distance learners from a Malaysian public university. The questionnaire was created using SurveyMonkey, and the measurement items were adopted from past research with acceptable reliability. This study utilised partial least squares (PLS) 3.0 to test the hypothesis via correlation and path analysis. Findings: Contrary to expectations, the findings contributed to the literature that online teaching competencies and self-efficacy were not significantly related to student engagement. The association between online teaching competencies and student engagement was shown to be moderated by self-efficacy. This finding is aligned with Bandura's (2001) social cognitive theory which states that personal factors such as self-regulation, self-efficacy, and interest are impacted in the distance education context. Significance: The results of this study can benefit online course instructors in Malaysian distance educational institutions to develop courses that enhance online learners' self-efficacy. Online teaching competencies employed by online distance learners can be the primary objective when developing faculty development programmes that aim to coach online instructors to be competent in online teaching. Moreover, institutions are encouraged to introduce other online learning platforms to facilitate training of its practitioners in order to accelerate successful online teaching and learning experiences.

AB  - Educators (Higher education teachers) play a significant role in equipping future professionals and contributing to societal progress. They are responsible for preparing competent citizens who serve various societal roles. Hence, examining educators' perceptions regarding professional development and technological proficiency is crucial. This study examines educators' perceptions of professional development and technological proficiency in Ethiopian higher education institutions, focusing on curriculum content, interdisciplinary integration, and aligning theory with practice. The impetus for this study is the growing necessity for educators to possess technological proficiency to meet global educational standards and the demand for innovative teacher education programs. It addresses Educators' perceptions of (1) Their technological proficiency, (2) The relevance and interdisciplinary integration of teacher education curricula, (3) The alignment of theoretical and practical curriculum components, and (4) The integration of technological training in teacher development programs. A structured questionnaire was utilized to collect data from instructors across various university categories. The analysis employed descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and post hoc tests. The findings indicate that educators perceive their technological proficiency as moderate (M = 3.0, SD = 0.66) and regard curriculum relevance and interdisciplinary integration as slightly above average (M = 3.1, SD = 0.64). Research universities demonstrate consistently higher scores across all variables, including technological training and curriculum alignment, than comprehensive and applied universities. Technological training integration and the alignment of theoretical and practical elements were identified as areas requiring improvement (M=2.8, SD=0.58; M=2.9, SD=0.67). Significant differences in perceptions were observed based on university type, qualifications, and experience, with research universities exhibiting the highest levels of perceived innovation and technological adoption. The study highlights gaps in technological training and curriculum alignment in Ethiopian higher education, urging strategic policies and resources to improve teacher education programs. By Emphasizing the importance of integrating theory and practice and fostering technological proficiency, the study calls for collaborative efforts to tackle the educational challenges of the 21st century.

AB  - Making and tinkering is currently gaining traction as an interdisciplinary approach to education. However, little is known about how these activities and explorations in formal and informal learning spaces address the content and skills common to professionals across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. As such, the purpose of this qualitative study was to examine how youth were engaged in the eight science and engineering practices outlined within the US Next Generation Science Standards within an informal learning environment utilizing principles of tinkering within the daily activities. Findings highlight how youth and facilitators engaged and enacted in practices common to scientists and engineers. Yet, in this study, enactment of these practices "looked" differently than might be expected in a formal learning environment such as a laboratory setting. For example, in this setting, students were observed carrying out trials on their design as opposed to carrying out a formal scientific investigation. Results also highlight instances of doing science and engineering not explicitly stated within parameters of formal education documents in the USA, such as experiences with failure.

AB  - With STEM education garnering an increasing share of educational budgets and press, humanities teachers should consider how to respond to the growing power of math and science. Should humanists read the writing on the wall and tether themselves to the economic engine of STEM? Or should humanists separate themselves, retreating securely into their own disciplinary homes? Middle ground options, including critique of and partnership with STEM, are available as well. This article lays out five postures or approaches that humanists should weigh as they consider how to proceed. Drawing from various case studies, including medical humanities, digital humanities, and innovative interdisciplinary curricula, the article fleshes out the advantages and limitations of each approach.

AB  - Defining what is meant by 'life' seems, on the face of it, straightforward. But, as this article explores, once you delve below the surface you find that providing a definition that everyone agrees upon is nearly impossible. By first considering how biologists and philosophers of science debate the issue of defining life, the article then goes onto explore the implications of this for the biology classroom. Finally, the debate is widened to include the 'meaning of life', suggesting that a cross-curricular approach to addressing questions of this type is a powerful approach for students to work with.

AB  - Interprofessional anatomy dissection (IAD) courses increase students' readiness for interprofessional education (IPE) both in-person and online. During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual environments for anatomy learning were perceived as less effective. Hybrid instruction approaches emerged but have been scarcely evaluated. This study assessed students' experiences with a hybrid IAD course's virtual and in-person components. A hybrid IAD course consisting of virtual and in-person anatomy laboratory-based instruction was offered to 32 students from different health sciences programs. Before and after the full course, students completed the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) and the Interdisciplinary Education Perception Scale (IEPS). After the virtual and the in-person course components, students completed a Q-methodology survey to assess their perceptions of the course. Twenty-eight students (20 females; 24.8 ± 6.3 years old) from different programs (4 Physician Assistant; 2 Midwifery; 3 Speech-Language Pathology; 4 Physiotherapy; 3 Occupational therapy; 4 Nursing; 8 Medicine) participated. The total RIPLS score improved after the 8-week course (Median 84 interquartile range [78-87] vs. 87 [8-90]; p = 0.0145). The Q-methodology identified three factors: IPE & Virtual Enthusiasts, Introspective Learners, and IPE & Virtual Skeptics. Factors represented different levels of students' engagement with the IPE and virtual environment. The transition to in-person resulted in all factors praising the experience. Health science students showed improvements in their readiness for IPE after an 8-week hybrid IAD course. The main differences in the evaluations of the virtual and in-person components were related to engagement and the ability to learn anatomy; no differences were noted between settings regarding engagement in IPE.

AB  - The field of digital forensics requires a multidisciplinary understanding of a range of diverse subjects, but is interdisciplinary (in using principles, techniques and theories from other disciplines) encompassing both computer and forensic science. This requires that practitioners have a deep technical knowledge and understanding, but that they are also able to explain the underlying theory that supports their analytical conclusions. It is therefore essential that students develop effective communication skills, and the ability to articulate their knowledge and understanding of complex technical concepts using words and terms that an individual without prior professional training would understand. Appreciating the importance of active collaborative learning, this paper examines the pedagogy and andragogy of the application of peer learning and teaching within the delivery of digital forensics, in order to improve technical knowledge and understanding and actively develop soft enabling attributes, while also enhancing the learning experience. It further examines the impact of the methodology, to identify the effectiveness of the approach in developing communication and articulation of knowledge, understanding and skills, but also the additional benefits in terms of improving confidence and self-esteem, and strategies designed to stimulate lifelong learning.

AB  - This article describes dance/STEAM-based educational workshops for 3rd and 4th graders at a local science museum led by the artistic director and members of a professional dance company and supported by a large university research community. The overarching pedagogical goal was to use dance to learn about science and science to learn about dance. The workshops were part of a large multimedia dance project inspired by human microbiome research. Mirroring the dance company's process, students explored various methods of embodied investigation. Using their whole bodies, they manipulated props to physicalize scientific concepts such as homeostasis and symbiosis. Microbes, viewed on video, led to students creating microbe-inspired movement phrases. Community skill building, discussion, and concepts from science and Laban Movement Analysis were woven throughout. Culminating "microbe performances" for teachers and facilitators allowed students to assimilate and celebrate their new holistic knowledge and to make meaning by integrating dance and science.

AB  - The National Science Education Standards have highlighted the importance of active learning and reflection for contemporary scientific methods in K-12 classrooms, including the use of models. Computer modeling and visualization are tools that researchers employ in their scientific inquiry process, and often computer models are used in collaborative projects across disciplines. The goal of this project was to develop and field-test a module that used a computer model to teach marine sciences content in an applied, inquiry-based, and collaborative manner. Students used an estuarine transport model to explore the question of how circulation patterns affect planktonic organisms, demonstrating the interdisciplinary interaction of physics and biology. Our experience suggests that computer models, when used for inquiry, can help foster students' understanding of the nature of science and critical-thinking skills.

AB  - Background: Many disciplines use outdoor fieldwork (OFW) as an experiential learning method in higher education. Although there has been an increase in research into the pedagogical approaches of OFW, the use of OFW is contested. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to synthesize the OFW literature across a range of disciplines to identify common strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) and outline implications for how OFW is used as an experiential learning pedagogy in higher education. Methodology/Approach: A descriptive literature review was undertaken to examine each aspect of the SWOT at the micro, meso, and macro levels, drawing from disciplines using OFW including biology, outdoor and environmental education, archaeology, and the associated geosciences. Findings/Conclusions: Strengths of OFW include engagement, outreach, and professional competencies; weaknesses exist in the areas of equity, logistics, and standards. Opportunities include improving pedagogical practices, diversity, and collaboration, while threats to OFW were costs, funding, outdated practices, and governance. Implications: Academics from a range of disciplines using OFW have similar experiences; therefore, exploring ways to collaborate or learn from each other will further develop OFW as an experiential learning strategy in higher education.

AB  - The world demands individuals with knowledge and skills in agriculture, food, and natural resources (AFNR) paired with proficiency in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) concepts. Current models for STEM education call for interdisciplinary approaches in which learners address real-world challenges, indicating high potential for collaboration with researchers and practitioners in AFNR. The purpose of this study was to articulate the state of the 2010-2017 literature for STEM in AFNR education to inform future research, innovations in practice, and interdisciplinary collaborations. Using a systematic review approach and qualitative analysis techniques, 52 peer-reviewed STEM in AFNR education articles were analyzed for general characteristics, instructional approaches, STEM subjects, relationship between STEM subjects, relationship between STEM and AFNR, justifications, foci, and operationalization of STEM in research. Within each category, we identified themes that resulted in a summary of STEM in AFNR education in which future research and practice could align. Results indicated STEM in AFNR serves a range of populations, science and math are well represented, engineering is poorly represented, and mechanisms through which STEM learning occurs are often inadequately described. We recommend a collaborative and interdisciplinary future for STEM and AFNR education because both communities are pursuing common aims.

AB  - This study aims to investigate students' awareness of the level, causes and negative effects of noise in schools through the utilization of creative drama activities. The objective of this sample application is to contribute to the development of a more tranquil and peaceful school environment. A single case study design was employed for this research, with the study group comprising 16 fourth-grade students from a primary school. Student interviews served as the primary data collection tool, supplemented by observations and video recordings. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze the data, resulting in the identification of four main themes related to noise awareness: "lack of tranquility," "noise phenomenon," "conflict exacerbation," and "creative ideas". By incorporating the Visual Arts and Science curriculum, students demonstrated important life skills such as innovative thinking, effective communication, and analytical reasoning. Additionally, this interdisciplinary approach allowed for the attainment of learning objectives within the Science curriculum's sound unit, while also addressing the "Visual Communication and Formation" domain of the Art curriculum.

AB  - Background: Interprofessional Education (IPE), provides an integrative and rewarding learning platform for different healthcare professions to engage with each other in a cooperative basis to ultimately improve healthcare services for patients. Throughout the years, IPE has established itself as an indispensible tool in cultivating the necessary skills, mindset, and understanding to enhance interprofessional collaboration among healthcare providers. That being said, as with many other educational approaches, the success of IPE hinges on the readiness of healthcare professions students to learn and apply the concept; and yet, despite having been readily explored in numerous Western institutions, such readiness among healthcare students in Asian universities remains largely unknown. Methods: We measured attitudes related to interprofessional education & collaboration using a questionnaire called Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS). A total of 158 students from three faculties of health sciences at Asia Metropolitan University participated in this study. Cumulative result, as well as results from individual faculties were analyzed using Descriptive and non-parametric statistics. Results: Medical students overall, reported a higher rating for the perceived benefits of working together to solve patient problems compared to other students from other health sciences faculties. They are more receptive to working with other students from different healthcare professions in small-team projects and also seem to value the importance of mutual learning when dealing with patients' problems. On the other hand, nursing students were more uncertain of how they will fit into a cross-disciplinary team in a professional capacity and felt the need to acquire much more knowledge and skills when compared to students from other health sciences faculties. The total RIPLS score among all three faculties of health sciences at Asia Metropolitan University was in the high range. Conclusion: Students from three faculties of health sciences offered at Asia Metropolitan University namely Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Healthcare Management, and Faculty of Nursing, were deemed IPE ready. Recommendations: The university needs to consider how to integrate IPE into the curricula, define learning outcomes and/or competencies, develop and utilize the 4-dimensional curriculum development blueprint in line with health professional accreditation standards to promote collaboration and competence among all students, whereby upon graduation, they as healthcare professionals, will in turn, optimize health services, strengthen health systems, and improve health outcomes.

AB  - Today, the essential skills and characteristics of individuals change within the frame of changing needs. The acquisition of these skills to individuals is not sufficient with traditional education and difficulties are experienced in adapting to the age. While gaining 21st century skills, conducting interdisciplinary studies is becoming importance and increasing the efficiency. In this study, the effect of LEGO WeDo 2.0 robotics education on academic achievement, attitude and computational thinking skills of the learners toward science was examined. The study was conducted with 5th grade students (N=36) in a private school in Elazig in the 2017-2018 school year. The study model was the "pretest-posttest control group design" of the experimental method. As data collection tool, "Science Course Academic Achievement Test", "Science Course Attitude Scale", and "Computational Thinking Scale" were used in the study. While the activities in the experimental group were carried out with LEGO WeDo 2.0 Robotic Education Set, the same activities in the control group were implemented using the traditional direct instruction technique as in the curriculum. The application was continued for eleven weeks and the obtained quantitative data were evaluated at the significance level of 0.05 with SPSS packaged software. It was seen as a result of the study that attitudes, academic achievements and computational thinking skills of the experimental group students, who received robotic-assisted science education, toward science course differed significantly compared to the students in the control group.

AB  - In French nursery schools ("l'école maternelle française"), primary school teachers take charge of the content organised into teaching areas of activities. The prescribed teaching activity "Discovering the world of life sciences, objects and material" refers to biology, physical sciences, chemistry and technology. The children's learning path concerning these worlds represents the early stages of the curriculum. Many research studied these children's learning (e.g. Bisault, 2005; Fleer, 1996; Ravanis & al., 2013). This paper focuses on teachers and aims at describing and analysing the implementation of the practices of this early childhood education. In a curriculum perspective (Dillon, 2009; Martinand, 2003; Ross, 2000), an inquiry about the practices reported both in teachers' logs and questionnaires, reveals the contents, activities and issues associated with these educational experiences. The results show biology is privileged and preferred to technology by the teachers. The research indicates an interrelated scientific and technological curriculum and a science and technology mostly found, in what I called, "compositional schemes". The discovery of this world, through these compositional schemes, takes various positions according to the priorities assigned by the teachers. The research at last allows me to discuss the professional training of preschool teachers in order to improve the teaching practices in science and technology.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to understand master's students' experiences of service-learning, following their participation in a workshop with local social innovators whose activities had contributed to combating poverty in East Africa and to determine how this participation affected work on the students' theses. The authors also explored possible gender differences in this context. Design/methodology/approach: The study was based on pretest-posttest mixed methods research design. Data were collected from master's students within the social sciences and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, respectively, in Kenya and Uganda, via surveys and interviews before the workshop, immediately afterwards and six months later. Findings: Students' immediate experience was that the workshop contributed to increased critical awareness, adoption of transdisciplinary community-serving approaches and strengthened self-confidence. Six months later, most had related their projects to social problems (e.g. poverty) in their communities. Moreover, the results motivated integration of gender-sensitive curricula based on service-learning in East Africa. Practical implications: Based on the results, the authors suggest a framework for gender-sensitive curriculum development that can stimulate service-learning in master's students. Implementation of such a curriculum could eventually contribute to community development, including, e.g. poverty reduction. Originality/value: Studies on service-learning are rare in Africa, especially in postgraduate education. Gender-sensitive studies on service-learning are generally scarce and the same holds for studies on encouraging STEM students to integrate social innovation into their thesis work. By combining these aspects, this study presents an original contribution to existing research.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has become the basic foothold of STEAM education. The role of teachers as an essential element of CT education cannot be ignored. Therefore, measuring teachers' ability to integrate CT into classroom is necessary. There were two sub-studies in this study, the one was to develop a specialized scale for the evaluation of teachers' CT skills. The other was to take K-12 STEAM teachers as sample to measure their CT levels and analyze the impact of the influential factors of personal attributes, occupational attributes, and environmental support on teachers' CT skills. The results showed that the Computational Thinking Scale for Teachers (TCTS) has good reliability and validity. The CT skills of 925 STEAM teachers from China were at an upper-middle level. Further analysis revealed significant differences in teachers' CT skills in terms of gender, age, teaching experience, grade, subjects, and nature of school. Firstly, by contrast, male teachers' CT skills were slightly higher than female teachers'; 30-40-year-old teachers possessed the highest level of CT skills; Second, the longer the teaching experience, the higher the teachers' CT skills; primary school teachers' CT skills were higher than those of middle school and high school teachers; Interdisciplinary comprehensive courses and teaching methods may be more conducive to the improvement of teachers' CT skills, which acted elementary science teachers' CT skills were higher than those of teachers of other subjects. Third, the nature of the school also affected the CT skills of STEAM teachers. The CT of teachers in private schools was higher than those in public schools. Therefore, the regional differences and educational equity in teacher' CT training should also be concerned. Concerning the questions, this study carried out an in-depth discussion and put forward inspiration and suggestions. The research findings revealed the mechanism that affects teachers' CT skills and provided meaningful evidence support for the training and evaluation of K-12 STEAM in-service teachers.

AB  - Purpose: The importance of sustainability in architecture currently necessitates the integration of innovative teaching strategies on the subject into architecture programs. This study aims to introduce and examine peer learning pedagogy by peer tutoring to educate architecture students in sustainable design. Design/methodology/approach: Based on class assignments proposed in two different architecture sustainability-focused courses in the second and fourth years of the Bachelor of Science in architecture program, a total of 103 students assessed the proposed peer learning experience and its impact on their sustainability mindsets and education. Subjective surveys for evaluating the peer learning experience were designed and delivered at different stages of the course sequences. A total of 502 survey responses were obtained in the study. Findings: The qualitative and quantitative data analysis confirms that the proposed peer learning by peer tutoring increased students' knowledge, motivation and commitment to sustainable design. In addition, participants became more confident in applying sustainable design skills and their academic grades improved more than 25% compared to previous courses using traditional teaching methods. Originality/value: Traditional architecture education has long been criticized for their pedagogical methodologies based primarily on passive learning. Recently, these programs have begun to prepare students to become active learners and communicators in collaborative and multidisciplinary environments. A mixed-method approach of combining pre-/post-experience surveys and analysis of final grades was used to determine the level of success and the quantifiable behavior change delivered by students involved in this peer learning experience.

AB  - In 2003, Holmes [The Statistician 52, Part 4, (2003), 439-474] reviewed 50 years of teaching statistics in English schools and drew out many lessons for more effective teaching. We consider the current relevance of several of these lessons and whether we have learned from them. Many national reports have been published about teaching statistics with few of their recommendations being implemented. There have been rapid developments in the methodology of, and technology used by, statistics at all levels "outside" schools. These have led to the accelerated development of the use of statistics and related disciplines such as data science (DS). "In" schools, we have not seen as much progress in teaching, learning, assessing, or communicating these subjects. We consider reasons for lack of progress in pedagogy and make our own recommendations to get schools to catch up with the exciting developments in the practice and communication of statistics and DS.

AB  - In most middle schools, learning is segregated by discipline. Yet interdisciplinary approaches have been shown to cultivate creative thinking, support problem solving, and develop interest while supporting knowledge gains (NAE & NRC in STEM Integration in K-12 Education: Status, Prospects, and an Agenda for Research. National Academies Press, Washington, 2014). The Designing Biomimetic Robots project emphasizes problem-based learning to integrate engineering, science, and computational thinking (CT). During a 3 to 4-week unit, students study the natural world to learn how animals accomplish different tasks, then design a robot inspired by what they learned. The project engages students in science, engineering, and CT practices. Over the course of a 3-year project, we used a design-based research approach to: (1) identify and describe strategies and challenges that emerge from integrated curriculum design, (2) explicate how a balance of integrated disciplines can provide opportunities for student participation in science, engineering, and CT practices, and (3) explore how a technology design task can support students' participation in integrated learning. Data from three focal groups (one from each year of the project) suggest that a focused design task, supported by explicit and targeted supports for science, CT, and engineering practices, led to a student technology design process that was driven by disciplinary understanding. This work highlights the importance of drawing out and prioritizing alignments between disciplines (Barber in Educ Des, 2(8), 2015), to enable integrated learning. Additionally, this work demonstrates how a technology design task can support student learning across disciplines, and how engaging in CT practices can further help students draw these connections.

AB  - Aviation is an interdisciplinary subject that has influenced human development over the last century. Learning about aviation exposes students to principles of flight, language, earth science, aeronautical engineering, flight training and airmanship. In K-12 education, educators have started to encourage children to learn science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects via aviation-themed activities to develop future scientists and engineers. This study investigated upper primary students' motivations to learn STEM via engaging in flight simulation experiences. The sample consisted of 345 10- to 13-year-old Hong Kong students from 8 primary schools. A modified version of the 31-item Science Motivation Questionnaire II (SMQ II) with four subscales with a focus on aviation was used. The relationships between intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, self-efficacy and peer support across gender and performance were examined. The data obtained were analysed using factor analysis and a regression model. According to our model, students are most strongly motivated by peer support, followed by intrinsic motivation, and they are least motivated by self-efficacy. As expected, our results indicate that a gender gap exists in aviation-themed STEM learning. These findings can help educators to better understand students' perceptions of aviation science and further develop related learning activities.

AB  - This paper describes analyses of the K-12 computational thinking (CT) integration activities collected at two NSF-funded workshops, "Developing an Interdisciplinary Framework for Integrating Computational Thinking in K-12 Science, Mathematics, Technology, and Engineering Education," held in August and November of 2017 at Education Development Center, Inc., in Waltham, Massachusetts. The workshops convened a working group of principal investigators, researchers, and educators from the National Science Foundation (NSF) ITEST (Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers) and STEM + C (STEM + Computing) funded projects to draft an interdisciplinary framework for integrating CT into K-12 education. The goal of this paper is to share that framework and our findings on promising learning progressions, gaps that exist in the collected set of activities, specific advances in STEM fields that were made possible through CT, and suggested ways that CT integration in K-12 can evolve to reach what the CT integration framework proposes as five "computational thinking integration elements" or "CTIEs". This framework is designed to help educators see ways to engage students in CT within disciplinary learning. The analyses and findings may benefit STEM and computing education fields by elucidating the target of CT as used within CT-integrated STEM fields.

AB  - The ACRL Framework for Information Literacy presents opportunities for moving beyond 'one-shot' information literacy sessions and creating a more scaffolded and embedded approach for instruction. We collaborated with faculty at [institution name] to create Framework-inspired information literacy learning objectives for first-year and third-year science undergraduates and are continuously refining the objectives as the curriculum continues to evolve. This article describes our learning objective design and refinement process, challenges encountered, and ideas on how to create opportunities for embedding information literacy into a curriculum. We also share our full activity lesson plans and assessment tool.

AB  - In this article, we describe a multi-year writing intervention in a highenrollment professional pharmacy course, implemented by a multidisciplinary team of pharmacy and writing instructors. Built around one capstone writing assignment, the "drug information question" paper, the intervention was designed to specifically improve students' writing and health science reasoning skills and their overall scores in the course, since historically students scored low on this assignment. We provide a background of our pharmacy program and an overview of writing in pharmacy, describe the history of the intervention and collaboration between pharmacy and writing faculty, and explain the design and principles of the intervention, the results, and the implications of the study for STEM writing pedagogy. Over the course of four years, starting with a peer-review model, we have gradually added lectures, workshops, and optional and mandatory Writing Center sessions in an effort to improve students' learning and health science reasoning skills. Over the same period of time, student scores on their written capstone in the course improved significantly, and survey results indicated that the students viewed the peer review process and the writing program interventions favorably.

AB  - Recent calls for reform in K-12 science education and the National Academy of Engineering's Grand Challenges for Engineering in the 21st Century emphasize improving science teaching, students' engagement, and learning. In this study, we designed and implemented a curriculum unit for sixth-grade students (i = 1305). The curriculum unit integrated science and engineering content and practices to teach ecology, water pollution, and engineering design. We investigated the designed integrated STEM unit's effectiveness in students' science learning outcomes on pre-, post-, and delayed post-assessments. We collected pre-and post-assessment data of students' science learning outcomes for both the baseline group (taught via existing district-adopted curriculum) and an intervention group (taught with integrated life science and engineering curriculum). We used a quasi-experimental research design and examined differences between baseline and intervention groups. We used ANCOVA to explore differences in students' learning in baseline and intervention groups. Furthermore, for students in the intervention group, we conducted repeated-measures ANOVA to investigate knowledge retention. Our analyses also accounted for students' gender and People of Color (POC) status. We conducted multiple regression analyses to explore the relationship between students' gender, POC status, and their learning outcomes. The results indicated that the intervention group students performed significantly better than the students in the baseline group. The repeated measures ANOVA showed that students in the intervention group retained science knowledge after 8 weeks of instruction. Finally, the regression analysis for the baseline group showed that gender and POC status were not significant predictors of their post-assessment scores. However, POC status was a significant predictor of post-assessment scores and knowledge retention for the intervention group. Overall, this study provides valuable findings on how an integrated STEM curriculum designed with engineering design and practices improves students' science learning outcomes.

AB  - This interdisciplinary, conceptual analysis addresses the nature and benefits of artistic processes in learning and work. While recognizing various forms of artistry, the emphasis is on visual-spatial thinking. The benefits of this kind of thinking in academic and professional activities include the simplification of massively complex writing, improvement of psychological functioning, and the magnification of creative work in various professions, especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Visual-spatial thinking also is a strength that often helps twice-exceptional individuals overcome their learning difficulties. Several thinking and learning strategies are explored, including visual data animation, concept cartooning, visual metaphor, and musical translation of written material. Some ways that visual-spatial thinking can help overcome the problems generated by dogmatic school reform also are scrutinized.
