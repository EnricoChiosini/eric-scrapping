AB  - The use of innovative technologies in speech-language pathology is revolutionizing diagnostic and treatment approaches for individuals with communication disorders. This evolution has required educators to integrate the use of technologies into the clinical training pedagogy. Phonetic transcription is a foundational skill presented early in the undergraduate speech-pathology curriculum and serves as the basis for advanced course work in clinical diagnostic decision-making. Mastery requires regular practice and performance feedback. One factor that impedes the provision of more practice opportunities is the widely agreed-upon problem of grading phonetic transcription assignments by hand. The development of a computational tool that automatically grades transcription assignments served as the mechanism for an integrated learning opportunity between the departments of Communication Disorders and Computer Science and Software Engineering at Auburn University.

AB  - Museums promote co-learning through the construction of a social community, one that involves personal, physical, and sociocultural contexts. As researchers and museum educators, we report some of our contextual reflections and recommendations that emerged from our collaborative learning experience of conducting research in a medical science museum. Guided by an established 6P model of museum learning ("place," "purpose," "person," "people," "process," and "product"), we articulate our experiences and propose an additional P ("partnership") with eight steps--beginning with relationship building and culminating in dissemination to varied audiences. Using examples from our research of children and young adolescents' experience of a science and health-related museum program entitled "Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse," we identify principles, factors, and processes that contributed to the success of our museum-based research. By presenting the lessons we learned, we aim to help guide future research endeavors of others considering interdisciplinary museum research.

AB  - The rising demand for digital information resources and services in the LAM sector has sparked many innovations by educators in recent years, as we seek to prepare students for careers in an environment that has continued to witness rapid and hard-to-predict changes. Granting agencies such as IMLS have played an important role in driving innovation to meet the needs of new professionals, in part by funding curriculum development projects within LIS schools, but also by facilitating dialogues between educators and practitioners. This work traces a 10-year process whereby one LIS school has designed and tested new courses as well as a new Master's concentration geared to the needs of LAM professionals who will be expected to work intensively with digital technologies, workflows, and collections. Through a succession of projects, some with grant funding, the school has been able to engage practitioners on an ongoing basis, enabling it to build a substantial and regularly updated body of case-study data on LAM practices, which has informed course development efforts and which has enabled the school to meet its key objectives of delivering authentic learning experiences for students and to maintain an up-to-date curriculum in an evolving area of study within the LAM disciplines. It is hoped that both the experience and the results to date will help justify continued support for innovations in LAM education.

AB  - This paper presents the experience of an initiative, the EXPLORE courses, designed to bring science and technology closer to secondary school. The EXPLORE courses, organised by "EXPLORATORI: Natural Resources" project, are particularly addressed to secondary school teachers and are conducted at Catalonia (North East of Spain). The main objective is to provide secondary school teachers with the opportunity to explore the natural resources. Based on a combination of face-to-face and online learning, the programme of the courses uses an interdisciplinary approach, integrating Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and STEAM (STEM + art) fields. Data presented in this paper correspond to the 2012 and 2013 editions. The results, which were obtained from a written questionnaire completed by teacher participants of EXPLORE courses, indicate that more than 70% of secondary school teachers were encouraged to introduce some course contents on their teaching classes after participating in an EXPLORE course.

AB  - Just as steam was found to be a source of power during the Industrial Revolution, increasing factory production and improving transportation, today STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) can be found to be a framework that empowers teachers, increases student engagement, and improves student understanding. Although a limited number of designated "STEAM" schools as well as some "traditional" schools throughout the United States support a STEAM curriculum with modified school schedules and structures, the fact remains that STEAM connections can be integrated into any existing mathematics curriculum through the implementation of STEAM-related projects, lessons, and/ or activity-based problems. STEAM can be integrated into the classroom through lessons or activities that connect mathematical concepts to science, technology, engineering, and the arts. This article provides mathematics teachers with four different STEAM activities that can be used when teaching linear functions. These four activities connect mathematics to science, technology, engineering, and art.

AB  - The La Trobe University iteration of the Teaching Teachers for the Future (TTF) project focused initially on subject in the second semester, third year of the Bachelor of Education course called the Multi-Disciplinary Science & Technology Integrated Experience (MSTIE). Two pairs of pre-service teachers were placed in the school where the TTF ICT Pedagogy Officer (ICTPO) worked as an ICT specialist. The two teams worked with classroom teachers and the ICTPO to cooperatively plan, teach and evaluate a science curriculum project enhanced by strong ICT integration. The experience was a catalyst for significant educational insight, for the students involved, but also for other pre-service teachers and teachers from the school and university. In the second cycle of the project the ICTPO worked with academics from the university to draw on findings from the first cycle in order to design and implement integrated ICT initiatives in a first semester, second year Science curriculum subject. This structure means that students who will take MSTIE in their third year will have a strong foundation of Science ICT integration on which to base their MSTIE preparation and implementation.

AB  - At Humboldt State University (HSU), location is everything. Students are as drawn to our spectacular natural setting as they are to the unique majors in the natural resource sciences that the university has to offer. However, the isolation that nurtures the pristine natural beauty of the area presents a difficult reality for students who are accustomed to more densely populated environments. With the large majority of our incoming students coming from distant cities, we set out to cultivate a "home away from home" by connecting first-year students majoring in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) to the communities and local environment of Humboldt County. To achieve this, we designed first-year place-based learning communities (PBLCs) that integrate unique aspects and interdisciplinary themes of our location throughout multiple high impact practices, including a summer experience, blocked-enrolled courses, and a first-year experience course entitled "Science 100: Becoming a STEM Professional in the 21st Century." Native American culture, traditional ways of knowing, and contemporary issues faced by tribal communities are central features of our place-based curriculum because HSU is located on the ancestral land of the Wiyot people and the university services nine federally recognized American Indian tribes. Our intention is that by providing a cross-cultural, validating environment, students will: feel and be better supported in their academic pursuits; cultivate values of personal, professional and social responsibility; and increase the likelihood that they will complete their HSU degree. As we complete the fourth year of implementation, we aim to harness our experience and reflection to improve our programming and enable promising early results to be sustained.

AB  - Many opportunities for more integrated teaching that better capture the interdisciplinary nature of contemporary scholars' work and better achieve the aims of liberal arts education still remain untapped, particularly at smaller schools where combined departments are often necessary. The disciplinary boundaries between history and sociocultural anthropology have become increasingly blurred in recent decades, a trend reflected in scholarly work that engages with both fields, as well as dual-degree graduate programmes at top U.S. research universities. For many scholars, this interdisciplinarity makes sense, with the two disciplines offering critical theoretical tools and methods that must be used in combination to tackle effectively the questions they pursue. This article asks why this interdisciplinarity, so central to professional pursuits of both historians and anthropologists, is significantly less present in the undergraduate classroom. Housed in one of the only joint History and Anthropology departments in the U.S., we detail our own efforts to make the chance joining of our disciplines pedagogically meaningful.

AB  - Background: Science, technology, reading and writing, engineering, art, and mathematics (STREAM) education is an emerging form of STEM/STEAM education. STEM education research focuses on how students acquire knowledge and skills. The potential of reading and writing to effectively support students in STEM education has been the focus of research. Although researchers have noted the role of language, they have not explored it in depth. Purpose/Hypothesis: This paper presents a systematic review of STREAM education to clarify how reading/writing is integrated with STEM/STEAM education and explores the level of cognitive goals in instruction. Design/Method: By searching for articles related to STREAM education up to 2021, we coded some important features of STREAM education and highlighted the correlations between two or more features. Results: (i) STREAM education has developed rapidly in the past 3 years; (ii) Writing appeared in STEM education before reading, and the trend of research is spreading from college to lower school levels; (iii) The combination of reading and writing is better in primary school and is underemphasized in middle school; (iv) The cognitive goals of STREAM education in higher education are slightly higher overall than those before college; (v) Current studies focus on the reflection process of the course, while the main process deserves more attention; and (vi) reading/writing activities in the reflection process achieved the highest levels of cognition than in the entry and main processes. Conclusion: The integration of language activities (reading and writing) into STREAM education is a trend toward disciplinary integration, which helps develop students' cognition and form knowledge constructs.

AB  - In this article, we seek to apply Julie Thompson Klein's supple understanding of typology as both category-making and category-defying to one aspect of her own body of work: her participation in a range of organizations with permeable boundaries. Specifically, we review her contributions to theories of boundary work in interdisciplinary studies and then her applications of those theories to building new academic institutions and networks that mirror and support related goals. We concentrate on Klein's work as a proponent of Digital Humanities (DH) and, in particular, on Klein as a founding member and leader of a boundary-breaking, cross-institutional, and cross-disciplinary alliance, HASTAC (Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Alliance and Collaboratory: HASTAC.org), the world's first and oldest academic social network, a participatory, constantly evolving, user-driven online community that has grown to more than 17,000 network members.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to discuss issues related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. It is emphasized that the need to prepare students with twenty-first-century skills through STEM-related teaching is strong, especially at the elementary level. The authors present selected previous experiences, publications, research into the study topic, and review examples of primary school robotics and programming curricula, as well as associated educational activities. The authors stress that workshops, using kits to build and programme robots, are a modern form of interdisciplinary education of children and youth. Design/methodology/approach: The rationale for conducting such activities in schools is found in the European reference framework in the context of training of key competences. Classes in robotics--if properly taught--will have an impact on the development of mathematical literacy and scientific-technical information and social competences. At the same time, competence is understood to mean a combination of knowledge, skills and attitudes appropriate to the situation. Besides, an analysis is presented of basic legal regulations in this matter as well as results of a survey, conducted in Poland and Ukraine among in-service teachers and prospective teachers. Findings: The study was carried out with the participation of 91 primary school teachers and future teachers in the province of Silesia and at the University of Silesia in Poland, and in Ukraine, at Borys Grinchenko Kyiv University. The survey contained 15 questions about the pedagogical research "Robotics and children". The study was carried out to determine the needs of modern education to introduce the basics of robotics in the educational process of primary school. Originality/value: It can be expected that the findings from the prior Polish and Ukrainian surveys can be extrapolated into curricula for secondary schools and vocational education and training (VET) in the coming years.

AB  - In the current research study the use of Wikis as an online didactic tool to apply project-based learning in higher education was reported. The study was conducted in university teacher education programmes. During the online activities, participants developed interdisciplinary projects for the primary school working collaboratively in small groups in a Wiki virtual environment within the Moodle platform. Science was at the core of the projects and acted as an organising hub to finding links with other disciplines. A mixed-methods approach involving the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data was adopted in the current research study. The authors developed the following three instruments in order to measure both processes and outcomes of the online activities: the interdisciplinary project-based learning questionnaire, the reflection questionnaire and a rubric for assessing interdisciplinary projects. The current paper focuses only on the qualitative data, which were subjected to an inductive content analysis. Results provided evidence of the processes involved during the collaborative activities and that online activities can develop teachers' abilities to design projects in interdisciplinary contexts. The discussion highlights the aspects of the online environment that made the collaborative work effective in learning. Future implications and suggestions for teacher education programmes are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this paper was to better understand the current practice of arts therapy in educational institutions in the Czech Republic comparing it to that in health-care institutions and other working environments. The research goal was to analyze the prevalence of the different fields of arts therapy, the main difficulties of clients, the therapeutic forms, the ways of interdisciplinary cooperation, and the groups of therapists (according to their age and duration of practice). The data collected from the first national survey using "The Practice of Arts Therapies" questionnaire were analyzed with descriptive and inductive statistics (Chi-square test). The 142 respondents who participated in the study were contacted mainly through professional associations. The significant characteristics of arts therapies in educational environments are linked to the diffusion of the respective arts therapy fields (music therapy being the most prevalent), the main difficulties of pupils (learning difficulties/multiple disabilities or no obvious problems), and to the length of practice of the respondents. The results can be used for the creation of a research-based map of Czech arts therapies in educational institutions and for further development of this area.

AB  - In this personal essay, I explain how my use of visual modelling has the capacity to broaden constructionism in five important ways. (1) It introduces new techniques for students to describe and document, in a personal way, what they are actually doing in modelling. (2) It introduces the big ideas of mathematical modelling and computational thinking in a way that is far more inclusive than many other constructionist-oriented courses that are labelled as math, science or computer science. (3) It favours the modelling of student-selected objects in the physical world over the modelling of concepts and problems drawn more directly from traditional math and science. (4) It introduces the core ideas of design and colour theories in context. (5) It demonstrates the benefits of using narratives and personal journaling to explore the thought processes that help us make sense of the world.

AB  - Humanities researchers have expressed concern about the uncritical adoption of information visualization techniques originating in the sciences by digital humanities classrooms. This paper describes an approach to information visualization that encourages students to foreground humanistic concerns by adopting a narrative focus. This approach to visualization development brings interdisciplinary perspectives and techniques to bear on qualitative or quantitative information and constructs stories from those data. To illustrate student experiences, I describe four student projects completed in a graduate course on narrative information visualization. I focus on how this course enabled students to take diverse types of data and construct engaging interactive stories using a range of tools and methods, while continually reflecting critically on their evolving goals and design choices. I conclude by showing how this approach helps students connect humanistic values to information visualization techniques.

AB  - Background: The assessment of cross-curricular skills is gaining attention in many countries. In Japan, the 'Information Literacy Survey for Upper Secondary Students' (the ILSUS) was designed to measure information literacy through Computer-Based Testing (CBT). It was the first large-scale survey based on Item Response Theory (IRT) implemented by Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). Purpose: This paper reports on the history and development of the survey and discusses its findings. As 'information literacy' is a generic and cross-curricular ability, we measured cognitive ability relating to how information can be utilised for problem-solving. Main argument: We present some released survey items that were actually used in the ILSUS, to explain how the items covered three aspects of 'information literacy'. Using proficiency levels, we discuss what the findings indicated about the features of the students' 'information literacy': it was evident that, whilst many had the ability to deal with complex and large amounts of information, few were able to address unfamiliar contexts. Then, using questionnaire items from the ILSUS, we report how we determined that 'information literacy' was strongly associated with 'student-teacher relationships' and 'meta-cognition'. Conclusion: This account of the ILSUS offers insight into how we measured information literacy and, more widely, the kinds of skills that Japanese education policy is trying to develop. In planning a new Information Literacy Survey (ILS), we will try to capture what has not been clarified yet, such as the trends in information literacy and differences between educational stages. It may ultimately become possible to specify, more clearly, the goals and teaching methods that should be aimed at in the acquisition and teaching of information literacy.

AB  - Israel is one of many countries in which English is not the spoken language. In these countries, it is of the utmost importance for students to acquire literacy in English as a foreign language (EFL) to support their entry into higher education and enhance their social and business opportunities. However, many students do not acquire adequate literacy skills by the conclusion of their elementary school years. To obtain these skills, the curriculum as reflected in EFL textbooks must include extensive and accurate content related to the constructs of the English language. This study aimed to explore to what extent literacy instruction components, as defined by research, are incorporated into textbooks that are commonly used for teaching EFL in elementary schools in Israel according to teacher self-reports. The textbook examination was based on the research-based literacy components aligned with the Science of Reading for English as a first language and on additional EFL literacy instruction components. The findings indicate that textbooks inadequately cover theory-based instructional materials for each of the literacy components. The conclusions of this study can be used to raise awareness regarding how EFL literacy instruction in Israel may be improved by providing theory-based textbooks.

AB  - Teacher-made teaching and learning resources are an effective way to facilitate relevant and appropriate curriculum content, values and attitudes for students. This is particularly significant when the context is rather unique, as was the case in the remote developing Pacific Island Country of Nauru. Such resources can be deployed in accompaniment with carefully selected commercially available resources. This approach has been shown to be particularly effective when integrating literacy and other disciplines such as Science. This study demonstrates the relevance; benefits and practicality of having teachers create their own storybooks for use in communicating chosen science concepts in a way that develops science knowledge and understanding as well as reading development and other literacy skills.

AB  - Patient care is complex and demands that health professionals work together effectively. Interprofessional education (IPE) encourages collaboration by educating students from different professions together. This study examined the effectiveness of IPE in terms of changing students' perceptions of teamwork, professional identity, role, competency and autonomy, and the need for interdisciplinary co-operation. Two multidisciplinary cohorts of health science students (n = 51 and n = 48) elected to participate in a problem-based learning module (PBL). The module included problems addressing areas of professional identity and cases requiring a multidisciplinary team approach. Evaluation was undertaken using the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) and the Interdisciplinary Education Perception Scale (IPES). Regarding the RIPLS, both cohorts reported significant (p<0.05) improvements in their perceptions of teamwork, collaboration, and positive professional identity. Regarding the IEPS students' perceptions of professional competency and autonomy improved significantly (p<0.05) in both cohorts. An IPE module delivered using PBL appears valuable for professional development.

AB  - A central goal of nonmajors chemistry courses is to instill within students the sense that chemistry does not occur in a vacuum but rather permeates everyday life. To encourage students to consider chemistry within the broader context of society and public policy, a week-long module in a survey course for nonmajors was designed to connect scientific principles and energy policy. This module featured a deliberative discussion to facilitate students' evaluation and consideration of multiple viewpoints, rigorously examining different perspectives, trade-offs, benefits, and values represented in multiple alternatives. Our results demonstrate that this approach was highly impactful, resulting in several significant positive outcomes, including a deeper awareness of the connection between chemistry and other disciplines, an increased level of understanding and confidence in their knowledge, and a greater sense of urgency regarding energy policy.

AB  - Librarians have traditionally taught information literacy skills to science graduate students in separate courses dedicated to information-seeking, during assignment(s)-based library sessions for other courses, or through workshops. There is little mention in the professional literature of teaching graduate students within their research groups. This is certainly an alternative to consider--especially for smaller science graduate programs where the more traditional means of reaching graduate students are less likely. This article discusses a collaborative effort between a Chemistry professor and Physical Sciences Librarian at Rutgers University-Newark to design a mini-course for a research group. With the amount of customization possible when working with research groups, this option may even become increasingly significant due to the growing importance of interdisciplinary research.

AB  - As part of a campus-wide, externally funded project to increase performance in, enthusiasm for, and retention within STEM disciplines, we developed an interdisciplinary, team-taught first-year seminar course. The construction and delivery of this course was designed to show the relevance of selected general chemistry topics such as matter and energy to students in STEM disciplines outside of chemistry, particularly to pre-engineering students. Centered on a "science in space" theme, students in the course participated in a series of hands-on, open-ended activities adapted from the chemical education literature. Concept maps were used as assessment tools to measure improvement of cognition, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. These instruments were also useful in evaluating the students' grasp of relevance regarding general chemistry topics. At the end of the course, participating students have shown improvement in all targeted skill areas and articulate the relevance of chemistry to engineering, physics, and other STEM disciplines. Additionally, students participating in this program have increased academic success during their first year and beyond, as measured by retention, test performance, GPA, and progression metrics.

AB  - Purpose: The authors describe the challenges and opportunities associated with developing an interdisciplinary sustainability programme in an emerging economy and illustrate how these are addressed through the approach taken for the development of the first postgraduate programme (MSc and PhD) in sustainability science at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The purpose of this paper is to outline an approach that has a potential for application in other parts of Latin America and perhaps more broadly in other world regions sharing some of the same challenges and opportunities as found in Mexico. Design/Methodology/Approach: The implemented collaborative framework enabled a transformation of disciplinary research and teaching at UNAM into a postgraduate programme designed to generate cutting-edge educational and research capabilities. The approach to curriculum and programme design emphasized the process and methodological framework for curriculum development as much as the outcome itself. It entailed three primary elements: theory on collaborative processes; the curriculum design approach; and a formative and summative evaluation. Findings: Several of the challenges faced were related to the nature of the institution (mainly because of the complexity of its organization and the emphasis in maintaining disciplinary boundaries), as well as to the curriculum development and design approach (acceptance of a competency-based programme appropriate for the MSc but considered restrictive for the PhD). The experience the authors relate in this paper exemplifies how to cope with such challenges. The approach enabled the emergence of a shared vision that was appropriated by all the participants. This ultimately empowered them in the presentation of the curriculum to their disciplinary peers. Furthermore, the approach facilitated the creation of a programme that remained salient along the process, while increasingly gained legitimacy and credibility among the academic community. Social Implications: In Mexico, the number of sustainability practitioners and scientists is still insufficient, and there is a clear lack of capacities in key themes and tools. UNAM combines a strong scientific tradition and a foundational mandate to serve both the country and humanity and is, thus, a natural platform for developing a higher education programme in sustainability science. The approach taken in the development of UNAM's programme has useful lessons for the development of similar programmes in other developing nations facing similar educational and institutional challenges. Originality/Value: This model not only resulted in an innovative and novel programme in sustainability education but also, in the process, strengthened the competencies of diverse stakeholders through a systematic collaborative framework that fosters sustainability as a social learning process. Such experience illustrates the advantages of implementing a collaborative approach to enable the emergence of a critical mass capable to handle the diversity presupposed by a curriculum in sustainability science. It also shows how such a collaborative process can be implemented to overcome the limited resources, lack of experience in sustainability education and strong disciplinary focus that hampers the advancement of higher education in institutions similar to UNAM.

AB  - We present adaptable activities for models of drug movement in the human body -- pharmacokinetics -- that motivate the learning of ordinary differential equations with an interdisciplinary topic. Specifically, we model aspirin, caffeine, and digoxin. We discuss the pedagogy of guiding students to understand, develop, and analyze models, progressing in complexity to a system of differential equations. We investigate the effects of parameter values that distinguish various health levels, and dosing that may have toxic effects. Our assignments include modeling in a student-centered, active, and increasingly inquiry-oriented setting through which the mathematics and biology inform and reinforce each other. We include supplemental information regarding inquiry methods, student learning outcomes, a student's commentary about our activities, and support through mathematical communities such as POGIL and SIMIODE.

AB  - Background: Issues of identity, interdependence, relationality and violence are far larger than the human species alone, although humanity has often pretended as if it alone were the beneficiaries of studying such ideas. Aim: Pedagogically, the complexity of existence beyond human being must influence the traditional humanities curriculum or risk further isolation and alienation within humanity-dominant narratives. Setting: As climate change continues to alter our comprehension of what is truly at stake in the survival of life on this planet, however, humankind needs a complete rethinking of its relationship with the multiple forms of life that dwell alongside it, as well as the traditional division between the humanities and the sciences within academic settings. Methods: It is with this scenario before us that I turn to the work of Bruno Latour who reconceives of humanity's relationship with nature as an interdisciplinary and boundary-crossing project, one that has deep pedagogical implications. Results: I demonstrate how Latour's collaborative and highly original work ranges across disciplines and provides new ways to contemplate research in academia. Conclusion: Latour's thought moves beyond polarising anti-humanist language and towards a way to limit the sovereign claims of humanity, opening discourse towards other non-human participants.

AB  - As our understanding of complex environmental issues increases, institutions of higher education are evolving to develop new learning models that emphasize synthesis across disciplines, concepts, data, and methodologies. To this end, we argue for the implementation of environmental science education at the intersection of systems theory and service learning. A tight coupling of systems theory and service learning provides learners with the knowledge and skills required to tackle contemporary social-environmental challenges. The tangible benefits of a systems theory--service learning (STSL) curriculum occur in two principal learning areas: increased knowledge breadth and depth. Systems theory requires a broad assessment of social and environmental changes, whereas service learning promotes a brand of research and teaching resulting in a deepening of knowledge through field immersion. We present the tangible benefits of this deepening and broadening process along three axes: appreciation, research methods, and communication. (Contains 2 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - Critical race theory (CRT) was used to frame a study of the impact of racial resegregation on students in a public school district. Racism operated in the district at multiple ontological levels -- such as interpersonal microaggressions, structural economic arrangements, and discursive processes. CRT provided a rationale for the interdisciplinary approach required to track these different manifestations of racism, while maintaining an emphasis on the material reality of racism. Having its origins in the field of law, however, CRT provided limited guidance for methodological decisions often required in a social scientific study. The author found posthumanist philosophy of science offered guidance for these decisions in a manner that complemented the philosophical and political commitments of CRT. This essay reflects on the advantages this combination of theories offers for the analysis of institutionalized racism. Illustrations are drawn from the study on school resegregation.

AB  - The authors represent the life cycle of the butterfly through writing, drawing, dance, and math. The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) (NGSS Lead States 2013) emphasize college and career readiness as well as critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Students must develop a deep understanding of science concepts and engage in scientific thinking. Teaching the phases of the life cycle in isolation does not promote a depth of knowledge of science and is not found in the NGSS. Therefore, when developing this five-day first-grade unit, the authors focused on the overarching concepts of growth and development of organisms, patterns, and structure and function. They also engaged students in simultaneously meeting standards and objectives in science, dance, mathematics, and language arts, integrating dance with science provides students with the opportunity to "surpass visualization and representation through discursive experiences with new information." Furthermore, a comparative study of science indicated that classes that experienced kinesthetic lessons were able to remember knowledge 30 days longer than students who did not participate in kinesthetic lessons based in dance (Faber 2011). Beyond the research-based benefits of integrating dance, the authors believe that this unit enhanced students' understanding of scientific concepts, as evidenced by their final performance, and revealed an increase in students' self-confidence.

AB  - Fractals are geometric objects used to describe irregular shapes that have a fractional dimension and commonly appear in nature. Although several proposals for the study of perfect fractals at the basic level are present in the literature, only few proposals for the study of real fractals exist, which does not seem reasonable considering the wealth of the theme and its potentiality as an interdisciplinary topic. In this text, we present a simple and easily assimilable procedure to calculate the fractal dimension of any two-dimensional object. It only demands a computer with the free software ImageJ installed. This procedure is easily understandable, considering the basic school curriculum, and easily usable in a variety of school settings.

AB  - Circular dichroism (CD) has emerged as one of the standard biophysical techniques for the study of guaninequadruplex (G4) folding, cation effect, and ligand binding. The utility of this technique is based on its robustness, ease of use, and requirement of only small quantities of nucleic acid. This experiment is also extendable to the classroom and adaptable to students from graduate school in a multidisciplinary area, bridging chemistry, biochemistry, and medicinal chemistry. Specifically, students employ a solution of a nucleic acid that can adopt a G4 conformation, anneal it in the presence of a metal cation, and assess the folding and topology by the characteristic CD signatures. During the class experiment, it was also possible to interconvert the G4 topology by changing the cation type, and to determine the melting temperature of the G4 structure in the absence and presence of molecules called G4 ligands. The current experiment used the commercially available porphyrin TMPyP4 as a G4 ligand and human telomeric 22AG and mutated oncogene promoter c-MYC G4 structures to illustrate the CD applicability in a context that can be explored or adapted to a student's course level and topic.

AB  - The High School Summer Research Program (HSSRP) is a rigorous eight-week research experience that challenges high school students to a novel scientific question in an engineering laboratory at the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science (HSSEAS) at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The program collates highly motivated students from all socioeconomic statuses, ethnicities, and genders to increase the diversity of applicants for STEM majors at four-year universities, and thereby potentially promotes a more diverse and innovative STEM workforce. To supplement students' unique research projects, HSSRP comprises several professional development opportunities, such as faculty presentations, lab tours, and industry tech talks. Students are trained to communicate their research through scientific posters and oral presentations in a ''learn-by-teaching'' system that further exposes all students to the multitude of creative strategies that are currently employed across the engineering disciplines to tackle world issues. This integrates with HSSRP's strong social element, which encourages students to act as a support system for each other in the midst of the challenging eight weeks, and serves as a network for students after the program. A survey of the 2014-2016 HSSRP classes indicates high satisfaction with the program, and a high likelihood of pursuing a STEM degree and advanced STEM degrees. Surveys of HSSRP alumni shows that a vast percentage of students are pursuing STEM degrees or are currently working in the STEM field.

AB  - Inquiry-based and interdisciplinary teaching practices exemplify constructivist approaches to education capable of facilitating authentic student learning; however, their implementation has proven particularly challenging within certain contexts in the United States. This qualitative study considers one such context via an investigation of elementary teachers' views on teaching inquiry-based, interdisciplinary science and social studies in urban settings. Interview data from 15 teachers in three urban schools are presented. Findings describe how teachers' views compare to the respective national standards in each curricular area and detail the barriers they report to implementing such practices in their classrooms.

AB  - Undergraduate research experiences benefit students' scientific skills, and recent trends in undergraduate research and education include focusing on interdisciplinary projects and on place-based learning. Here we describe a semester-long pilot interdisciplinary undergraduate research program focused on local aquatic ecosystems, discuss perceived benefits of this research approach, and show how this program's structure could be modified for use at other undergraduate institutions. The program included nine undergraduate students and five faculty from multiple scientific disciplines (geography, virology, ecology, vertebrate and invertebrate zoology) and involved approximately half a day of research per student per week and weekly hour-long lab meetings of the entire group, followed by end-of-semester poster presentations to the university. Student self-assessment data indicated that the program improved students' perceptions of their scientific ability, as well as their comfort level at performing scientific skills. We suggest that bringing together faculty from multiple disciplines with projects focused on the same local ecosystem is a valuable technique for providing undergraduate students with not only hands-on research experience, but also with (1) exposure to a diversity of research areas and methods and (2) a better understanding of the ecosystems in and around their campus.

AB  - Due to the interdisciplinary nature of environmental education, addressing the range of socioscientific issues included under the umbrella of sustainability can be challenging for educators working within the context of mandated state subject area standards. Two states (Washington and Vermont) have been recognized as leaders in incorporating sustainability into K-12 education through standards reform. Similarly, other states may engage in revisions in response to the recently released Next Generation Science Standards. This study examined how Washington and Vermont have incorporated sustainability-related topics into their state science standards and considers implications for practitioners, curriculum development, and standards reform.

AB  - An interdisciplinary science course has been implemented at a university with the intention of providing students the opportunity to develop a range of key skills in relation to: real-world connections of science, problem-solving, information and communications technology use and team while linking subject knowledge in each of the science disciplines. One of the problems used in this interdisciplinary course has been selected to evaluate if it affords students the opportunity to explicitly display problem-solving processes. While the benefits of implementing problem-based learning have been well reported, far less research has been devoted to methods of assessing student problem-solving solutions. A problem-solving theoretical framework was used as a tool to assess student written solutions to indicate if problem-solving processes were present. In two academic years, student problem-solving processes were satisfactory for exploring and understanding, representing and formulating, and planning and executing, indicating that student collaboration on problems is a good initiator of developing these processes. In both academic years, students displayed poor monitoring and reflecting (MR) processes at the intermediate level. A key impact of evaluating student work in this way is that it facilitated meaningful feedback about the students' problem-solving process rather than solely assessing the correctness of problem solutions.

AB  - In 1999, the International Research Training Group "GRK532" was founded as a pilot project for cross-border European postgraduate education along the German/French/Luxembourg borders. The project consists of an interdisciplinary research programme on synthesis, isolation and characterization of new materials accompanied by an ambitious continuous and consecutive education programme between research groups from chemistry, pharmacy, physics, biochemistry, materials science and analytical chemistry. The education programme aims at qualifying doctoral students in international, interdisciplinary and soft skills during their thesis work. Key elements of the education programme are lectures, hands-on workshops, scientific presentations and discussions in English. Alumni receive a certificate of successful participation, which is signed by the German and French speakers and the president of the Deutsch-Franzosische Hochschule/Universite Franco-Allemande [Franco-German University].

AB  - It is a surprising fact that social work is not conceived as a scientific discipline in many countries and especially in the United States. It is surprising because the extent of academic social work programs and the scientific output of people working at schools of social work are significant. And it is surprising anyway if social work is conceived as a profession that by definition is linked to scientific knowledge. This article presents a characterization of the debate on social work science that has been led in the German-speaking countries. As a consequence of this debate and following the philosophy of science as developed by Mario Bunge, it introduces some basic propositions on how to conceive social work as a science, namely as a transdisciplinary action science ("Handlungswissenschaft") and outlines the target of building a consolidated knowledge base of social work as well as the challenges related to this goal.

AB  - In this article, we consider the notion of tacit modalities as a theory and method for researchers. Based on research studies with individuals across ages and stages of life, we interviewed people about objects that they value, and what pervades all of the stories are tacit, lived properties that objects possess. The research ostensibly sought to extend work on the notion of artifactual literacies and tacit modalities, and, in the end, what stretched the research were sensory, embodied, and "non-representational" experiences expressed by collaborators in the research. This article focuses on three people's stories about their felt experiences and sensory-led (and laden) stories associated with objects. To analyze interview data, we apply transdisciplinary theories that offer the reader a syncretic conceptual experience of tacit modalities as a method within ethnographic work to locate sensorial, affective dimensions of objects.

AB  - The International Technology and Engineering Educators Association (ITEEA) defines STEM as a new transdisciplinary subject in schools that integrates the disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics into a single course of study. There are three major problems with this definition: There is no consensus in support of the ITEEA definition of STEM education. There exists the conceptual conundrum of converting four major academic disciplines, each divisible into major subdivisions, into a single school course. And, activity-based learning has been omitted from the definition. Activity-based learning is the signature characteristic of technology and engineering education. While there does exist a national movement in support of the idea of STEM education, the failure to agree on what STEM is, why STEM is important, and how to implement STEM, means that since the emergence of STEM as an education concept approximately fifteen years ago, too few students are graduating from STEM programs in order to meet the demands of U.S. employers (Rothwell, 2014). The purpose of this article is to propose changes to the ITEEA definition of STEM; to include emphasis on learning activities, eliminate the conundrum of turning four subjects into one, and provide the basis for consensus among stake holders, by answering the question "Why STEM?"

AB  - The aim of this research was to examine the potential of project-based learning (PBL) and everyday life contexts in developing primary pupils' scientific and engineering practices. Multiple data were collected in a Finnish primary school class; pupils were aged 7-8 years. The pupils' practices and creation of artifacts were videotaped and analysed using theory-guided content analysis. The analysis revealed that the designed multidisciplinary PBL unit placed within a familiar everyday life context enabled pupils to practice and communicate scientific and engineering practices supported with digital technology.

AB  - One of the most important component of innovative economy is forming of effectively functioning the work market. This is particularly true for countries with developing economy, that requires the formation of new pedagogical paradigms. The universities face a global challenge - to rebuild the educational process, taking into account the challenges and requirements of modern production. A successful preparing of future specialists, who are able to independent, creative, solving problems and strive toward their goals achieving is a practice-oriented project management education. It should consist in the work on educational project of different level of sophistication, using adapted educational attempts. Studying in this ideology, students acquire the experience of team work required in professional activity, such as team work, practice of presentation and defending of their ideas and responsibility of solutions adapted. Such an approach is actively applied in many leading universities in the world. The main task of the authors is to carry out a comparative analysis of educational design practices in different areas of training (engineering, management, public administration, organization of work with youth) in two leading universities in Poland and Russia -- Wroclaw University of Science and Technology and Ural Federal University. Used research methods are general and particular document's analysis, data integration, benchmarking, constructive congruency and case study. It is established that project competences are universals and recommended in national learning standards at all levels and streams of education. Regardless of corporative specificity, project management affects education matters, resources of educational process and pedagogical technologies. Project education of students has a systemic, infiltrating, successional and interdisciplinary character. Specificities of project learning, its social and corporative heterogeneity, are addicted many factors. Among them, the most important are project learning content, specificity of national project background, level of adaptivity in regional practices and different methodological approaches to project management--from the classical to agile one.

AB  - Potency assays of pharmaceutical products are designed to measure the amount of an active ingredient in a sample. They are important quality control tools for all medications, including intravenous (IV) admixture fluid bags which are commonly prepared by pharmacists in healthcare facilities via extemporaneous compounding. An interdisciplinary laboratory module was created by combining the learning outcomes of a pharmacy compounding course with the classic undergraduate chemistry quantitative analysis course. The pharmacy students prepared the IV bags of calcium gluconate or magnesium sulfate in isotonic saline vehicle based on given prescriptions. The analytical chemistry students applied United States Pharmacopeia complexometric titration methods to determine the concentration of calcium or magnesium in the IV fluid and convert it to mass for each bag. The analytical results allowed the pharmacy students to confirm whether their IV bags met the passing criteria for the labeled claimed mass. This transformative learning experience provides an interesting real-life application for a quantitative analysis laboratory course and highlights the importance of quality control in the pharmacy compounding course.

AB  - Awareness of one's knowledge, skills, and dispositions are important for college graduates to excel in the workforce. The purpose of this study was to administer a needs assessment to students enrolled in the Agricultural Sciences department at Clemson University to determine areas of discrepancy based on perceived levels of proficiency and importance of knowledge, skills, and dispositions for career readiness. The Borich needs assessment model was used to discern between student's perceived competency and importance of career readiness skills within nine constructs. Constructs were analyzed and ranked using mean and grand mean weighted discrepancy scores. We found career skills, interdisciplinary skills, life skills, and learning skills ranked as the highest areas of need. Some differences were revealed among the three majors in the department, but career skills were consistently ranked as students' highest priority need. The majority of the students believed they were most responsible for developing skills to prepare themselves to be career ready. Recommendations included expanded data collection among employers, faculty, secondary education teachers and students, and post-secondary students enrolled at technical colleges and conducting a pre/post survey of students as they enter their first semester and complete their final semester to determine any change in student perception over time.

AB  - Virtually all national standards now require students and teachers to understand the particulars of disciplinary literacy. But recently emerging scholarship suggests that disciplinary literacy is, by itself, an incomplete and potentially problematic approach to secondary literacy instruction. By asking students to "think like" or even "be like" experts, students may receive implicit messaging about whose knowledge is--and isn't--valued. Critical disciplinary literacy (CDL) creates space for, and highlights connections between, critical literacies and disciplinary literacies. CDL acknowledges disciplines as unique communities with their own specialized (and often exclusionary) skills, norms, practices, and discourses, but deviates from conventional applications of disciplinary literacy by responding to the ways in which power systems and the analytic skills needed to understand them work "differently" based on the disciplines at hand. A CDL instructional approach acknowledges that applying the critical literacy skills of "reading the word and the world" to understand the power dynamics of vaccine distributions requires a different skill set and strategy approach than looking at textual representations of masculinity in "Romeo and Juliet." Written by a team of educators with over 70 combined years of classroom experience, "Power Tools: 30 Critical Disciplinary Literacy Strategies for 6-12 Classrooms" offers readers research-based, multidisciplinary, ready-to-implement disciplinary literacy strategies from critical literacy lenses. The book sets itself apart from other strategy textbooks by offering creative strategy implementation that calls attention to power systems. Educators can learn, for example, how they might employ read-alouds to explore the global refugee crisis, or use the exit ticket strategy to help students reflect on the relationship between race and COVID statistics/experiences. "Power Tools: 30 Critical Disciplinary Literacy Strategies for 6-12 Classrooms" provides standards-aligned lessons that both challenge and extend traditional engagement practices to build a more just world. Each chapter includes: (1) An overview of each strategy, situated within the research of best practices; (2) Two disciplinary examples for each CDL strategy (e.g., an example of a CDL think-aloud in seventh grade math and tenth grade ELA classroom). Chapters provide resources such as examples of student work, discussion prompts, dialogue between teacher and students, and reprintables; and (3) Ideas for addressing resistance to CDL instruction. Preservice and in-service teachers, as well as teacher educators and researchers, looking to do and support justice-oriented work in disciplinary spaces will find value in the book. "Power Tools" is an ideal text to implement in courses such as Disciplinary Literacy, Secondary Literacy, Content Area Literacy, Methods/Strategies for Teaching Social Justice, Multicultural Education, ELA methods, Science methods, Social Studies methods, and Mathematics methods.

AB  - Articles from the National Science Teacher Association (NSTA) publications were analyzed to investigate resources available for teachers who want to implement interdisciplinary approaches into the science classroom. All articles in each journal from 2004 through 2008 were read an analyzed; approximately 13% of Science & Children (elementary), 21% of Science Scope (middle), and 17% of The Science Teacher (high school) articles met the interdisciplinary approach criteria. Results show that overall, reading, writing, art, and technology are the subjects most commonly integrated into science. Surprisingly, math is rarely discussed across all school levels. Comparing the articles across different school levels, Science Scope articles have the highest number of integrated articles, whereas The Science Teacher had the fewest number of integrated articles.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how an intentionally planned learning environment, rich with material resources and inquiry questioning practices, supported young children's engagement with an integrated science and mathematics learning experience. A practitioner-researcher, named 'Jenny', from an Australian early year learning centre, partnered with the research team to explore how she could effectively provoke her Kindergarten (4-year-old) children's curiosity and engagement with integrated inquiry learning projects. To illustrate how Jenny used inquiry questioning frameworks to guide her children's engagement with a construction task as well as their development of science and mathematics concepts, we report and analyse a selected series of episodes from a 'Sun Protection' learning experience. Importantly, as an outcome of this study, Jenny reported an increase in her personal awareness of science and mathematics learning demands and opportunities in children's everyday activities and construction projects. She also reported that the use of inquiry questioning increased the time her children spent engaged with learning experiences and higher-order thinking.

AB  - This article describes factors that influence the success of collaborations involving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and Education faculty at research-focused universities who work toward postsecondary STEM education improvement. We provide insight into how interdisciplinary faculty may successfully collaborate given their different disciplinary backgrounds. We explore the importance of education research brokers, individuals credited with helping STEM faculty understand, respond to, and recognize the importance of education research and theory. In addition, we discuss the advantages of appointments of brokers within STEM versus Education Departments. We identify key characteristics that help build and sustain interdisciplinary collaboration and establish the critical roles of brokers at institutions that strive to improve education.

AB  - Working with second-grade teachers, the authors designed a six-day integrated science and language arts unit to investigate the structures that insects use to make their sound vibrations. They were inspired by "The Very Quiet Cricket" (Carle 1990), which was used as the focus text for the unit, as well as "Bug Music" (Rothenberg 2013), which prompts readers to think about the noise that insects make as an inspiration for music. While Robertson and Meyer (2010) engaged middle grades students with the songs and sound wave images of various insects to teach about sound, the authors wanted to have concrete, physical examples to demonstrate sound energy vibrations to young learners. This lesson was designed a unit using multiple modes of representation for the insect body parts and their vibrations, including physical specimens, video, photographs, diagrams, and informational text. In addition, students represented their understanding using drawing, writing, and speaking. Using multiple modes of representation in the presentation to and production by students of science concepts is beneficial for early elementary students' learning (Wilson and Bradbury 2016), as well as for supporting the science learning of students with learning disabilities (Taylor and Villanueva 2014). By including various visual representations (physical specimens, video, photographs, and diagrams) along with more traditional informational text, science information is made more accessible to developing and struggling readers.

AB  - In 2014, the Finnish National Board of Education launched a new core curriculum with the aim of meeting the skills and competence requirements of the 21st century. The purpose of this case study was to find out what transversal competencies Finnish eighth graders developed and how they experienced studying in a problem-based transdisciplinary course, which was arranged for the transitional stage between the former and the new curriculum. The qualitative data consisted of questionnaires and interviews. The analysis followed the methods of qualitative content analysis. When asked about their learning, the students commented on not having learnt much, referring to the discipline-based knowledge. Instead, they had learnt skills through teamwork, problem solving, and expression of their views and opinions, an aspect that they did not clearly connect with the things to be learnt at school. Many students felt that they acquired the competencies that they would need later in their lives. The students' teamwork had a crucial impact on their learning experience. The timeframe for the integrative approach needs careful consideration; the learning process in this course was perceived as being successful because it was long enough. Our study highlights that focusing on students' views is critical when reforming curriculum.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effect of interdisciplinary activities organised online within the scope of an eTwinning project carried out with gifted students on the students' technology awareness and computational thinking (CT). However the research was not funded by eTwinning. The study was carried out through web-based tools for a period of 3 months in the year 2020. These Web 2.0 tools were: Canva, Zoom, Google Classroom, Jamboard, Tinkercad, Telegram, Facebook, Kahoot!, Instagram, StoryJumper, Padlet, etc. The research was designed with an explanatory design which is one of the mixed models. While in the quantitative aspect of the study, a quasi-experimental design with pretest posttest control group was carried out, a case study was carried out in the qualitative aspect of the study. The participants were 50 gifted students continuing their education at Science and Art Centres affiliated to the National Education Ministry in 6 different provinces of Turkey. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used together in the study. A technology awareness and computational thinking scale was chosen as the quantitative data collection tool, while mind maps were used as the qualitative data collection tool. As a result of the research, a significant increase in the participants' technology awareness and computational thinking was determined in favour of the posttest, while this increase was verified through the mind-mapping technique applied to the students. At the end of the study, the findings were discussed, and recommendations were made for future studies. In addition, a great limitation of this research was the effectiveness of activities that had to be carried out entirely remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the distance education, in which the teacher's control was weak, the skills intended to be fostered in students remained at a lower level.

AB  - The trend toward the digitalization of all areas of human activity has had a significant impact on education. Today, more than ever, there is a lot of discussion about developing the students' specific skills to adapt to future changes. In this context, research investigating practices at the primary school level is constantly expanding, out of the desire for researchers to identify how specific digital citizenship content is implemented in the work of young learners. This study aims to systematically review the scholarly articles to examine primary school practices related to digital citizenship. Studies conducted on participants, students, and primary school teachers, were included in the analysis. The systematic review was also developed taking into account empirical studies that investigated practical applications in the field of digital citizenship. The results showed that the practices used in primary school focus on students' digital literacy and personal development through an interdisciplinary approach. The studies were theoretically grounded, focusing on only a few dimensions of digital citizenship. These results are the prerequisites for the realization of elementary education in line with the needs of young learners, taking into account the trend of digitalization in all areas of human activity.

AB  - The aim of the present study is to improve the quality of students' environmental literacy and sustainability education in chemistry teaching by combining the socio-scientific issue of life-cycle thinking with inquiry-based learning approaches. This case study presents results from an inquiry-based life-cycle thinking project: an interdisciplinary teaching model designed by chemistry teachers. The strength of the project is that upper-secondary students (N = 105) are allowed to investigate the life cycle of an optional product based on their own interest. Student-centred teaching methods are suggested to promote the students' interest in studying. The research question was: How does an inquiry-based life-cycle thinking project in chemistry education affect students' chemistry attitudes and environmental literacy? The research methods used included surveys and semi-structured interviews. The study shows that the project positively affected students' attitudes towards chemistry learning: they valued the independent and collaborative learning setting. The changes in the students' environmental literacy were evident in their new realisations: they emphasised the importance of environmental protection and recycling, but perceived that changing their own behaviour is still difficult. The inquiry-based teaching of life-cycle thinking can be seen as an effective approach to more motivating and sustainable chemistry education. Further research should address the kinds of knowledge outcomes that this type of inquiry-based life-cycle teaching creates in students. Furthermore, other useful approaches to teaching sustainable development in chemistry lessons should be shared.

AB  - We are delighted to welcome you to the International Conference on Education and New Developments 2016--END 2016, taking place in Ljubljana, Slovenia, from 12 to 14 of June. Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. Our International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. Our goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2016 received 489 submissions, from 53 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. It was accepted for presentation in the conference, 133 submissions (27% acceptance rate). The conference also includes a keynote presentation from an internationally distinguished researcher, Professor Dr. Mojca Juriševic, Associate Professor of Educational Psychology, Faculty of Education, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, to whom we express our most gratitude. Also, we give a special thanks to Professor Emerita Nina K. Buchanan, PhD, University of Hawaii, USA and Professor Emeritus Robert A. Fox, PhD, University of Hawaii, USA for the special talk entitled "The Search for New Educational Forms in the United States and its International Implications." This volume is composed by the proceedings of the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2016), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (W.I.A.R.S.) and had the help of our respected co-sponsor and media partner that we reference in the dedicated page. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. To develop the conference program we have chosen four main broad-ranging categories, which also covers different interest areas: (1) In TEACHERS AND STUDENTS: Teachers and Staff training and education; Educational quality and standards; Curriculum and Pedagogy; Vocational education and Counseling; Ubiquitous and lifelong learning; Training programs and professional guidance; Teaching and learning relationship; Student affairs (learning, experiences and diversity; Extra-curricular activities; Assessment and measurements in Education. (2) In PROJECTS AND TRENDS: Pedagogic innovations; Challenges and transformations in Education; Technology in teaching and learning; Distance Education and eLearning; Global and sustainable developments for Education; New learning and teaching models; Multicultural and (inter)cultural communications; Inclusive and Special Education; Rural and indigenous Education; Educational projects. (3) In TEACHING AND LEARNING: Educational foundations; Research and development methodologies; Early childhood and Primary Education; Secondary Education; Higher Education; Science and technology Education; Literacy, languages and Linguistics (TESL/TEFL); Health Education; Religious Education; Sports Education.

AB  - This chapter aims to seek insight into engagement in context, conceived through Productive Disciplinary Engagement (PDE), which can be perceived as a condition for sustained disciplinary and interdisciplinary interest and motivation. Despite ongoing trends in the design and implementation of enriched learning environments that are expected to boost effective use of material and digital tools along with new sources of information, the empirical research on their motivational and emotional consequences is still in its infancy. These environments challenge, cognitively as well as motivationally, emotionally, and socially, both students and teachers alike. Keeping in mind the challenging times for future learning and work-life, engagement and motivation are discussed with a focus on science disciplines. In these fields, there is a strong call for proficient skills in collaborative team learning, problem-solving, and collective knowledge creation in anticipation of an uncertain, challenging future. Knowledge-intensive work and knowledge demands are escalating along with fast technological development, and simultaneously tasks that demand new, not yet even existing and partly unpredicted knowledge and expertise are increasing. In addition, knowledge and expertise are progressively more distributed, with new knowledge, products and innovations being created in collaboration that crosses disciplinary borders. In this chapter, three case illustrations in different science fields and learning contexts provide empirical evidence for the discussion on the learned lessons from these illustrated studies designed to support PDE, and the potential significance of PDE for productive collaboration, sustained disciplinary interest, and motivation given later development of adaptive expertise.

AB  - Engagement involves students' investment in learning activities, as well as interrelated affective (emotive responses), behavioral (active responses), and cognitive (mental effort) components. This study assessed undergraduate student and instructor perceptions of the interrelated components of engagement during and after the rapid online transition of teaching in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fifteen courses--including laboratory, discussion-based, large lecture, tutorial, and problem-based learning--within a multi-disciplinary faculty at a large research-intensive Canadian university were surveyed to: (a) assess student and instructor perceptions of students' levels of engagement during and after the rapid transition to online teaching due to the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) describe which aspects of engagement were enhanced or diminished due to the rapid online transition; and (c) identify which learning activities students would find most engaging in an online setting so as to assist in developing student-centered online pedagogical techniques. Student engagement was lower after the rapid online transition. Students who engaged by connecting with peers and instructors through in-class discussion (affective engagement) had diminished engagement, whereas students who engaged by listening to lectures, reading course materials, and reviewing slides (cognitive engagement) had enhanced engagement. Overall, students found synchronous activities more engaging. Students experienced positive and negative outcomes related to classroom engagement when transitioning rapidly to online learning during a global pandemic.

AB  - This study explored (1) pedagogical strategies in Educational Coding and Robotics (ECR) learning which can develop computational thinking of students and (2) the degree of teacher centrality in the ECR classroom. In addition, we investigated (3) the added value of the Small Private Online Course (SPOC) to teacher professional development (TPD). We analyzed reflections of 80 in-service teachers on TPD through the SPOC (1,091 statements) and conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 of them one year after completing the course and teaching ECR in the classroom (328 statements). The most prominent strategies immediately after the TPD were "constructing learning experiences," "tinkering & debugging," and "interdisciplinary learning," while one year later, "experiential learning" and "collaborative learning" were more common. Regarding the degree of teacher centrality, a year after teaching ECR curriculum the teachers had a significantly higher percentage of statements reflecting their role as a "guide-on-the-side" and as "a partner" of students in the learning process. Regarding the contribution of the SPOC for TPD, teacher statements revealed significantly more benefits than challenges in both points of time. Interestingly, the same categories emerged bottom-up as benefits and challenges: a variety of "control dimensions," "independent learning," "learning and knowledge management" and "collaboration." Implications for educational theory and ECR practice are discussed.

AB  - This paper provides theorisation about a novel concept for education: an integrative philosophy of knowledge (IPK). This is proposed for school curricula to relate multiple subjects to big questions of personal and existential importance. Critical contemporary issues such as climate change education require multiple subject contributions but there is little clarity in the English education guidance on this drawing together, beyond the encouragement to do so in priority areas. Leading British thinkers have engaged the idea of the unity of knowledge, not without difficulty and criticism. The paper identifies reasons for a practical approach to consilience in school curricula. In addition to preliminary theorisation, in methodological 'harmony', this paper adds tentative empirical findings from a related research project that provides quantitative indications that such multi-subject connection is likely not happening. The findings are not definitive, but the perceptions of three groups of beginning and experienced teachers (secondary Religious Education (RE), secondary science and primary teachers) indicate that school curricula do not reflect an integrative approach to climate change education, and sex and relationships education, despite policy priority. A significant national survey could not detect many signs of connection. The paper speculates that RE could have a key epistemic role for the curriculum as a whole in this regard.

AB  - A thematic course called "Climate Change: Chemistry and Controversy" was developed for upper-level non-STEM students. This course used the socioscientific context of climate change to teach chemical principles and the nature of science. Students used principles of agnotology (direct study of misinformation) to debunk climate change misconceptions commonly encountered in the media and politics. The culmination of the course was a service-learning project to create training documents for staff at a local science center that explained common climate misconceptions. In the process of completing this project, students gained a greater appreciation for the nature of science and learned chemical principles of electromagnetic radiation, atomic structure (isotopes), molecular structure (Lewis structures, VESPR, and polarity) spectroscopy, and stoichiometry. This paper summarizes the outcomes of the course, teaching strategies used to reach the outcomes, and strategies for incorporating agnotology and socioscientific study in science courses.

AB  - This longitudinal study examines the responses of student sat two different institutions to creative exercises related to models of chemical bonding. Questions in the form of creative exercises required students to provide relevant, accurate, and distinct statements about two compounds for which they were provided only the formula and electronegativity values: SCl2 and CaCl2. Students responded to the questions at the end of general chemistry, six months later, and one year later. Their responses were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively to explore patterns in application of bonding ideas and change overtime. The data reveal extensive application of covalent bonding ideas to an ionic compound, regardless of whether a student identified the substance as ionic or not, and that this is consistent over a year out. Implications for instruction of bonding models in general chemistry(and beyond) are discussed.

AB  - To attract and retain more academically qualified students to science and mathematics, we developed a merit-based scholarship program for incoming students with STEM interests. Scholarship recipients participate for the first two years in an interdisciplinary learning community and declare a STEM major by the sophomore year. STEM Learning Community (SLC), a year-long course initiated in fall 2009, has become a permanent part of the College curriculum. Content consists of weekly meetings for discussions and presentations on such topics as scientific ethics, relationships between science and technology, the nature and history of science, and the interplay between scientific discovery and societal development. A major component are group research projects conducted during the school year and presented at our annual undergraduate research symposium. In addition, we provide career counseling, visits and presentations by STEM professionals, and internship opportunities. Students report that they are developing such valuable skills as problem solving ability, communication skills, collaboration, and knowledge of the research process. Enrollment and graduation data show that numbers of participants, especially women and minority students, increased following the inception of the SLC. The results suggest that targeted scholarships combined with engagement in collaborative undergraduate research are a useful tool for enhancing STEM recruitment and persistence.

AB  - This paper investigates the impact of changing science policy doctrines on the development of an academic field, working life research. Working life research is an interdisciplinary field of study in which researchers and stakeholders collaborated to produce relevant knowledge. The development of the field, we argue, was both facilitated and justified by the, at the time dominant, science policy orthodoxy in Sweden, sector research. Sector research science policy doctrine favoured stakeholder-driven research agendas in the fields relevant to the sector. This approach to agenda setting was highly contested by Swedish universities and left scientists vulnerable to the fallout from any conflicts arising among the stakeholder groupings that were part of the governance arrangement. Our case shows that working life research was in part a victim of the struggle between science and policy over who sets the agenda for science in Sweden. In this struggle, each side chose to use "scientific quality" as a proxy for furthering its respective interests and visions for how science should be governed. The paper argues that this case is of interest to the continued elaboration of the Mode 2 thesis and the debate about "relevant science". We find that the close association with stakeholders and the concomitant dependence it created left working life research unable to defend itself against its critics and that this state of affairs was particularly problematic for social science research on working life.

AB  - This article addresses a translational research framework for school psychology. Translational research uses outcomes of basic and applied science to enhance the overall well-being of persons. This transdisciplinary framework connects disciplines and uses their resources, capacities, systems, and procedures to advance prevention, intervention, and diagnosis. In order for this advancement to occur, research outcomes must quickly reach the field-based setting and the research findings must result in efficient and effective practices that can be readily implemented by the practitioner. Translational research studies published in "School Psychology Forum" are intended to quickly promote the application of promising new evidence-based practices in real-world contexts such as schools, homes, and communities. In addition, primary prevention models of school psychology practice are emphasized. This emphasis will help school psychologists promote the development of all children. By promoting child development across the spectrum of psychoeducational, psychosocial, and physiological well-being, school psychologists help to perpetuate the profession and expand their opportunities to be of service to potentially all students.

AB  - The health of Hispanics is greatly influenced by level of education, socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare (United States Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS], 2011). To address this issue and to reduce health disparities among all ethnic groups, community based interventions with culturally appropriate and linguistically relevant education are recommended (DHHS, 2010; Rios-Ellis, 2011; Wallace, Fulwood, & Alvarado, 2008). The National Council of La Raza (NCLR)/California State University Long Beach (CSULB) Center for Latino Community Health, Evaluation and Leadership Training convened concerned Health Science (HSC) and Family and Consumer Sciences (FCS) faculty and research staff at CSULB. The purpose was to apply for a "Transdisciplinary Graduate Education and Training" grant, 2011-2016, with an overall outcome of reduction and prevention of early childhood obesity in Latino families. The purpose of this article is to: (1) inform and ignite FCS faculty and students to pursue collaborative, interdisciplinary research and university-based projects, including course development, so that curricula reflect both the multicultural nature of the U.S. and the current FCS Body of Knowledge themes; and (2) outline the development and approval of a new graduate course at CSULB within the FCS and HSC departments.

AB  - Impact evaluation plays a critical role in determining whether federally funded research programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are wise investments. This paper develops quantitative methods for program evaluation and applies this approach to a flagship National Science Foundation-funded education research program, Research and Evaluation on Education in Science and Engineering (REESE). Results of three different bibliometric analyses all point to the same conclusion: REESE is an interdisciplinary research program that attracts highly productive investigators who exhibit an additional increase in their productivity rate as a result of receiving REESE funding. Limitations of the bibliometric approach are discussed, and directions are provided for the future of impact evaluations of research programs intended to serve the public good.

AB  - This article describes higher degree research supervisors' experiences of supervision as teaching. While research education is considered central to the higher degree research experience, comparatively little is known to date of the teaching lenses adopted by supervisors as they go about their supervision. We worked with 35 supervisors engaged in discipline-specific and interdisciplinary research across architectural design, science, engineering, computer science, information systems and librarianship. Several of these supervisors conducted projects which interfaced with the social sciences and humanities. Nine categories describing supervisors' experiences were constructed through the adoption of a phenomenographic approach. These offer a picture of supervisors' collective awareness of supervision as teaching. Supervision as teaching was experienced as: Promoting the supervisor's development, Imparting academic expertise, Upholding academic standards, Promoting learning to research, Drawing upon student expertise, Enabling student development, Venturing into unexplored territory, Forming productive communities, and Contributing to society.

AB  - Educational technologies have an important role in education today. They represent a relevant resource in the process between theorizing and educational practices, and they are essential in the awareness process for sustainability. Thus, technological education appears as a facilitator in this process, especially with students, parents, and everyone around us, as being supported by tech resources to produce an efficient effect. This study was performed at Escola Municipal de Ensino Fundamental in Alagoinha-Paraíba, Brazil, between January and February, 2019; the research question is: Are teachers using and recognizing technology as a partner in the environmental awareness process? The main objective is to analyze the usage of tech in the process for environmental awareness by teachers. The specific objectives are: to check the usage of technological education in the environmental awareness process, to comprehend the challenges faced by the teachers in the process of technological usage on the scope of environmental education, to identify the activities developed by the teachers involving tech and environmental education, and to perceive the educational practices. A total of 22 teachers responded to the questions. Data collection was made on a Likert scale using the qualitative method and descriptive research. The Likert scale was validated on its construction with analysis factor. Therefore, it was found that the teachers use the tech resources in their classes, through the environmental awareness, besides defending the educational projects and realizing interdisciplinary works about environmental education for environmental conservation.

AB  - Robots and robot technology have been used widely across disciplines at the postsecondary level, but have not gained traction at the secondary (K-12) level. In higher education, for example, mechanical engineers design the kinematics of a robot, the electrical engineers determine electrical needs, and the industrial and systems engineers determine best use in optimizing production. At the secondary level, courses are taught in a "silo" format and seem unrelated resulting in students wondering why some subjects are required. The robot is appealing as an integrator of courses because of permeation across the subject matter. Although the typical subject matters referred to when robots are in discussion are science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), other subject areas such as language, geography, medicine, and art are easily integrate-able. The ability of robot technology to use knowledge across fields of study and across all levels of education is valuable. The ability of robot education to cut across the discipline's knowledge helps to show interconnectedness, interdependence, and relevance of courses. The ability to scale the robot education from elementary to college creates a platform for continued growth. In addition, robot technology can be customized to local economy or needs. This chapter presents three case studies that were conducted to reach 5th- and 6th-grade students in three different continents. The case studies, though conducted at different times using different research methods, offer a glimpse of not only the interaction of subject matter, but also a larger aspect of value of education.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of an interdisciplinary and intergenerational educational experience in the elderly, in teachers, students and their parents or guardians. Creative Dance and Drama Workshops were articulated with Portuguese, PE, Arts and IT subjects. A total of 20 6th graders, their parents or guardians, five teachers and 15 elders participated in the study. An analysis of 194 free evocations based in the free word association technique was performed, along with 17 semi-structured interviews. From the literary texts "Os Piratas" and "Ulisses", an expressions-based work was proposed, where drama and movement games were explored. Evocations of the central core were of Friendship, Learning, Affection, Solidarity and Interaction. Of the 264 text units analysed, interaction with the elders was highlighted. In the teachers' perception about the subjects and workshops involved in the project, a valorisation of IT and of Portuguese was registered. It is also relevant the amount of references to values and to the Interaction with the elders. This interdisciplinary and intergenerational project has revealed itself valuable for the integral and humanistic training of the students, having also given rise to corporeal artistic and emotional experiences relevant to their well-being.

AB  - The purpose of the present work is to rethink, in the university context, the concept of genius, related to the high intellectual abilities associated with intelligence; also, to connect the idea of entrepreneurial competences, such as leadership or social commitment. The hypothesis is that a university genius is defined by his high creative abilities and, in particular, entrepreneurial ones. From the methodological point of view, the recommendations of the National Association for Gifted Children were followed, and evidence collection was based on such practices, using the results obtained by two studies: the first one with professors and postgraduate students (from Argentina and Spain, from hard and soft sciences) who responded to a conceptual questionnaire, previously validated, in order to delineate common minimum denominators of geniuses. The other one comes from analyzing the results of an acceleration program of entrepreneurial competence with undergraduate students. Combining both data resulted in the need to think in an educational proposal (itinerary) with trajectories of excellence. One during the Degree level, with pilot training activities (in entrepreneurial competence), experimenting on a small scale; and the other in the Postgraduate level, encouraging them to be architects of their "routes", allowing them to self-employ and to become agents of socio-community change.

AB  - This study explores the commitment of a school faculty to use the pedagogical practices needed to employ a project-based unit of Science, Technology, Religion, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STREAM). The unit of study concentrated on environmental sustainability of butterflies through project-based learning (PBL). Teacher interviews were analyzed to reveal the similarities and differences, strengths and weaknesses in the teachers' reactions to implementing a cross-curricula content unit designed for a pre-kindergarten (PK) to eighth grade school. Analysis of teacher data and classroom artifacts provided evidence of: content mastery at the student levels; implementation of scaffolding for developmental levels; and the need for flexibility in scheduling. As a result of the study, the school leadership gained new perspectives regarding how the faculty understood and implemented STREAM programming. This study contributed to the knowledge base by informing teachers and educational leaders about the level of effectiveness STREAM can have within an K-8 school.

AB  - Strengthening critical thinking abilities of citizens in the face of news published on the web represents a key challenge for education. Young citizens appear to be vulnerable in the face of poor quality news or those containing non-explicit ideologies. In the field of data science, computational and statistical techniques have been developed to automatically collect and characterize online news media in real time. Nevertheless, there is still not a lot of interdisciplinary research on how to design data exploration platforms supporting an educational process of critical citizenship. This article explores this opportunity through a case study analyzing critical thinking ability of students when facing news dealing with the social mobilization "No+APF". From data collected through 4 online exercises conducted by 75 secondary school students, 55 university students and 25 communication specialists, we investigate to what extent young citizens are able to classify news headlines and ideological orientation of news media outlets. We also question the influence of the media's brand name and the subjectivity of each participant in regards to the social mobilization "No+APF". The results underline the importance of group work, the influence of the brand name and the correlation between critical-thinking abilities and having a defined opinion.

AB  - Business is progressively integrating technologies and R&D with corporate and business strategy. This trend is creating increasing demand for executives and managers who have sufficient technology-centered knowledge to work effectively in interdisciplinary environments. This study addresses how management education could address the growing need for such pluralistic training by embracing development of undergraduate science curriculum attuned to the needs of business students. We found that science courses are part of the required curriculum at 80% of "Business Week's" "top business schools." To assess what content and learning objectives might best meet the needs of business students, we conducted a survey of educators from business, science, and arts and sciences in general and examined curriculum developed explicitly for business students at two freestanding business institutions. These results suggest that science courses could better serve business education by providing a broad picture of scientific principles and their presence in everyday life, promoting critical thinking and inductive reasoning, and enabling understanding of scientific research, technical innovation, and product development as well as their ethical and social implications. Development of such courses would require collaboration between management and science educators to ensure that the scientific content of the courses meet the highest standards of evidence-based science education and the business context is grounded in rigorous management principles and practices.

AB  - The aim of the article is to analyse subdisciplines of management and quality and sub-indicators of the European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS) as a measure of innovation management: 1.1.1 "New doctorate graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) per 1,000 population aged 25-34," 1.2.1 "International scientific co-publications per million population"; 1.2.3 "Foreign doctorate students as a percentage of all doctorate students." As Kotarbinski (Kotarbinski, T. (1961). Elementy teorii poznania, logiki formalnej i metodologii nauk (p. 516). Wroclaw: Zaklad Narodowy im. Ossolinskich) and Lisinski, the research procedure was divided into exploration, explication, operationalization, and verification. Triangulation (diversity) of data sources, methods, theories, and researchers has been used. Research methods: literature studies, method of document examination with secondary data analysis, descriptive analysis, comparative analysis, cause and effect analysis. For 12 Member States indicator values 1.1.1 "New doctorate graduates" the first sub-indicator of the EIS 2022 declined in 2020, and for only one Member State it increased (Finland). There is a similarity between indicator 1.1.1 and the Summary Innovation Index (SII), which could mean that the fewer New Doctorate graduates (Indicator values by country in 2022) the worse the SII is. This result is worse than in 2019, the last year before the COVID-19 pandemic, when indicator values declined for only six Member States. However, also in 2016, there was an increase in the number of Member States for which performance declined, and in 2017, this number was also high. Considering that completing a doctorate degree is the result of various years of study, the increase in 2020 in the number of Member States showing a decline in the indicator is not likely to be related to the Covid-19 pandemic as this would be too early to observe any possible impact. The more (higher indicator) doesn't always mean better innovation, as authors. Recommendation: to change the EIS 2022 description from "classification scheme" to "typology," because the scheme had doubled items or change the scale (we could see that the scale for EIS 2018 and EIS 2022 doubled in terms of ranges for strong and moderate innovators (the range ending and starting, ex. for EIS 2018 in 90% and EIS 2022 in 100%)). The recommended changes in the scale are for strong innovators in EIS 2018: above 90-120%, EIS 2022: above 100 to 125%. In 2017, the indicator "New doctoral graduates per 1,000 inhabitants aged 25-34" in many European countries, including Poland, is below the values of 2010 year, and in 2017, Poland was in the second place since the end of the ranking. The international conferences, also for PhD Candidates, maybe could help to improve the EIS indicator and its sub-indicators (ex. 1.2.1 International scientific co-publications per million population) and also compare and broaden the knowledge about different scientific methods, techniques, and tools in member countries and its network. Short-term mobilities could increase the sub-indicator 1.2.3 Foreign doctorate students as a percentage of all doctorate students (better: "candidates"), but also help PhD Candidates, who cannot leave a country for a long period or could help PhD Candidates during the war in Ukraine and in other countries. But it doesn't mean that we need to promote wars to increase sub indicator. International mobility could help to achieve Level 8 of the Polish Classification Framework, which must be met by a doctoral candidate, i.e.: "is able to plan and implement an individual and team research or creative project, lead and bear responsibility for the group, participate in the exchange of ideas, also in the international environment." There is in EIS 2022 in the UE, and in all member countries, increase of scientific publications (which is a unique situation in EIS) like articles, including international, we may consider promoting the PhD as a connection of a few articles what is important, e.g. in Medicine, Law, Engineering's studies. Such a way is possible, but unfortunately not popular in Poland, despite article 187. point 3 Act of 20 July 2018 Law on Higher Education and Science (Ustawa z dnia (2018)): "a doctoral dissertation may consist of a written thesis, including a scientific monograph, a collection of published and thematically related scientific articles, a design, construction, technological, implementation or artistic work, as well as an independent and separate part of a collective work." It is also important that PhD candidates be paid for their work in a proper way and allowed to graduate studies thanks to a collection of published and thematically related scientific articles. Many issues were not discussed in detail. The voluminousness of the material and the combination of issues with two different subdisciplines could cause chaos. Interdisciplinary subdisciplinary analysis can be used to look for potential problems to be solved in PhD thesis, to provide an impetus for further work by other scientists wishing to use the right methods, techniques, and tools and be a new doctorate graduated in STEM. Presentation of the modified model of Nadler (Nadler, G. (1967). Work system design: The ideals concept. Irwin: Homewood) and Szarucki (Szarucki, M. (2016). Modele doboru metod w rozwiazywaniu problemów zarzadzania w ujeciu G. Nadlera. Zeszyty Naukowe UEK, 954(6)), indicating that there is no ideal model in practice, taking into account all methods, and we can say techniques and tools with maximum effectiveness and help to choose a specific methodology, method. PhD Candidates could help to increase innovation in countries thanks to international events, articles, and thesis.

AB  - In scientific teaching, especially in physics and chemistry, some historical aspects have been introduced at the secondary level in France, since 1993. Particularly, in 2007, the syllabuses of 11'-15' years old level ("college") propose precise activities in history of science and technology. Detailed guidance has been distributed in official ministerial literature. The invention of Volta's battery in 1800 is one of the examples proposed, which is detailed here.

AB  - There has been increased attention paid to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics also known as STEM. The focus on STEM has been both educational and occupational. Unfortunately, students with disabilities perform below their peers without disabilities in math and science. The authors discuss issues related to STEM and students with disabilities. These issues include (1) traditional views of STEM education, (2) the importance of STEM education, and (3) students with disabilities performance in STEM. The authors posit a framework for STEM education for students with disabilities and promote the incorporation of the arts to increase students' STEM knowledge and achievement.

AB  - There are a number of examples in technology education history of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary efforts linking technology education with other disciplines; however, there has never been a time in technology education where multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary efforts are not only promising but also may be essential for the prosperity of technology education. One important example of blurred boundaries caused by a multidisciplinary effort from the recent past was the Math, Science, and Technology (MST) movement in the early 1990s. The MST movement had an important impact on technology education, and a strong case can be made that the MST efforts of the 1990s paved the way for the recent STEM education initiatives. In this article, the author seeks to make the case that no previous multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary efforts within technology education's history has such potential to impact the field greater than the recent Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) movement. Here, the author defines the terms "multidisciplinary" and "interdisciplinary," reviews a recent history of such efforts in technology education, explores how funding can and has blurred the mission of technology education, and presents the opportunities for technology education regarding STEM education.

AB  - The conceptual positions of professional training of Masters in International Relations in Great Britain have been studied. On the basis of literary and documentary sources the basic concepts laid into contemporary theories of constructivism and cognitivism, theory of development and self-realisation of creative personality on the basis of learner-centered learning, theories of intellectual, human and cultural capital, the idea of education, science and industry integration have been revealed. The importance of structural and functional organization of Master's professional training in the system of higher education on the principles of consistency, science, multiculturalism, interdisciplinarity and continuity has been highlighted. It has been emphasized that the concept of the rational choice theory and the study of career orientations that are parts of Master's professional image are very important for the professional training of Masters in International Relations. The new ideas of solving educational problems such as the openness of higher education, participation, continuous education, the advanced development of higher education have been analyzed. The basic directions of the system development of Masters in International Relations' professional training, including education focus on the problems of post-industrial civilization, the development of man's creative abilities; taking into account the status and prognosis of the economy, labour market, information technology development, the objective needs of updating professional education and learning have been defined.

AB  - Combining mathematics and environmental issues may be a valuable way not only to increase environmental awareness of students but also provide real life context to the mathematics lessons. In this study, it was aimed to explore changes in the views of 5th grade students toward sustainability with the help of the tasks integrating environmental education and mathematics education contents. Based on this aim, as convenient sample, a fifth-grade classroom in a private school in Tukey selected and students attending to this classroom participated in the study. Environmental education issues and mathematical contents were integrated in students' tasks and these developed tasks were applied as a regular part of the teaching processes of this classroom. Before and after applications, semi structured pre-interviews were carried out with nine students randomly selected from the classroom and the data obtained from these interviews and researcher teacher's observations were analyzed qualitatively. The findings as the changes in students' views were combined under 3 categories; students' views about environmental problems; students' own individualized role in environmental problems and students' views towards integration of environmental education and mathematics. This study may provide valuable contributions both to the mathematics education and science education fields in this regard.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report on the Multidisciplinary Sustainability Education Project (MSEP) as a framework using sustainability-themed education modules to introduce students to the need for multidisciplinary approaches to solving twenty-first-century problems while retaining traditional course strengths and content. Design/methodology/approach: The MSEP uses sustainability-themed education models and a multidisciplinary approach to link courses across disciplines. Modules are identified by an overarching question with activities designed to address the overarching question from course-specific perspectives, resulting in students writing short technical reports summarizing their results. Students then read and evaluate technical reports from other classes, and complete a summary activity designed to connect perspectives from different disciplines. Findings: The multi-method assessment identified no loss or gain in discipline-specific learning; increased understanding about the characteristics of twenty-first-century problems, in particular those related to sustainability; and increased students' favorable perceptions of introductory calculus. Assessment of increased understanding of how different disciplines can work together to understand complex problems was difficult to measure due to limitations of a project-developed assessment instrument. Originality/value: This paper contributes to undergraduate sustainability education by describing a framework for connecting courses using sustainability-themed modules. By implementing an asynchronous manner where courses use materials from the project Web site and contribute materials to the Web site after implementing a module, it is easy to incorporate a module into existing courses, any educational institution's existing structure and across institutions. The framework's flexible design allows new courses from any discipline to connect to a module, allowing for multidisciplinary connections to grow over time.

AB  - An interdisciplinary and context-driven course focused on global water issues was developed and taught at the college level. Students designed a semester-long research project, collected and analyzed data, and ultimately presented their results and conclusions to the larger community. As a result of the course, students' science literacy improved as did their curiosity and confidence in the science field. Students self-reported that they were more interested in the topic and saw connections to the course and other disciplines and real-world issues. They concluded that their ability to think through a problem increased as a result of the course. Finally, students reported that their enthusiasm and appreciation for the subject increased over the semester. (Contains 2 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - In this article, Julian Grant, a Prep VI class teacher at Bridgewater School, Worsley, Manchester, explores the cross-curricular nature of language in scientific recording and how children can waken an audible science world with words. The ideas that came from what started as an applied vocabulary exercise demonstrated just how many cross-curricular links can be made, emphasising the power of well-chosen topic titles. It also showed the need for clear focus when making subject links as it would be easy to be swamped by a flood of initially exciting ideas that drain away to diffuse, diluted, insubstantial outcomes. For Grant, the most important outcome of the exercise--the factor that has had the greatest impact on recording observations in science--is the understanding that descriptive vocabulary is as essential and precise a scientific tool as any measuring scale, newton meter, stopwatch, or graph.

AB  - An eight-session interdisciplinary laboratory curriculum has been designed using a suite of analytical chemistry techniques to study biomaterials derived from an inexpensive source such as the tomato fruit. A logical
progression of research-inspired laboratory modules serves to "tour" the macroscopic characteristics of the fruit and the submicroscopic properties of its constituent cuticular biopolymers by atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV-visible, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods at increasingly detailed molecular levels. The modular curriculum can be
tailored for specialty undergraduate courses or summer high school workshops. By applying analytical tools to investigate biopolymers, making connections between molecular and microscale structure, and linking both structural regimes to the functional properties of natural polymers, groundwork is established for further student investigations at the interface of chemistry with biology or chemical engineering.

AB  - We describe the content and organization of a series of day-long field trips to a university for high school students that connect chemistry content to issues of sustainability. The seven laboratory activities are in the areas of environmental degradation, energy production, and green chemistry. The laboratory procedures have been modified from published procedures so that the length and scope would be appropriate for our format and audience (AP and college preparatory chemistry and environmental science students). While students spend the majority of their time at the university in the laboratory, connections between the chemistry content and sustainability are highlighted in the previsit reading assignments, prelab discussion, and postlab small group discussion. Results of formative assessment are presented, as are considerations for other institutions that may be interested in developing and maintaining a similar program.

AB  - As societal challenges involving sustainable development increase, the need to effectively integrate this inherently multidisciplinary topic into existing curricula becomes more pressing. Multidisciplinary, team-taught, project-based instruction has shown effectiveness in teaching teamwork, communication, and life-long learning skills, and appreciation for other disciplines. Unfortunately, this instruction mode has not been widely adopted, largely due to its resource-intensiveness. Our proposed co-instruction model of multidisciplinary senior project administration was tested to see if it could effectively teach sustainability topics and duplicate the known benefits of team-taught instruction, while overcoming its resource-intensiveness. A case study of a co-instructed senior project was undertaken with students and faculty from electrical and mechanical engineering, business, political science, and industrial design. The participating students were compared to the control group, i.e. students who chose to complete a traditional disciplinary senior project instead. Extensive assessment was performed with pre/post quizzes, online surveys, focus groups, and course deliverables. The multidisciplinary projects outperformed traditional senior projects in 4 out of the 5 participating courses. However, the students in the multidisciplinary project rated their satisfaction with the experience lower on average than the control group. A strong, positive correlation between students' project satisfaction and rating of other instruction aspects (0.50 < r < 0.7, p < 0.01) was discovered, which has implications for all project-based instruction. Participating faculty generally found the process illuminating and engaged in scholarship and creative endeavors as a result.

AB  - The study of ruthenium polypyridyl complexes can be widely applied across disciplines in the undergraduate curriculum. Ruthenium photochemistry has advanced many fields including dye-sensitized solar cells, photoredox catalysis, lightdriven water oxidation, and biological electron transfer. Equally promising are ruthenium polypyridyl complexes that provide a sterically bulky, photolabile moiety for transiently "caging" biologically active molecules. Photouncaging involves the use of visible (1-photon) or near-IR (2-photon) light to break one or more bonds between ruthenium and coordinated ligand(s), which can occur on short time scales and in high quantum yields. In this work we demonstrate the use of a model "caged" acetonitrile complex, Ru(2,2'-bipyridine)[subscript 2](acetonitrile)[subscript 2], or RuMeCN in an advanced synthesis and physical chemistry laboratory. Students made RuMeCN in an advanced synthesis laboratory course and performed UV-vis spectroscopy and electrochemistry. The following semester students investigated RuMeCN photolysis kinetics in a physical chemistry laboratory. These two exercises may also be combined to create a 2-week module in an advanced undergraduate laboratory course.

AB  - This 5E (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate) learning cycle integrating science and mathematics challenges and engages second-grade students in designing sail cars to solve an engineering problem. Students create and use line plots to organize their data to evaluate the strengths and weakness of their design solutions. Three strategies were used to plan for successful integration in a 5E learning cycle. Integrating the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields can increase student interest and learning (Becker and Park 2011), and the authors' experiences with this integrated project support this finding. The integrated learning activities and assessments presented in this article are the result of collaboration between elementary classroom teachers, preservice teachers, and higher education faculty, but the strategies used could be implemented by anyone seeking to integrate math and science in an elementary classroom.

AB  - This book provides a platform for international scholars to share evidence for effective practices in integrated STEM education and contributes to the theoretical and practical knowledge gained from the diversity of approaches. Many publications on STEM education focus on one or two of the separate STEM disciplines without considering the potential for delivering STEM curriculum as an integrated approach. This publication analyzes the efficacy of an integrated STEM curriculum and instruction, providing evidence to examine and support various integrations. The volume focuses on the problems seen by academics working in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and provides valuable, high quality research outcomes and a set of valued practices which have demonstrated their use and viability to improve the quality of integrated STEM education.

AB  - Every object we think of or encounter, whether a natural or human-made, has a regular or irregular shape. In its own intrinsic conceptual design, it has elements of mathematics, science, engineering, and arts, etc., which are part of the object's geometric shape, form and structure. Geometry is not only an important part of mathematics, but it is also an important part of daily life. However, geometry is challenging for some students, even high-achieving students. One way to help students understand geometry and its relevance in life is to engage students to discover them cognitively, then to research and identify them in real world examples and then to relate them to past, present, and future innovations that improved our way of thinking about ourselves and the world around us. This interdisciplinary activity uses the Developmental Awareness Approach of Teaching and Learning (DAATL) to help students discover principles, acquire knowledge, and learn mathematical concepts including surface area, volume, dimensions, regular and irregular plane figures, solid polygons (regular polygons and polyhedra), thinking design, and graph making, etc. It is designed to help students become acquainted with the most useful and familiar parts of mathematical geometry and its application in daily life through connections with disciplines such as science, engineering, art, design, and social studies. The Development Awareness Approach of Teaching and Learning (DAATL) capitalizes on students' natural curiosity, inclination to comprehend as well as students love of drawing, doodling, painting, thinking and talking. Throughout the learning process, students are engaged in authentic learning activities by real and concrete doing with clear purposes, thinking analytically, and evaluating their understanding of texts and ideas orally, in drawing, and in writing. This approach of teaching and learning has been tried and modified to ensure maximum effectiveness of acquiring understanding of the intended learning concepts. The activities can be used with students in elementary school up to 2-year college levels.

AB  - We conducted a literature review of using educational technology in biology learning from 2001 to 2010. A total of 36 empirical articles were included for review. Based upon the content analyses of these studies, such as technologies utilized, student sample, biological topics involved, the research purpose, and methodology, the following observations were revealed. Among the different types of technologies, the majority of studies utilized simulations or visualization tools. Genetics and molecular biology were the most popular biological topics. Most studies examined students' conceptual outcomes, fewer studies examined affective outcomes, and a few studies examined higher-order skills. Also a small number of studies observed students' learning processes. Beyond simply the comparison for traditional teaching versus technology-assisted learning, some studies emphasized comparing different technologies or different representations. This review also suggested some future research directions. For example, more studies should use technologies for interdisciplinary training and for fostering problem-solving skills.

AB  - Using an interdisciplinary approach to water resource education, 4-H Youth Development and Environmental Extension agents enlisted 4-H teens to connect local watershed education with social action. Teens participated in a dynamic service learning project that included learning about nonpoint source pollution; constructing, decorating, and teaching families about rain barrels; and selling the barrels at the county fair. The program resulted in significant knowledge increase among the teens. Furthermore, rain barrel installation rates were higher than the average rates of similar Extension programs. This program, while small in scale, illustrates the potential of employing teens as teachers in interdisciplinary Extension programs.

AB  - The paper provides a theoretical synthesis that addresses the multiple calls to consider the existence of an integrated nature of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). The nature of STEM (NOSTEM) has been advocated for as a way to promote effective STEM instruction in K-16 education and has been challenged as being non-existent. We propose a theoretical conceptualization of the NOSTEM through a convergent model that integrates the shared characteristics of the nature of knowledge and nature of inquiry practices of each of the four STEM disciplines. We propose this model in light of the siloed individual disciplines by considering the dimensions of each and whether they are pure or applied or attend to questions and issues surrounding the physical and non-physical world(s). Using this synthesis and model, we argue that the NOSTEM is congruent with the nature of engineering (NOE). This finding has multiple implications for all stakeholders (i.e., teachers, researchers, policy makers) in STEM education. First, we caution stakeholders from using this model to create or change educational policies or standards but rather work to validate, extend, and challenge the model in light of STEM education reform. Second, with the congruency between our model of NOSTEM and NOE, we charge scholars to work to illuminate the critical aspects of the nature of engineering "knowledge." Third, if the model withstands the scrutiny of STEM scholars (i.e., researchers and teachers), it has the potential to inform teaching and learning in STEM education.

AB  - Growing from a multi-year and multidisciplinary research and applied arts investigative team based in North America, this essay presents a model of how performative engagements contribute to individual behavioural change in wellness practices. To be even more specific, this essay analyses and theorises the mechanisms involved in the application of one particular art form to one particular pre-condition for health. The art form: applied theatre. The pre-condition: attitudes, behaviours and beliefs about healthy eating. The co-authors ask not "what can theatre-making do to have a positive effect on health-related attitudes and behaviors?" but rather "how does it do that?" and offer a model towards answering that question that might satisfy the needs of researchers in both applied theatre and health science.

AB  - Green chemistry is the design, development and implementation of chemical products and processes to reduce or eliminate the use of sub-stances hazardous to human health and the environment. This article reports on the integration of green chemistry and sustainable development concepts (SDCs) into an existing teaching methods course for chemistry pre-service teachers. Incorporation of SDCs with green chemistry enhances the interdisciplinary nature of green chemistry. It is in line with the course purpose of introducing instructional strategies for teaching chemistry at the secondary level. Through the experiences of hands-on activities, writing lesson plans and integration of SDC content into lectures and discussion, pre-service teachers learned how to integrate these elements into their own courses. The design of this course is an example of how to integrate green chemistry incorporated with SDCs into a teacher education curriculum. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - The foundation upon which surgical residents are trained to work comprises more than just critical cognitive, clinical, and technical skill. In an environment where the synchronous application of expertise is vital to patient outcomes, the expectation for optimal functioning within a multidisciplinary team is extremely high. Studies have shown that for most residents, one of the most difficult milestones in the path to achieving professional expertise in a surgical career is overcoming the learning curve. This view point commentary provides a reflection from the two senior medical students who have participated in the Student-as-Teacher program developed by the Department of Anatomy at Mayo Clinic, designed to prepare students for their teaching assistant (TA) role in anatomy courses. Both students participated as TAs in a six week surgical anatomy course for surgical first assistant students offered by the School of Health Sciences at Mayo Clinic. Development of teaching skills, nontechnical leadership, communication, and assessment skills, are discussed in relation to their benefits in preparing senior medical students for surgical residency.

AB  - Background: Experiential educators face difficulties assessing participants and programs because there are so many measurement tools to choose from, many measures have validity issues such as those based on self-reported data, objective tests may not adequately measure social or psychological outcomes, and tests in content disciplines often assess knowledge rather than skill in synthesis, analysis, or evaluation. Purpose: We hypothesized that an open-ended essay final would reliably measure individual growth, internalization of foundational threshold concepts in our disciplines, and the effectiveness of our outdoor, interdisciplinary program. Methodology/Approach: Student essays contained 36 student-generated concepts spread across our four disciplines (biology, writing, history, and recreation) which we compared with 20 threshold concepts from professional literature. Findings/Conclusions: Individual students identified about half of the concepts generated by the whole group, illustrating that their learning varied significantly. Our group identified 13 of the published threshold concepts. Students demonstrated comprehension of threshold concepts--foundational ways of seeing--as opposed to restatements of information from teachers' lectures. Implications: Writing essays aids permanent cognitive and behavioral learning; coding responses to open-ended essay questions for threshold concepts can be a valuable tool for both individual student and program assessment in experiential education.

AB  - Students at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, can now take an innovative biology course in which an integrated, interdisciplinary, problem-based approach is used--one that the scientific community itself is promoting. The first course in a four-semester sequence, Biology 123--The Living World: Concepts and Connections--explores real-world problems and biology's role in addressing these major societal issues. In Bio123, students learn core biological concepts while developing their problem-solving and quantitative skills and applying their new knowledge to societal challenges related to food, the environment, energy, and health. Too often, faculty use teaching methods that do not support the ways in which people learn, the needs of the world, or the job market. By focusing on sustainability, students can experience firsthand the relevance of their science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses and can gain insight into how they can contribute to solving challenging global problems both throughout their lives and through their own career choices.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate how patterns of collaboration and scholarly independence are related to early stage researchers' development in two multidisciplinary learning environments at a Swedish university. Based on interviews with leaders, supervisors, doctoral students, and post docs, results show how early stage researchers' development is conditioned by their relative positions in time (career stage) and space (geographical and epistemic position). Through the theoretical notions of 'epistemic living space' and 'developmental networks', four ways of experiencing the multidisciplinary learning environment were distinguished. Overall, the environments provided a "world of opportunities," where the epistemic living space entailed many possibilities for cross-disciplinary collaboration and development of scholarly independence among peers. However, depending on the members' relative positions in time and space, this world became "an alien world" for the post docs who had been forced to become "over-independent" and find collaborators elsewhere. Moreover, it became "an avoided world" for absent mono-disciplinary supervisors and students who embodied "non-collective independence", away from the environments' community. By contrast, "a joint world" emerged for doctoral students located in the environment, which promoted their "independent positioning" and collaborative ambitions. Thus, early stage researchers' collaboration and development of scholarly independence were optimised in a "converged learning space," where the temporal and spatial conditions were integrated and equally conducive for learning. Based on these results, the authors provide suggestions for how to improve the integration of scholars who tend to develop away from the community because of their temporal and spatial positions.

AB  - While traditional practices of critical reading, writing, dialogue, and discussion are no doubt essential inputs and outputs of higher education and a means of achieving critical thinking in college students, recent science and pedagogical innovation can help develop additional, unique methodologies that can have more immediate significance for learners. These tools are especially useful for honors students. One such device is First-Person Noting, a technique that not only furthers general educational goals but also may advance honors distinctiveness and learner-oriented experience that is cross- and multi-disciplinary. Through First-Person Noting, students observe and acknowledge the subjective elements of their academic experience, in particular the thoughts, sensations, and feelings that occur while they read, write, listen, discuss, and reflect. First-Person Noting is described and its use for honors students is explained in this article.

AB  - Methods for teaching early childhood mathematics and science are often addressed in a single, dual-content course. Approaches to teaching this type of course include integrating the content and the pedagogy of both subjects, or keeping the subject areas distinct. In this article, the authors discuss and illustrate their approach to such a combined course. They emphasize the development of preservice teachers' distinct pedagogical content knowledge in mathematics and in science rather than an integration of the two. The authors do this by concentrating their course development on a central unifying theme or idea within each content-area. Through course readings, media, in-class activities and discussions, and fieldwork, the authors highlight the similarities and differences between early childhood mathematics and science methods, thus offering preservice teachers a conceptual infrastructure that empowers them to make informed choices about their own mathematics and science programs.

AB  - Biology students need analytical and critical thinking skills to analyze data and apply their knowledge to real-life situations. To meet this growing need while helping students to discover the relevance of learning through applications, we created an academic learning community (LC) between Ecology and Biostatistics courses. Selected case-studies and their corresponding data from the Ecology lab were incorporated into Biostatistics. Our data demonstrated that the LC group might have improved their statistical knowledge and their understanding of ecological problems more than the non-LC group and that LC promoted interactions among students and between instructors and students. We discuss key criteria that permitted the LC development, the evidence of its effectiveness, limitations of this study, and ways to improve the LC.

AB  - The article deals with the study of foreign experience in training engineering educators for modeling technological processes. It has been stated that engineering education is a field that is being dramatically developed taking into account the occurring changes in educational paradigms, global higher education space, national higher education systems, economics, society, etc. It has been indicated that the abundance of the latest information and communication technologies alter the approaches to training various specialists, and, in particular, engineering educators. It has been mentioned that engineering teacher education is undergoing significant development. The activities of the International Society for Engineering Education--IGIP have been justified. It has been found out that there is the vital need for those specialists able to combine the techniques of traditional teaching and innovative scientific achievements, design technical structures, be leader and facilitator of the education process. It has been defined that the activity of the society is aimed at providing engineering educators with relevant training that involves their obtaining the qualification that is accorded with European education standards. US experience in training engineering educators for professional activity has been analyzed. It has been specified that engineering education has become more integrated into the curricula of elementary, middle and high school because of the increasing focus on STEM subjects; the demand for engineering educators is dramatically growing at all the levels of the education system. The peculiarities of engineering educators' training have been demonstrated on the example of the Purdue Polytechnic Institute. It has been concluded that Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology Teacher Education is a rather interdisciplinary degree program and trains future engineering educators for a wide range of fields. The organization of the program is considerate and well-planned. It has been stated that in Great Britain future engineering educators should be able to apply innovative and less conventional teaching methodology, namely, via problem-based learning, virtual learning environment, etc. According to the mentioned above, the author has outlined the recommendations to improve engineering teacher education in Ukraine.

AB  - To evaluate the impact of a multidisciplinary, project-based course in introductory statistics, this exploratory study examined learning experiences, feelings of confidence, and interest in future experiences with data for undergraduate students in Ghana, West Africa. Students completed a one-semester, introductory statistics course utilizing the Passion-Driven Statistics curriculum. Results showed more than half of the students put more effort into the course and found the material more challenging compared to other courses, while nearly three-quarters reported interest in one or more follow-up courses. Importantly, students also reported increased confidence in a variety of applied statistical skills. These findings demonstrate the positive impact of a multidisciplinary, project-based curriculum on undergraduate students in Ghana, West Africa and demonstrate the potential for its global portability.

AB  - Spatial reasoning is defined as the ability to generate, retain, and manipulate abstract visual images. In chemistry, spatial reasoning skills are typically taught using 2-D paper-based models, 3-D handheld models, and computerized models. These models are designed to aid student learning by integrating information from the macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic domains of chemistry. Research has shown that increased spatial reasoning abilities translate directly to improved content knowledge. The recent explosion in the popularity of smartphones and the development of augmented reality apps for them provide, a yet to be explored, way of teaching spatial reasoning skills to chemistry students. Augmented reality apps can use the camera on a smartphone to turn 2-D paper-based molecular models into 3-D models the user can manipulate. This paper will discuss the development, implementation, and assessment of an augmented reality app that transforms 2-D molecular representations into interactive 3-D structures.

AB  - "Kahua A'o," a National Science Foundation Opportunities for Enhancing Diversity in the Geosciences project, seeks to prepare educators to address issues of underrepresentation of Native Hawaiian students in Earth and Space Science (ESS) and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. An interdisciplinary team provides culturally grounded, place and standards-based curricula, and professional development (PD), drawing on 4,000-plus weather- and geology-related, Hawaiian-language newspaper articles that convey the importance of ecological knowledge to identity, social status, and sustainability. The project expands Hawaiian resources for science educators and scientists, supports revitalization of an endangered language, and presents original research correlating articles on drought and rains with 19th century El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Professional development with two cohorts of educators finds interest in studying local phenomena, using technology to map cultural and science phenomena, incorporating place and culture into instruction, and, in some schools, challenges to implementing interdisciplinary instruction

AB  - Writing, a critical pedagogical tool, cultivates student learning and fosters deeper understanding of the material. When frequent, low-stakes (informal) writing activities help students write more freely, engage with the material and thus become active learners. Looking at students who are at opposite ends of a community college spectrum, this article compares and contrasts students' writing skills using low-stakes assignments, including peer-reviewing of each other's work, in a capstone course and in a First-Year Seminar in terms of organization, clarity in communication and content analysis. The data generated from this study stem from an interdisciplinary collaboration among three instructors from Humanities, Mathematics and Natural Sciences, with the goal of creating a network between students in First-Year Seminars and students in the capstone course. Research methods in this context included assigning common readings to students in different classes on the theme of Women in STEM. It also included a peer review component: students reviewed each other's assignments and instructors visited each other's class to lead a discussion on the paucity of women in the fields of sciences or as Nobel Prize winner, with the additional aim of improving women's interest in STEM courses.

AB  - The authors present the individual and collective results of a university-wide initiative to institutionalize a hybrid pedagogical approach--Creative Inquiry--across multiple academic disciplines. The program is intended to systematically combine inquiry-guided learning and creative thinking in order to further enhance the depth and breadth of pedagogical transformation. This transformation is explored using a series of case studies drawn from courses in nursing; science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); the social sciences; and the humanities, as well as institutional-level assessments. They then, in turn, draw upon these cases to consider effective strategies for designing, disseminating, and assessing organizational change.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: The purpose of this article is to provide an overview and analysis of the emerging research landscape surrounding the integration of ChatGPT into education. The main problem appears to be that this is a new, rapidly developing research area for which there is no comprehensive synthesis of the current literature. The aim of the article is to fill this gap by conducting a timely bibliometric study to map publication trends, influential works, themes, and opportunities, thus representing the growth and structure of ChatGPT educational research. Background: This article addresses the issue of the lack of a comprehensive synthesis of the new research on ChatGPT in education by conducting a bibliometric analysis. Specifically, the authors use statistical and network analysis techniques to examine the patterns of publication, citation, and keywords and map the growth, contributions, themes, structure, and opportunities in this evolving field. The bibliometric approach provides a comprehensive, evidence-based overview of the current state of the literature to uncover trends and gaps and help researchers improve their understanding of appropriate and effective applications of ChatGPT in educational contexts. Methodology: The authors used bibliometric analysis as the primary method to summarize the new research on ChatGPT in education. We searched the database of the Web of Science Core Collection to find 51 relevant documents from 2023 that included ChatGPT in the title and were classified as 'educational research.' The sample consisted of these 51 documents, including articles, early access articles, editorials, reviews, and letters. Statistical techniques examined publication, citation, and keyword patterns. Network analysis visualized citation and cooccurrence networks to reveal intellectual structure. The multifaceted bibliometric approach allowed a comprehensive study of the sample from a productive, conceptual, and intellectual perspective. Contribution: This article conducts comprehensive bibliometric analysis of this emerging research area and synthesizes publication, citation, and keyword data to map the growth and structure of the literature. The results reveal important trends, such as the rapid growth of publications since the release of ChatGPT, initial authorship patterns, the focus on higher education applications, and distinct research clusters around pedagogical, ethical, and assessment issues. Visualizing citation networks identifies seminal studies while mapping co-occurrence clarifies conceptual relationships between topics. The comparative analysis highlights the differences between document types, topics, and time periods. Knowledge mapping highlights gaps in the literature, such as lack of focus on K-12 contexts, and highlights opportunities for further research. Findings: Key findings from this bibliometric analysis of the emerging research landscape surrounding ChatGPT integration in education include the following: (1) Since ChatGPT was released in late 2022, the number of releases has increased significantly, indicating rapid growth in this emerging space; (2) The most cited authors initially came primarily from Anthropic, but over time, the citations spread throughout the research community; (3) The topics focused primarily on higher education applications, with a clear focus on pedagogical strategies, ethical risks, and implications for assessment; (4) Citation networks visualized seminal studies, while the co-occurrence of keywords clarified conceptual connections; (5) Gaps such as applications in the K-12 context were uncovered, and opportunities for further research were highlighted; and (6) The literature is rapidly evolving and requires ongoing monitoring of the development of this field. In general, the analysis presents the productivity, contributors, themes, structure, and opportunities in this emerging area around the integration of ChatGPT in education based on current scientific evidence. The key findings focus on the growing early interest, gaps and developments that can provide insight for researchers and educators. Recommendations for Practitioners: Practitioners should carefully integrate ChatGPT into education based on new evidence, carefully assess contextual applicability, and proactively develop guidelines for ethical and equitable implementation. Ongoing advice, impact monitoring, and research partnerships are crucial to informing best practices. Educators must be vigilant for risks such as privacy, student well-being, and competence impairment while staying abreast of advances in knowledge to dynamically adapt integration strategies. The introduction should empower diverse learners through measured, integrative approaches based on continuous contextual analysis and ethical principles. Recommendations for Researchers: This article recommends that researchers conduct more studies in under-researched contexts, use multiple methods to capture nuanced impacts, increase focus on responsible integration strategies, develop tailored assessments, conduct interdisciplinary collaborations, monitor long-term adoption, mix with interactive explain and publish open access technologies, help guide adoption pathways through actionable studies, and synthesize the exponentially growing literature through updated systematic reviews. Impact on Society: The rapid publication growth and prevailing optimism suggest that the integration of ChatGPT into education will accelerate, increasing the need for rigorous research that guides ethical, responsible innovations that avoid risks and improve outcomes in all educational contexts. The findings have broader implications for guiding adoption trajectories through ongoing evidence synthesis and expanded investigations in under-researched areas to address knowledge gaps. Ultimately, continued monitoring and updated guidance are critical to ensure that ChatGPT's educational penetration progresses carefully by maximizing benefits and minimizing harms in rapidly evolving AI-powered learning ecosystems. Future Research: Based on the basic mapping provided by this paper, recommended research directions include longitudinal impact studies, research tailored to under-researched contexts such as K-12, qualitative research to capture stakeholder perspectives, development and testing of AI-calibrated assessments as well as explorations that combine conversational and interactive learning technologies, updated systematic reviews, and co-designed implementation research that explain pedagogical strategies that ethically unlock learning potential while mitigating risks in diverse educational environments. Such multilayered tracking can provide critical insights to guide context-specific, responsible ChatGPT integration and monitor impact within rapidly evolving AI-powered education ecosystems.

AB  - Collaboration plays a major role in interdisciplinary activities among Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics (STEM) disciplines or fields. It also affects the relationships among cluster members on the management team. Although effective collaboration does not guarantee success among STEM disciplines, its absence usually assures problems. More specifically, collaboration has the obvious roles of identifying talents coming together for a common purpose of combining knowledge and sharing responsibility, creativity, and experience of others. Facilitating collaboration across Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields in program development is critical to providing a strong educational foundation to all learners in STEM education. This synergistic effort among educators and other professionals across the STEM fields will enable effective knowledge sharing in program development. This paper addresses leadership and knowledge sharing among collaborators in STEM program development through facilitating collaboration across STEM fields.

AB  - This paper highlights an investigation of how middle school students responded to a theatre performance designed to portray science as a humanistic and relatable endeavour that youth -- similar to the youth in the audience -- engage in during their everyday lives. The play included in this study was generated as a part of a design research project with a collaborative community comprised of artists, scientists, educators, and researchers. The design and implementation of this cross-disciplinary intervention and the research included in this study represent the design team's initial attempts to better understand youths' response to dramatic productions, and specifically which characters' practices youth 'count' as scientific. The design and goals of the project are described, followed by an analysis of focus group interviews with students (N = 65), which were conducted after watching the play. Despite the design team's intentions, findings highlight that the majority of students included in this study recognised a narrow range of practices taking place in the play as scientific, which led to a process of re-examination, complication, and interrogation the findings and design. Guided by Butler's theory of performativity, this paper is used as a reflection space in order to theorise this work in a new direction.

AB  - Educational perspectives from Hawaiian points of view in all areas of Native Hawaiian health are timely and critical to share today, as remarkable and unprecedented collaborations within the Hawaiian community are addressing not only the overall health and wellness of Hawaiians, but a range of additional culturally grounded issues, such as healing from intergenerational/historical trauma, visioning for an alternative system of healthcare, and social justice. Examples of such collaborative efforts include Na Limahana O Lonopuha, a consortium of health professionals from a wide range of disciplines; the diverse range of community, cultural and health related groups involved in the E Ola Mau a Mau project with Papa Ola Lokahi; as well as Kukulukumuhana, another gathering of organizations and members from the community, all of whom are working tirelessly to confront persistent health disparities and improve the health and wellness of Native Hawaiians. The deep and ambitious work of reimagining how Hawaiian institutions and providers could begin the work of making substantive change in systems thinking laterally, which would more closely align with cultural healing practices, is the direction Hawaiians are moving toward together. This coalescing of organizations and individuals is also happening in educational circles as many have worked for years to bring parity and cultural awareness to learning within the school environment and beyond. This article describes the invitation for visual artists to join this conversation and the role of the visual arts to offer ways for Hawaiian communities to see and experience concepts such as historical trauma, health, and healing in novel, dynamic, and lively ways. This article tells the story of how the visual arts can contribute to healing and also be viewed as part of a comprehensive cross sector prespective for achieving health and wellness.

AB  - Music education research has in recent years been interested in defining music education's societal mission. Concepts such as praxial music education, artistic citizenship, or an activist approach tried to determine that music education's foremost task would be to transform societies. This seemed urgent in view of global crises. But is music education's foremost mission really social change? To a certain degree, this is a sociological question. To answer it, a look back to the beginnings of sociology as a field of research is a promising way to go. When sociology emerged as a specific field of investigation, it was not clear if its task would be only analyzing how societies work or proposing necessary changes. The tension between the present and the future, between reality and "utopia" was significant for an emerging field. But the close connection to utopia got lost over time. Sociologist Ruth Levitas revives the approach of understanding sociology as a utopian field and develops the concept of the imaginary reconstitution of society. Furthermore, scholars in utopian studies or political science emphasize the usefulness of utopia in critical relation to transforming societies. Understanding sociology as a utopian field could provide innovative ideas for music education.

AB  - This article is a review of the literature related to the cognitive, learning, behavioral, and cultural styles of African American children. This is an assessment of the progress that has been made since 1982 when my first book was published. Several flaws in the creation of the science that undergirds learning styles research related to African American children are identified. First of all, a precise definition of what we are studying is not there. Second, the instruments have not been created to measure the target constructs. Third, we need to collaborate on an interdisciplinary basis to create the science to support culturally appropriate instructional practices and child and classroom management procedures. Fourth, the problems with inadequate science have been compounded by imprecision in the measurement of social class as pertains to the achievement of African American children.

AB  - This article aims to investigate environmental education in preschools by taking Donna Haraway's call of "staying with the trouble" together with preschool children seriously, here-and-now, in explorations of dirty water and water purification. This posthumanist inspired research project draws theoretically and methodologically on the writings of Haraway, Anna L. Tsing and Isabelle Stengers. The empirical data consist of three stories from a multidisciplinary intervention research project in the Stockholm region in Sweden, collected from collaboratively produced data such as films, photographs, drawings, and notes from the project. The study can be seen as an invitation to preschools to engage in the debate on climate change and to create a togetherness around environmental concerns, not only in the future, but also here-and-now in the preschool.

AB  - This article describes a unit in which students were able to create projects that went far beyond the initial scope of what the authors imagined due to the scaffolded and sociocultural learning environment (Vygotsky, 1978). The article begins with an explanation of constructivism, design thinking, and Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM), as they relate to the approach used in the authors' classroom. Students learned from and with their classmates, but also differentiated projects to meet individual vision. While the students might have gained similar knowledge about computer programming and circuitry through a classic scientific and technology unit, it would not have engaged students to consider issues of aesthetics, the design process, and the notion of using technology as a tool to transform their ideas into reality. The complementary interdisciplinary approach worked, because the theme of transformation was enhanced by using discipline-based knowledge from the fields of art, science, and technology (Hayes-Jacob, 1989). By using an approach based in design, the authors found that STEAM education, at the elementary level, provided opportunities for students to develop understandings of complex concepts through engaging projects that break down barriers between disciplines. While art education has seen dramatic shifts in terms of content and focus in the last 20 years, STEAM education offers further opportunities for the field. Educators have struggled to actualize the vision of progressive educators who aimed to centralize education around students, their knowledge, and their experiences. STEAM education opens the door to integrate design thinking as part of the K-12 educational experience.

AB  - This paper discusses the findings of a search for the intellectual tools used by Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) in his chemistry, education, and theology documents. Priestley's enquiring democratic view of knowledge was applicable in all three areas and constitutes a significant part of his lifework. Current epistemological issues in science education are examined from the point of view of the nature of theory and experiment as observed in Priestley's writings and as espoused in modern philosophy of science. Science and religious faith issues in the context of science education are examined from the point of view of one's understanding of sacred texts, and the suggestion is made that a Priestleyan model of "the liberty to think for oneself" and "to hold knowledge with humility and virtue" could prove helpful in dealing with the known divergent opinions in relation to science, education, and religion.

AB  - The connections the "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS") creates between science content and practices to literacy and mathematics are especially beneficial at the elementary level. In this article, the authors present a series of lessons a second-grade teacher taught within a thematic unit that integrated standards from science, mathematics, and literacy. The two-week unit encouraged second-grade students to investigate famous structures in the United States. Learning goals and standards in literacy, science, and mathematics all centered on exploring the history, purpose, and creation of human-made landmarks such as the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge.

AB  - A low-cost and portable colorimeter kit has been designed and developed as an educational tool at Penn State University by Dr. Daniel Sykes for K-12 schools' integrated STEM learning. This scientific instrument allows students to learn how scientists utilize light as a means to study the chemical and physical properties of materials with an accuracy of instruments such as the Ocean Optics USB 4000 Spectrophotometer costing nearly $2000. In addition, it serves as a platform to introduce the topics of wet chemistry, nanotechnology, electronics, computer Excel graphing, and algebra in the classroom. Teachers at the Park Forest Middle School (PA) had previously developed an interdisciplinary Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) team. The cross-curricular nature of the group strives to reinforce each teacher's subject areas by developing curricula and projects that connect individual subjects into a bigger, real-world picture. During the summer of 2011, two of the Park Forest Middle School STEM team members were privileged to study with Dr. Daniel Sykes, Senior Lecturer, Director of Analytical Instructional Laboratories, Department of Chemistry and Forensic Sciences Program in the University's Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program. The RET program, mentored by Dr. Francelys Medina, MRSEC Education and Outreach Coordinator, immerses K-12 teachers in hands-on research with leading scientists. During the six weeks that followed, additional members of the Park Forest Middle School STEM team staff became actively involved in developing and participating in a cutting-edge STEM endeavor centered on Dr. Sykes' colorimeter. Working in teams, technology education students assembled the colorimeters and learned how the electronic components interact to quantify electromagnetic radiation in the visible light spectrum. When completed, students utilized the instruments in science classes to test properties of various solutions with a spotlight on nanoscale particles. The data collected was entered into Excel spreadsheets for graphing/analysis in their algebra class.

AB  - This book contains a compilation of papers presented at the International Psychological Applications Conference and Trends (InPACT) 2021, organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (W.I.A.R.S.), that this year has been converted into a fully Virtual Conference as a result of the ongoing Coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic. Modern psychology offers a large range of scientific fields where it can be applied. The goal of understanding individuals and groups (mental functions and behavioral standpoints), from this academic and practical scientific discipline, aims ultimately to benefit society. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the several areas within the Psychology field, new developments in studies and proposals for future scientific projects. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between psychologists, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in psychological issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement the view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons there are nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. InPACT 2021 received 358 submissions, from more than 40 different countries from all over the world, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters and Workshops. 117 submissions (overall, 33% acceptance rate) were accepted for presentation in the conference. The Conference addresses different categories inside Applied Psychology area and papers fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. This book contains the results of the different researches conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to study and develop research in areas related to Psychology and its applications. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters that are hereby sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. [This document contains the proceedings of the virtual International Psychological Applications Conference and Trends (InPACT) 2021. The proceedings were published by inScience Press.

AB  - Scientists, researchers, and educators have promoted the improvement of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education by incorporating an interdisciplinary approach to the study of STEM; but current research offers little guidance about how this change can occur. This study expands on a new body of research examining faculty leadership in institutional change. Utilizing the "tempered radical framework" developed by Meyerson and Scully (1995) and later applied to the higher educational context by Kezar, Bertram Gallant, and Lester (2011), the current research examines faculty leadership in the implementation of an interdisciplinary STEM bridge program in biotechnology. This qualitative study relied primarily on the analysis of interviews with key faculty at four community colleges. The data revealed that faculty leaders employ strategies identified by Meyerson and Scully (1995). Further, the results of this study indicate that characteristics of tempered radical leadership may be more important than specific strategies identified by Kezar et al. (2011). First, tempered radicals are boundary spanners, able to translate their vision to appeal to the values of different stakeholders. Second, tempered radical faculty leaders maintain cognitive complexity, or the ability to perceive change from a variety of perspectives, revealing the importance of collective sensemaking around the change effort. Third, tempered radicals are savvy organizational insiders able to navigate the organizational culture and its systems and are viewed as legitimate change agents within their institutions. Understanding the characteristics of effective faculty leaders may offer guidance to other faculty interested in leading interdisciplinary change in their institutions.

AB  - Changes in the National Curriculum for England in 2014 included the introduction of levers, gears, and pulleys into primary science. Although simple mechanisms had been part of the design and technology (DT) curriculum for some time, it was the first time that the science behind the mechanisms had been included at the primary school level. These changes were an opportunity to link the two subjects together, and to reinforce students' understanding of science through different types of exploration in science and through designing, making and evaluating a product in DT. In this article, the author highlights key ideas for understanding levers and provides examples of teaching the topic in a cross-curricular approach.

AB  - The national Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Education Initiative favors a curriculum shift from the compartmentalization of math and science classes into discrete subject areas to an integrated, multidisciplinary experience. Many states are currently implementing programs in high schools that provide greater integration of math, sciences, and technology. Program evaluation results indicate that students participating in multidisciplinary team projects of this type exhibit significantly higher levels of motivation and develop greater cognitive skills than students in the traditional, compartmentalized curriculum (Ross & Hogaboam-Gray, 1988; Venville et al., 2000).

AB  - How can classrooms become communities of inquiry that connect intellectually challenging science content with language-based activities (opportunities to talk, listen, read, and write) especially in settings with diverse populations? This question guided a 3-year mixed-methods research study using the Science Writing Heuristic (SWH) approach in cooperation with 2 universities, area education agencies, 6 school districts, 32 elementary teachers, and over 700 students each year. The participating teachers engaged in a yearly summer institute, planned units, implemented this curriculum in the classroom, and contributed to ongoing data collection and analysis. Findings demonstrate that critical embedded language opportunities contribute to an increase in student Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) scores in science and language based on level of implementation particularly for elementary students who receive free and reduced lunch (an indicator of living at the poverty level).

AB  - This article provides an in-depth examination of differentiation, instructional strategies that cater to all learners. Differentiation is beneficial when teachers can select content, process, and products that meet student's needs. While teachers incorporate differentiation to modify instruction with struggling students, gifted and talented students, English Language Learners, and culturally diverse learners, this article specifically focuses on African American learners in K-6th grades. Elementary-level African American students can benefit from differentiation that include culturally relevant processes. Teachers of elementary grades must be prepared to teach all curricular areas including English language arts, reading, math, science, social studies, and history. English language arts, history, math, science, and social studies strategies are explored in this article. Recommendations have been made to make them culturally relevant pedagogy. Six strategies are introduced that provide examples of the recommended processes for various curricular areas that can be used with African American students.

AB  - Background: Small-group discussions are well established as an effective pedagogical tool to promote student learning in STEM classrooms. However, there are a variety of factors that influence how and to what extent K-12 teachers use small-group discussions in their classrooms, including both their own STEM content knowledge and their perceived ability to facilitate discussions. We designed the present study to specifically target these two factors in the context of photovoltaics, an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of all STEM disciplines with potential to yield widespread benefits related to the use of solar technologies as a sustainable, renewable energy source. Teachers engaged in a series of small-group discussions based on photovoltaic source material (e.g., scientific articles) to build both their STEM content knowledge and capability with discussions, promoting their potential to design and deliver STEM instruction in their own classrooms using small-group discussion. Results: Overall, teachers productively engaged in rich STEM talk as they spent most of the time in the discussion asking authentic questions about photovoltaic topics in alignment with a variety of science and engineering disciplinary core ideas, responding to the questions with rich, elaborative talk, and taking on ownership of the discussions. Teachers also evidenced increases in their photovoltaic knowledge and their perceived capability to facilitate discussions. Finally, most teachers' end-of-program lesson plans included the use of small-group discussions, and a subsample of teachers who completed a follow-up interview one year after the summer program reported greater enactment of discussion in their STEM classrooms. Conclusion: Our manuscript forwards an important contribution that draws from a practice-based approach to professional development in a way that not only better prepares teachers on what to teach (i.e., through enhanced PV content knowledge), but it also supports their ability to implement this instruction into their classrooms more effectively (i.e., though the use of small-group discussion). As such, this manuscript illustrates an innovative pedagogical approach for potential use in supporting teacher education and informs ways to enable teachers to build enhanced curricula for their STEM students.

AB  - This commentary aims to discuss an overarching boundary crossing framework under which integrated STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) pedagogy can be conceptualized. Four potential learning dialogical processes for boundary crossing are presented and used as the main theoretical construct for the discussion. A proposal of an interactive pedagogical framework is put forward accompanied by a provisional statement to relate the connective factors that are critical in the formation of a boundary crossing STEM pedagogy. These factors are situated learning, communities of practices, problem solving, learning dialogical processes, and boundary objects. A Hong Kong school STEM case is employed to illustrate the applicability of this framework. The commentary ends with a reflective remark on boundary crossing STEM pedagogy.

AB  - Under a previous grant (2005-08), researchers and teachers at Stanford University (SU) and the University of Gothenburg (GU) co-designed a ten-week interdisciplinary, research-based laboratory course in human biology to be taught online to undergraduate students. Essentials in the subject were taught during the first four weeks of this course. Subsequently, student groups at SU and GU developed their own research questions, conducted live-streamed experiments remotely, processed their unique data with support from multiple interactive resources, cross-cultural collaboration and an interdisciplinary network of expert consultants, and presented original scientific results remotely. Student course-perceptions were evaluated using online questionnaires, reflective blogs, and observations. In student teams from both universities, the course concept clearly improved student abilities to conduct research using laboratory experiments while learning theoretical basics. A comparison of pre- and post-course scores from student surveys showed that post-course student comfort levels with several research-related tasks increased radically at both universities. All participating staff generally agreed that the methods and tools were valuable in this type of course and should be evaluated at other levels and areas of higher education, and shared in an expanded network of universities.

AB  - This paper describes a case study of how a middle school literacy coach and a science teacher attempted to improve disciplinary literacy teaching in a sixth-grade science class. The collaborative inquiry exposed the disciplinary knowledge gap of the literacy coach (a former language arts teacher) and the science teacher's limited knowledge of literacy instruction. These shared disciplinary knowledge gaps necessitated the co-construction of collaborative practices to ameliorate the tension and improve disciplinary literacy instruction. Through a recognition of individual knowledge and the use of responsive disciplinary teaching, the participants created collaborative symbiosis. To improve disciplinary literacy teaching, schools should recognize teacher disciplinary knowledge and expand participation in discipline-specific collaborative inquiry.

AB  - The present study takes an interdisciplinary mathematics-physics approach to the acquisition of the concept of angle by children in Grades 3-5. This paper first presents the theoretical framework we developed, then we analyse the concept of angle and the difficulties pupils have with it. Finally, we report three experimental physics-based teaching sequences tested in three classrooms. We showed that at the end of each teaching sequence the pupils had a good grasp of the concept of angle, they had truly appropriated the physics knowledge at play, and many pupils are enable to successfully grasp new physics situations in which the angle plays a highly meaningful role. Using a physics framework to introduce angles in problem situations is then pertinent: by interrelating different spaces, pupils were able to acquire skills in the domains of mathematics, physics, and modelling. In conclusion, we discuss the respective merits of each problem situation proposed. (Contains 22 figures and 6 tables.)

AB  - Cross-curricula opportunities afforded by STEM education (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education), supports an environment where students can develop twenty-first century competencies. One approach to addressing cross-curricula opportunities in STEM education is the introduction of computer science (computer programming--coding) as a basic skill/literacy for all students. Coding (computer programming) is a language that draws on a set of syntax rules (or blocks for primary school students) that informs a computer program to execute a series of functions. While there is evidence that computational thinking (the thinking used for coding/computer programming) and conceptual development in mathematics are connected, there is limited research related to how such a confluence applies to primary school students. The aim of this article is to provide insight into how mathematical knowledge and thinking, specifically the identification of mathematical patterns and structures, can be promoted through engagement with coding activities. The data for this article is drawn from year 2 students (n = 135) in two Australian primary schools. A teaching experiment approach was adopted for the study with a small intervention group (n = 40) undertaking coding lessons for 6 weeks. Data collection comprised of pre-test and post-tests with a focus on patterning and coding in conjunction with video-recorded lessons. The study provides evidence that the learning that takes place through coding instruction can lead to higher levels of students' mathematical thinking in relation to identifying mathematical patterns and structures that can lead to generalisations.

AB  - This paper examines the roles that 52 university Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students play in an Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Partnership that connects several middle schools, high schools, institutions of higher learning, businesses, and community institutions. It also examines the support these students feel are necessary to be successful in their roles, as well as what they feel the experience has taught them about science communication. Results from both qualitative and quantitative data, including surveys, interviews, observations, and artifact collection indicate that the most common experiences that the students had in the schools were assisting teachers in conducting labs, leading small group activities/discussions with students in class, demonstrating scientific content, procedures, tools, and techniques, and assisting teachers in teaching lessons. Most students felt these activities benefited their ability to work as a team, lead a team, facilitate group discussions, teach STEM concepts and methods, and generate others' interest in STEM research and activities. However, it was found that some tasks that the students were involved in provided more of a chance to practice their science communication skills than others. In order to be successful in these roles, nearly all of the students felt that support from the classroom teacher they were working with was necessary.

AB  - This study examined the efficacy of a curriculum-based intervention for high school science students. Specifically, the intervention was two years of research-based, multidisciplinary curriculum materials for science supported by comprehensive professional development for teachers that focused on those materials. A modest positive effect was detected when comparing outcomes from this intervention to those of business-as-usual materials and professional development. However, this effect was typical for interventions at this grade span that are tested using a state achievement test. Tests of mediation suggest a large treatment effect on teachers and in turn a strong effect of teacher practice on student achievement--reinforcing the hypothesized key role of teacher practice. Tests of moderation indicate no significant treatment by demographic interactions.

AB  - Recently, there has been a substantial amount of research on smart classrooms, encompassing a number of areas, including Information and Communication Technology, Machine Learning, Sensor Networks, Cloud Computing, and Hardware. Smart classroom research has been quickly implemented to enhance education systems, resulting in higher engagement and empowerment of students, educators, and administrators. Despite decades of using emerging technology to improve teaching practices, critics often point out that methods miss adequate theoretical and technical foundations. As a result, there have been a number of conflicting reviews on different perspectives of smart classrooms. For a realistic smart classroom approach, a piecemeal implementation is insufficient. This survey contributes to the current literature by presenting a comprehensive analysis of various disciplines using a standard terminology and taxonomy. This multi-field study reveals new research possibilities and problems that must be tackled in order to integrate interdisciplinary works in a synergic manner. Our analysis shows that smart classroom is a rapidly developing research area that complements a number of emerging technologies. Moreover, this paper also describes the co-occurrence network of technological keywords using VOSviewer for an in-depth analysis.

AB  - Experience developing multidisciplinary bachelor's and master's curricula involving intertwined chemistry, informatics, and librarianship-editorship skills is described. The bachelor's curriculum was created in close cooperation of academic staff, library staff, and the publishing house staff (Institute of Chemical Technology Prague: a sole publisher of chemical literature in Czech Republic), with the aim to educate a new generation of information retrieval and e-publishing professionals in the science-technology-medicine (STM) field. This cooperation together with a set of specifically tailored courses gave students the insights into real-world issues of STM publishing. The master's curriculum, heavily relying on the bachelor's stage, inclines towards cheminformatics and deepens software engineering skills. Successes, pitfalls, and failures are described, together with proposed changes and future directions. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - In this article, we present the results of a cluster-randomized trial of an inquiry-based science curriculum conducted in grades 6-8 with 551 students in 13 schools. The intervention integrates science and civics instruction in a unit about community and family water conservation. The intervention also includes teacher professional development and technology-based tools to support instruction. We examined effects in science and civics, finding that student engagement in both areas was positively affected by the intervention. We argue that best practices in inquiry-based science instruction have value for students' civic development and that the integration of science and civics in the classroom can enhance student outcomes in both fields.

AB  - We describe and analyze a professional development (PD) model that involved a partnership among science, mathematics and education university faculty, science and mathematics coordinators, and middle school administrators, teachers, and students. The overarching project goal involved the implementation of interdisciplinary STEM Design Challenges (DCs). The PD model targeted: (a) increasing teachers' content and pedagogical content knowledge in mathematics and science; (b) helping teachers integrate STEM practices into their lessons; and (c) addressing teachers' beliefs about engaging underperforming students in challenging problems. A unique aspect involved low-achieving students and their teachers learning alongside each other as they co-participated in STEM design challenges for one week in the summer. Our analysis focused on what teachers came to value about STEM DCs, and the challenges in and affordances for implementing DCs. Two significant areas of value for the teachers were students' use of scientific, mathematical, and engineering practices and motivation, engagement, and empowerment by all learners. Challenges associated with pedagogy, curriculum, and the traditional structures of the schools were identified. Finally, there were four key affordances: (a) opportunities to construct a vision of STEM education; (b) motivation to implement DCs; (c) ambitious pedagogical tools; and, (d) ongoing support for planning and implementation.

AB  - Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree program curricula are typically comprised of heavy course loads and assessment burden. Typically, students "live" from exam to exam only preparing and studying for the exam directly ahead of them while neglecting concurrent courses. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine the impact of weekly multicourse collective exams academic behaviors and learning in an integrated biological sciences (BSI) course within a PharmD program. Weekly multicourse exams included questions, four per credit hour, from all first semester courses that traditionally included summative exams. Seven courses contributed questions, which amounted to 15 weekly exams of 60 questions. No other graded assessments were given in any of the courses, other than individual course cumulative final exams; the final exams in each course were not collective. After completion of final exams, a Qualtrics survey was emailed to all students and the two professors teaching the course. Course grades, not including the final exam, were compared between two cohorts with or without the collective exams to determine impact on learning. The cumulative final exam was compared between cohorts to determine impact on retention. The majority of students agreed or strongly agreed that the weekly collective exams encouraged them to study BSI more frequently, most days of the week, reduced the likelihood of skipping class, and increased likelihood to pay attention and engage in class. The majority believed that they better learned and retained the BSI material. The majority specified that they liked the collective exams for BSI and preferred it over a traditional exam schedule. Learning also appeared to be improved. However, the impact on retention is less clear and requires further research. In conclusion, the weekly multicourse collective exams improved academic behaviors and learning.

AB  - This narrative of my research on drawing shares my experience of relearning drawing by hand and how the act of drawing can stimulate curiosity. This article examines its potential to enhance learning/observation in science. It describes a kinaesthetic drawing methodology and addresses pedagogical solutions for overcoming a student's declaration that "I can't draw". This art creation experience was an interdisciplinary study in the faculties of art, science and education. My claim is that a hands-on, interactive approach to learning is at play where strategies of creating images are not predetermined. What emerges is both a subjective and objective phenomenon. As knowledge production arises after the fact of drawing, an emergent process allows for reflexive methodology and intuition to come into play. As Derrida describes in "Memoirs of the Blind", drawing emerges from the temporal space between the seeing and the unfolding of the drawing. This art-based research flows in the direction of reflective practice-based research through drawing, to address these questions by calling on the tactile and kinaesthetic dimensions of sense that drawing can engender.

AB  - This work explores the interface between 3D-printing, material sciences, and microfluidics with electrochemical detection in an undergraduate laboratory. This work includes a module for the characterization and electrochemical analysis of microelectrodes that spans 4 weeks (3 h per week). Laboratory exercises include the fabrication of a 3D-printed device, examination of 3D-printing techniques, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electrochemistry. This interdisciplinary curricula exposed students to the process of designing a functioning microfluidic device. Students began by designing the microfluidic chip with AutoDesk Inventor. To gain a better understanding of the microelectrodes utilized in a microfluidic system, students explored the surfaces of various microelectrodes with SEM. On the basis of the visualization of the microelectrodes with SEM, students formed a hypothesis on the impact of electrode surface area on the sensitivity and limit of detection. Cyclic voltammetry in a classical three-electrode system was used to experimentally examine the relationship between electrode surface area and sensitivity. The module concluded with the use of the fabricated 3D-printed chip and amperometry to develop a calibration curve and determination of an unknown concentration of analyte. This work highlights the integration of 3D-printing, SEM, microfluidics, and electrochemistry into the upper-level undergraduate curriculum.

AB  - This article details an experiment in an 11th and 12th grade 3-week intensive course, the Science and History of Contagious Disease. The course was an interdisciplinary survey of how diseases are spread along with an examination of social responses. Although both lecture and discussion based, the course revolved primary around a trip in which we led approximately 22 students through archival research in the City of Savannah Municipal Archives on the Yellow Fever epidemics of 1820, 1854, and 1876. The article describes the numerous advantages of archival work, from direct contact with rare and unique primary sources to the frustration students felt struggling with nineteenth-century handwriting. The article also addresses some of the stumbling blocks experienced by students as well as the strategies and prompts used to foster student engagement with direct primary documents that led to a critical assessment of a group of sources and a new appreciation for local history.

AB  - In this article, I describe how the theory of integrative learning frames student learning in a course on climate leadership. The course is grounded in the theory of strong sustainability, which is sustainability for the planet rather than for individual companies alone. In a description of Beta, an MBA course on climate leadership, I show how these theories interact to enhance the student experience. Implications for the theories of integrative learning and strong sustainability as emerging pedagogies are discussed. This course can be adapted for undergraduate and executive audiences. Course content emphasizes what leaders need to know to make effective decisions in their organizations and communities, with an emphasis on applying a range of social sciences, including psychology, sociology, anthropology, and economics. A description of the pedagogical content is embedded in the article, and includes learning objectives, assignments, the main topics, a short book aligned with these topics, other readings, and an array of media. Additional pedagogical materials, including experiential exercises, are available directly from the author.

AB  - In this article , the authors describe an activity in which students in Savannah, Georgia, use handheld GPS devices to record the sightings of bottlenose dolphins, examine spatial data from five pairs of dolphins in the study, and then form hypotheses about the spatial patterns they observe. In the process, they learn not only about the ecology of bottlenose dolphins but also that scientific research is interdisciplinary and can involve subjects such as math and geography. The activity is geared toward high school biology or environmental science classes but can be modified for other grade levels.

AB  - In Aotearoa New Zealand we need an informed educational response to the environmental crisis within and across all learning areas in the curriculum. One way of organising that response is through the concept of eco-literacy. This article explains the concept of eco-literacy developed within the TLRI project Tuhia ki Te Ao--Write to the Natural World, and introduces the collection of four articles from the project published in this issue of "set." This introductory article outlines how the model of eco-literacy has been enacted within the learning areas of English, the Arts, and Social Sciences, and indicates how eco-literacy is connected to Maori and Pasifika cultural perspectives within the full articles.

AB  - Background: STEM educational reform encourages a transition from instructor-centered passive learning environments to student-centered, active learning environments. Instructors adopting these changes incorporate research-validated teaching practices that improve student learning. Professional development that trains faculty to implement instructional reforms plays a key role in supporting this transition. The most effective professional development experiences are those that not only help an instructor redesign a course, but that also result in a permanent realignment of the teaching beliefs of participating instructors. Effective professional development features authentic, rigorous experiences of sufficient duration. We investigated changes in the teaching beliefs of college faculty resulting from their participation in the Interdisciplinary Teaching about the Earth for a Sustainable Future (InTeGrate) project that guided them in the development of reformed instructional materials for introductory college science courses. A convergent parallel mixed methods design was employed using the Teacher Belief Interview, the Beliefs About Reformed Science Teaching and Learning survey, and participants' reflections on their experience to characterize pedagogical beliefs at different stages of their professional development. Results: Qualitative and quantitative data show a congruent change toward reformed pedagogical beliefs for the majority of participants. The majority of participants' Teacher Belief Interview (TBI) scores improved toward more student-centered pedagogical beliefs. Instructors who began with the most traditional pedagogical beliefs showed the greatest gains. Interview data and participants' reflections aligned with the characteristics of effective professional development. Merged results suggest that the most significant changes occurred in areas strongly influenced by situational classroom factors. Conclusions: The process of materials development employed in the InTeGrate project is comprised of rigorous, authentic, and collaborative experiences continued over a sufficient duration. Incorporating these characteristics in to a professional development program on a variety of scales can help promote the long-term adoption of reformed teaching strategies. Collaboration among geoscience professionals was one of the predominant drivers for change. Consequently, this research provides insight for the development of future professional development opportunities seeking to better prepare instructors to implement reformed instructional strategies in their classrooms.

AB  - Educating future scientists and citizens is more effective if students are guided to correctly apply what they learned in school to their daily lives. This experience-based work is focused on the study of a well-known commercial product: cat litter. This material offers different starting points for a critical examination. Questions related to physical properties at the origin of the litter's efficacy, to information on chemical composition provided in the packaging, and to environmental features and possible noxiousness of cat litter were asked to be investigated by secondary school 14-15 year old students, through laboratory experiments based on problem solving approach, analysis of tag claims of different cat litter brands and cooperative learning activities. This multidisciplinary approach gives the chance to learn effectively chemistry core concepts and to avoid the typical students' lack of attention.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to present theory, practice and original research findings to support the proposition that broad enquiry and problem-based learning (EPBL) approaches provide an appropriate pedagogical lens for sustainability educators to develop the knowledge and skills needed to work effectively within mission-oriented innovation policy (MIP) environments. Design/methodology/approach: The research study comprised four elements, each of which used different research methods. The first element involved a literature review mapping the synergies between MIP and EPBL; the second element piloted the use of EPBL for undergraduate modules related to sustainability challenges; the third element involved external stakeholders in the co-creation of a postgraduate programme that brought together innovation and sustainability, with EPBL fundamental to the design and development; the fourth element curated and comparatively analysed international cases of EPBL in the context of MIP, and sustainability challenges in particular, highlighting the versatility of EPBL and the importance of creativity in EPBL design and implementation. Findings: The systematic literature review reveals synergies between the key features of EPBL and defining characteristics of MIP, indicating the relevance of applying EPBL to support MIP. Two in situ pilots generated 13 recommendations on the benefits and operational challenges of applying EPBL. These recommendations informed the design and development of a postgraduate programme, involving a transdisciplinary consultation process with key industrial and societal stakeholders. Comparative analysis of four international case studies describing EPBL applied in practice in different international settings show there is no "one size fits all". Instead, the application of EPBL to different sustainability challenges and for different learner groups demonstrates the versatility of the pedagogical approach and the creativity of the sustainability educators. Originality/value: A discourse around the appropriate pedagogical methods and teaching/learning practice to equip the current and future workforce with the knowledge and skills to respond to MIP and global sustainability challenges is nascent but emerging. This paper makes a scientific and practical contribution to the discourse. The authors show how EPBL can underpin the design of programmes to provide learners with the knowledge and skills to support organisations working effectively within an MIP context, especially addressing sustainability challenges. The authors provide recommendations for educators seeking to embed EPBL within their curriculum and call for external stakeholders to proactively engage with educators to co-create programmes with context-specific outcomes.

AB  - One of the guiding principles highlighted in "A Framework for K-12 Science Education" (NRC 2012) states that "children are born investigators," claiming that students construct their own understanding of the natural world even before they learn about it in formal learning settings. Even if students lack a thorough understanding, their curiosity encourages them to ask questions and to consider solutions to problems they encounter. This belief encourages teachers to to cultivate classroom cultures that position students' ideas, knowledge, and abilities first, and encourages them to contemplate scientific and engineering solutions for problems currently facing our society. Toward the goal of creating this classroom culture, teachers have turned to integrated science and engineering curricula that are free and readily available through various online outlets. However, in a recent content analysis study, the authors investigated 52 of these free and readily available lesson activities across four different integrated science and engineering units designed for grade 3-5 students and found a lack of support for the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States 2013) science and engineering practice (SEP) of asking questions and defining a problem. Findings from this analysis suggest that this practice is often overlooked and lessons continue to rely on teacher driven questions or teacher-generated problems. The goal of this article is to consider ways teachers can highlight the practice of asking questions and defining problems within grades 3-5 by making minor adjustments to lessons that have a big impact on encouraging question development.

AB  - We describe the structure of a writing-intensive, chemistry first year seminar designed to support a three week, research focused summer bridge program. Writing assignments in the seminar helped students understand their research activities, learn to conduct themselves as scientists, and reflect upon their lab work. The writing intensive seminar helped to maintain order and cohesion across multiple research groups. The participants in the program have experienced higher rates of retention and graduation in STEM fields as well as higher rates of participation in high impact practices than their peers.

AB  - We implemented a laboratory curriculum reform to teach foundational concepts in chemistry, particularly those concepts related to healthcare, in a chemistry course for prenursing students. Here, we discuss the reform, exploring how students built upon understandings gained in lab and correlating lab learning to course outcomes. We further discuss shifts in student work as they move through the course. As the course progressed, students became familiar with the pedagogy but also faced more challenging tasks. We present details on several of the laboratories that build the groundwork for understanding chemical principles, including the following: intermolecular forces, physical properties, acid-base chemistry, equilibrium, and chemical reactions. We further share our observations of student interactions around in-lab prompts and activities, and how these interactions inform our teaching. Our reform aims to improve critical thinking skills, namely, making and using models, observation skills, reasoning with evidence, and applying concepts to new problems. The laboratory procedures presented here modify those commonly found in the chemistry curriculum with a consistent student-centered pedagogy. We hope the simplicity and popularity of the lab procedures will allow for broad implementation of Rickey's MORE (Model, Observe, Reflect, Explain) pedagogy, and we hope our lessons in implementation will broadly benefit those who are implementing new lab curricula.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a model to help engineering faculty overcome the challenges they face when asked to design and implement interdisciplinary curricula. Researchers at a U.S. University worked with an Interdisciplinary Consultant Team and prepared a steering document with Guiding Principles and Essential Elements for the design, implementation, and evaluation of integrative curricula in engineering education. The team also developed exemplar materials (Integrative Learning Module) to provide a practical example and demonstrate how the tools provided could be used in the development of new curricula. The Guiding Principles, Essential Elements, and Integrative Learning Module were evaluated by faculty and students who provided feedback for their improvement. Faculty indicated that the tools provided were appropriate guidelines for faculty, but they indicated that the Integrative Learning Module was too long to be a manageable example. Students agreed about the need for more interactive, real-world applications of engineering concepts, but they expressed differences of opinion regarding how humanities and social sciences topics should be addressed in the engineering curriculum. Students who participated in a course modeling the Integrative Learning Module were satisfied with its use and learning outcomes. After the course, these students were able to explain the importance of problem definition, process, and disciplinary integration in engineering work.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate a professional development programme that prepares and assists teachers with the implementation of a multidisciplinary science module, basing the evaluation on "participants' reactions," the first level of Guskey's five-level model for evaluation (2002). Positive evaluations at the higher levels in Guskey's model are thought to depend upon those at the first level, that is, teachers' positive appreciation for the professional development programme. Different instruments (questionnaires, e-mail correspondence, and interviews) were used at various stages in the four-part professional development programme. The data were categorised by the stage in the programme to which they pertained: individual preparation; preparation seminar; online support; or reflection meeting. The data from all participating teachers were combined in word tables, with some parts paraphrased in a few sentences. In general, the teachers were satisfied with the professional development programme. This paper identifies several elements that ensure teacher satisfaction in the multidisciplinary professional development programme, indicates which are the difficult elements of this programme, and suggests how these difficulties can be handled in such a programme.

AB  - Youth in foster care experience disproportionate rates of abusive relationships, teen pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Extant research points to the need for interventions at multiple levels of the social ecology, however, there is a lack of evidence to guide the development of coordinated interventions for youth, foster parents, and child welfare professionals. The Texas Foster Youth Health Initiative (TFYHI) convened a multidisciplinary learning community to build a foundation for intervention development. The intentional learning and innovation process engaged several groups of stakeholders: young adults with lived experience (n = 41), foster parents (n = 14), and child welfare professionals (n = 52). Interviews, community listening sessions, and reflection exercises were designed to capture tacit and experiential knowledge and explore challenges and desired outcomes from different perspectives. Based on a thematic analysis of stakeholder perspectives, we identified overarching needs to normalize conversations about sexuality and relationships and shift away from risk-based and stigmatizing approaches. We also identified key strategies for designing coordinated interventions targeting youth, foster parents, and child welfare professionals: (1) Reflect on values about sexuality and relationships; (2) Validate youths' need for connection; (3) Focus on strengthening youth-adult relationships and ongoing conversations; (4) Build healthy relationship skills including communication about consent, condom use, and contraception; (5) Identify teachable moments and model problem solving; and (6) Use interactive approaches for sharing health information and empower youth to choose methods that fit their needs.

AB  - In life sciences, the internet is an indispensable medium for research, but has not yet realized its full potential for teaching. The concept of e-learning has been developed over the past decades for undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate programs. We set up an e-learning lecture on cancer biology and pharmacology that was first offered in 2003 to students of Molecular Biotechnology at the University of Heidelberg and to students of Pharmacy at the University of Mainz, Germany. The present paper recapitulates the first decade of experiences with this e-learning lecture from both the students' and the teachers' perspectives. A total of 317 students during the past 10 years participated in a survey. In general, the students enjoyed the possibilities that self-controlled learning offers. E-learning interested them as a novel educational method. They felt quite comfortable listening to the material despite the interdisciplinary nature of the lectures, which included molecular biological, pharmacological and medical aspects of cancer biology and pharmacology. This lecture was the first e-learning experience for the majority of students, and their impressions were generally positive. The students not only indicated that they would like to continue with e-learning, but also would recommend e-learning to other students. Remarkably, the majority of students would like to see more e-learning offered in their present curricula. They indicated interest in mixed forms of traditional learning and e-learning ("blended learning"), although it is recognized that face-to-face contact between teachers and students is critical. Overall, many students would consider e-learning for further and continuing education after graduation.

AB  - The integration of research and education is an essential component of our university's teaching philosophy. Recently, we made a curricular revision to facilitate such an approach in the General Chemistry Laboratory, to teach students that investigative approaches are at the core of sciences. The curriculum revision included new interdisciplinary experiments and a research project. Investigative, peer review, and cooperative learning strategies were introduced to enhance student learning and engagement. An environment in which students can analyze results within a laboratory session and reach comprehensive and quantitative conclusions was encouraged. To assess our results, students completed questionnaires, evaluated their peers and themselves. Instructors evaluated students through written reports, oral presentations, pre- and post test, a practical exam and a final exam. Assessments of the learning outcomes were performed to determine the level of research skills development, the improvement in laboratory techniques, and depth in analysis of concepts. The experimental designs, implementation of results, and comparisons of student performances using traditional approaches are presented.

AB  - In this paper, Leonard J. Waks re-imagines the social foundations of education (SFE) as a project within the information society. He begins with what he believes to be a reasonably non-controversial definition: SFE is a field of scholarship and teaching aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding, through description, interpretation, and social inquiry, of the educational institution of society and its relations with other institutions--economic, political, cultural, religious, familial, and social-structural. It seeks to understand education both as it has existed in various previous societies and as it exists today, and it seeks to understand the dynamics of institutional change--how various intrinsic and extrinsic factors cause it to shift from one form to another and from its present to some future state. It also seeks to understand the broader aims, purposes and values underlying education, to evaluate educational policies and organizations in light of those purposes, to critique existing policies and organizations, to prescribe desirable changes in them and--through publications, consultation and teaching--to assist education publics, professionals, and policy makers in bringing about these changes. Work in SFE is distinctly inter-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary. In engaging in its core tasks SFE draws upon the disciplines of history, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, economics, political science, and other disciplines as relevant. The philosophy, history, and sociology of education and other disciplines operating under the umbrella term "educational studies," contribute to SFE but neither define it nor are comprehended by it--these fields maintain distinct identities as sub-disciplines within social science and humanities disciplines. This is the field of SFE that the author has known and worked within for the last fifty years. It is the field as reflected in contemporary textbooks, and in course and program descriptions in university catalogs. Any effort to re-imagine SFE will have to remain bounded by such a definition--otherwise it will not be re-imagining SFE, but imagining a change from SFE to something else. Re-imagining SFE is itself an education project, and its place in a new social order is itself an SFE question. Waks characterizes this new information network social order with four key information webs: (1) the human web; (2) the knowledge web; (3) the learning web; and, (4) the work web--the network that allocates work opportunities based on capabilities acquired through the knowledge and learning webs. Waks describes how these learning webs have affected SFE and concludes that, if current trends continue, the foundations disciplines--philosophy, history and sociology and the others--will all but disappear in the pre-service preparation of teachers and in some ways will be a welcome development, as SFE scholars will be liberated from teaching required SFE courses to students who are academically underprepared and unmotivated.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this article is to analyse the concepts of national and European identities through a multidisciplinary lens and to examine empirically how schools develop those identities in adolescents. Method: The study employs data from the "International Civic and Citizenship Education Study 2016." Correlation and regression analyses are conducted with data from over 45,000 students from fourteen different European educational systems. Country-specific weighted statistical analyses are conducted. Findings: A combination of perspectives from the fields of psychology, political culture, and civic and citizenship education is useful to reflect upon the dimensions and desirability of overarching identities. Formal learning opportunities are shown to be particularly relevant for fostering a European identity. Positive relationships between students and teachers and between students statistically predict stronger identities. Practical implications: Good social relationships at school help to develop national and European identities. Moreover, the development of a European identity especially depends upon its explicit inclusion in the curriculum. Teachers should guide students to reflect on the meaning and content of tolerant and complex national and European identities.

AB  - The National Security Agency (NSA) awards Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) designations to institutions that commit to producing cybersecurity professionals who will work in careers that reduce vulnerabilities in our national infrastructure. A review of the curricula in the 327 institutions and their degree programs reveal that only two programs offer a required course about terrorism. Given the fluid nature of terrorism and its threat to national infrastructure, the omission is concerning. It is recommended that NSA-certified cybersecurity programs begin implementing educational content that aim to teach about this emerging crime and justice issue. One suggestion is to embrace the interdisciplinary nature of cybersecurity, as exemplified in the success of the Cybersecurity Living and Learning Community (CLLC). Designing courses that educate about the social processes that leads to the growing problem of violence and terror directed towards marginalized communities and our nation's technological infrastructure, is another.

AB  - Addressed is the current practice in educational reform of reducing time for science instruction in favor of traditional reading/language arts instruction. In contrast, presented is an evidence-based rationale for increasing instructional time for K-5 science instruction as an educational reform initiative. Overviewed are consensus interdisciplinary research and complementary multi-year findings of the Science IDEAS model demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating conceptually-relevant reading within science instruction in improving student achievement in both science and reading comprehension. Based on research summarized, increasing time for integrated K-5 science is advocated as a meaningful reform-based approach to science learning and reading comprehension proficiency that, in turn, better prepares students for subsequent success in science and content-area reading comprehension across upper elementary and middle school grades (3-8).

AB  - The main task of the examination is to establish environmental issues in the didactic materials for primary and secondary school in Republic of Serbia. Environmental issues in the secondary school curriculum in Serbia, according to the current educational curricula and educational programs, is limited to general subjects (chemistry and biology above all), and to the subject of Ecology in some profiles of secondary vocational education. There is no equal distribution of the environmental issues in curriculum by subjects, classes and educational levels. In general, in the didactic materials there are about 5,4% environmental issues. Because of the lack of national guidelines and institutional coordination we are not able to make a qualitative leap, and we also need to seek a holistic approach to contribute to education about, in and for the environment.

AB  - This systematic literature review was conducted to explore the effectiveness of problem-based and project-based learning (PBL) implemented with students in early elementary to grade 8 (ages 3-14) in mathematics and science classrooms. Nine studies met the following inclusion criteria: (a) focus on PBL, (b) experimental study, (c) kindergarten to grade 8 level, and (d) focus on mathematics or science content. For these studies, we examined: the definitions of PBL used, the components of PBL explicitly identified as salient to student learning, and the effectiveness of PBL. This review found that although there is no consistent definition of PBL, PBL is an effective method for improving K-8 students' science academic achievement, including knowledge retention, conceptual development, and attitudes. Implications and limitations are discussed.

AB  - Despite abundant data and increasing data availability brought by technological advances, there has been very limited education policy studies that have capitalized on big data--characterized by large volume, wide variety, and high velocity. Drawing on the recent progress of using big data in public policy and computational social science research, this commentary discusses how to approach big data and how big data can be used in education policy research. First, I introduce big data that is potentially relevant to education policy research. I then present methodological frontiers by examining the assumptions, key concepts, merits, and caveats of three commonly used analytical approaches to mining massive amounts of text data: topic models, network text analysis, and sentiment analysis. Next, to ensure the veracity of using big data in education policy research, I debunk three methodological misconceptions. This commentary concludes with a discussion on developing interdisciplinary research capacity and addressing the privacy concerns and ethical conundrums as we explore a research agenda of using big data in education policy.

AB  - Teachers, both of science and of religion, have to help pupils to learn about the links between these subjects. An effective way to support this learning should start from the beliefs and ideas that pupils already have, ideas which might well be influenced by public debates, often characterised by controversy, between those holding strong beliefs about the two areas. This article aims to give teachers a framework of information and argument to guide their design of teaching in this overlap area. In the "first" of three main sections, there is a summary account of the history of the science-religion relationships, showing that over the last two millennia they have oscillated between positive support and negative controversy. A "second" section analyses this history in terms of three models of the relationship. One is a model of conflict in which each disputes the knowledge claims of the other. Another is one of mutual independence in which each accepts to work within its side of an agreed boundary. Finally, there is a model of collaboration, in which each discerns positive contributions that the other can make to its own insights. The "third" main section discusses the implications of the preceding analyses for curriculum and pedagogy in both science education and religious education, with a stress on the similarity between the pedagogic aims and values to which teachers of both subjects should work.

AB  - As the popularity of Information Technology programs has expanded at many universities, there are a number of questions to be answered from a curriculum standpoint. As many of these programs are either interdisciplinary, or at least exist outside of the usual Computer Science and Information Systems programs, questions of what is appropriate for the curriculum and accreditation have arisen. More specifically, as the demand for information security professionals has expanded enormously, IT majors will increasingly be asked to fill these roles. This paper seeks to examine the curriculum for IT programs with a special focus on security. Security has become an increasingly important topic, and one that IT graduates will likely be dealing with professionally. We answer this question by examining the curriculum guidelines for IT programs, and comparing these to both professional standards and IT program curriculums at several universities.

AB  - The field of nanotechnology has outgrown the discovery phase into the application and even commercial production phases. Consequently, the need for a workforce capable of supporting this growth is more than ever. However, because of the different challenges associated with nanotechnology education, specific courses are required to be developed and implemented in engineering schools to help produce this much needed workforce. This article describes the details of developing and implementing a course entitled Fundamentals of Nanotechnology as part of an umbrella plan for nanotechnology education and awareness at multiple levels. The course is designed to overcome most of the challenges facing nanotechnology education. As an example, one of the major challenges related to teaching this topic is the lack of equipment and facility, due to high cost, among other factors. Computer based activities are proposed and implemented to overcome this challenge. The course aims at providing a multidisciplinary pool of science and engineering students with the elements needed to continue and expand into the nanotechnology field, regardless of their discipline or focus. This course was developed and first implemented during the spring semester of 2010. Results from this offering were assessed to help close the quality loop and improve the next offering, the sequel project-based course, as well as the umbrella plan.

AB  - For years engineering educators and researchers have tried to get more students from underrepresented groups interested in engineering as a career field and college major. Many interventions designed for high school students assume that students do not know about engineering careers and just need opportunities to learn about the field. The key may not be lack of awareness but instead a narrow conception of engineering. The stereotypical view of engineering is that the field is filled with people who want to make money and prefer to work alone; this perception is reinforced by many outreach programs. This perception of engineering reduces its attractiveness as a career to those that are interested in "making a difference" in the world. Many practicing engineers would argue that this perception is wrong (Faulkner 2007); they see engineering as a way to work in teams to solve some of society's most pressing issues (National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine 2010). Highlighting this view of engineering may help engage more underrepresented groups in thinking about engineering as a career path. The National Academy of Engineering's (NAE) "Grand Challenges for Engineering" (NAE 2008) is a list of 14 critical challenges that society faces and can be addressed by engineers. These challenges highlight how important engineering is in helping others and also emphasize the collaborative, creative, and interdisciplinary work that engineers do. The challenges are intended to help the public understand more concretely how engineering innovations contribute to advancing society and to provide real-world examples of how an engineering career meets communal and altruistic goal. In this article, the authors share a few of the activities they have developed to introduce the Grand Challenges to students to demonstrate the impacts that engineering has on society and their own lives. Their work has primarily focused on summer camp experiences, where junior high and high school students come to the university campus, but these activities have also been used in formal spaces (e.g., high school and university classrooms) as well as informal spaces (e.g., community outreach events and school-based science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) events).

AB  - Within Australia most Departments of Geography have been merged with programmes in Environmental Studies or Earth Sciences, and have been cast as multidisciplinary contributors to the increasingly vocational concerns of universities. One outcome is that named Geography programmes for postgraduates are not growing in institutional prominence in Australian universities. In such a situation, relatively few new innovations in the training specifically of Geography postgraduates are underway, and innovative developments are more likely to be occurring in multidisciplinary, coursework-based master's programmes or in the short courses offered by universities' central schools of graduate studies.

AB  - Interventions that comprise interdisciplinary collaboration including behavioral elements are effective in addressing lifestyle disease risk factors. However, it is not known how best to conduct this collaboration for sustainable change. The aim of this study was to systematically examine the evidence for the effects of interdisciplinary interventions on lifestyle disease risk factors including weight, lipid levels, glycemic control, and blood pressure. To do so, a systematic review of the literature was conducted using the databases Scopus, Medline, and Web of Science (all years to September 2014). Eighteen articles describing 16 studies of interdisciplinary interventions were identified. Consistent results were found for effects on weight loss but not for effects on blood lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure. Effective interventions involved collaborations between dieticians, exercise physiologists, and psychologists and incorporated intensive initial participant engagement. Few studies investigated the long-term effect of interventions, but where this was done, the maintenance of favorable changes required ongoing participant support. Current evidence suggests that interdisciplinary interventions are effective in promoting weight loss and that ongoing support of participants is key to maintaining results beyond initial study duration. Future studies should examine long-term effects in pragmatic trials that address translation to practice.

AB  - In a cluster of courses called Food for Thought, seven faculty from different departments (including Biology, Economics, Sociology, Chemistry, Health and Wellness, and Foreign Language) teach students about food information, food consumerism, nutrition and health. The classes all have a shared learning outcome focused on developing the student as an informed consumer of food. Each semester, faculty teach a food-related course from their respective disciplinary perspective while also incorporating cross-course interactions that allow for both integration of disciplinary knowledge and student-to-student learning opportunities. Previous research demonstrated that this approach leads to student perceptions of learning gains (Authors, 2011). Building on that work, this research directly assesses student learning in the Food for Thought cluster. The results demonstrate that exposure to multiple disciplines covering a shared topic enhances learning through greater student ability to integrate diverse forms of knowledge and to see an issue from multiple perspectives. These findings demonstrate the value of multidisciplinary learning opportunities for students.

AB  - The indigenous sub-Saharan African philosophy of "ubuntu" that comes down to the expression: "I am a human being because of being with other human beings", developed over centuries. This philosophy, embodying the notion of deep respect for all human beings, is rooted in a humane inclination towards kindness and sound relationships among all people. Before its adoption as a principle in the South African Interim Constitution of 1993, "ubuntu" had never been referred to, or codified in any statutory format. Since then, however, although not mentioned in the final Constitution of 1996, the humane undertones of the "ubuntu" philosophy have often surfaced in South African jurisprudence, particularly in cases involving citizens' Constitutional right to human dignity (section 10). This paper examines the phenomenon that the actual modern-day practical, day-to-day life in South Africa does not seem to attest to application of the "ubuntu" ideal of maintaining and improving the human condition. After examining a number of possible reasons for this phenomenon, "ubuntugogy" is presented as a possible remedy for this condition. This paper reports on an interdisciplinary analysis involving philosophical, societal, anthropological, legal and pedagogical perspectives. A mixed method research methodology in the form of a social science based interpretive-constructivist qualitative approach combined with a legal approach was followed.

AB  - Case-writing within an integrated, systems-based health professions education curriculum presents many unique challenges. Specifically, case-writing in this context must consider integration of multidisciplinary learning objectives and synthesis of biomedical and clinical sciences. Establishing an effective process for content integration and determining who should be involved in the case-writing process can be a daunting task and this specific context requires a new model for effective casewriting. This paper provides a model for the cycle of case development, implementation, evaluation and modification in an integrated, systems-based health professions curriculum. We highlight how this collaborative case-writing model parallels the social constructivist approach promoted by the problem-based learning process in which our students engage.

AB  - The article provides the basis for a model of inquiry-based science education in which K-12 teachers' and pupils' engage in authentic science experiences as participants of a scientific research project, which we refer to as Multiple Outcome Interdisciplinary Research and Learning (MOIRL). We provide the basis for the model for inquiry based science education (IBSE) by first describing how the model came about through our 10 years of research on how people learn to do science in research groups. We then turn to the literature on the relationship among scientific inquiry, inquiry learning and MOIRL. As our case studies of MOIRL projects show, by being participants along with scientists and their graduate/undergraduate students in authentic scientific research, school pupils learn how to do science and gain a better understanding of scientific concepts. Productive disciplinary engagement can be fostered with learning environments that are problematic in the sense that they encourage students to ask and seek answers to intellectual questions. By incorporating as many stakeholders and outcomes as possible, the likelihood increases of pupils' learning of science concepts and processes. In addition, the incorporation of multiple stakeholders and outcomes provides pupils with a view of the many authentic ways that science and scientific inquiry is connected to the world outside of school, which increases the likelihood that they study more science and aspire to scientific careers. Finally, the MOIRL projects provide teachers with the opportunity to engage in scientific research, which can better prepare them to teach science as inquiry and through the use of inquiry methods.

AB  - Two common goals of science teacher professional development (PD) are increased content knowledge (CK) and improved readiness to teach through inquiry. However, PD assessment challenges arise when the context is structured around inquiry-based, participant-driven learning, and when the content crosses scientific disciplines. This study extended the use of concept mapping as an assessment tool for examining changes in the content knowledge of 21 high school science teachers who participated in a field-based environmental science summer institute. The scoring rubric focused on documenting concepts, links, and map organization and scope in an attempt to capture development of cross-disciplinary knowledge in ways that correspond with theories of expertise development. The analysis revealed significant gains from pre-PD to post PD maps in the sophistication of links between concepts and in the number of additional, participant-generated scientifically valid concepts. Relative to the initial maps, post PD maps also manifested more complete clustering of concepts. Findings are discussed in reference to previous studies on teachers' learning and implications for future research using concept mapping as a means of assessing teacher PD.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of the research was to examine if adolescents can develop abilities of democratic interaction through Community Theatre. Design/methodology: Firstly, two instruments were applied, a questionnaire covering socio-moral problems, of the students and a Questionnaire, covering the Educational Ideologies of the professors. Then, a theatrical intervention was realized at middle-school students in Aguascalientes City, based on the objectives of the formation of Citizenship as stated at the National Curriculum. Findings: Students themselves stated a change in their attitude during the intervention, which was also observed and registered at the field diary and at the written evaluations. For this reason, we claim that Community theater could be used as a transdisciplinary method for teaching democratic skills, as it creates a public sphere where the students can develop democratic behavior. Research limitations: Further studies on the subject are required, especially concerning the time and the sample as the research had a two-month duration and was conducted at a limited population. Practical implications: The contribution of this project was the introduction of Community Theatre at the service of the Citizenship Education, promoting the artistic education as a means of the formal education in the search for personal and social democratic development and could be considered in an educational reform.

AB  - The surface-to-volume ratio is an important quantity in thermal physics. For example it governs the behaviour of heating or cooling of physical objects as a function of size like, e.g. cubes or spheres made of different material. The starting point in our paper is the simple physics problem of how cheese cubes of different sizes behave if heated either in a conventional oven or in a microwave oven. The outcome of these experiments depends on a balance between heating and cooling with the surface-to-volume ratio (S/V) as the key parameter. The role of (S/V) becomes most obvious in studying cooling curves of differently sized objects like cubes or spheres, alone. Besides problems in thermal physics, the surface-to-volume ratio has many important applications in biochemistry, chemistry and biology. It allows us to draw general conclusions concerning the thermal and mechanical properties of different-sized animals, in particular their metabolism. Hence, this topic offers rich contexts for interdisciplinary teaching. An example presented in this paper starts in physics while studying thermal properties of cheese cubes and ends up in biology by discussing the differences in food intake of animals from small mice to huge elephants.

AB  - Because present initiatives guiding educational decision-making place a high emphasis on accountability, there was a need to explore the educational value of the literacy and science education courses' joint interdisciplinary focus for elementary education. With current research alluding to time constraints, scripted curriculum, and memorization dominating teachers' decisions about instruction, it seemed important to gain insight into the practical nature of the interdisciplinary method with former students. Former pre-service teachers in their first years of teaching were surveyed. The goal was to find out how the interdisciplinary strategies influenced their instruction and students' learning, and if they were continuing to meaningfully chunk their curriculum. Twenty-five of the forty former pre-service teachers returned the survey. These first-year teachers reported making cross-curricular connections and articulated a range of benefits for their students. However, they also discussed hindrances to their attempts at making cross-curricular connections, including state and local mandates, time constraints, and dilemmas related to being a first-year teacher. The findings from this study could prove valuable to teacher educators in elementary education programs, as well as to those involved in planning and facilitating professional development activities for elementary school teachers.

AB  - As evidenced by national data, a large proportion of students in middle school, content area classrooms in the United States (U.S.) may be considered developing readers. Evidence-based literacy practices and explicit instructional practices can support these students' literacy development. Yet, research suggests that teachers often miss opportunities to integrate evidence-based literacy practices to support students' access to text, and little is known about middle school teachers' use of explicit instructional practices. In this observation study, we document 17 U.S. middle school teachers' use of both explicit instructional practices and evidence-based literacy practices across 51 lessons in general education language arts, science, and social studies classrooms. We find that most explicit instructional practices and literacy practices were infrequently utilized across all content areas; within some content areas, some of these important practices were not used at all. We discuss the contexts in which explicit instruction and/or evidenced-based literacy instruction did occur, and the importance of school-wide literacy models and related professional learning opportunities to increase middle school content-area teachers' ability to support developing readers.

AB  - This paper presents a novel design for an upper-level undergraduate statistics course structured around data rather than methods. The course is designed around curated datasets to reflect real-world data science practice and engages students in experiential and peer learning using the data science competition platform Kaggle. Peer learning is further encouraged by patterning the course after a genetic algorithm: students have access to each other's solutions, allowing them to learn from what others have done and figure out how to improve upon previous work from week to week. Implementation details for the course are provided, and course efficacy is assessed using a survey of students and a focus group. Student responses suggest that the structure of the course contributed to narrowing the perceived gap between low- and high-performing students, that desired learning outcomes were successfully achieved, and that a data-first approach to learning statistics is effective for learning.

AB  - Problem-based learning (PBL) has been gaining in popularity, especially within the context of STEM-based (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) schools. Program assessments for these schools typically focus on student standardized test scores rather than the needs of the teachers. This study utilized anecdote circles, storytelling via moderated group discussions, to investigate teachers' needs related to developing and implementing authentic, interdisciplinary PBL activities in an urban, public STEM high school. Teacher experiences and viewpoints were explored within three broad themes: assessment; coaching and training; and authentic learning. The analyses provide insights for transitioning a school for effective PBL implementation as well as improving teaching and learning best practices. Recommendations to improve PBL practice based on the study's results are also included.

AB  - Scientific research projects competitions for high school students have been held by TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) since 1969. Whereas only projects on science were taken into the scope of competition for long years, the projects appropriate to the interdisciplinary approach such as social sciences projects and values education have been started to be included beside science broadening the range since 2000s. In projects, it has been aimed to encourage students studying at high school grade for carrying out studies on basic, social and applied sciences, directing their studies and providing contribution upon the development of current scientific studies. The required qualification is projects' being originated and developed from own knowledge, skill and original thoughts of the students, and being completed by the support of a counselor. Geography has started to be included in scientific project competitions since 2011. In this research, it was aimed to reveal the importance of secondary education students' scientific project competitions upon their gaining a scientific point of view depending upon the branch of geography. In the research, case study design as one of the qualitative research methods was used. The study group of the research included 38 geography teachers carrying on their duties in Nevsehir province in 2015-2016 academic year. Semi-structured interview technique was used as data collection tool, and the data were analyzed using content analysis method. Obtained quantitative data were digitized, their frequency and percentage were obtained and interpreted. In the research, it was concluded that participating into scientific project competitions was very beneficial in terms of students, developed viewpoint of students in terms of various aspects, most of the geography teachers considered that the institutions they carried on their duties were adequate for students' developing projects, teachers considered themselves competent for guiding students during the process of preparing the project, and preparing a project provided significant benefits and experiences for the future of students.

AB  - The focus of this paper is learning the language of data science and statistics through the use of simple classroom activities. Many terms in statistics are known to be lexically ambiguous, having one meaning in general English conversation and another, more technical, meaning in statistical English. The main aim is to investigate whether the classroom-ready interventions proposed are perceived by students to be fun and helpful. A secondary aim is to measure students' ability to correctly define lexically ambiguous words at the start and end of the semester, and seek evidence of an association between the interventions and lexical disambiguation. Three types of interventions are studied: crosswords, gap-fill exercises and a sorting exercise. The results from student evaluations of the activities show that, in general, students found the activities helpful and fun. There was also some moderate evidence of an improvement in disambiguation for statistical terms including significant, control and relationship.

AB  - This paper describes a collaborative project involving mathematicians, scientists and educators at an Australian university where an innovative initial teacher education (ITE) degree in mathematics/science was developed. The theoretical frameworks of identity theory and academic brokerage and their use in understanding the challenges associated with the early stages of collaborative projects is described. Data from reflections and interviews of the participants after involvement in the project from one to three years are presented to illustrate these challenges. The paper concludes with a description of the importance of the academic broker in overcoming identity challenges and facilitating cultural change for academics involved in cross-disciplinary collaborations and the time and resource requirements to achieve a successful outcome.

AB  - In the Fall of 2015 and in the 2016-2017 academic year, we conducted a two-week, team-taught, interdisciplinary module concurrently in an advanced biochemistry course, offered in the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department, and a sophomore-level environmental-ethics course, offered in the Religion Department, at Oberlin College. The focus of the unit was the mechanism of pesticides and the ethics of their use domestically and in agriculture, using "Silent Spring" by Rachel Carson as a primary text. The general question our students explored was: How does understanding the chemistry of various pesticides impact biological systems and larger preservation and conversation practices? Posing the question in this manner signaled to students that to adequately grapple with pressing environmental concerns, we must utilize an integrated approach and response. Students in both classes were exposed to chemical and biological mechanisms of different types of pesticides at their level of assumed knowledge and learned about several ethical theories that they then applied to real-world case studies. The two instructors (a biochemist and an ethicist) visited each other's classrooms and taught lectures relevant to their specialties (e.g., the biochemist taught a lecture on pesticide mechanisms of action). Students completed a reflection assignment about the unit as well as a research paper about a pesticide of their choice, which demonstrated their knowledge about the pesticide's mechanism of action and explored the ethics of that pesticide's use. We believe this module is easily adaptable to any biochemistry or environmental chemistry course. We provide a detailed description of the module and our assessment of its impact on students' ability to apply general ethical theories to complex societal issues.

AB  - Professionals in the environmental domain require cognitive interdisciplinary skills to be able to develop sustainable solutions to environmental problems. We demonstrate that education in environmental systems analysis allows for the development of these skills. We identify three components of cognitive interdisciplinary skills: (1) the ability to understand environmental issues in a holistic way, taking into account the interplay of social and biophysical dynamics; (2) the ability to connect both the analysis of environmental problems and the devising of solutions with relevant disciplinary knowledge and methodologies; and (3) the ability to reflect on the role of scientific research in solving societal problems. Environmental systems analysis provides tools, methods, and models to assist in framing complex environmental issues in a holistic way and facilitates the integration of disciplines. Systems analysis also supports reflection by making students aware that a system always represents a simplified model and a particular perspective. Through the analysis of a collection of bachelor of science students' "reflection papers", we identify two major challenges in teaching these cognitive skills: (1) to train students to not just follow a systematic approach but acquire a systemic view and (2) to train students to be reflexive about systems analysis and the role of science. We recommend that training in cognitive skills starts early in a study program.

AB  - Multiple pedagogical approaches, such as experimental experiences or computer-based activities, have been shown to increase student learning and engagement. We have developed a laboratory module that includes both a traditional "live" experimental component and a student-designed "virtual" computer simulation component. This laboratory employs the mating pathway of "Saccharomyces cerevisiae" (yeast) to demonstrate four fundamental cell and molecular biology concepts: cell signaling, cytoskeleton, cell cycle, and cell cycle checkpoints. In the live laboratory, students add mating pheromone to cultures, then measure changes in cell division and morphology characteristics of the "S. cerevisiae" mating response. We also developed a "virtual" complement to this laboratory. Using the principles of Design Thinking and Agile methodology, we collaborated with an undergraduate Computer Science course to generate two computer simulations which can support the live laboratory or provide a virtual laboratory experience. We assessed how both the live and virtual laboratories contributed to learning gains in analytical skills and course content. Students who performed the simulation alone or the simulation plus live lab demonstrated learning gains, with greater gains for the live lab, but students who performed neither lab did not. Attitudinal assessment demonstrated increased student engagement and self-efficacy after performing the live and virtual labs.

AB  - Exploiting the special synergy between science and mathematics can deepen children's understanding of scientific concepts and ideas and provide a range of contextualised opportunities for children to apply their mathematical knowledge and skills. With some creative thought and careful planning, science activities can be developed so that they require application of mathematics. This article explores how a science investigation focused upon grouping (classifying) seeds and observing plant growth can be utilised in the assessment of children's competency in applying place value (partitioning), addition and subtraction and using appropriate units of measurement in solving problems. Taken together the evidence can support judgements made about a child's mastery of key mathematical areas. The activities described in this article demonstrate that children's experience of learning science can be enriched when application of mathematics is built into lessons.

AB  - Purpose: Empirical investigation into the e-learning innovation, FUSE Studios, is both timely and relevant because FUSE is rapidly expanding domestically and abroad and there is continued interest in the interdisciplinary fields of information and learning sciences in the constructs of choice and interest as they relate to the provision and design of learning experiences. In particular, this paper aims to contribute to scholarly and design-based conversations on how e-learning innovations--especially those situated within the digital youth and constructionism strands of research--can be designed in ways that support robust opportunities for learning for young people (Reynolds et al., 2019). Design/methodology/approach: Drawing upon a large corpus of mixed-methods data including computer-generated activity log data, youth survey data and studio facilitator interview data, this paper examines patterns of use and interest-related experience among young people in a range of FUSE Studios settings across the USA. Findings: The results suggest that student choice within FUSE's curricular and Studio model tends to support a broad exploration of interests across a wide range of youth, rather than a deep dive into particular Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) content areas. Practical implications: Alongside the broad exploration that was found to characterize the patterns of student choice in FUSE Studios, a striking number of students from those surveyed reported that FUSE supported their interest development: they liked the FUSE challenges, were always able to find something of interest to do in the FUSE Studios and saw the FUSE challenges are supportive of their current and future interests. (See similar findings in Stevens et al., 2016). We understand these student self-reported experiences as evidence that the FUSE Studios model did well to encourage meaningful, interest-driven learning experiences for youth. Originality/value: Committed to making research usable for practice, this paper offers implications for future e-learning designs that seek to make choice and interest central to the organization of activity and environment.

AB  - This article reports and reflects on the design and use of the board game KEEP COOL on climate change. The game covers and integrates central biophysical, economic, and political aspects of the issue. By using a board game as common language between students and scientists from different scientific cultures, knowledge of different disciplines can be integrated and different views can be discussed. Thus, even complex issues such as the free-rider problem, trade-offs between adaptation to and mitigation of climate change, and path dependencies can be studied. KEEP COOL is the first game on climate change that is readily available from a commercial publisher. It has successfully been used in multiple settings, for example, as a tool for interdisciplinary research, public relations, public understanding of science, and, in particular, teaching. The experience with the game indicates that it can be effectively used in seminars with students to obtain a holistic picture of the issue and to lay out a common language for deeper reflections on climate change. This contribution also identifies some pitfalls and essential instruments for its adequate use for teaching.

AB  - Background: How do we account for the persistent difficulty the U.S. community of science has in educating larger numbers of talented and diverse undergraduates? We posit that the problem lies in the community's unremitting focus on scientific subject matter knowledge and students' ability to learn, to the neglect of interpersonal social relations--particularly trust. Our study focuses on trust in academic mentoring. This topic is particularly relevant in studies of the undergraduate segment of the pipeline into science that typically occurs in large, impersonal settings that often generate student alienation. Our study hypothesizes that trustworthy relations may be both a significant condition for academic mentoring as well as an important outcome. Purpose: The study we report explores the promise of a new research direction in undergraduate science education, one focused on trust in academic mentoring. A focus on interpersonal trust is unusual, if not entirely overlooked, in most studies of undergraduate science education, and stands in sharp contrast to the situation in K-12 education where an emergent body of survey and field research measures trust and documents its educational importance. Our framework derives from social capital theory and cautions that a science curriculum that informs and motivates entails attention not only to cognition, as indicated by subject matter knowledge, but also to the educational significance of other complex forms of cognition that undergird social skill, relational awareness, and the development and maintenance of trust. Research Design: Because the MARC-U*STAR training program funded by the National Institutes of Health sponsors only a select number of talented upper division science major students on each host campus, our correlational analyses were based on a unique and relatively small sample of data collected from undergraduate science major students (N = 161) in 16 colleges and universities in the Pacific Southwest. We analyzed the data in two linked parts: (a) an analysis of the association between trust and motivation; and (b) an evaluation of whether the Program affects trust. We link the two parts by using the same longitudinal dataset in each and, further, by building the evaluation on the findings from models that compare trust and motivation among upper division science major students enrolled in the Program (n = 49) with trust and motivation among upper division science major students not in the Program (n = 112). Given the study's exploratory purpose and design limits, we situate the results near the front end of the continuum from preliminary studies designed to suggest further research directions to the kinds of precise predictions we can expect from truly randomized controlled experiments. Findings: Despite its necessarily preliminary findings regarding trust, this study contributes to the literature on academic mentoring in undergraduate science education in several ways. First, our study develops a novel conceptual perspective on the measure and utility of trust as a crucial form of social capital. Second, we used this perspective to develop a set of structural models that suggest interpersonal trust is producible in undergraduate science education; is pedagogically powerful, not a mere nicety; and is particularly important for students who are members of groups historically underrepresented in the sciences. Third, and surprising because the literature on trust does not prepare for them, are results suggesting that trust may work differently for different groups of students in different contexts. Conclusions/Recommendations: Our findings are unusual and encouraging, and they bring several issues to light regarding (a) the utility of theory in research and practice in undergraduate science education, (b) inequitable representation in the sciences, and (c) contextual complexities that condition the development and maintenance of trust within institutional settings. First, our framework on trust derives from social capital theory and cautions that a science curriculum that informs and motivates entails attention not only to cognition but also to the educational significance of other complex forms of cognition that undergird social skill, relational awareness, and the development and maintenance of trust. In cognitively and socially consequential exchanges in undergraduate science education, trust and mistrust are important. Next, our most unusual finding--that trust in a mentor seems to matter more for the motivation and career expectations of the MARC-U*STAR Program students than for non-Program students--raises the question: How does trust in a university mentor matter for equitable undergraduate education in science? With our data, we cannot fully account for this unexpected finding. Drawing from studies that disentangle the concept of interpersonal trust from more generalized notions of trust in the social environment, we have worked at a tentative interpretation: Perhaps interpersonal trust is especially impactful in situations where the more general social environment poses perceptible threats. Last, when the literature on trust is examined concurrently with our findings, trust emerges not as an invariant entity, but as supremely contextualized. We conclude by calling for a more expansive, multidisciplinary, and multimethod research agenda focused on trust, which may contribute to a reorientation of undergraduate science education.

AB  - Incorporation of mathematics into biology curricula is critical to underscore for undergraduate students the relevance of mathematics to most fields of biology and the usefulness of developing quantitative process skills demanded in modern biology. At our institution, we have made significant changes to better integrate mathematics into the undergraduate biology curriculum. The curricular revision included changes in the suggested course sequence, addition of statistics and precalculus as prerequisites to core science courses, and incorporating interdisciplinary (math-biology) learning activities in genetics and zoology courses. In this article, we describe the activities developed for these two courses and the assessment tools used to measure the learning that took place with respect to biology and statistics. We distinguished the effectiveness of these learning opportunities in helping students improve their understanding of the math and statistical concepts addressed and, more importantly, their ability to apply them to solve a biological problem. We also identified areas that need emphasis in both biology and mathematics courses. In light of our observations, we recommend best practices that biology and mathematics academic departments can implement to train undergraduates for the demands of modern biology.

AB  - Children's literature provides elementary teachers and students the opportunity to critically engage in the world around them. However, too often teachers choose not to engage students in discussions of complex social issues out of a sense of fear or discomfort. In this paper, we explore the reflections of 11 teachers who chose to engage their students in discussions of three complex social issues: immigration, migration, and forced relocation. Specifically, we highlight the successes, challenges, and surprises teachers reported after completing a three-week long unit that integrated discussions of complex social issues with computer science and science. Findings suggest that despite teacher reservations, students are interested in talking about complex social issues and through engagement with children's literature are able to engage in thoughtful, personal, and critical conversation about these issues. Further, through discussing critical social issues, teachers and students were able to build the culturally responsive social-emotional skills essential for effective participation in a diverse democratic society.

AB  - We are living in an increasingly diverse media landscape, with advertising a significant part of this. There appears to be unanimous agreement that the ability to critically examine and make rational decisions about advertising is indispensable for contemporary citizens. Students need to develop critical thinking skills in order to evaluate messages and facts drawn from advertisements in various media. They also need to be familiar with the hidden mechanisms used to create advertisements with the goal of subconsciously influencing consumers. Today, advertising for many products has strong scientific and technological components. However, learning both with and about advertising does not play a prominent role in the science education literature. To date, the use of advertising as educational content is found almost exclusively in the humanities and social sciences, especially language education. On the other hand, there is an extensive body of research on the effects of advertising on children, consumer socialization as well as marketing strategies aimed at young consumers. The results indicate that advertising has a strong impact on children's beliefs and perceptions which already starts at an early stage. Therefore, this paper attempts to analyse the potential use of and learning about advertising in science education. It reviews the available literature, not only from science education, but also from other domains, including non-science subjects, cross-curricular approaches as well as research on the use and effects of advertising in the public arena. The aim is to identify the potential roles advertising might play in the science classroom and to open up new directions for science education research and curriculum development.
