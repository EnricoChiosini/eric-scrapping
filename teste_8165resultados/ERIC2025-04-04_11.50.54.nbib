AB  - Causal mechanistic reasoning is a thinking strategy that can help students explain complex phenomena using core ideas commonly emphasized in separate undergraduate courses, as it requires students to identify underlying entities, unpack their relevant properties and interactions, and link them to construct mechanistic explanations. As a cross-disciplinary group of biologists, chemists, and teacher educators, we designed a scaffolded set of tasks that require content knowledge from biology and chemistry to construct nested hierarchical mechanistic explanations that span three scales (molecular, macromolecular, and cellular). We examined student explanations across seven introductory and upper-level biology and chemistry courses to determine how the construction of mechanistic explanations varied across courses and the relationship between the construction of mechanistic explanations at different scales. We found non-, partial, and complete mechanistic explanations in all courses and at each scale. Complete mechanistic explanation construction was lowest in introductory chemistry, about the same across biology and organic chemistry, and highest in biochemistry. Across tasks, the construction of a mechanistic explanation at a smaller scale was associated with constructing a mechanistic explanation for larger scales; however, the use of molecular scale disciplinary resources was only associated with complete mechanistic explanations at the macromolecular, not cellular scale.

AB  - This study responds to the demands of the rapidly changing landscape of education, the 21st century competencies and development of curriculum. Those competences are being interpreted all over the world resulting to differing curricular changes. In the Finnish National Core Curriculum 2016 they are presented as seven transversal competences that guide all subject-specific instruction and must also be addressed through multidisciplinary learning modules. Our analysis aims to connect the relevant curriculum theory and new perspectives to everyday school practices. The perspective is that of the teacher education students: how the student teachers experience the demands and possibilities of the new national curriculum. A science teaching/learning module for promoting the Big ideas of Science education was introduced to them in an out-of-school environment. The results show how confident the student teachers (N = 108) were when facing the challenge of integrating the competences into teaching. The future use of this type of pedagogy was predicted by the Structural Equation path model. The results show that in general integration of the competences was not experienced as hard, but it was more challenging to figure out how to fit them into the daily school routines and timetables.

AB  - In many health-related programs biochemistry and molecular biology are core subjects, but these subjects are often not the students main focus. This challenges educators to develop curriculum that demonstrates the relevance of biochemistry and molecular biology and engages these students. This conference session discussed the value of biochemistry and molecular biology education in the health sciences and the methodologies which can be implemented.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify how and why doctoral students do interdisciplinary research. A mixed-methods approach utilising bibliometric analysis of the publications of 195 students identified those who had published interdisciplinary research. This objective measurement of the interdisciplinarity, applying the Rao-Stirling index to Web of Science and Scopus citations, allowed for a comparison of students' interdisciplinary research outcomes from three different computer science programmes: a traditional programme, a multidisciplinary doctoral school and an interdisciplinary doctoral college. Applying a sociocultural approach, interviews with the 15 most interdisciplinary students were analysed to understand how dispositions and experiences of students and factors of the different programmes affect the circumstances and processes of becoming an interdisciplinary early career scientist. The data indicate that student motivations, previous skills and knowledge interacted with policies and programme structures including type of funding and supervisor expectations to play a crucial role in interdisciplinarity at the doctoral level. These factors can give rise to interdisciplinary research even in programmes without interdisciplinary focus and compromise the interdisciplinary goals of interdisciplinary programmes.

AB  - Addressing many of the world's contemporary challenges requires a multifaceted and integrated approach and, in this respect, interdisciplinary research (IDR) is increasingly recognized as central to both academic interests and national science policies. In spite of the growing attention given to IDR, the impact of IDR remains under-investigated. In this study, we analyzed the influence of interdisciplinarity on citation impact (particularly, WoS citation) and broader impact (particularly, PloS usage) at the article level. We measured IDR in terms of three different elements of diversity-variety, balance, and disparity--as well as the integrated diversity overall. The results of negative binomial regression analysis with field fixed effects and robust standard errors show the positive effects of interdisciplinarity on both academic and broader impact. From an analysis of trends over time, the results show that higher interdisciplinary publications tend to attract more citations and have higher PLoS usage. Compared to citations, which need a more extended period to accumulate, the advantage of measuring impact with PLoS usage is its immediacy. Also, there are signs that PLoS usage and citations can mutually reinforce each other.

AB  - In this article, the authors share lessons combining visual arts, sound, technology, and science through the lens of soundscape, STEAM, and multisensory education. Focusing on teacher education, this article explores two primary issues. First, it considers how STEAM--multisensory integration fosters students' cultural understanding and expression of selves. Second, it looks at how these types of lessons contribute to students' comprehension of the concept of STEAM-multisensory integration. The conclusion of this article includes a summary of the key findings from the lessons, which offers further insights into soundscape approaches and transdisciplinary methodologies within STEAM--multisensory education.

AB  - Internationalization of the Curriculum (IoC) has proved essential to realize the potential of internationalization as a driver of quality in Higher Education. The broadening of topics, bibliographic materials and other resources that result from it improve the breadth and depth of the content, making it more comprehensive, updated, and relevant. Moreover, the Internationalization at Home (IaH) strand that seeks to mobilize the informal and the hidden curriculum to bring stay-at-home students an international experience similar to that of those going abroad widens access. However, both IoC and its IaH subset have centered mostly around individual disciplines. This article proposes an alternative view of IoC that focuses on interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to reviewing the curriculum, in particular STEAM, including indigenous knowledge as it does not separate the arts and humanities from science (STEM). Using case studies and quoting instances of best practice, the article demonstrates that the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches advocated are better suited to pursue the learning outcomes sought by IoC.

AB  - Higher education is faced with the challenging problem of preparing students for their careers while developing them to be well-rounded, life-long learners. Employers report they desire candidates who use a broader set of skills and have higher levels of learning and knowledge to meet the increasingly complex demands of today's workplace. At Mercer University, the Department of Chemistry offers a traditional ACS-certified B.S. degree in Chemistry, but for some students, this course of study does not address their desire for the interdisciplinarity that is becoming more common in today's work environment. The department has developed a program in Chemical Commerce that focuses on developing students' foundational knowledge in several of the chemical disciplines while also providing them with a business curriculum. The program provides a high degree of flexibility for students, with B.A. and B.S. tracks and three areas of focus in business to choose from (Accounting, Business Management, and Economics). An upper-level chemistry course titled "Traditions in Commercial Chemistry" was developed for advanced Chemistry, Chemical Commerce, and Biochemistry and Molecular Biology majors and served as a capstone experience for these students. This course focused on the application of advanced chemistry and its associated principles in a variety of business sectors. With the broad skills students have acquired in the program, they have gained employment in industry and matriculated into medical, pharmacy, and business-administration programs. Though not intended to replace a full chemistry degree, this program is in high demand and is experiencing exceptional growth from students who seek components of a chemistry degree while gaining business acumen. Approaches used in developing these degrees and course are highly transferrable to other institutions and may provide more options for students interested in a wider variety of career paths.

AB  - While interdisciplinarity is not a new concept, the political and discursive mobilisation of interdisciplinarity is. Since the 1990s, this movement has intensified, and this has affected central funding bodies so that interdisciplinarity is now a de facto requirement in successful grant application. As a result, the literature is ripe with definitions, taxonomies, discussions and other attempts to grasp and define the concept of interdisciplinarity. In this paper, we explore how strategic demands for interdisciplinarity meet, interact with and change local research practices and results of higher education and research. Our aim is to question and trace the consequences of applying the slippery and difficult term interdisciplinarity in research. The paper is based on ethnographic fieldwork in a Danish interdisciplinary research programme, where we observed and analysed practices of writing, publishing, collaboration and educational development in five different research projects. We show how the call for interdisciplinarity was mobilised in a way that rendered the incentives and motives behind the programme unclear. Furthermore, we argue that the absence of clear definitions and assessment criteria produced a dominant, all-inclusive, but vague, configuration of interdisciplinarity that affected the research outcome, and ultimately, promoted and reproduced the existing monodisciplinary research and power structures.

AB  - In this theoretical essay, we find inspiration in Lotman's semiotics, in Morìn's sociology of education, the studies of cultural psychology and psychoanalysis of Valsiner and De Luca Picione, and other cultural stimuli coming from the didactics of mathematics. The notion of boundary and liminality was developed and discussed to grasp a relationship between some psychological processes and some transformative aspects of educational processes. Our idea is that an interdisciplinarity education could help orient disciplinary resources towards common educational goals and acquire the skills necessary for each student to be a citizen of the glocal community.

AB  - An interdisciplinary approach to science education through history of art is proposed. The approach is innovative, as the artworks complement the history, philosophy and sociology of science contents to increase students' interest and motivation. The approach integrates humanities and science education through history of art, which requests interdisciplinary cooperation of the teachers of the school subjects involved with historical curriculum contents. The approach is elaborated through the case of Galileo's telescope, which provides specific features on the relationships between science and technology (scientific instrumentation applied to generate knowledge), nature of science, and science-technology-society relationships, where history and art meet each other. Further, history of art contributes some contemporary artworks on Galileo case that highlight all those relationships. The explicitness, perception, beauty and accessibility of the paintings may also be a key element to develop teachers' and students' interest and motivation in teaching and learning science through its integration with history of art. Finally, the interdisciplinary educational approach develops a teaching-learning sequence on the basis of Galileo's telescope to guide teaching the issue in science education through history of art. This didactic exemplification elaborates some aims, contents, resources and activities throughout the human, social, philosophical, artistic, scientific and historical aspects involved in the case of Galileo that teachers must adapt to specific subjects, degree and students.

AB  - This paper explores the influence of the concept of interdisciplinarity on the work of educational technologists and others involved in technology-enhanced learning (TEL) research. There is a growing recognition of the need for interdisciplinarity in solving complex research problems in many areas of science. Technology-enhanced learning is a relatively young area of research adopting a multidisciplinary approach to investigating the use of technologies for learning. This makes it a field that is worthy of exploration in terms of how the ways of working developed by its practitioners inform our understanding of the challenges of the field as well as its benefits. This paper reporting on work commissioned by the Joint Research Councils' programme on Technology Enhanced Learning provides a discussion of the growing literature on this topic, and a study of the working practices of academics in TEL research. An interview study of 18 participants was conducted as part of the project. The paper reports on the key findings from the interviews and concludes with some practical suggestions to help participants deal with the challenges posed by interdisciplinary working in TEL research.

AB  - The faculty at Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences (MCPHS) recognized the potential benefits for collaborative teaching and learning across disciplines. Research and development of an Interprofessional Case Learning Project (ICLP) laid the foundation for the creation and implementation of a problem-based learning course. This course, Interdisciplinary Perspectives of an Infectious Disease--Malaria, introduced innovative interdisciplinary pedagogy into the curriculum of the MCPHS School of Arts & Sciences. Designed by biologists, chemists, historians, and public health faculty, this course introduced senior pre-medicine majors to varied methods and theories as they worked in groups to solve problems related to the incidence, prevention, and treatment of an infectious disease. Students' deliverables included journal-quality research papers and posters presented at the MCPHS School of Arts & Sciences Undergraduate Research Conference.

AB  - The article explores the importance of early reading proficiency and its long-term impact on academic and life outcomes, particularly in Romania. Analyzing PISA data, the article highlights significant literacy gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students, as well as urban and rural learners. These disparities perpetuate intergenerational poverty and limit future opportunities. The importance of early interventions is presented, as research shows that reading difficulties in first grade often persist through later years. Key components of emergent literacy are identified, such as phonemic awareness, letter recognition, word recognition, and story structure. Proven methods like screening tools, phonics instruction, and leveled reading materials are presented, which are critical for overcoming early confusion and preventing reading failure. While research in English offers valuable insights, its has its limitations when applied to Romanian, a language with simpler orthography. Targeted studies are necessary to address gaps in understanding Romanian-specific reading processes, including phonics, fluency norms, and intuitive spelling stages. To advance literacy outcomes, there is a need for stronger teacher preparation programs, interdisciplinary research, and collaboration with international literacy experts. By fostering a research-driven approach tailored to Romanian needs, educators can implement effective strategies to close literacy gaps and ensure all students achieve reading proficiency, ultimately improving their life prospects.

AB  - Transdisciplinary learning environments have potential to bring together the arts, sciences, and computing within schools. We investigate the student and teacher enactment of sensemaking practices that break down disciplinary silos. We describe a pedagogical approach, Luminous Science, where students make dynamic, computationally-rich artistic representations of data from a classroom garden. Then we present an analysis of students' sensemaking practices used during the transdisciplinary unit in three cases of art, science and computing classrooms. Qualitative analysis of a student group and teachers' curricular materials in each of these classrooms elucidates how teachers' enactment choices, organization, and facilitation of the unit we co-designed with them facilitated opportunities for students' transdisciplinary thinking and learning. We show that when teachers' enactments supported increased computational complexity and ties between artifact and phenomenon, then students participated in deeper transdisciplinary sensemaking. We discuss the implications for the design of curricular materials and professional development to support effective organization and discourse practices by teachers in orchestrating transdisciplinary sensemaking.

AB  - We present a simple undergraduate level experiment dealing with the preparation and characterization of a colloidal Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film. The experiment is designed to invoke an interdisciplinary understanding of colloid chemistry and surface science. It will allow the students to develop the concepts of wettability, hydrophobicity, and surface structuring with colloidal nano- and microparticles. In this experiment, the student prepares an LB film of submicron colloidal particles on a well-cleaned glass slide. The contact angle, surface morphology, and packing efficiency of the LB film are later characterized by a goniometer and an optical microscope. The students learn a very useful method of making colloidal LB films and further understanding their surface properties. It will help to broaden their knowledge in chemistry and materials science.

AB  - Historically, research disciplines have successfully operated independently. However, the emergence of transdisciplinary research has led to convergence methodologies, resulting in groundbreaking discoveries. Despite the benefits, graduate programs face challenges in implementing transdisciplinary research and preparing students for real-world collaboration across diverse disciplines and experience levels. We propose a convergence training framework integrating project-based learning, training modules, and collaborative teaming to address this. This approach, tested in a multi-institutional workshop, proved effective in bridging expertise gaps and fostering successful convergence learning experiences in computational biointerface (material-biology interface) research. Here, biointerface research focuses on control of biomolecular interactions with technologically relevant material surfaces, which is a critical component of biotechnology and engineering applications. Positive outcomes, including conference presentations and published models, endorse the framework's application in graduate curricula, particularly for students engaging in transdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - There is a long tradition of teaching science through inquiry, with broad agreement about the form it should take. Students should investigate researchable questions; gather and analyse data; and develop and represent evidence-based claims. Authoritative teacher or textbook representations are generally used to guide this learning (Buckley & Boulter, 2000; Bybee, 1997; Furtak et al., 2012; Sell et al., 2006). Parallel to this approach, teachers have also guided students to construct, review and refine their own representations, leading to learning gains. However, this student representation construction approach poses new challenges for teachers. The teacher is expected to elicit and guide students' reasoning about their own represented claims as an orientation to understanding and learning scientific forms of reasoning and their representation. In this paper, drawing on our initial account of this pedagogy, we aim to clarify further this approach's rationale and teacher strategies and underlying purposes in key early stages of exploration in the topics of chemistry and mathematics with a Grade 5 class. An interdisciplinary focus was used to guide students' learning about the science concepts of states of matter, evaporation and the mathematical concepts of formal and informal measurement and data representation. Analysed data included video capture of the teacher's guidance of tasks and classroom discussion, student artefacts and teacher and student interviews. We identify how the teacher framed the task, oriented student inquiry and guided evaluation of students' representations through implicit and explicit instruction.

AB  - Recent studies have posited that K-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education should go beyond traditional subject silos and take an interdisciplinary approach that integrates these core subjects into a cohesive curriculum to foster authentic problem-solving skills. The purpose of this study was to field test one of five proposed packages of interdisciplinary STEM lessons to examine its feasibility for further revisions of lesson development. The study employed a piecewise linear growth model to examine growth patterns of students' science vocabulary acquisition and contextualized problem-solving skills during a 40-week observation period. Results showed that all students with learning disabilities (N = 9) made significant knowledge gains in these two areas and maintained them for a long term--two and four weeks post intervention. Our findings are encouraging and provide initial evidence for effective lesson design to support STEM education for students with learning disabilities.

AB  - The goal of this research is to provide a rich set of connections between two fields: (i) Nanoscale science and technology (NST) and (ii) topics from a common middle school physics curriculum. NST is emerging as one of the most promising new fields of the 21st century, which is one of the many arguments for including NST topics in secondary science education. A specially designed guided discourse with NST scientists was used to produce a map of connections between the two fields. During the discourse, the scientists were presented with two sets of concepts using a visual board and were asked to find connections between them. All suggested connections and the corresponding context offered by the scientists were arranged and presented as a rich set of connections. For example, (i) the NST concept of characterization methods is connected to mechanical forces and can be explained using the example of an atomic force microscope; (ii) the NST concept of size-dependent properties was connected to 7th grade inquiry skills by explaining the size dependence of accuracy, errors, and defects. This set of connections was validated by an experienced middle school science teacher in an open discussion regarding teachers adopting and implementing the resulting insertion points for the curriculum. This resulting set of connections can be used to enrich the curriculum within the NST field. It also provides a perspective on scientists' views regarding insertion of contemporary NST topics into physics middle school education.

AB  - As a "wicked problem," climate change requires interdisciplinary understanding and collaboration in order to prepare future leaders to develop solutions. To this end, as an ecologist and an anthropologist at a mid-sized university in the southeastern U.S., we designed a pair of interdisciplinary, research-intensive courses for first-year Honors students with the goal of improving understanding and communicating the urgency of climate change. We employed High Impact Practices (HIPs) and Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) to accomplish learning outcomes during both years of the course. Gains in scientific knowledge and climate change-specific knowledge were assessed with quantitative and qualitative analysis of pre and post-tests. Analysis suggests that the course improved climate change knowledge and sophistication of interdisciplinary thinking and increased student confidence in understanding of the process of science. This course structure offers an approach to providing a practice space for developing multifaceted solutions to wicked problems.

AB  - While it is essential for life science students to be trained in modern techniques and approaches, rapidly developing, interdisciplinary fields such as bioinformatics present distinct challenges to undergraduate educators. In particular, many educators lack training in new fields, and high-quality teaching and learning materials may be sparse. To address this challenge with respect to bioinformatics, the Network for the Integration of Bioinformatics into Life Science Education (NIBLSE), in partnership with Quantitative Undergraduate Biology Education and Synthesis (QUBES), developed incubators, a novel collaborative process for the development of open educational resources (OER). Incubators are short-term, online communities that refine unpublished teaching lessons into more polished and widely usable learning resources. The resulting products are published and made freely available in the NIBLSE Resource Collection, providing recognition of scholarly work by incubator participants. In addition to producing accessible, high-quality resources, incubators also provide opportunities for faculty development. Because participants are intentionally chosen to represent a range of expertise in bioinformatics and pedagogy, incubators also build professional connections among educators with diverse backgrounds and perspectives and promote the discussion of practical issues involved in deploying a resource in the classroom. Here we describe the incubator process and provide examples of beneficial outcomes. Our experience indicates that incubators are a low cost, short-term, flexible method for the development of OERs and professional community that could be adapted to a variety of disciplinary and pedagogical contexts.

AB  - Is there a crisis in Australian science and mathematics education? Declining enrolments in upper secondary Science and Mathematics courses have gained much attention from the media, politicians and high-profile scientists over the last few years, yet there is no consensus amongst stakeholders about either the nature or the magnitude of the changes. We have collected raw enrolment data from the education departments of each of the Australian states and territories from 1992 to 2012 and analysed the trends for Biology, Chemistry, Physics, two composite subject groups (Earth Sciences and Multidisciplinary Sciences), as well as entry, intermediate and advanced Mathematics. The results of these analyses are discussed in terms of participation rates, raw enrolments and gender balance. We have found that the total number of students in Year 12 increased by around 16% from 1992 to 2012 while the participation rates for most Science and Mathematics subjects, as a proportion of the total Year 12 cohort, fell (Biology (-10%), Chemistry (-5%), Physics (-7%), Multidisciplinary Science (-5%), intermediate Mathematics (-11%), advanced Mathematics (-7%) in the same period. There were increased participation rates in Earth Sciences (+0.3%) and entry Mathematics (+11%). In each case the greatest rates of change occurred prior to 2001 and have been slower and steadier since. We propose that the broadening of curriculum offerings, further driven by students' self-perception of ability and perceptions of subject difficulty and usefulness, are the most likely cause of the changes in participation. While these continuing declines may not amount to a crisis, there is undoubtedly serious cause for concern.

AB  - Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) gaps persist in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, as demonstrated by the discrimination, stereotyping, and inequities that historically and persistently marginalized groups face. Recognition of this gap led a transdisciplinary team to develop foundational-level e-learning modules, titled "Foundations for Inclusive and Respectful Engagement" (FIRE) on EDI capacities to be delivered in STEM undergraduate classes at the University of British Columbia's Okanagan campus. FIRE consists of online, asynchronous, self-study modules delivered through the learning management system, Canvas. Feedback from pilot testing the FIRE modules has demonstrated that STEM students find the modules to be relevant and beneficial. Throughout the development of FIRE, we learned the importance of aligning the course with our institution's values, working in a transdisciplinary team, and revising iteratively. This documentation of the development and preliminary feasibility of the FIRE modules aims to assist other institutions or organizations who are in the process of developing their own EDI teaching and learning materials.

AB  - Systems thinking, interdisciplinary research projects, and creative problem solving are ways to frame modern chemistry curricula to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, teachers, and citizens to use their skills and education to create a sustainable future. By integrating planetary boundaries, green chemistry, and the UN sustainable development goals, we use a systems thinking approach in undergraduate education and outreach to a range of diverse populations to drive discussion, exploration of scientific principles, and teach students how they can use chemistry to solve the distinctive challenges of the anthropocene. Interdisciplinary research projects employ critical thinking, problem solving, and creativity as part of the scientific method. Translating undergraduate research in nanotechnology, renewable energy, and sustainability into lesson plans and engaging in outreach to diverse populations promotes equity in science education and encourages underrepresented groups to seek careers in a scientific field. Community college students act as role models in outreach as they teach chemistry using a systems thinking approach, connect sustainability to STEM careers that can make a positive impact on local communities, and show underrepresented groups that they are needed in these disciplines. Engaging, interdisciplinary laboratories used in outreach, such as the synthesis of algae biodiesel, making paints from natural resources, sustainable agriculture and engineering, and DNA origami, access all aspects of systems thinking. Using systems thinking as a framework in science education and outreach teaches students the significance and relevance of chemistry while creating a platform for women and underrepresented groups to learn how important their representation is to contribute to a sustainable, equitable future.

AB  - Society needs transdisciplinary citizens with good scientific literacy. One way to achieve this could be through the use of areas or subjects for which students have more affinity and expertise. This study seeks to maximize the chemistry learning of students who want to be musicians, through the use of analogies. Analogies are a powerful tool to explain abstract, unfamiliar, or complex scientific concepts (such as the quantum atomic model) in familiar terms and to promote positive attitudes toward learning science. A case study is presented regarding the use of musical analogies developed to teach the atom concept, subatomic particles, and the atomic structure, according to the quantum mechanical model of the atom. A cohort of 50 Portuguese 12 to 13 year old students, enrolled in the seventh grade of a middle school music course, was selected by convenience sampling from four schools. A questionnaire and interviews were used for data gathering. The results show that the musical analogies used helped to overcome students' difficulties regarding the topics taught, improved chemistry learning, and stimulated attentiveness and interest. The use of analogies between music and chemistry with students of similar characteristics to those of this study, or the use of different areas and subjects for other student backgrounds and tastes, can be fruitful for teaching chemical content.

AB  - Fieldwork has always been an important component in the teaching of ecology in England's secondary schools where it has been delivered almost exclusively as part of the biology curriculum for nearly 70 years. However, historical evidence shows that both the quantity and quality of ecology fieldwork has been declining in recent decades at a time when the scope, complexity and interdisciplinarity of ecological science has been growing. This paper presents evidence of a continuing decline in ecology fieldwork over the past 15 years, discusses some possible causes and reviews solutions to reverse the trend. In particular, it argues that teaching scientific ecology through geography fieldwork could overcome several of the fundamental obstacles encountered in biology education. Trends in biology and geography fieldwork are compared. These show that the risks to ecology in forging a strong relationship, and increased dependency, with geography teaching are likely to be outweighed by reciprocal benefits.

AB  - STEM, STEAM education is important for building a better future, and teachers have a key role in attracting students to the field of STEM. However, when teachers need to shift from traditional disciplinary-based education to integrated STEM education, they often find this transition challenging. This difficulty arises because their beliefs about science teaching and learning are deeply rooted in traditional disciplinary-based approaches. Beliefs have a profound influence on their teaching practises as well as their professional development, even though teachers are often not conscious of their own beliefs. To address this issue, we employed a phenomenological approach to investigate the phenomena when their beliefs espoused by asking formative episodes that influenced their development as science teachers. This study aimed at exploring the current subject-specific beliefs of in-service science teachers. This told us how best to guide teachers through this process of the transition from traditional disciplinary-based education to STEM education. Our findings revealed that teachers' beliefs showed that curiosity and/or interest towards science to be the most important factors in student learning. This indicates that while teachers' core beliefs are not entirely disciplinary-oriented, they are more open. It would reduce their anxiety and low self-efficacy in conveying STEM education.

AB  - Bioinformatics--the so-called shotgun marriage between biology and computer science--is an interdiscipline. Despite interdisciplinarity being seen as a virtue, for having the capacity to solve complex problems and foster innovation, it has the potential to place projects and people in anomalous categories. For example, valorised "outputs" in academia are often defined and rewarded by discipline. Bioinformatics, as an interdisciplinary bricolage, incorporates experts from various disciplinary cultures with their own distinct ways of working. Perceived problems of interdisciplinarity include difficulties of making explicit knowledge that is practical, theoretical, or cognitive. But successful interdisciplinary research also depends on an understanding of disciplinary cultures and value systems, often only tacitly understood by members of the communities in question. In bioinformatics, the "parent" disciplines have different value systems; for example, what is considered worthwhile research by computer scientists can be thought of as trivial by biologists, and "vice versa." This paper concentrates on the problems of reward and recognition described by scientists working in academic bioinformatics in the United Kingdom. We highlight problems that are a consequence of its cross-cultural make-up, recognising that the mismatches in knowledge in this borderland take place not just at the level of the practical, theoretical, or epistemological, but also at the cultural level, too. The trend in big, interdisciplinary science is towards multiple authors on a single paper; in bioinformatics this has created "hybrid" or "fractional" scientists who find they are being positioned not just in-between established disciplines but also in-between as middle authors or, worse still, left off papers altogether.

AB  - Complex global challenges and declining scientific literacy demand novel approaches to engaging students with science and the natural world. While evidence supports integrating creative and scientific modes of inquiry, these approaches are often separated in undergraduate education. We designed Ecology Through the Writer's Lens (ETWL) to allow students to explore an ecosystem of critical importance, the tall grass prairie, through an interdisciplinary field experience. Co-taught by Biology and English professors and open to students of all majors, ETWL leverages classroom activities to prepare for and process the immersive field experience over the course of one semester. Field-based exercises include natural history observations, hypothesis building, experimental design, analysis of the literature, and creative/reflective writing. Learning was assessed through multiple assignments, including a final creative project that spanned diverse writing genres. Students met and exceeded expectations with respect to course objectives. Non-science majors learned how scientific knowledge is generated; science majors learned how creative approaches can open new pathways for exploration. Many students overcame fear of natural spaces. Several students independently engaged with tall grass prairie in post-course activities. We conclude that interdisciplinary approaches to field-based inquiry can generate transformative experiences, even when the immersive component is short-term and close to home. ETWL provides one model by which different modes of inquiry can be blended to enhance student appreciation of science, literature, and the environment.

AB  - Creating authentic science assessments that engage students in conceptual understanding and provide evidence of their learning is challenging. Student-centered instruction and assessments provide an opportunity to build student agency and foster positive student relations with science. This qualitative work showcases assessments that focus on knowledge-in-use and assessments that incorporate opportunities for and evidence of student learning. We present the design, implementation, and reception of two authentic assessments, Science Portfolios and Teaching Presentations, designed for and implemented in an interdisciplinary science content course for preservice K-8 educators. Each assessment was designed to deepen student knowledge and incorporate relevance to students' future careers as teachers. These science assessments created authentic opportunities for, and served as evidence of, student learning. We offer our reflections about the implementation and discuss how these types of assessments could be used in other science classrooms.

AB  - This study explored the views of 63 Taiwanese pre-service teachers who had participated in a workshop about the value of integrating drama-based approaches in their practical science learning. It was primarily designed to investigate the pedagogical approach of Heathcote and other founders of process drama. In addition, it examined specific claims that it immerses learners in an enjoyable and social learning environment (Poston-Anderson, 2008; Lin, 2017) and that learners can practice core scientific skills such as making predictions, observing, and then validating their predictions (Weisberg et al., 2016). Following the workshop, participants completed an anonymized online questionnaire. Descriptive data analysis indicated that most participants (75%) strongly agreed that integrating drama-based approaches into practical science teaching was satisfying. Of the remainder, 20.7% agreed, 2.1% neither agreed nor disagreed, 2.2% disagreed, and none strongly disagreed with this statement. Moreover, 34.9% of the participants lacked opportunities to experience improvisation and integration of drama-based teaching in practical science. The study indicated that a drama-based approach can be a highly effective strategy for enhancing practical science teaching among pre-service teachers. Furthermore, the findings provide valuable insights into the factors influencing drama-based teaching in practical science. They suggest it could be an excellent strategy to stimulate learners' interest in science and interdisciplinary science-related subjects and improve their science skills. Teachers could thus provide young children with similar drama-based teaching in practical science activities to promote their learning of science. Finally, the study offers a set of important recommendations for future pedagogical policymaking and further research by drama-based practitioners.

AB  - Information technology is a significant action to promote education informatization. Currently, there are numerous literature studies on information technology education, but existing research lacks a comparative summary of the research status, research hot spots, and research trend of information technology in China and abroad from an overall perspective. Therefore, this paper selected the information technology education literature collected by China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Web of Science Core Collection (WoS) from 2000 to 2021 as the research object and used bibliometrics to analyze the literature characteristics, core forces, research hot spot, and frontier trend of information technology education in China and abroad. The results showed that: (1) The discipline literature of information technology education showed a fluctuating growth trend, in which the growth rate of foreign literature was faster, and the scale of Chinese literature was slightly smaller; Both Chinese and foreign literature involved pedagogy, computer, and other disciplines, with the characteristics of multi-disciplinary integration. (2) The United States was the leading country in this field, followed by China, with the total literature accounting for more than 50%, ranking the leading position in the world; China Audio-Visual Education and Computers & Education were representative journals in China and abroad. (3) Foreign research focused on information technology, education, science, attitude, model, perception, experience, self-efficacy, Internet, etc. China's hotspots included information literacy, computational thinking, curriculum standards, application contexts, teaching models, subject integration, etc. Foreign research focused on both theory and practice, while China focused on the theoretical nature of the subject, but the degree of practice was insufficient. (4) Student participation, technology integration, teaching innovation, Internet +, core literacy, and artificial intelligence (AI) have been popular until now, constituting the discipline frontier in information technology education.

AB  - Education in implementation science, which involves the training of health professionals in how to implement evidence-based findings into health practice systematically, has become a highly relevant topic in health sciences education. The present study advances education in implementation science by compiling a competence profile for implementation practice and research and by exploring implementation experts' sources of expertise. The competence profile is theoretically based on educational psychology, which implies the definition of improvable and teachable competences. In an online-survey, an international, multidisciplinary sample of 82 implementation experts named competences that they considered most helpful for conducting implementation practice and implementation research. For these competences, they also indicated whether they had acquired them in their professional education, additional training, or by self-study and on-the-job experience. Data were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach that combined qualitative content analyses with descriptive statistics. The participants deemed collaboration knowledge and skills most helpful for implementation practice. For implementation research, they named research methodology knowledge and skills as the most important ones. The participants had acquired most of the competences that they found helpful for implementation practice in self-study or by on-the-job experience. However, participants had learned most of their competences for implementation research in their professional education. The present results inform education and training activities in implementation science and serve as a starting point for a fluid set of interdisciplinary implementation science competences that will be updated continuously. Implications for curriculum development and the design of educational activities are discussed.

AB  - Although science education, including biochemistry and molecular biology education, starts before students commence university, for many students, undergraduate programs are their first real introduction to biochemistry and molecular biology. Students often report that biochemistry and molecular biology are relatively difficult topics hence the use of varied and well-thought-out approaches are critical to fully engage students. This session provided insights into undergraduate curriculum design.

AB  - Adolescents are considered as a nutritionally vulnerable subgroup because of their alimentary behaviours. Considering that alimentary habits are strongly influenced by knowledge about digestion, an experiment was conducted with aim to determine whether conceptual understanding and functionalization of this knowledge can be improved by the interdisciplinary teaching approach. The experiment encompassed 258 students attending the fourth year of high school. No statistically significant difference in the level of the previously acquired chemistry, biology and physics knowledge concerning digestion between the two groups was determined on the pre-test. Conversely, the students in the experimental group significantly outperformed those in the control group on the post-test that required a deep understanding and the application of knowledge about digestion in solving real-life problems. Therefore, it was concluded that high-school teachers can be advised to apply the interdisciplinary teaching approach in order to improve their students' knowledge about this process.

AB  - This paper presents a teaching scenario designed to introduce preschool children to electricity, structured around the 5E instructional model (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate). The study involves 18 children from an urban kindergarten with diverse backgrounds and learning needs. Over four weeks, children engage in interactive activities to understand electrical devices, electric current, static electricity, conductors, insulators, electricity generation, and safety. The curriculum integrates interdisciplinary learning, combining literacy and science, and uses hands-on experiments and digital tools to enhance engagement. Activities include constructing simple circuits, experimenting with static electricity, and role-playing. Emphasis is placed on practical applications and safety. Findings highlight the effectiveness of a constructivist approach, where children build understanding through exploration. The study underscores the need for resources, teacher preparedness, and inclusive strategies to address diverse learning needs. This scenario provides insights into effective early childhood science education, emphasizing the potential to build a strong foundation for future learning and curiosity in young children.

AB  - Integrated or interdisciplinary teaching is an approach that encourages students to synthesize knowledge from more than one discipline in order to solve problems. It focuses on students' interests, a connection of subjects, use of authentic situations and problem solving techniques. This study aimed to make clear the concept of interdisciplinary teaching, by identifying how different subjects could be integrated in a curriculum and how interdisciplinary work could be developed and organized in mathematics classrooms. By reviewing various literature of the research on the topic of interdisciplinary education, the study synthesized ideas, concepts and models in interdisciplinary teaching. Then the study discussed how to apply the explored theory of interdisciplinary teaching in the Vietnamese mathematics situation. It was found out that projects should be used for interdisciplinary mathematics education. A four-step process to design an interdisciplinary project for Vietnamese mathematics classrooms was proposed. This process proved to be a useful guideline for mathematics teachers to design interdisciplinary projects. Two interdisciplinary projects for Mathematics involving Biology as the second subject were introduced in this study. These are examples of how to construct an interdisciplinary project based on the four-step process. Through these projects, students could know how to integrate skills and knowledge of the two subjects Mathematics and Biology to solve a real life problem.

AB  - This qualitative study examines the influence of a 3-year professional development project for middle school mathematics, science, and special education teachers focused on integrating science, mathematics, and engineering in classroom instruction on participants' understandings of productive struggle in learning. Multi-disciplinary teams of teachers engaged as learners to use engineering design as a framework for integrating significant mathematics and science content supported by effective teaching practices. In this paper, we describe how the components of our professional development design supported teacher-participants to make sense of productive struggle in learning. In particular, participants noted that being able to experience design-based activities as learners and working through solutions with their colleagues supported their understanding of what it means to productively struggle, resulting in their growth as individuals and as teachers. The significance in this work lies in understanding how to effectively support teachers to buy-in to the meaning and value of productive struggle and how engaging in integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), design-based professional learning experiences facilitated that effort.

AB  - From literature, we know that making the connections between mathematics and physics is not trivial for most students, even at the advanced level. In the specific context of partial derivatives in thermodynamics, research suggests that making explicit connections between the mathematics and the physics is necessary to foster student understanding. In this paper, we investigate how graphical reasoning can help undergraduate students in making connections between the partial derivatives of temperature with respect to position and to time and their respective physical meaning in the context of one-dimensional systems modeled by the heat equation. We conducted task-based, think aloud interviews with four pairs of undergraduate students majoring in physics or mathematics and use dynamic conceptual blending diagrams to analyze their reasoning processes and the role of the graphs therein. The results in this paper indicate that stimulating graphical reasoning is a promising way to promote the blending of mathematical and physical knowledge. Specifically, our data shows that constructing graphs can be a catalyst which helps students to give physical meaning to the partial derivatives ?T/?t and/or ?T/?x. Therefore, in teaching/learning activities, actively promoting graph construction and reasoning based on those graphs offers perspectives to support the blending of mathematics and physics.

AB  - Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a vibrational spectroscopic technique useful in chemical, pharmaceutical, and forensic sciences. It is essential to identify chemicals for reasons spanning from scientific research and academic practices to quality control in companies. However, in some university degrees, graduate students do not get the proficiency to optimize the experimental parameters to obtain the best IR spectra; to correlate the IR spectral bands with the molecular vibrations (chemical elucidation); to have some criteria for any substance identification (especially relevant in quality control to recognize counterfeit); and to apply chemometrics for comparing, visualizing, and classifying the IR spectra. This work presents an experimental laboratory practice for an introductory teaching of the IR instrumental conditions in the identification of substances based on visual spectra comparison and statistical analysis and matching. Then, the selected IR conditions are applied to different commercial drugs, in the solid state or in solution, mostly composed of acetaminophen. Finally, the students apply chemometrics analysis to the IR data. This practice was designed for the training in a chemistry subject for undergraduate students of the chemistry, pharmacy, or forensics degrees, among others related to science, medical, food, or technological sciences.

AB  - A primary aim of science education is to teach students how to interpret and engage with scientific information. To do so effectively requires an adequate understanding of the nature of science (NOS)--in other words, what science is and how it works. There is a long history of evidence to suggest that many undergraduate students struggle to properly understand NOS. While the specific factors contributing to misinformed views on NOS may be difficult to tease apart, the way in which students learn about science at the undergraduate level is a significant contributor. We implemented a reflection activity in a unique first-year program at a large Canadian university in order to promote student learning of NOS. Through the students' reflections, we identified how certain pedagogical approaches, many of which deviate from traditional teaching methods used throughout undergraduate science education, can positively impact student comprehension of NOS. Our experiences support the use of reflective practices in promoting critical thinking and the development of more nuanced student views of NOS.

AB  - This paper describes a number of active learning strategies based on implementing the Raspberry Pi as low-cost single-board computing device for carrying out physics laboratory activities. This Microcomputer-Based Laboratory (MBL) Project has been funded by the Baden-Württemberg Foundation and it encompasses the use of high-accuracy yet inexpensive sensors for controlling digital inputs and outputs and for data acquisition in physics experiments. The open-source software package PhyPiDAQ consists of programmed classes in Python which, together with the Raspberry Pi, manage the collection, display, and storage of data obtained from physical sensors. Thus, students select pre-configured default modules of specific sensors such as for position, acceleration, temperature, current or force sensor, as well as a variety of representations and graphical features for the display of real-time data. An extensive range of recorded measurements may be interdisciplinary used in analytical processes for statistic calculation, or for numerical derivative and integration of physical quantities. The rich array of innovative implementations of this Raspberry Pi based MBL fosters an environment in which students can carry out a variety of creative exploratory physics activities within as well as beyond the classroom.

AB  - To assist preservice elementary teachers in attaining scientific competence, knowledge, and understanding of interdisciplinary concepts, a teacher education model--the combined individual microteaching, modeled teaching, and inquiry-based team-teaching (CIMIT) model--was established, and its effectiveness was evaluated. A quasiexperimental design was adopted, and 57 preservice elementary teachers from 2 classes of a science education preparatory course were included in the analysis (30 in the experimental group and 27 in the control group). The 18-week course comprised 36 h of classes. Before and after the course, all participants completed pretests and posttests, respectively, that measured basic scientific competency and subject matter knowledge. Quantitative and qualitative data were also collected and analyzed. The instruction of the CIMIT group comprised 3 stages: individual microteaching, modeled demonstration inquiry--based teaching by an expert teacher, and inquiry-based team teaching. For the control group, the inquiry-based team-teaching stage was omitted. The results validated the effectiveness of the CIMIT model. First, the experimental group exhibited a significantly greater improvement in scientific competency and knowledge than did the control group. Second, after training, the experimental group's knowledge of interdisciplinary concepts increased for all seven interdisciplinary concepts.

AB  - In the last decades spectroscopy began to play an essential role in physics education research with the recognition that atomic spectra constitute a good occasion to study the concepts of quantum mechanics. Moreover, activities in which atomic spectra are studied in order to understand star structure and evolution have proved particularly engaging for students. In this sense, the hydrogen atom spectrum is especially important in astronomy. Other researchers showed how interdisciplinary experimental activities involving interferometry and applied optics offer a good occasion to teach fundamental concepts of radiation-matter interaction.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to design, implement, and evaluate a course according to a STEM education approach for pre-service science teachers. The study was conducted in three phases according to an educational design research method: preliminary research, development or prototyping, and assessment (Plomp & Nieveen, 2013). The STEM education pre-knowledge form, STEM lesson plans, the STEM lesson plan evaluation form, STEM self-evaluation, and peer-evaluation forms, and a semi-structured face-to-face interview form were used as qualitative data collection tools. Data were analyzed by methods of content analysis. The results suggest that pre-service science teachers need education in the dimensions of the theoretical structure of STEM education, STEM disciplines and integration, 21st-century skills, sample STEM activities, current science curriculum, STEM learning/teaching methods and techniques, measurement and assessment for STEM education, collaboration with peers, and planning-implementing a lesson according to STEM education. The findings showed that the STEM course design developed through this study was seen to be effective in responding pre-service teachers' needs. In STEM course design, six activities were prepared in the context of designing a 21st-century house and designing a vehicle according to the trans-disciplinary model and hands on minds on method. According to the relevant literature, the findings were discussed and future studies should provide collaboration with pre-service teachers, students, and in-service teachers. Future studies should also focus on developing the knowledge and skills of pre-service teachers about engineering and technology discipline and show how to integrate these disciplines into their real-life problems.

AB  - Argumentation is widely recognised as a core practice of science, but the relation between argumentation in the teaching of science in contrast to the teaching of other school subjects has not been sufficiently addressed. In this study, we investigate science and religious education (RE) teachers' instructional practices related to argumentation in lower secondary lessons in England. Through qualitative analysis of a pair of science and RE teachers' instructional practices, we characterise how the teachers participating in a professional development project understand and teach argumentation. Data sources included questionnaires, lesson materials, classroom video recordings, and written teacher reflections. Findings suggest that both teachers recognised the value of argumentation in their subject, but some variations existed in the nuances of their views and particularly how different instructional strategies were utilised to achieve the lesson goals related to argumentation. The study highlights the teachers' different understandings and enactments of argumentation as a disciplinary practice and an instructional objective in science and RE lessons. We call for further consideration of argumentation in different school subjects and how argumentation can enrich science teaching in interdisciplinary contexts.

AB  - A subject worth examining was the interdisciplinary approach's planning and application of two distinct disciplines and investigating the value acquisition inclinations of students who participated in the multidisciplinary approach. In this context, the problem sentence of the research is that: Does integrate mathematics and life sciences teaching have an effect on primary school 3rd-grade students' acquisition of honesty, respect, love, and helpfulness values?". The impact of integrated Mathematics and Life Sciences teachings in third grade on students' honesty, respect, love, and helpfulness value dispositions was studied using a quasi-experimental method with a pretest-posttest control group and the theme of "tolerance." As the data collection tools of the research, the "Honesty Value achievement Scale," "Love achievement Scale," "Respect achievement Scale," and "Helpfulness achievement Scale" was applied to the students in the sample. This research was conducted in three stages: preliminary preparations before application, integration of disciplines, lesson plan preparation, and actual application. There was a significant difference in favor of the experimental group when comparing students taught integrated mathematics and life sciences versus retrained students using a Ministry of National Education-approved course and workbook. In addition, there was a significant difference in favor of the post-test between the pretest-posttest scores of the honesty, respect, love, and helpfulness values belonging to the students in the experimental group taught integrated mathematics and life sciences.

AB  - The majority of this essay describes the content, pedagogy, and assessments associated with an undergraduate, interdisciplinary honors seminar on science and religion. The seminar is structured around five major themes: (a) philosophy of science, religion, and their interactions, (b) historical and contemporary case studies, (c) the controversy over biological evolution in the United States as a necessary case study, (d) comparative religion and science, and (e) contemporary issues at the intersection of science and religion. I also describe the consistency between the seminar and the mission of the honors college at my institution. Given the prominence of both science and religion in contemporary culture, I assert that such a course is engaging for students and faculty alike and provides opportunities for multidisciplinary involvement.

AB  - The article deals with the development of collaborative problem-solving (CPS) abilities of pre-service science teachers using the following stepwise problem-solving (SPS) strategies: (1) identification (this stage presupposes identification of fundamental problems), (2) solution (this stage in essence involves implementation) and (3) checking (this stage mainly comprises monitoring, setting and controlling). The research on the development of pre-service teachers' collaborative problem-solving abilities was based on cross-curricular content (Biology, Chemistry or Physics). SPS strategies were implemented in different steps of the cross-curricular problem-solving activity. The first strategy (identification) encompassed the following steps: discussions and careful investigation of knowledge, deepening of one's knowledge, definition of the problem, formulation of the hypothesis of problem solution, "brain storming", concretization of the problem and creation of a group plan. The second strategy (solution) involved three steps: management of information, explanation of problem solution and practical application of experience. The self-evaluation of the pre-service teachers was performed at the end of each stage. The quantitative study revealed that CPS abilities of the pre-service science teachers corresponding to the second problem-solving strategy (implementation) were higher than the problem-solving abilities of the first problem-solving strategy (identification). The results of the qualitative research highlighted the role of collaboration at the cross-curricular problem-solving activity.

AB  - The article moves away from the traditional architectural basic design education methods and approaches it within the framework of the discipline of educational sciences and learning models. The multi-layered education structure transforms into a new learning field under the guidance of Bloom's Revised Taxonomy, which proposes a course schedule for the architectural basic design studio. Taxonomy allowed us to discover the reflections and effectiveness of the interdisciplinary structure of architecture and design in the educational process and to be instrumentalized and used in the context of basic design education. The course schedule proposal presents a flexible schedule outline with the example of an interdisciplinary studio schedule. The trial created within the scope of this study can be appropriately organized for different Ecoles, schools, and values. The paper is significant for its interdisciplinary nature and develops a new discourse using Bloom's Revised Taxonomy. Using Bloom's Revised Taxonomy as a method in the studio has led to a paradigm shift in methodology.

AB  - This article examines a physics course for pre-service primary teachers in which physics, crafts and drama were taught together by connecting the standpoints of crafts and drama. The study was carried out by three university educators from these disciplines during an advanced optional course for student-teachers at the University of Helsinki in Finland. This article discusses the impact of the multidisciplinary teaching approach on the participants' learning outcomes. First, the article explains the multidisciplinary teaching model, an educational energy game that the student-teachers designed as part of the course. Second, it describes the learning that emerged from the student-teachers' learning process, including (1) learning skills, (2) new pedagogic thinking and (3) a change of attitude towards integrative teaching. Finally, the analysis shows the strength of sociocultural animation, which is traced through a path of becoming animated.

AB  - This paper presents findings from a small-scale research study eliciting students' perceptions of benefits and challenges of working in interdisciplinary groups to solve an engineering challenge using problem-based learning. Penultimate and final year undergraduates and postgraduate MSc students in the School of Engineering and Physical Sciences at a Scottish university, studying Robotics, Mechanical, Chemical, Electrical and Software Engineering worked in interdisciplinary groups of five on a project to provide solutions to the United States National Academy of Engineering Grand Challenges (NAEGC). Students were surveyed twice, using closed and open questions before and towards the end of the project. Data were analysed using a thematic approach. Findings showed that most students saw benefits to problem-based working with students from other disciplines, citing increased awareness of approaches, future 'real world' professional preparation and efficiency in problem solving. However, challenges around scheduling meetings and concerns around cross-discipline collaboration indicate that universities should provide training for students before undertaking such problem-based projects, to ensure maximum educational benefits. In addition, greater emphasis needs to be put on students' awareness of the added benefits of development of the 'soft skills' needed for future professional practice.

AB  - This research presents an exploratory and descriptive study on the use of knowledge organization processes and systems in the context of repositories, published in journals indexed in databases between 2015 and 2020. The authors of these papers do not necessarily publish in specific events and journals in the Knowledge Organization area, but rather in the Library and Information Science arena. The study has been carried out in four steps: 1. Search, retrieval and selection of articles; 2. Development of a data codebook; 3. Identification and codification of topics; and, 4. Analysis of the data extracted. A final sample of 33 articles was defined. The methodology applied to determine the theme of journal articles is presented in detail, including the use of the Classification System for Knowledge Organization Literature (CSKOL). The illustrative data of disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity present in the articles object of this study are shown and discussed, regarding the predominance of certain ranges of CSKOL and regarding the diversity of the representative themes of the contents. It is possible to conclude that the use of CSKOL proves to be a suitable lens for analysing and understanding the literature on the field of knowledge organization in institutional repositories. It is shown that, in these 33 articles the themes of knowledge organization are combined with interdisciplinary themes from other areas of knowledge. In our opinion, this enriches and improves theoretical support for research development.

AB  - Students often struggle to make interdisciplinary connections and cite a lack of opportunity to make such connections. To address this issue, we are developing activities aligned with the framework of three-dimensional learning that provide students with opportunities to make connections between chemistry concepts and biological phenomena. Here, we focus on an activity that asks students to incorporate the concept of entropy in explaining the biological phenomenon of osmosis across a cell membrane. This activity was administered in both introductory cell and molecular biology and second-semester general chemistry courses. We found that after completing carefully scaffolded questions within the activity, students were better able to correctly use the concept of entropy in explaining osmosis than they were before the scaffolding questions. Additionally, we found that students' course history appeared to impact their explanations of this phenomenon in that students who had taken second-semester general chemistry (i.e., the semester in which entropy is discussed for these students) provided more sophisticated responses and were less likely to include scientifically inaccurate ideas than their peers who had not taken second-semester general chemistry.

AB  - Modern research often requires collaboration of experts in fields, such as math, chemistry, biology, physics, and computer science to develop unique solutions to common problems. Traditional introductory undergraduate laboratory curricula in the sciences often do not emphasize connections possible between the various disciplines. We designed an interdisciplinary, medically relevant, project intended to help students see connections between chemistry and biology. Second term organic chemistry laboratory students designed and synthesized potential polymer inhibitors or inducers of polyglutamine protein aggregation. The use of novel target compounds added the uncertainty of scientific research to the project. Biology laboratory students then tested the novel potential pharmaceuticals in Huntington's disease model assays, using "in vitro" polyglutamine peptide aggregation and "in vivo" lethality studies in "Drosophila". Students read articles from the primary literature describing the system from both chemical and biological perspectives. Assessment revealed that students emerged from both courses with a deeper understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of biology and chemistry and a heightened interest in basic research. The design of this collaborative project for introductory biology and organic chemistry labs demonstrated how the local interests and expertise at a university can be drawn from to create an effective way to integrate these introductory courses. Rather than simply presenting a series of experiments to be replicated, we hope that our efforts will inspire other scientists to think about how some aspect of authentic work can be brought into their own courses, and we also welcome additional collaborations to extend the scope of the scientific exploration.

AB  - The much-needed interest in promoting a healthy lifestyle among school-age students has found a context for development: school gardens. There are numerous studies where using gardens as a teaching-learning context also improves students' performance in the experimental sciences. In this study, we proposed another interest that sets it apart and adds motivation: combining curricular mathematics with experimental science content in this context. The search for possible studies in the scientific literature has gave rise to the review presented herein. From this review, we obtained 21 studies, from which we extracted a series of categories: whether research was undertaken and with which tools; which curricular contents were covered and the impact produced; the ages of the participants and duration of the project; and, finally, whether the garden was cultivated. The main conclusion of this search was the lack of a clear line of research linking school gardens, the experimental sciences, and mathematics, in addition to the scant presence of studies framed in this context. For that reason, we send a call to action to the scientific community encouraging the interdisciplinarity of the two aforementioned subjects within the context of school gardens.

AB  - The ability to analyse aspects of visual culture--works of art, maps or plans, graphs, tables and X-rays--quickly and efficiently is critical in decision-making in a broad range of disciplines. Eye tracking is a technology that can record how long someone dwells on a particular detail in an image, where the eye moves from one part of the image to the other, and the sequence the viewer uses to interpret visual information. These MP4 recordings can be played back and graphically enhanced with coloured dots and lines to point out this natural and fluent eye behaviour to learners. These recordings can form effective pedagogical tools for learning how to look at images through the eyes of experts by mimicking the patterns and rhythms of expert eye behaviour. This paper provides a meta-analysis of studies of this kind and also provides the results of a cross-disciplinary project which involved five different subject areas. The consensus arising from our meta-analysis reveals an emerging field with broad concerns in need of more integrated research. None of the studies cited in this article are interdisciplinary across the sciences and arts and, while some of them address higher education in medicine and computing, there are no interdisciplinary studies of how eye tracking is important for teaching in arts and science subjects at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. In addition, none of the studies address how learning practitioners find these eye recordings useful for their own understanding of learning processes. This establishes the unique contribution of this project.

AB  - This study develops a framework to conceptualize the use and evolution of machine learning (ML) in science assessment. We systematically reviewed 47 studies that applied ML in science assessment and classified them into five categories: (a) constructed response, (b) essay, (c) simulation, (d) educational game, and (e) inter-discipline. We compared the ML-based and conventional science assessments and extracted 12 critical characteristics to map three variables in a three-dimensional framework: "construct," "functionality," and "automaticity." The 12 characteristics used to construct a profile for ML-based science assessments for each article were further analyzed by a two-step cluster analysis. The clusters identified for each variable were summarized into four levels to illustrate the evolution of each. We further conducted cluster analysis to identify four classes of assessment across the three variables. Based on the analysis, we conclude that ML has transformed--but not "yet" redefined--conventional science assessment practice in terms of fundamental purpose, the nature of the science assessment, and the relevant assessment challenges. Along with the three-dimensional framework, we propose five anticipated trends for incorporating ML in science assessment practice for future studies: addressing developmental cognition, changing the process of educational decision making, personalized science learning, borrowing 'good' to advance 'good', and integrating knowledge from other disciplines into science assessment.

AB  - Science educators are placing increasing emphasis on the development of students' interdisciplinary competence. This study examined the degree to which disciplinary, cognitive and affective factors could explain students' (N = 385) individual differences in interdisciplinary competence. Multiple linear regression indicated that students' disciplinary knowledge (DK), attitudes toward interdisciplinary approach and interdisciplinary learning opportunities were significant when added to the prediction model. Notably, the results of a semistructured interview and think-aloud session suggested that students' engineering design knowledge was not robust in their responses. Students' feelings toward interdisciplinary learning affected how they mobilized DK to create comprehensive insight into all aspects relevant to the possible solution. Additionally, students' feelings about the interdisciplinary approach influenced their exposure to interdisciplinary issues outside school and engagement in interdisciplinary learning tasks at school, which affected their integration of scientific ideas across disciplines. The results of this study can inform both the movement toward incorporating an interdisciplinary approach into pedagogy and educators and instructors about the factors and possible mechanisms that may shape students' interdisciplinary competence.

AB  - One promising way to cope with changing requirements from the labor market in the domain of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), but also to keep the field up to date, to start innovations and to advance the STEM domain as such is the use of student labs. In these labs, students work together in small groups imitating professional practice of design and technology workers. More insights are needed in what competences student labs in the STEM domain address and what the implications would be for the design of student labs. A review of empirical studies on student labs and additional literature indicate that five generic competences are addressed in most student labs: Collaboration, communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and creativity. In order to effectively enhanced these competences, student labs should be designed as authentic productive learning environments based on three design principles: (1) Realistic, complex task situations, (2) Multidisciplinarity, and (3) Social interaction. IoT Rapid Proto Labs are examples of such a student labs, in which cross-border multidisciplinary teams of students, teachers (coaches), and practitioners jointly develop solutions to challenging IoT applications (Internet-connected objects), add value for enterprises, and strengthen the employability, creativity and career prospects of students.

AB  - The national conversation around undergraduate science instruction is calling for increased interdisciplinarity. As these calls increase, there is a need to consider the learning objectives of interdisciplinary science courses and how to design curricula to support those objectives. We present a framework that can help support interdisciplinary design research. We developed this framework in an introductory physics for life sciences majors (IPLS) course for which we designed a series of interdisciplinary tasks that bridge physics and biology. We illustrate how this framework can be used to describe the variation in the nature and degree of interdisciplinary interaction in tasks, to aid in redesigning tasks to better align with interdisciplinary learning objectives, and finally, to articulate design conjectures that posit how different characteristics of these tasks might support or impede interdisciplinary learning objectives. This framework will be useful for both curriculum designers and education researchers seeking to understand, in more concrete terms, what interdisciplinary learning means and how integrated science curricula can be designed to support interdisciplinary learning objectives.

AB  - A shift from teaching to learn to learning to think is necessary to promote critical thinkers. Since teachers tend to replicate the educational models they have experienced as students, new references are needed. In order to address these concerns, we present an interdisciplinary intervention in initial teacher education and analyse its impact on teachers' critical thinking and awareness of the importance to promote it. The intervention is based on the potential of socio-scientific issues to support argumentation and provide meaningful contexts for graph interpretation. The content analysis of participants' responses before and after inquiring about climate change shows an increase in the level of argumentation and the capacity to read beyond data, providing evidence of the development of critical thinking. In addition, pre-service teachers explicitly refer to their future responsibility in preparing students to face current challenges, demonstrating awareness of the need to promote critical thinking.

AB  - Educational phenomena and child development fascinate many disciplines for which they offer a tremendous field of experimentation and application. More than a hundred years ago, when educational sciences adopted the main institutional emblems of an academic discipline (chairs, diploma, laboratories, scientific network etc.), they obviously vacillated between the dream of becoming a unified science (as pedology testifies), and the claim of a rewarding pluridisciplinarity that could synergise all disciplines concerned with the child and with education. This paper asserts that the issue of pluridisciplinarity is constitutive for the development of sciences of education whose object is ever coveted by other disciplines. The first section adopts the point of view of a social history and, on the basis of voluminous archives, it describes the main lines of the shaping of this pluridisciplinary field in Geneva, representative of that which also occurs elsewhere. In the second part, it presents a more theoretical reflection on the tensions and pitfalls of what we call the "process of disciplinarisation" of educational sciences, outlining the characteristics of this constitutively pluridisciplinary field.

AB  - Learning to create, use, and evaluate models is a central element of becoming a scientist. In physics, we often begin an analysis of a complicated system with highly simplified or toy models. In introductory physics classes, we tend to use them without comment or motivation. Some students infer that physics is irrelevant to their understanding of the real world and are discouraged from making the cognitive blend of physics concepts with math symbology essential for making sense of physics. In this paper, I discuss the often-hidden barriers that make it difficult for our students to accept and understand the value of toy models and suggest instructional approaches that can help.

AB  - Despite longstanding calls to integrate school science and mathematics, concerns remain about how to achieve high-quality learning in both subjects. In reporting on a teaching approach that aimed to achieve this outcome, the authors focus particularly on the teacher's role. The Interdisciplinary Mathematics and Science project (IMS), an Australian Research Council study, aimed to integrate learning in both subjects through investigative inquiry processes. Teachers guide students to construct, evaluate, and refine multimodal representations in a four-stage teaching model. This article describes the key design principles of this interdisciplinary approach and the focus of the inquiry process. The authors outline the teaching model's stages as a basis for illustrating how teachers have enacted these stages across different topics.

AB  - In the contemporary workplace, data scientists who are capable of interdisciplinary collaboration are in high demand. Universities need to provide data science students with a plethora of learning opportunities that involve collaboration in interdisciplinary contexts and engagement with industry partners. Curtin University and Lab Tests Online Australasia (LTO[superscript AU]) collaborated to provide an interdisciplinary, industry-focused learning experience for data science students. Upon completing the project, students reported improved understanding of the range of applications for data science skills. The experience delivered opportunities for greater self-awareness and highlighted the importance of teamwork, decision-making and leadership skills. This chapter presents Interdisciplinary Project-based Work-Integrated Learning (IPjWIL), an educational approach that equips data science students with the necessary skills to navigate the future world of work. The results of the pilot project described demonstrate how interdisciplinary, industry-focused learning experiences enhance the capabilities of data science students, thereby augmenting employability.

AB  - By means of their pivotal role in the outbreak of a variety of diseases, such as, recently, COVID-19, the molecular aspects of cell membrane function have gained considerable attention from researchers in recent decades. The resulting information explosion and the growing interdisciplinary character of cell biology seems, however, to not be represented in science classrooms. Hence, there appears to be a gap between what is scientifically known and what is actually taught in classrooms. Framed by the model of educational reconstruction (MER), the aim of our study is therefore to identify scientific core ideas of cell membrane biology from an educational point of view. This is achieved by conducting qualitative content analysis of relevant cell biology literature. By using Conceptual Metaphor as a theory of understanding, we additionally illuminate the experiential grounding of scientific conceptions. Our results propose that cell membrane biology can be structured into three core ideas, comprising "compartmentalisation," "physical and chemical properties," and "multicellular coordination" interrelated by evolution as a key aspect. Our results show that scientists conceive these ideas metaphorically. Embodied part-whole relations seem, for example, to lay the grounds for their understanding of biological function. The outcomes of the study may inform future cell membrane teaching.

AB  - The Polaris Project, a National Science Foundation-funded program at the Woodwell Climate Research Center, aims to comprehensively address minority participation in climate and Arctic science research. The project implemented design principles to recruit, motivate, and retain African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans or Alaskan Natives, and women through immersive, field research experiences. The project included undergraduate and graduate students from environmental science, ecology, hydrology, biology, forestry, and geology. Ninety-five percent of participants identified as African American, Hispanic, Native American or Alaskan Native, and/or female. Critical participant outcomes included development of interdisciplinary research projects, involvement in self-efficacy and advocacy experiences, and increased awareness and discussion of Arctic research careers. All outcomes contributed to the Polaris Project's role as a model climate science research program.

AB  - This study investigated sixth-grade students' development of multidisciplinary models involving the integration of mathematics, science, and statistics, together with shared STEM practices. Mathematics and science featured a reciprocal relationship within the real-world context of tsunami inundation. Experimenting with water tubs comprising "landmasses" and "shore slopes" of varying angles, students explored how varying the slope of the shoreline affects the inundation distance. Given that organising and structuring data are essential to the creation of models as systems of representation, students' modelling revealed a basic understanding of key statistical concepts and processes, including variation and covariation, and an ability to identify trends both within and across data sets. Students were able to apply their learning in recommending ways of minimising the impact of a real-world tsunami, demonstrating how such an investigation can facilitate understanding of natural phenomena. The overall findings indicate how elementary-grade students can successfully engage in independent multidisciplinary modelling within integrated STEM investigations and develop important conceptual understandings in the process.

AB  - Effective collaboration among general education, special education, and support professionals is critical for the support of student learning and growth. However, preservice teachers rarely get the opportunity to learn about this process or to engage in meaningful interactions with professionals from other disciplines during their preparation programs. In this article, the authors discuss adapting the interprofessional education model from the health sciences to the teacher preparation context. The interprofessional education model brings students from multiple disciplines together in multidisciplinary teams to explore, analyze, and evaluate learner academic, behavioral, and support services assessments and to make recommendations for future learner support. The authors discuss their experiences implementing a short-term online interprofessional education experience for undergraduate and graduate students across five disciplines. The authors also discuss the implications of and make recommendations for establishing and sustaining interprofessional education in teacher preparation programs.

AB  - Limited empirical research has investigated the impact of interdisciplinary STEM approaches on students' learning with a particular dearth in the area of assessment. A lack of alignment between interdisciplinary approaches in STEM teaching and its assessment strategies is notable. In this study, we adopt an inquiry approach to the ways in which interdisciplinary learning of science and mathematics impacted on student learning through the use of a STEM challenge that involved a real-world task. Two secondary school teachers, one who teaches science and the other mathematics, participated in the study and jointly planned and taught a sequence of science and mathematics lessons using an interdisciplinary approach to their Year 8 class of 24 students over several weeks. Data of students' project reports, video of their project presentation, and teacher interviews were analysed to identify the intersection of disciplinary specific and generic skills in assessment practice of an interdisciplinary task. Our findings highlight the importance of having an assessment rubric with criteria that addressed both disciplinary specific skills as well as generic STEM skills.

AB  - Climate change is a contemporary global crisis that necessitates pedagogical innovation for the middle school dance classroom. This article describes an integrated design for a dance and science unit. Building on students' kinesthetic abilities, teachers are able to create a unit comprising a series of lessons on bird migrations effected by climate change, culminating in a final performance. Students engage in research on climate change and its effects on global bird migrations and view past performances reflecting avian formations from Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov's "Swan Lake" (1895) to non-Western influences on dance. Yoga poses such as Swan, Eagle, and Pigeon evolve into dance phrases. The teacher facilitates students' selection of a musical soundtrack for the choreography of an ensemble performance with props and upcycled costumes. An assessment of the dance and science unit is performed through a continuous feedback loop during practice and through a final group interview after the performance.

AB  - Liberal arts programs encompass a range of academic disciplines, and their effectiveness relies not only on what these disciplines are, but also on how they are integrated. The natural sciences are one important component of liberal arts programs that may be difficult to assimilate with the rest of the curriculum. In this paper, the topic of neglected tropical diseases is provided to illustrate an innovative approach to bridging transdisciplinary connections across and through disparate academic disciplines. This approach is supported by evidence from prior studies demonstrating the effectiveness of transdisciplinary teaching at promoting creativity, knowledge retention, and student motivation.

AB  - This article aims to explore the experiences of science instructors who are active participants in the design and enactment of an interdisciplinary science course with student-centered pedagogy in a large-enrollment class. The data were collected through interviews with instructors and analyzed using the inductive thematic approach. Results show that the instructors discussed the benefits and challenges of using the previous passive-lecture format of the science course. Instructors believed that even though the previous format is easy to implement, it does not help students understand how scientists approach complex problems. In the new approach, the instructors prepared learning objectives to address expected learning outcomes. They integrated diverse research-based instructional strategies to enhance students' learning and interest in science but encountered some challenges. The instructors' experiences illustrate that planning and enacting an interactive science learning with an interdisciplinary approach is possible in undergraduate science education with appropriate support. The findings of this study can be a model for other universities to initiate changes in science instruction.

AB  - Motivational hands-on workshops for grade-school level future scientists are needed to inspire young and receptive minds. Described here is an educational event, titled "Inspiring Future Rocket Chemists", with hands-on laboratory exercises demonstrating the fundamentals of rocket flight and live chemistry demonstrations illustrating the fundamentals of rocket propulsion. This event was developed for seventh and eighth grade students by the local Mojave Desert Section of the American Chemical Society and the China Lake Museum Foundation (CLMF).The CLMF is dedicated to educating the public and preserving the history of the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division's contributions to our nation's warfighters. The workshop was developed and led by experts currently working in or retired from the rocket science field. Four hands-on exercises and four demonstrations were performed with the students. The laboratory exercises and demonstrations covered topics including model rocket components and assembly, rocket stability, propulsion, safety, chemical reactions, gas generation, and catalysis in propellants. Two distinguishing characteristics of this event was the inclusion of fundamental principles of rocket science and emphasis on the interdisciplinary nature of the field. The event's pedagogical goals were to motivate and inspire the participants in exploring the field of rocketry while teaching them the fundamental properties and important safety precautions for practicing rocketry. This event serves as the framework for future collaborative efforts between institutions for specialized workshops in topic areas not traditionally covered in student's coursework. The effectiveness of the event was measured through student assessments and feedback at the conclusion of the event.

AB  - The authors decided to create a transdisciplinary science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) lesson for children focused on Charleston, South Carolina iron-gate artisan Philip Simmons and his work. The lesson taught about the art of Philip Simmons, as well as symbolism, mathematics, the process of 3D printing, and some history of Charleston. The results were some original 3D printed, Simmons-inspired gates that made connections to several disciplines in the curriculum. This article begins with an introduction to the artist and his work, followed by a discussion of culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) and the importance of inclusion in the classroom. Then the history and nuances of transdisciplinary and STEAM education is examined. The details of the lesson are highlighted, along with a discussion of the outcomes of a transdisciplinary lesson that celebrates the African American artist Philip Simmons.

AB  - In the last decades, agroecological and permacultural initiatives and organizations have grown. These initiatives attend to notions of food sovereignty and alternative models of agricultural production. The confluence of different actors and social initiatives through which experiences and knowledge of cultivating food are shared, and new ones are created, reveals a high educational potential. In light of impending global catastrophes such as climate change and pressing inequalities, new alternatives and diverse forms of sociability are necessary to open up possible futures for life on a damaged planet. Freirean approaches to science education must align with transdisciplinary social and political movements, and generate reflective practices and methods. This article addresses the case of an art and permaculture cooperative (APC) to analyze how communities work together to disrupt and dismantle inequities in science and education and make a more livable world. We offer a critical and contra-hegemonic pedagogical perspective on science education, one that forges new epistemic territories grounded in cooperation, art, permaculture, relationship, and diverse ecologies. The APC is the only one of its kind in Argentina. It has carried out its socio-ecological activities and interventions in ways that respect the characteristics of the natural ecosystem, agriculture and permaculture. We use narratives and case study methods to reveal how people's subjective narratives give meaning to their experiences and learnings. The APC as a learning context has the potential to transform reality, promoting the development and strengthening of popular science education for liberation, one that honors diverse ecologies, and meaningfully addresses new socio-environmental challenges and concerns.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to reflect on the implications for higher education of a rapidly changing global context, where technologies play a role in the propagation of unsustainable patterns of change. Drawing from research on science and technology studies as well as existing work on (higher) education for sustainability, it seeks to expose the multidimensional nature of these patterns to raise a series of questions for educators, particularly those in engineering, computer science and other technical disciplines, and inform structured curricular and organisational interventions. Design/methodology/approach: Theoretical perspectives on unsustainable patterns of technological change are explored with the objective of informing how the mitigation of their evolution could be addressed in educational settings. Key themes in the sustainability and higher education literature are then identified with the purpose of informing curricular and organisational intervention. Findings: Countering unsustainable patterns of technological change requires the development of key sustainability competencies within more technical disciplines, informed by concepts in science and technology studies. This requires change at curricular, organisational and institutional levels to enable spaces for inter- and transdisciplinary learning to be created, so that skills may be developed. Originality/value: This paper reflects on unsustainable patterns of technological change, identifying challenges for educators, in particular those in more technical disciplines.

AB  - Electrostatic potential energy is a topic of great difficulty for many students. In this paper, we empirically test the utility of two approaches for laying a foundation for developing an understanding of energy in an electrostatic context, with interdisciplinary relevance. We examine student responses to a question about how the potential energy of a system of two attracting ions varies with distance (the "ions" task), and investigate how these responses change after students have been exposed to either a question designed to help them think about gravitational potential energy or the potential energy of a system of two attracting magnets. We found that performance on the ions task improved for those students who were prompted to think about the gravitational context, while it did not change for those who considered the magnets. The results are interpreted using dual-process theories of reasoning and decision making, and implications for instruction are discussed.

AB  - This article presents the analysis and discussion of solving geometry tasks by Portuguese Basic Education students, using material from the Poly-UNiverse in Teacher Training Education (PUNTE) project. The teaching experience developed was aimed at testing and disseminating new resources, and innovative and transdisciplinary methodologies in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics (STEAM). The adopted methodology involved two phases. The first phase was exploratory, followed by a second phase where the exploration of geometry concepts in the plane (namely, the perimeter and the similarity of triangles) was carried out using the Poly-Universe material. The results of the study show that the Poly-Universe materials constituted an important teaching resource in solving the proposed tasks. Its manipulation allowed the visualisation of the situations involved in the tasks, as well as contributed to an implication in the activities developed by the students.

AB  - Although one of key ideas behind the introduction of STEM (or STEAM) as a unifying concept, is to emphasize the interdisciplinary character of many real world problems, there is a non-trivial educational challenge in exceeding existing subject boundaries and implementing multidisciplinary activities into the classroom. The present case study covers the design, implementation and evaluation of a multidisciplinary unit in a Finnish lower secondary school, grade 9. The entire multidisciplinary unit was organized around the central concept of energy, and the present study focuses on an activity within that unit that explored how energy can be used to analyze both living and non-living systems. Evaluation of the activity was done with pre and post student questionnaires, analyzing the students' written poster presentations and focus group interviews done with a voluntary group of students after the whole unit. The aim of the study was to explore how students understand the multidisciplinary character of the energy concept. Our results show both challenges and possible gains of working in a multidisciplinary way. However, to succeed serious thought has to be invested in both identifying core concepts that gain by being analyzed in an interdisciplinary way, and in the design of appropriate learning activities around these core concepts. Our study is as an effort in this direction.

AB  - What are the current challenges and opportunities for bringing actor-network theory (ANT) into issues-based science education? This article discusses experiences gained from introducing an educational version of ANT deploying digital technology into an upper secondary school science class. This teaching innovation, called "controversy mapping", has been pioneered in different contexts of higher education before being adapted to school education. Experimenting with controversy mapping in a Swedish science class raised both conceptual and practical issues. These centre on: (1) how ANT-inspired controversy mapping redesigns the citizenship training enacted by institutionalized approaches to issues-based education as socioscientific issues (SSI); (2) how controversy mapping reconfigures the interdisciplinarity of issues-based science education; and (3) how controversy mapping displaces scientific literacy and knowledge of the nature of science as guiding concerns for teaching in favour of new preoccupations with digital literacy and digital tools and methods as contemporary infrastructures of free and open inquiry.

AB  - In this article, we present details of a one-week interdisciplinary science camp for high school students in Denmark, "Criminal Camp". We describe the use of forensic science and simulated crimes as a common foundation for teaching the theory and practice of concepts in chemistry, physics, and medicine or biology. The main goal of the science camp program was to introduce the participants to the nature of science and what scientists do as the students experience easily understandable real-world scenarios. Results from a survey indicate that Criminal Camp had a positive effect on the participants' attitudes toward science in general and the applications within forensic science in particular. From the free-response answers given in the survey, it was furthermore inferred that the participants enjoyed working with science in an interdisciplinary context, and that they gained both concrete knowledge of the subjects taught and scientific literacy in general.

AB  - Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education has gained popularity as an interdisciplinary approach that combines these subjects into a single curriculum. STEM concepts align with the competencies the contemporary workforce requires, making it a desirable education model to foster twenty-first-century skills. The dynamism of the metacognitive awareness of science teachers in STEM has not been the subject of serious research. This study explores the metacognitive awareness level of science teachers in STEM, and the results are average. A gap exists between the living culture and the learning culture of students in this digital era. STEM is a new way of learning and comprehending in terms of a sustainable future.

AB  - This paper describes the integration of geographic information system (GIS) technology in a high school environmental science classroom, specifically examining the impact of GIS technology on student engagement, critical thinking, and interdisciplinary learning for Education for Sustainability (EfS). This environmental science classroom utilized ArcGIS Online and StoryMaps to facilitate hands-on learning, enabling students to explore spatial relationships, analyze data, and communicate insights to foster engagement and critical thinking. This GIS technology promotes interdisciplinary learning by connecting essential environmental issues with location and other social factors. Students deepen their understanding of human-environment interactions by interpreting spatial data, empowering them to propose sustainable solutions to environmental challenges. Using ArcGIS Online and StoryMaps, students engaged in guided lessons, explored sustainability topics, and created their own StoryMaps based on the United Nations' (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The findings highlight positive engagement, critical thinking, and interdisciplinary learning impacts. Students demonstrated increased interest, understanding of complex issues, and developed analytical skills through spatial data analysis. The approach encouraged interdisciplinary thinking and expanded awareness of ongoing environmental challenges, supporting EfS goals.

AB  - Over the past decade, integrated STEM education research has emerged as an international concern, creating around it an imperative for technological and disciplinary innovation and a global resurgence of interest in teaching and learning to code at the K-16 levels. At the same time, issues of democratization, equity, power and access, including recent decolonizing efforts in public education, are also beginning to be acknowledged as legitimate issues in STEM education. Taking a reflexive approach to the intersection of these concerns, this book presents a collection of papers making new theoretical advances addressing two broad themes: Transdisciplinary Approaches in STEM Education and Bodies, Hegemony and Decolonization in STEM Education. Within each theme, praxis is of central concern including analyses of teaching and learning that re-imagines disciplinary boundaries and domains, the relationship between Art and STEM, and the design of learning technologies, spaces and environments. In addition to graduate research seminars at the Masters and PhD levels in Learning Sciences, Science Education, Educational Technology and STEM education, this book could also serve as a textbook for graduate and pre-service teacher education courses.

AB  - Archiving is a process of organizing and creating content for sustainable, long-term access. However, the "archivists" actively shape the content in the realm of the performing arts, which often involves adding a new layer of knowledge to the original artform. This article explores the archiving of a ballet repertory course conducted in a higher education institution in Hong Kong during the pandemic, including the archival product and the collaborative process between a multidisciplinary team of people from dance, education, and library science. While teaching repertory online has its challenges, being "online" also offered unique learning experiences. Aiming to illustrate the topics related to hybrid pedagogy and individual creativity in use during the pandemic, the team conducted interviews with some participants for the purpose of creating a series of short educational films. These materials were collected and stored in the institution's digital repository as the first archive for a specific course.

AB  - Background: Creativity is often viewed as a fundamental educational capability. Science can play a role in nurturing creativity. Research suggests that creative pedagogy, including interdisciplinary teaching , can engage students with science. Previous studies into teachers' attitudes to science and creativity have been largely situated within national educational contexts. Purpose: This study explores educators' perspectives on the relationship between Science and Creativity across national contexts drawn from Europe and beyond. Sample and Methods: A convenience sample of 270 educators, recruited by project partners and via online media, and broadly defined to include teachers, trainee teachers, informal educators and teacher educators, responded to an online survey designed to explore perceptions of the relationship between science and creativity. Exploratory factor analysis of Likert question responses was used to develop a combined attitude scale, with results compared across nationalities and phases of education. Open question responses were analysed thematically to allow nuanced interpretation of the descriptive statistical findings. Results: The findings show broad agreement internationally that science is a creative endeavour, with a small number of educators disagreeing about the relationship between science and creativity in the context of school science. Those who disagreed were usually secondary science teachers, from England, Malta or outside Europe (primarily from the United States). The role of scientific knowledge within creativity in science education was found to be contentious. Conclusions: That educators broadly see science as creative is unsurprising, but initial exploration of educators' perspectives internationally reveals some differences, particularly amongst educators working in formal education, relating to the role of knowledge with respect to creativity in science. With current interest in STEAM education, further investigation to understand potential mediating factors of national educational contexts on teachers' perspectives with respect to the role of disciplinary knowledge(s) in creativity and their interaction in interdisciplinary teaching and learning, is recommended.

AB  - The increasingly diverse and complex student population school psychologists serve necessitates a reconceptualization of the field with explicit emphasis on interprofessional, interagency collaborations (IIC) to promote equitable and high-quality services for all students. School psychologists are positioned to play a central role in IIC with specific training and experience in consultation, psychology, education, and multidisciplinary knowledge to ensure effectiveness. We highlight the historical context of IIC in the field and advocate for school psychologists to engage in IIC to better meet the needs of all students and families through coordinated and streamlined services. We conceptualize this paradigm shift through three multidisciplinary frameworks: (a) interprofessional team-based care, (b) population health, and (c) implementation science. We posit that school psychologists are ideal school professionals to engage in IIC, which has been adopted by other fields; educational and mental health inequities may be improved through effective IIC; and that implementation science concepts, which are familiar to the field of school psychology, can be applied to successfully implement IIC in schools. We conclude by providing recommendations that span graduate training, practice, and research in an effort to stimulate meaningful change in graduate training and preparation, practice, and research in the area of IIC.

AB  - In this paper we present activities that can help students deepen their understanding of DC circuits and develop practical competences. The students investigate electric properties of commercially available conductive thread and solve a practical design task using the thread. The activities follow the framework of investigative science learning environment (ISLE)--an approach to learning and teaching that helps students learn fundamental physics concepts by engaging them in processes that mirror those used by physicists when they develop new knowledge and use it for practical applications. In this paper this framework is extended to engineering.

AB  - The climate crisis is a growing concern for many people, especially those who are of college age, making it an important and pressing issue to explore in honors courses. Eco-Art: Using Art to Reconcile with the Climate Crisis, a University of New Mexico (UNM) Honors College course, integrates the disciplines of art and environmental justice to examine climate change and address the social and emotional toll of climate grief. The class was co-created and team taught by Associate Professor Megan Jacobs and UNM undergraduate honors and environmental science student Kineo Memmer. This article unpacks the methodologies and lessons learned from this intergenerational team-teaching experience. The class forged community partnerships and created short documentary films highlighting climate activism in New Mexico as well as creative works on climate grief. Using an egalitarian instruction model, the instructors found common ground between their respective disciplines to develop projects and cull readings, which they outline in detail. This type of collaboration is key in the climate movement, as intersectional ways of problem-solving are necessary to combat the climate crisis.

AB  - Transdisciplinary-based learning (TDBL) is a need of teachers in teaching where its existence offers for solutions to solve teaching and learning problems in class. In this case, the presence of TDBL in Aqidah Akhlak subject means integrating Islamic teaching into science as knowledge in a holistic way. Thus, this study aims to propose a new way of teaching by developing the learning materials for the Aqidah Akhlak subject which is integrated into TDBL. Plomp's model of research and development design is used in this research which typically includes five stages including problem analysis, design, realization, implementation, and evaluation. The result from expert validation both for student and teacher books is considered in the eligible category, highly eligible for field trial assessment, and practical category for the practical assessment. Students' performance on Aqidah Akhlak subject is dominated by moderate level rather than high one. T-test proved that the use of TDBL Aqidah Akhlak learning materials effective to be utilized in class. Through the result of the study, it can be concluded that the proposed product of TDBL Aqidah Akhlak learning materials can be used both for students and teachers. Discussion and research implications are discussed further in this study.

AB  - This article presents a review of research studies related to the theme of barriers to inclusive education in primary schools. The basic data set for our study consisted of 27 expert articles selected from the Web of Science and Scopus databases according to clearly defined criteria. The result of the analysis provided findings that appear across all the texts. The research questions of this review study are what the barriers to inclusion in primary schools are, what we know about them, and whether there are ways to reduce them. We focused in more detail on the themes of discrepancies between legislation and practice, teaching barriers in the classroom, transdisciplinarity and interprofessionalism, and methodological specifics. In the analysis and discussion, we delineate the essential points of the individual articles by searching for similarities and differences among the texts.

AB  - As part of a larger study investigating the perceptions of university academics about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); STEM learning environments; and necessary capabilities for STEM educators at a university, this article reports a sample of academics' perceptions of STEM and its teaching and learning, as gleaned from their Draw a STEM Learning Environment (D-STEM) depictions and associated texts. The analysis of participants' perceptions of STEM--conducted both deductively, using research-informed understandings of STEM education, and inductively, through the identification of emerging ideas--indicated that most participants displayed quite limited understandings of STEM education, with few having an awareness of its power for enabling transdisciplinary learning. Both informed representations of STEM and evidence of STEM pedagogical competence were rare. The fact that engaging with the D-STEM instrument was perceived positively by many participants highlights its potential for inclusion in professional learning experiences for academics.

AB  - The Integrated Concentration in Science (iCons) 4-year program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst was designed to promote interdisciplinary STEM collaboration in the solution of real-world problems and encourage student independence and interdependence through a student-centered teaching approach that structures all projects as group endeavors. Researchers evaluated the first- and second-year courses to determine whether instructors implemented the student-driven curriculum as planned and how students perceived the courses with respect to pedagogy and collaboration experiences. Results of a mixed-methods study that included observations, interviews, and surveys showed that instructors implemented a student-centered approach as planned; provided help only when students asked for it or obviously needed scaffolded support; and answered most student queries with questions intended to promote discussion, research, and reframing. Students expressed satisfaction with the courses and felt their experiences aligned with their expectations of receiving more guidance than direct instruction. At the end of each course, students confirmed that they had, in fact, received good guidance, feedback, and critique from their instructors and little in the way of lectures. Students also expressed that their collaboration skills improved, especially in the areas of group communication and sharing their ideas.

AB  - Teachers, pre-service teachers and teacher educators in Australia are predominately European Australian with a small minority of First Nations people. Those with limited first-hand understanding of First Nations ways of knowing can find it difficult to embed these knowledges across learning areas. This is particularly complex for pre-service teachers. We argue that all teacher educators have a responsibility to engage First Nations ways of knowing across learning areas as an ethical and professional commitment to preparing pre-service teachers for negotiating the complexities of Australian histories and living cultures. This paper reports on interventions implemented with final year primary/middle pre-service teachers with an expertise in science and mathematics. Firstly, we discuss pre-service teachers' confidence (self) ratings in integrating their understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures across the curriculum. Secondly, we present an in-depth exploration of two pre-service teachers' transdisciplinary units of work which embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledges and practices. This study challenges all science and mathematics teacher educators to consider ways a transdisciplinary, culturally responsive approach prepares students to transition into confident and competent early career teachers.

AB  - The emerging discourse about the science of social work has urged doctoral social work programs to reexamine assumptions about conducting research and responding to new expectations for scholarship. This article examines three promising models to guide scientific research in social work (evidence-based practice, team science, and multi- and transdisciplinary models). We first conducted a systematic review of social work publications (1985-2016) and found a notable increase in publications that discussed either research-informed or evidence-based practice or multidisciplinary approaches, but not team science or transdisciplinary approaches. Next, we engaged in a comparative analysis of each model's purpose, number of researchers, and breadth of disciplinary focus. Finally, we completed an exploratory assessment of PhD program websites to identify the presence of these models. Information provided on these websites followed a similar pattern as noted in the publications. Implications of these models for doctoral education in the 21st century are discussed.

AB  - STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education is an interdisciplinary approach aimed at enhancing students' understanding of these disciplines and fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This study investigates the experiences and perceptions of 20 third-year pre-service science teachers (PSSTs) participating in STEM practices at a Turkish public university. The research addresses three key questions: (1) What are the opinions of STEM teacher candidates? (2) What benefits and challenges did they encounter during STEM practices? (3) How do they perceive STEM education and its implications for students and teachers? A qualitative case study methodology was employed to gather in-depth insights from PSSTs. The sample was selected using criterion sampling to ensure relevance to the study's focus. Over a four-week period, PSSTs engaged in STEM activities designed to align with the science education curriculum. Data collection involved a "Views on STEM Education Questionnaire" developed by the researcher and reviewed by two experts in STEM education. Content analysis was used to analyze the collected data, ensuring reliability through inter-coder agreement assessment. The results indicated that STEM education encompasses not only the four core disciplines but also interdisciplinary interactions. Participants recognized its positive impact on cognitive and psychomotor skills, creative thinking, problem-solving abilities, and its real-world relevance. However, limitations in time, resources, and pedagogical technological content knowledge were noted as potential challenges. Effective STEM instructors were described as possessing strong communication skills, creativity, innovation, and a passion for research. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of STEM teacher candidates' perspectives, shedding light on the importance of interdisciplinary approaches and the qualities required for successful STEM educators.

AB  - Communication and collaboration are key science competencies that support sharing of scientific knowledge with experts and non-experts alike. On the one hand, they facilitate interdisciplinary conversations between students, educators, and researchers, while on the other they improve public awareness, enable informed choices, and impact policy decisions. Herein, we describe an interdisciplinary undergraduate course focused on using data from various bioinformatics data resources to explore the molecular underpinnings of diabetes mellitus (Types 1 and 2) and introducing students to science communication. Building on course materials and original student-generated artifacts, a series of collaborative activities engaged students, educators, researchers, healthcare professionals and community members in exploring, learning about, and discussing the molecular bases of diabetes. These collaborations generated novel educational materials and approaches to learning and presenting complex ideas about major global health challenges in formats accessible to diverse audiences.

AB  - While the majority of STEM persistence has focused on outcomes for first-year students, there has been little investigation into the outcomes for peer mentors. Of the studies conducted, results are promising. Benefits for peer mentors include a change in their perceptions on teaching and learning; an improvement in their communication, presentation, and leadership skills; and an increase in their understanding of the course content. However, one of the main limitations of these studies is their small sample sizes. Many of the studies purport sample sizes of 5 to 30 peer mentors. The purpose of this article is to overview, from the perspective of the mentors, a university-wide interdisciplinary peer mentoring program for first-year students enrolled in key gateway courses (Calculus I, Physics I, and Chemistry I). Each year over 1,000 undergraduate students participated in the program and were served by approximately 136 peer mentors. The program was monitored by an advisory committee comprising an interdisciplinary team of faculty, university staff, program staff, and an outside consultant. This article examined mentor outcomes and included the data from over 300 mentors.

AB  - Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is a transdisciplinary approach. It aims to bring 21st-century skills to students. It is important whether teachers, who have an important place in the development of students, have knowledge that will affect students' STEM teaching. This study aims to examine the basic knowledge level of the teachers on STEM education. The descriptive method was used in the research. The study was conducted with 319 science, mathematics and information technologies teachers in the public middle schools in Turkey. "The STEM Basic Knowledge Test" was used to collect data. The first seven items of the STEM Basic Knowledge Test consist of demographic information and twenty-eight items. These items measure the basic knowledge level of STEM education. The statistical package program was used to analyze the collected data. In the study, it was determined that the STEM basic knowledge level of the teachers was 66%. Moreover, the basic knowledge level of the teachers in STEM showed a significant difference in terms of gender, teaching experience, technology use, and participation ina program such as a STEM seminar. However, there was no significant difference in terms of discipline and highest qualification of the teachers. Recommendations include encouraging teachers to participate in STEM training programs and giving courses on STEM education at the postgraduate level.

AB  - Laboratory learning in the life sciences is historically centered around following recipe-like instructions to complete activities with defined outcomes. The American Association for the Advancement of Science's "Vision and Change" report has called for a change in science teaching. The report emphasizes the importance of providing research experiences for students and the need to foster discovery, collaboration, and communication of science by students. In recent years, the course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) has been introduced into science pedagogy. CUREs provide authentic, inquiry-based research experiences to undergraduate students from all backgrounds. There is evidence that CUREs produce students who have more concrete science identities, improved interdisciplinary collaboration and communication skills, and better understanding of the process of doing science compared with traditional courses. Students who participate in CUREs may be more likely than students without an authentic research experience to continue in the sciences. CUREs are often offered as single courses, but multi-semester CUREs increase the potential for undergraduate students to publish and present their science and benefit faculty supporters and their institutions. CUREs have revolutionized laboratory learning in the life sciences. In this article, we offer a review of current literature on the benefits and limitations of CUREs.

AB  - The interdisciplinary subject of agricultural biochemistry can provide an abundance of didactic opportunities for educators teaching biochemistry and molecular biology in secondary-level science courses. This is especially true in present times when virtual-learning strategies supersede in-person instruction and contemporary approaches are needed to engage students with relevant applications of science. In this communication, we discuss how pairing daily lessons in agricultural biochemistry with periodic e-notebook usage further refines this strategy by promoting content-retrieval and providing educators with formative feedback on student progress in a simple and inexpensive manner.

AB  - In an effort to promote integrated STEM education, the Malaysian government has integrated STEM teaching framework within the science and mathematics curriculum specifications to guide the science and mathematics teachers to design and implement interdisciplinary teaching while teaching science and/or mathematics concepts. Some of the factors that make STEM teaching effective include knowledge about integrating the different subjects in teaching and teachers' pedagogical strategies, perceived difficulties (PD), and self-efficacy. This study was designed to measure and model the relationships between these three factors and integrated STEM teaching practices in a sample of Malaysian teachers. Data obtained from 573 science and mathematics teachers were analyzed using a partial least square structural equation modeling approach. Findings revealed that the model derived from a combination of the three factors exhibits substantial predictive power and thus has substantial relevance for STEM teaching. Knowledge and perceived efficacy have significant positive effects on and PD have significant negative direct relationships with STEM teaching. Knowledge has a significant negative and positive mediation effect between difficulties and integrated STEM practices, and self-efficacy and integrated STEM practices, respectively. This study has immediate implications for developing teacher professional development curriculum and STEM education policymakers in Malaysia, and it is a model to be tested in other countries or regions intending STEM education reforms.

AB  - This article examines the effect of different educational approaches to environmental education (EE) in the environmental attitudes of 507 preservice teachers. In one experimental group EE was addressed in a science subject and in other experimental group in a literature subject. The latter integrated content and competences in a transdisciplinary way, overcoming the idea that environmental attitudes should only be addressed in science classes. The analysis of their responses to the Environmental Attitudes Inventory (EAI) in a prestest-postest design show that both approaches were able to increase their pro-environmental attitudes, while the control group showed no significant changes. The educational intervention at the literature subject was able to significantly increase those dimensions related to preserving nature and the diversity of natural species in their original natural state, while the educational intervention at the science subject was also able to significantly decrease those dimensions related to the belief that it is right and even necessary to use and alter nature, natural phenomena, and species for human objectives. Female future teachers had more favorable attitudes towards nature than their male counterparts, but no statistically significant differences were observed according to gender for a specific educational approach.

AB  - The compartmentalisation of distinct disciplines limits the opportunities for teachers to work in a collaborative multidisciplinary manner. Workshops such as 'Saviour Siblings' from the Epistemic Insight Initiative encourage students to consider big questions from different perspectives and thus provide a bridge between the religious education (RE) and science curricula at key stage 4 (ages 14-16). This article reports on a collaborative teaching intervention between science and RE lecturers on a secondary PGCE initial teacher education programme. Discussing big questions with their peers proved to develop trainee teachers' beliefs about the power and limitations of science and the value of considering a diverse range of disciplinary perspectives.

AB  - This paper proposes a philosophy of STEAM education in the current moment, the Anthropocene. Whereas many proponents of STEAM focus on outcomes related to cultivating a more creative and competitive generation of STEM workers, it is, more importantly, an approach to education that can foster spaces for transdisciplinary conversations surrounding critical issues of the Anthropocene -- those of ethics, sustainability, and relationality. Thus, the question arises, "How might we understand/practice STEAM education differently?" This philosophy of STEAM in the Anthropocene is inspired by the guiding notions of Braidotti's affirmative ethics as well as Stengers and Ulmer's conceptions of slow(ing). These perspectives challenge the ideologies and practices that have created and sustained divisions between the arts and sciences, while also promoting different ways of engaging in/with the world. Entangled in this conceptual framework are three concepts that might guide STEAM education moving forward: transdisciplinarity, relationality, and responsibility. With these notions as inspiration, this paper asserts a philosophical vision that takes seriously the realities of our Anthropocenic present and considers how educators might move with, rather than push against, the challenges that continue to present themselves.

AB  - Given the potential applications of generative AI (GenAI) in education and its rising interest in research, this systematic review mapped the thematic landscape of 407 publications indexed in the Web of Science, ScienceDirect and Scopus. Using EPPI Reviewer, publication type, educational level, disciplines, research areas and applications of GenAI were extracted. Eight discursive themes were identified, predominantly focused on 'application, impact and potential', 'ethical implication and risks', 'perspectives and experiences', 'institutional and individual adoption', and 'performance and intelligence'. GenAI was conceptualised as a tool for 'pedagogical enhancement', 'specialised training and practices', 'writing assistance and productivity', 'professional skills and development', and as an 'interdisciplinary learning tool'. Key gaps highlighted include a paucity of research and discussions on GenAI in K-12 education; a limited exploration of GenAI's impact using experimental procedures; and a limited exploration of the potential and ethical concerns of GenAI from the lens of cultural dimensions. Promising opportunities for future research are highlighted.

AB  - Over the course of 3 years, the Political Science and Biology Programs at a regional HBCU have built a curricular learning community centered on a mock trial competition, where a microbiology course was paired with an introductory legal studies course. Over the course of a semester, students enrolled in both courses studied a real appellate case that dealt with some aspect of forensic science (DNA evidence for example). The legal studies students were to act as prosecution and defense and the microbiology students played the role of expert witnesses and consultants. To be successful, students had to build an interdisciplinary team, outline their side's case, and learn scientific and legal principles. This paper evaluates the impact of this experience on student learning using a mixed-methods approach. Students completed a self-reported knowledge survey and participated in a focus group debriefing session. Students report important gains in understanding the legal system and aspects of forensic science.

AB  - During the second industrial revolution (1870-1914), scientists moved away from trial-anderror methods to more systematically apply the principles of chemistry, physics, and biology (Mokyr 1998). The authors chose this period as the foundation of a project-based learning (PBL) unit integrated with the ninth-grade U.S. history curriculum (Thomas 2000). The unit encouraged students to associate the second industrial revolution's many inventions (in such areas as manufacturing, transportation, and communication) with methodical investigation and professional collaboration rather than random eureka moments. The goal was to develop student understandings about the evolution of different inventions within their scientific and societal contexts. The unit culminated with students producing and presenting timelines of significant inventions from the period. This article presents a four-phase approach to implementing the PBL unit that links scientific innovation to social context (Larmer and Mergendoller 2015). The authors launched this project at a STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and math) academy in Jersey City, New Jersey. The small public high school offers all students a college preparatory program grounded in hands-on, project-based activity. The PBL unit took place in six two-hour weekly sessions.

AB  - STEM experiences that capture students' curiosity have a unique role in inspiring awe in science, enculturing science engagement, and recruiting students to pursue STEM careers. Here, we present a unique interdisciplinary STEM experience for elementary school students that teaches them to write computer code to test primate intelligence at a zoo where they test their code with real monkeys. In a pilot study involving 3rd to 6th grade students, we find that students can acquire "hard skills" in computational thinking during this short-term immersive STEM experience, with a significant increase in accuracy and problem-solving attempts at post-test. Furthermore, students' interests in animal science, computers, and robots remain stable or even increase following this experience, demonstrating the project's capacity to blend technical skills with authentic scientific exploration. Teachers' feedback highlights the positive impact on critical thinking and leadership. This research underscores the potential of free-form, authentic, interdisciplinary STEM experiences to simultaneously nurture computational skills and a passion for science.

AB  - STEM education is on demand more than ever as the workforce relies on 21st century skills and STEM disciplines. This paper presents a framework (IMS-TEAM) for integration of mathematics and science with the use of technology and modeling in an authentic context. The activity based on this framework is designed for and implemented with forty-four 8th grade students in Turkey. The study was conducted to investigate the impact of the activity as well as the IMS-TEAM framework. A qualitative methodology was utilized. Data analysis revealed that different components of our conceptual framework fostered the integration of mathematics and science affecting the nature of students' engagement with the activity. Different frameworks are required to be adapted to different environments with the consideration of learners and teachers. Future research investigating the effectiveness of IMS-TEAM framework adapted to different content and disciplines would provide more evidence on the effectiveness of the framework.

AB  - This chapter argues for a research gaze that de-centres talk and attends to the body. It situates my reflections on methodological innovation and transdisciplinary collaboration in the context of studying the body and its meaning making capacities at the intersection of the social sciences and the arts. With a focus on the body as it is digitally mediated, the chapter draws on exploratory work within the MIDAS project, to discuss how social science methods might be brought into conversation with art and design based methods. It shows the potential of working at this intersection to generate novel themes and ideas for researching the digital body. I introduce three of these thematic synergies and reflect on how these could be mobilised by social research to interrogate and re-imagine the digital body: Fragmenting and zoning the body, Physical-digital trajectories of the body, and Engaging with the sensory material body. These themes are not exhaustive; rather I am using them to illustrate the indicative potential of an interdisciplinary approach to foster social science imagination and to move beyond the silences left by standard social science methods towards engaging with a creative potential for social science methodological innovation.

AB  - The advanced interdisciplinary research laboratory (AIRLab) represents a novel, effective, and motivational course designed from the interdisciplinary research interests of chemistry, physics, biology, and education development faculty members as an alternative to the independent thesis project experience. Student teams are assembled to work toward the completion of an interdisciplinary research project. Each team is composed of at least one student from a differing area of specialization (e.g., biology, biotechnology, chemistry, and physics), and projects are based on current trends in research. The inaugural project was the development of a portable DNA sequencer for in-field species identification; a project at the interface between physical and life sciences and that holds the potential for real-world application and positive social change. This work describes the details underlying the design and implementation of the AIRLab course, and includes an account of the method of student team assembly, the selection of a suitable research challenge, the specialized training provided in Agile project management, the methods used to achieve cohesive team dynamics, the learning outcomes from this experience, future directions that will be pursued for course improvement, and how our undergraduate degree-level expectations were met at an advanced level.

AB  - For several decades there has been a broad consensus on the need to promote scientific literacy and, ultimately, to promote the full development of student competency from an early age. However, many of the results recorded in the educational field are not very encouraging. Although interdisciplinarity has a more extensive trajectory, the continuous questioning of traditional teaching methods, due to their inefficiency, has given rise to the emergence of educational approaches that integrate the teaching of diverse scientific disciplines in a more contextualized, coherent, and comprehensive manner. The body of empirical research on the application of these approaches has grown, while leaving behind some essential theoretical questions. In the present work, a theoretical framework is proposed for integrated science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education, a current teaching approach with the important momentum. Based on the epistemological stance of Larry Laudan, three levels of scientific commitment are adopted: with theories, methods, and aims. Regarding the theoretical commitment, three axes of support are established for this framework: epistemological, psychological, and didactical. This mechanism allows us to construct a consistent model that may contribute to developing coherent integrated STEM education. In addition, an example of a real application of this theoretical framework is provided in the design, implementation, and evaluation of a STEM didactic unit in the primary education stage, demonstrating its coherence and viability.

AB  - The development of science education in many countries is varied and diverse. However, one common goal of science education in the different contexts is the focus on scientific literacy. To promote scientific literacy, the Nature of Science (NoS) is one of the vital components for raising scientifically literate citizens. In view of this, the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA 2000) proposed that all those who are involved in science teaching and learning should have a common view of the NoS. In Nigeria, this view is interpreted to have informed the stronger advocacy for students to develop an understanding of the scientific enterprise as articulated in the nation's policy document and revised science curricular. Therefore, this study aims to examine how NoS is represented in three Nigerian chemistry textbooks. The study draws from the NSTA document and literature--the analytical framework for the representations of NoS aspects, approaches used, and the content relation of NoS in the textbooks. Though comparatively few, the results indicated that NoS aspects of tentativeness, empirical nature, human endeavor, creativity, and imagination were the most cited in all the three textbooks. NoS aspects of theories and laws, subjectivity, and scientific methods were less mentioned, while the interdisciplinary nature of science, use of models, and science as a solitary pursuit were neglected in about two thirds of the textbooks. The results further revealed the dominance of implicit approach, followed by the historical approach used to integrate a few NoS aspects in the textbooks. The content relation of the NoS aspects were more of content-embeddedness than content-generic. Following these results, we conclude that the analyzed textbooks may not be adequate to promote scientific literacy in their present states but have the potential to contribute to scientific literacy among students; if revised to reflect recommendations, this study adds to existing literature on NoS representations in science textbooks.

AB  - Translational medicine (TM) is an interdisciplinary branch of biomedicine that bridges the gap from bench-to-bedside to improve global health. Fundamental TM skills include interdisciplinary collaboration, communication, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving (4Cs). TM is currently limited in undergraduate biomedical education programs, with little patient contact and opportunities for collaboration between different disciplines. In this study, we developed and evaluated a novel interdisciplinary challenge-based educational concept, grounded in the theoretical framework of experimental research-based education, to implement TM in undergraduate biomedicine and medicine programs. Students were introduced to an authentic clinical problem through an interdisciplinary session with patients, medical doctors, and scientists. Next, students collaborated in groups to design unique laboratory-based research proposals addressing this problem. Stakeholders subsequently rewarded the best proposal with funding to be executed in a consecutive interdisciplinary laboratory course, in which mixed teams of biomedicine and medicine students performed the research in a fully equipped wet laboratory. Written questionnaires and focus groups revealed that students developed 4C skills and acquired a 4C mindset. Working on an authentic patient case and the interdisciplinary setting positively contributed to communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving skills. Furthermore, students were intrinsically motivated by (i) the relevance of their work that made them feel taken seriously and competent, (ii) the patient involvement that highlighted the societal relevance of their work, and (iii) the acquisition of a realistic view of what doing science in a biomedical research laboratory is. In conclusion, we showcase a widely applicable interdisciplinary challenge-based undergraduate concept fostering TM.

AB  - Despite growing calls to develop data science students' ethical awareness and expand human-centered approaches to data science education, introductory courses in the field remain largely technical. A new interdisciplinary data science program aims to merge STEM and humanities perspectives starting at the very beginning of the data science curriculum. Existing literature suggests that humanities integration can make STEM courses more appealing to a wider range of students, including women and students of color, and enhance student learning of essential concepts and foundational reasoning skills, such as those collectively known as data acumen. Cultivating students' data acumen requires a more inclusive vision of how the knowledge and insights generated through computational methods and statistical analysis relates to other ways of knowing.

AB  - Knowledge related to photochemistry has been gradually introduced as a part of chemistry courses at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. However, due to their complex conceptual principles, limited class time, and tedious experimental setup and methodologies, students tend to encounter difficulties in understanding the concepts and comprehending the applications of fluorescence in their daily lives. Hence, developing effective multidisciplinary approaches to help students understand such intricate and complicated concepts remains a focus for most chemistry educators. In this study, we demonstrated the introduction of the excitation-emission matrix and how it can be used to monitor the effect of thermal treatment on different olive oils via the fluorescence fingerprinting method. The heating effect on the fluorescent properties of three olive oils, including extra virgin olive oil, refined olive oil, and blended olive oil, was discussed in a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates mathematical analyses. A speed-reading-based informative questionnaire survey was also conducted on students to investigate whether this method was effective in aiding students to better understand the physical significance of the excitation-emission matrix and its relevance to their daily lives. The acceptability and extensibility of this method were further evaluated by the student's performance in this survey.

AB  - This article presents ideas and narratives of an experiment on the concept of energy developed for an honors seminar on energy and a mechanics course. We argue that energy is an idea best taught in an interdisciplinary manner. While most physics courses explore ideas such as mechanical energy and conservation of energy, it is imperative that a more practical view of energy as fuel be addressed since this has particular relevance to our students' future. We believe energy cannot be discussed without talking about entropy and that a proper introduction to energy can only be made by simultaneously discussing the idea of entropy. In this article, we present one lab activity related to carbon emissions from bicycling, designed to help elucidate this idea through the use of conceptual metaphors and embodied learning. The learning goals of the activity were to encourage students to understand that energy and entropy are intricately related and to have students gain a deeper understanding of the concepts by considering and discussing ways in which they apply to different contexts. We discuss the rationale, implementation, and outcomes of the activity.

AB  - During recent decades, educational reform in the U.S. has favored standards-driven curricula with the purpose of improving education. However, national assessments have not demonstrated significant improvements in educational outcomes, especially among economically disadvantaged and minoritized populations. To mitigate these outcomes, youth-serving organizations provide children from these populations with out-of-school time programs to enhance their academic and social skills. This study highlights the significance of programs offered by nonprofit organizations like the Boys & Girls Clubs and the need to establish partnerships with universities to foster systematic collaboration. The program described in this article is a one-week summer science camp for students entering grades 4-7. The authors created an instructional unit that integrated literacy and mathematics into a science unit focused on water quality and related environmental issues, while also exploring student outcomes. The interdisciplinary project-based instructional unit focused on culturally responsive practices. Through these practices, students developed awareness of environmental issues and increased their understanding and use of scientific vocabulary related to water quality.

AB  - Realising the full potential for educational technologies to improve the student experience is a challenge for higher education institutions. Although academic resistance is often blamed for poor dissemination of teaching technologies, recent literature has more satisfactorily framed the issue in terms of intransigent organisational culture. Features of higher education organisational culture that are conducive to innovation include senior executive support, freedom to experiment and permission to fail and interdisciplinary and cross-institutional engagement. One approach to changing organisational culture is to establish new organisational structures embodying positive traits. This study qualitatively evaluated a technology in teaching innovators group established in 2018 in a science, health and engineering faculty of an Australian university; it provides evidence that the group improved the culture of teaching technology innovation by creating a safe space for innovation, which members then disseminated into their departmental communities. The study also found that the group created a forum for teaching technology innovators to engage with stakeholders in the university's learning and teaching and information and communication technology units, leading to improved outcomes for the university's learning environment.

AB  - Today's school students are faced with complex and harmful global challenges that they will need to address. The ability to think critically and creatively, to work in interdisciplinary teams and to understand the importance of a healthy planet for all life will be key to success. Education, including school education, has a major role in helping humanity achieve this. We argue that transformations in both the curriculum and teaching are required. We draw upon Young's (2008) 'powerful knowledge' and the rather different approach of an 'aims-based curriculum' found in Reiss and White (2013) to propose curricula and associated pedagogies that can potentially address the global challenges of our times. We offer examples of what learning might look like to achieve these aims, paying particular attention to school science education, as science will need to play an important role if these global challenges are to be successfully met.

AB  - Transdisciplinary (TD) graduate training programs are growing in number, yet little is known about their effectiveness or the development of TD attitudes and behaviors among students over time. This prospective longitudinal mixed methods study compares graduate students participating in a federally funded TD training program with non-participating students from the same disciplines and degree programs (n = 26). The Interdisciplinary Perspectives Index (IPI) and Behavior Change Collaborative Activity Index (BCCAI) were used to assess TD attitudes and behaviors at beginning, middle, and end of an MPH/PhD program. Additionally, a multiple case-based approach was used to further analyze changes among the TD students at three time points (n = 10), including a novel sketch protocol to elicit TD student conceptualizations (mental maps) of TD teams. Four assessments were used to construct an overall TD orientation score. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests showed TD behaviors increased over time only among TD students, and favorable TD attitudes were high at baseline and did not change for any group. Generalized Estimating Equations showed that TD behaviors were higher among TD students than traditional students at both mid and endpoint, with no difference at baseline. Visual assessments showed TD students' mental maps of TD research and team science, elicited under a novel sketch protocol, reflected greater integration and organization by endpoint. Two developmental patterns of increasing overall TD orientation emerged among the TD students. This article reports findings and insights applicable to TD graduate education and curriculum design and introduces a novel visual assessment tool.

AB  - The European Union Framework Programme (EUFP) is the most institutionalised form of supranational thematic programming in the world and the centrepiece of European Union research policy. Since 1994, the EUFP has also funded collaborative research projects in the social sciences. Surprisingly, little attention has been paid to its genesis, development, and effects in shaping the development of European science, especially examined by discipline or multidisciplinary fields. The EUFP is thus analysed here through an "instruments-as-institutions" approach that conceptualises the EUFP as an institution. Content analysis of the official documents of each funding cycle (n = 5) and a sample of European-funded educational research projects (n = 122) was analysed in conducting this research. The results show incremental ideational change of the EUFP's guiding ideas: from knowledge as an instrument to knowledge as a resource; within-the-EU to outside-the-EU internationalisation; and cooperation to an integration rationale of Europeanisation from the EUFP4 and EUFP5 (1994-2002) to the EUFP6 onwards (2002-2020). European-funded educational research contents are shaped by such representations of what is expected of European research. If the policy instrument steers European-funded educational research, ideas more than regulatory features significantly--though incrementally--change the direction of European social science.

AB  - Combining mathematical and physical understanding in reasoning is difficult, and a growing body of research shows that students experience problems with the combination of physics and mathematics in reasoning beyond the introductory level. We investigated students' reasoning about boundary conditions (BCs) for the diffusion equation by conducting exploratory task-based, think-aloud interviews with twelve undergraduate students majoring in physics or mathematics. We identified several difficulties students experienced while solving the interview task and categorized them using the conceptual blending framework. This framework states that in reasoning, people draw from separate input spaces, in this case the mathematics and the physics input space, to form a blended space, where they make connections between elements from these spaces. To identify difficulties, we used open coding techniques. We observed few difficulties in the physics space. In the mathematics space, we identified several difficulties that we clustered in two main groups: findings about the mathematical meaning of BCs, and findings about reasoning with functions of two variables. Lastly, we identified four ways in which blending failed. Starting from our findings, we formulate recommendations for teaching and future research.

AB  - Excessive alcohol consumption in adolescence is a worldwide concern because of its numerous negative consequences. It also increases the chance of accidents and may lead to significant impairment of part of the brain, causing learning difficulties. The present work aims to present the development of a forensic educational kit composed of a breathalyzer produced with low cost materials and a colorimetric palette for use in science classes for high school students. The kit's function is to estimate the ethanol concentration in alcoholic samples. The methodology is based on applied research with a qualitative and quantitative nature guided by an experimental procedure that presents all steps from the construction of the kit to its functionality. It also describes three didactic-pedagogical strategies on how this instrument may be used in the teaching-learning process. The results of this proposal show that, during the operation of the device, it is possible to observe a correlation with physical, chemical, biological, and mathematical concepts involving relations between science, technology, society, and environment (CTSE), which may be approached in a contextualized way and arouse student curiosity. In addition, the topic of this study provides an educational action since it enables a discussion of the impacts of ethanol on the body, raising awareness about the alarming use of alcoholic beverages. The implementation of interdisciplinary activities on the topic here is a fundamental strategy for the education of a citizen capable of developing a critical view of social events and the use of technologies.

AB  - Adopting an explicit and reflective approach to the teaching of the history and philosophy of science is useful in promoting high school students' understanding of the nature of science. Whereas the history of science is usually signposted clearly in the school science curriculum, the philosophy of science is considered to be embedded in and integral to science education. This article argues that philosophical topics also need to be explicitly signposted and discussed in the teaching of the nature of science in high schools. This study investigates an interdisciplinary course on the nature of science in a Chinese senior high school. The course involved explicit teaching of philosophy of science topics with subject knowledge in each lesson. This mixed method design of the research included a modified version of the Views on Science, Technology and Society questionnaire as reported by Aikenhead and Ryan ("Science Education," 76(5):477-491, 1992) and phenomenographical analysis. Although the sample size is small, the results suggest that explicit teaching of philosophy of science topics helps students better understand both the nature of science and the relationship between science, technology and society.

AB  - At its simplest, paint pouring is the mixing of paints with lower density and viscosity liquids and then pouring them onto a surface for an aesthetic artifact. Using active art as a teaching tool, middle school students were engaged in a paint pouring activity to study the influence of the interdisciplinary combination of chemistry and art topics on student understanding of density, viscosity, and creativity. It is accepted that hands-on activities increase the understanding of complex topics because students are able to apply these topics to real-world applications. Survey analysis (N = 124) of a pre- and post-event survey with 14 Likert scale questions broken into the following categories: density, science and creativity, viscosity, and art. The pre- and post-surveys included three multiple-choice questions indicating that student's understanding of the importance of density and viscosity in art increased after completing the activity. Of the 14 Likert scale questions, 11 showed an increased self-reported understanding of the scientific concepts and enthusiasm for art after engaging in the paint pouring exercise. Three responses did not increase, as the students already wanted to complete a paint pour and recognized paint pouring as an art activity. It was also observed that, after completing the exercise, students were receptive to how science and art can be integrated. Correct student responses to the multiple choice all increased in the post-survey, providing evidence for the self-reported increased student understanding of density and viscosity.

AB  - This paper, the third in a series on Earth System Science Education, describes various pedagogical ways forward when science teachers are addressing the curriculum implications of the recent interdisciplinary field of Earth System Science (ESS). Parts I and II introduced the key ideas of ESS and the implications for the Australian Curriculum: Science (see "Teaching Science" 68.1 & 68.2 respectively). Part III outlines several research-informed pedagogies to help learners develop more scientific understandings of the Earth System and appropriate related abilities. We believe the suggested ESS additions, emphases and the recommended pedagogies could comprise one pathway toward a more comprehensive and confident Earth System literacy and a stronger engagement in the Earth and other sciences at every school level, and to the curriculum as a whole. Better-informed, sustainability decision-making and actions by students as today's, and tomorrow's, citizens are the hoped-for outcome. [For Part II, see EJ1355521.]

AB  - Far too few high-school students choose subjects from the natural sciences (NaSc) for their majors in many countries. Even fewer study biology, chemistry or physics at university. Those, that do, often lack training to present and discuss scientific results and ideas in texts. To meet these challenges the center for didactics of biology of Graz University has set up the program "Young Science Journalism." This new workshop-based interdisciplinary concept was tested in an exploratory study with grade 10 students of one Austrian high school, engaging both the biology and the German teacher of the class. It was our aim to raise students' interest in the NaSc by encouraging them to write popular scientific articles about self-chosen topics, and to help them improve their writing competence. In this paper we focus on interest development through writing. Results from this pilot study were promising. Using a mixed-method approach (comparing pre- and post-test questionnaires and semi-structured interviews from different time points analyzed qualitatively), we found that almost all students valued the project-related work highly. Most of them showed higher interest in the NaSc at project end with girls, in average, seeming to profit more from project participation. We thus recommend integrating such writing tasks into school curricula to increase students' interest in NaSc or to even create new interest. Additionally, we introduce a network presentation of questionnaire data as a powerful tool to visualize the effect of an intervention on individual students and student profile groups.

AB  - Teaching about energy in interdisciplinary settings that emphasize coherence among physics, chemistry, and biology leads to a more central role for chemical bond energy. We argue that an interdisciplinary approach to chemical energy leads to modeling chemical bonds in terms of negative energy. While recent work on ontological metaphors for energy has emphasized the affordances of the substance ontology, this ontology is problematic in the context of negative energy. Instead, we apply a dynamic ontologies perspective to argue that blending the substance and location ontologies for energy can be effective in reasoning about negative energy in the context of reasoning about chemical bonds. We present data from an introductory physics for the life sciences course in which both experts and students successfully use this blended ontology. Blending these ontologies is most successful when the substance and location ontologies are combined such that each is strategically utilized in reasoning about particular aspects of energetic processes.

AB  - Context-based STEM learning has been proven to be useful as interdisciplinary storylines to regulate the flow and sequencing of lessons to obtain expected outcomes. This case study pilot project aims to contextualise scientific learning to local culture. Student groups sampled from two schools in distinct social backgrounds, reflected varied Indian population. Pre-service middle school science and social studies teachers conducted eight lessons as an interdisciplinary storyline with a few natural and social science concepts utilising an artefact representing the cultural history of India for seventh-graders. Data were collected through manually recording of students' responses and products made during class activities; researchers' observations and pre-service teachers' feedback about finding solutions to the difficulties faced. In order to address three research questions about socio-cultural context in science-curriculum design, student adoption of 3D learning, and overcoming teachers' challenges, a thematic analysis of data through the lens of five science practices and one crosscutting concept was performed. This study supported context-based STEM learning for the twenty-first century and strengthened cultural anchoring from an early stage implying the need for teacher professional development, curricular reform, and school infrastructure improvements to support policy implementation. Such researches may be extended to varied sociocultural contexts and discipline combinations to offer broader perspectives.

AB  - Background: The STEM education system has garnered significant interest due to its innovative approach in creating a multidisciplinary and integrated knowledge structure that connects science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and allows students to apply scientific knowledge in a comprehensive and holistic manner. Consequently, evaluating the teaching methods of teachers in accordance with STEM standards is critical. This assessment should take into account various educational objectives, including cognitive, skill-based, and emotional aspects. Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the creative teaching practices of mathematics teachers for gifted students according to STEM standards. Method: The study applied the descriptive analytical method and developed a rating scale for evaluating creative teaching practices based on STEM standards, verifying the psychometric properties in several ways. The study sample consisted of 64 teachers of mathematics for gifted students. Results: The results showed that the degree of application of creative teaching practices by the teachers of gifted students according to STEM standards was at the moderate level in three domains: planning, implementation, and assessment. Conclusions: Despite the importance of achieving integration for STEM, the actual teaching practices of teachers of the gifted according to these standards were generally average and did not reach acceptable and ambitious levels.

AB  - The medical education (Med Ed) research community characterises itself as drawing on the insights, methods, and knowledge from multiple disciplines and research domains (e.g. Sociology, Anthropology, Education, Humanities, Psychology). This common view of Med Ed research is echoed and reinforced by the narrative used by leading Med Ed departments and research centres to describe their activities as "interdisciplinary." Bibliometrics offers an effective method of investigating scholarly communication to determine what knowledge is valued, recognized, and utilized. By empirically examining whether knowledge production in Med Ed research draws from multiple disciplines and research areas, or whether it primarily draws on the knowledge generated internally within the field of Med Ed, this article explores whether the characterisation of Med Ed research as interdisciplinary is substantiated. A citation analysis of 1412 references from research articles published in 2017 in the top five Med Ed journals was undertaken. A typology of six knowledge clusters was inductively developed. Findings show that the field of Med Ed research draws predominantly from two knowledge clusters: the Applied Health Research cluster (made of clinical and health services research), which represents 41% of the references, and the Med Ed research cluster, which represents 40% of the references. These two clusters cover 81% of all references in our sample, leaving 19% distributed among the other knowledge clusters (i.e., Education, disciplinary, interdisciplinary and topic centered research). The quasi-hegemonic position held by the Applied Health and Med Ed research clusters confines the other sources of knowledge to a peripheral role within the Med Ed research field. Our findings suggest that the assumption that Med Ed research is an interdisciplinary field is not convincingly supported by empirical data and that the knowledge entering Med Ed comes mostly from the health research domain.

AB  - The meaning of the term energy varies widely in scientific and colloquial discourse. Teasing apart the different connotations of the term can be especially challenging for non-science majors. In this study, undergraduate students taking an interdisciplinary, general science course (n?=?49) were asked to explain the role of energy in five contexts: radiation, transportation, generating electricity, earthquakes, and the big bang theory. The responses were qualitatively analyzed under the framework of conceptual metaphor theory. This study presents evidence that non-science major students spontaneously use metaphorical language that is consistent with the conceptual metaphors of energy previously identified in the discourse of students in introductory physics, biology, and chemistry courses. Furthermore, most students used multiple coherent metaphors to explain the role of energy in these complex topics. This demonstrates that these conceptual metaphors for energy have broader applicability than just traditional scientific contexts. Implications for this work as a formative assessment tool in instruction will also be discussed.

AB  - Background: The technological age of the twenty-first century has witnessed an upsurge in the demand for STEM education. Early childhood STEM learning and teaching has sparked attention among researchers. Purpose: This study aims to provide a holistic review of current STEM research in Early Childhood Education (ECE). Sample: We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 129 articles on early STEM education published in educational journals via Web of Science. Design and methods: This study used VOSviewer to analyze and conduct a bibliometric analysis. Statistical analyses on publications included annual trends, grants, journals, publishers, research topic, publishing source, institutions, keywords, categories and classification, and researchers. Results: The review found that (1) The majority of early childhood STEM research was conducted in developed countries such as the United States, Turkey, and Australia. (2) Key STEM literature in ECE studies tended to fall into major clusters such as STEM education, Robotics, and Mindstorms. (3) STEM in ECE studies were frequently associated with psychology in ECE. Conclusion: The findings suggest a need for more multidisciplinary and cross-disciplinary studies on STEM research in ECE and advocate for the inclusion of the STEM research in ECE from broader geographical contexts.

AB  - The aim of present research was to examine the effects of interdisciplinary teaching approach on teaching the topic of proteins. In the research, unequal control group model- one of the quasi-experimental research designs was used. The experimental group included 16 students (8 female and 8 male) whereas the control group included 14 students (6 female and 8 male) in this research- which was conducted with the participation of the 12th grade students. A lesson plan in which the topic of proteins was taught in interdisciplinary approach was prepared as the tool of application. A concept map prepared by the researcher and a 5-point Likert type of question were used in collected the data. The data collection tool was given to both the experimental group and the control group as a pre-test and post-test. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, a non-parametric method- was used in comparing the participants' scores in the pre-test and post-test of concept map and Likert type question. As a result, it was found that the application of interdisciplinary teaching conducted in the experimental group had caused differences in students' associating the concepts in biology and chemistry available in the topic of proteins and in their perceptions of their skills in this respect.

AB  - The Small Group Learning (SGL) permeates throughout higher education fields of study. Thus, our aim is to assess the influence of a planned activity of SGL on a variety of competences appraisals through a multidisciplinary perspective. To that end, cooperative learning activities implemented under the SGL approach were programmed for six different degrees. For each activity, students were provided with instructions about what the activity was about and how to make it. Two surveys were scheduled before and after the completion of the SGL. Our findings are presented in a descriptive and quantitative analysis, using surveys with which we examine the pre and post differences in students' self-reports. As a result, self-perceptions on oral and written expression and bibliography competence increased after the practice of the Small Group Learning (SGL) strategy in students from Social Science degrees as well as in students from Psychology degree. In addition, receiving feedback showed an improvement for the whole sample after doing SGL. Our results confirm that, in order to achieve an excellent quality education, SGL could be applied equally in different fields of study: both Health and Social Sciences. The novelty of this study is that it has been conducted in six different academic degrees and has focused on higher education skills in order to improve future undergraduate's employability.

AB  - Immersive learning practices (ILPs) in higher education are multidisciplinary in nature and varied in levels of integration into the student learning process. They appear in a variety of higher education programs such as teacher education, social work, law, and health sciences, and in practices such as service-learning, study away, internships, and foreign-language instruction. Based on observations of teaching and data from an open-ended survey and semi-structured interviews with post-secondary educators from three different countries, this study theorizes that immersive learning practices are composed of six distinct underlying theoretical components that work in combination. These six components can be used to describe, define, compare, and design different types of structured ILPs. This study suggests that ILPs are pedagogically distinct from other forms of engaged and experiential learning.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the role of multidisciplinary course requirements in shaping student attitudes toward sustainability and education for sustainable development. Previous research indicates that students conceptualize sustainability based on their academic discipline; thus, this research investigates whether there is a difference in student attitudes toward sustainability at Grenfell Campus, Memorial University of Newfoundland, where students are encouraged to cross the borders of their academic disciplines. Design/methodology/approach: This research reports on the findings from a mixed-methods study to assess the impact of program requirements on student attitudes toward sustainability and education for sustainable development at Grenfell Campus, Memorial University of Newfoundland. In phase one, an anonymous survey was administered to students regarding their perceptions and attitudes toward sustainability and education for sustainable development. The survey yielded 100 usable responses. Phase 2 consisted of a series of 10 semi-structured expert interviews with key faculty and staff at Grenfell Campus and a representative from the City of Corner Brook, which gave further insights regarding sustainability programming and campus culture. Findings: Contrary to previous research, the results of this research indicate that the School of Study does not have a statistically significant impact on student attitudes toward sustainability. This may be attributed to Grenfell Campus's Breadth of Knowledge requirement within the School of Arts and Social Science and the School of Science and the Environment, which requires that students take elective courses from a broad range of subject matter to develop their holistic awareness of social, cultural, scientific and political issues. Practical implications: The results of this research indicate that students who are exposed to broad multidisciplinary requirements may be more likely to have positive attitudes toward sustainability than students who focus on a single discipline. Originality/value: A limited number of studies investigate the impact of core program requirements on student attitudes toward sustainability. This paper promotes an effective way of raising sustainability-literate young people/citizens in a Canadian higher education context.

AB  - Objective: To examine the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary, discovery-oriented teaching unit designed to provide science and health information about HIV from the perspective of viral biology, population statistics and epidemiology. Design: Single group pre- and post-curriculum pilot study. Setting: Fifteen middle and high school classrooms recruited from districts in and around a large, diverse, urban area in the mid-southern USA. Method: Science educators, clinicians, virologists and biologists collaborated to develop a set of five activities intended to increase content knowledge related to HIV, while developing students' science-related skills in the context of an authentic, relevant example. The activities were piloted with six hundred and twenty-four 12- to 18-year-old students. Multiple-choice pre- and post-tests were used to assess changes in students' knowledge, and teacher evaluations were used to gauge appropriateness of content, ease of activity implementation and teacher perceptions of student skill development, learning and engagement. Results: Student pre- and post-tests and teacher post-evaluations indicated that the curriculum was effective in increasing content knowledge for students across all age ranges, with 13- to 14-year-old, grade 8 students achieving the greatest knowledge gains. Teacher-reported information also suggested that students were able to apply relevant skills to their interpretation of authentic data related to the incidence and transmission of HIV infection around the world. Conclusion: The developed activities have the potential to provide timely, relevant information to students while strengthening science-related content knowledge and skills as well as health literacy.

AB  - Computer science education (CSEd) is a growing interdisciplinary area that continues to gain momentum from students, researchers, and educators. Yet, there are few formal programs or degree options for students interested in pursuing graduate work in CSEd. This article explores the existing state of CSEd in the United States (U.S.) through semi-structured interviews with (n = 15) faculty engaged in CSEd research. Thematic coding of the transcripts revealed the complexities involved in the development of formal programs, the distinct considerations for faculty, and the value of having strong ties to both computer science and education. The themes described positive aspects of support and cohesion within the larger community and opportunities to expand knowledge across fields. Applying Cornell and Parker's principles of interdisciplinary science to the field of CSEd, we provide recommendations for ways forward and discuss the potential impact on institutional structures, research capacity, individual and group identities, and teaching and learning. The findings from this investigation not only inform on the present state of CSEd in the U.S., but also offer guidance for CSEd-focused graduate programs.

AB  - Integrating biology and mathematics can potentially solve problems associated with students' inability to solve quantitative biology problems. To face this issue, we embarked on a project to develop biological and mathematical content-based comics for elementary school students. It would assist them in gaining early comfort with transdisciplinary work. However, we need experts' perceptions to see if our comics are feasible. This exploratory interview research attempted to understand how experts perceive mathematical representation in biology comics. The three experts involved in the interview were a biology teacher, a mathematics lecturer, and a comics enthusiast. This study's empirical data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analyzed using thematic analysis. The research uncovered three major themes: (1) comic content, (2) graph type, and (3) graph modification. Experts have a positive opinion of our comics. We highlight the experts' feedback for some revision, such as adding additional information, expanding the storyline, and modifying the graph through Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach.

AB  - Group work is often used in university courses. This article examines group work in a widely interdisciplinary holography course that combines both art and science, for students from the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. In these interdisciplinary teams, how much specialization of labor (dividing work according to students' pre-existing abilities or personal interests) is acceptable? We present student survey responses regarding their attitudes toward interdisciplinary group work, and their practices in dividing the work, to determine how much specialization of labor is taking place within the interdisciplinary teams. The surveys indicate a mix of approaches among groups concerning the division of labor based on prior skills. In the presence of specialization of labor, students learned from their partners and displayed a positive attitude toward working with someone from a different discipline. We believe that the intriguing nature of the holography projects helped many students avoid dividing the work according to their prior skills, and helped them see the value of working in a widely interdisciplinary team.

AB  - Public schools are a major provider of mental health services for children in the US. Mental and behavioral health services range from universal programming to individualized clinical supports to address student needs. These services in schools are delivered by various professionals including non-teaching and teaching school personnel, school-employed clinicians, and/or contracted community mental health partners. Provision of mental health services requires complex coordination of providers across disciplines, although few professionals have training in multidisciplinary collaboration strategies. Attention to team processes, such as delineating team members' roles, improving communication, and identifying collaboration strategies, may impact the effectiveness of evidence-based mental health service provision in real world settings. One intervention, Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS), has been used in healthcare with positive outcomes and has been adapted to educational settings. The current paper describes the community-partnered subsequent adaptation of TeamSTEPPS for schools. Needs assessment interviews identified challenges, successes, and goals for student mental health. Overarching themes extracted from interviews include limited resources at multiple levels (e.g., financial support, time, and personnel), communication challenges, and poor role clarity. A community advisory board provided guidance during the adaptation and implementation planning process. Adaptations to the intervention included tailoring the intervention to the school context and the development of flexible training plans. In addition, individualized implementation plans were developed with each school partner to mitigate foreseeable barriers to rolling-out TeamSTEPPS. Our team is currently piloting the adapted TeamSTEPPS intervention and implementation strategies in partnership with three school districts.

AB  - Landscapes have been and are an important aspect of any society, culture, economy and environment. Besides the role of landscape and Landscape Sciences in these arenas, there have been increasingly greater calls to incorporate landscape into the curriculum. Moreover, Landscape Education is beneficial in developing important foundations in students, particularly that of active citizenry. While the benefits of Landscape Education are evident, current research remains focused on Western, especially European, contexts. This article discusses how a leading Singapore public University incorporates Landscape Education within a relatively new module on Toponymy offered in the Linguistics and Multilingual Studies Programme. While the links between Linguistics and a course in Toponymy or even the links between Toponymy and Landscape may not be immediately apparent, an analysis of the content covered in the module demonstrates congruence to existing frameworks and principles in teaching Landscape Education and, at the same time, provides a case in point in interdisciplinarity, drawing from diverse disciplines such as Language, Linguistics, History, Geography, Landscape Sciences, Anthropological Linguistics, among many others. This study provides useful references for educational institutions in incorporating Landscape Education into their curriculum.

AB  - Interdisciplinary experiments within chemistry are very important for the improvements in the overall quality of the education received by students. In this work, we describe an interdisciplinary experiment that was successfully completed by undergraduate students. This training integrates multiple disciplines including natural product medicinal chemistry, organic synthesis, and instrumental analysis. The experiment involved the extraction of crude berberine hydrochloride (BBH) from "Coptidis rhizoma," recrystallization for purification, and qualitative and quantitative analysis of purified BBH using the "Brick-L" miniature mass spectrometer (mini-MS). The use of mini-MS analysis is the highlight of this work. Mini-MS offers an unprecedented opportunity to incorporate MS analysis into regular undergraduate teaching due to its small size, low power consumption, and portability. The modular design of the mini-MS instrument used in this work allows instructors to disassemble the instrument on-site in the laboratory to show and introduce the actual structure and components inside the instrument to students. Students not only gain hands-on experience with technology but also have the opportunity to see some of the "inner workings" rather than simply treating the mass spectrometer as "a black box". This greatly helped students understand the construction and analysis principles of MS and motivated students to learn about scientific instruments. This comprehensive experiment can help undergraduate students to improve their overall ability and get in touch with the frontiers of analytical chemistry. This teaching practice can also provide a viable case for comprehensive chemistry experiments in other related disciplines.

AB  - Nolan and Temple Lang's "Computing in the Statistics Curricula" (2010) advocated for a shift in statistical education to broadly include computing. In the time since, individuals with training in both computing and statistics have become increasingly employable in the burgeoning data science field. In response, universities have developed new courses and programs to meet the growing demand for data science education. To address this demand, we created Data Science in Practice, a large-enrollment undergraduate course. Here, we present our goals for teaching this course, including: (1) conceptualizing data science as creative problem solving, with a focus on project-based learning, (2) prioritizing practical application, teaching and using standardized tools and best practices, and (3) scaling education through coursework that enables hands-on and classroom learning in a large-enrollment course. Throughout this course we also emphasize social context and data ethics to best prepare students for the interdisciplinary and impactful nature of their work. We highlight creative problem solving and strategies for teaching automation-resilient skills, while providing students the opportunity to create a unique data science project that demonstrates their technical and creative capacities.

AB  - Symbols are a cornerstone of the written language of mathematics and mathematical sciences. However, variations in their use pose a constant challenge to students. This paper reports data from first year undergraduate students studying mathematics, statistics and/or physics collected using surveys and interviews. It became clear that multiple uses of a single symbol across topics and across STEM subjects can be problematic for students. In particular our attention was drawn to misinterpretation of subscripts. Without explicit attention, educators of mathematics and mathematical science subjects should not assume that students correctly interpret symbols in a given context.

AB  - The interdisciplinary nature of food makes it an effective teaching vehicle in many fields. This article shows specifically how flavor and food fermentation, two topics not usually featured in the undergraduate STEM curriculum, can inspire a powerful interdisciplinary learning experience. Importantly, because of their accessible nature and relatively unexplored status in current research, these two topics are also uniquely attractive as authentic research experiences for students from diverse backgrounds. Focusing on these topics, the author designed and executed a student-centered science course. The course is unusual from other Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) in being highly inquiry-driven and discovery-based, with students independently defining their research topics. By emphasizing curiosity, creativity, and practicing how to generate "good" research questions, the course fills a gap in the traditional undergraduate research experience and curriculum. The findings of the article are based on hundreds of enrolled students from five course offerings. It shows that the course promotes student engagement and curiosity, as well as gains in conceptual learning and in self-reported learning of concepts and science skills. Further, students report valuing the hands-on and inquiry-based format for improving their learning, engagement, and sense of curiosity about the material.

AB  - The essence of Islamic education, in addition to the transfer of value and knowledge is the optimization of all human potential. Most of human potential rests on his brain. The science of studying the brain is neuroscience. Therefore, Islamic education and neuroscience can be hybridized in an interdisciplinary manner. The purpose of this study was to find new scientific varieties resulted from hybridization of Islamic education and neuroscience. This research is an interdisciplinary study with a qualitative approach in the form of library research. The source of the research data is the literature in the field of Islamic education and neuroscience that is explored and collected documentary and analyzed with content analysis. The results of the study showed that the concepts of "nasiyah" (crown) and "'aql" (mind) in the Quran have a correlation with the brain and mind in neuroscience. Both can be hybridized so as to find new varieties of science called the Islamic Education Neuroscience. This new branch of science has the potential to be equivalent to the scientific branches that have been developing so far, such as the philosophy of Islamic education, the psychology of Islamic education, the anthropology of Islamic education and so is the neuroscience of Islamic education. Educators, both teachers and lecturers who study this science can do stimulation and intervention to optimize students' brain potential in an integrated manner in learning Islamic diversity.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to identify the need for gender equality education. For this purpose, the views of mathematics, science, and information technology teachers on the current situation of gender equality in schools were determined. In addition, the awareness of sixth, seventh and eighth grade middle school students on gender equality was examined. This study was a descriptive research conducted in a qualitative context. In data collection, an interview form on teachers' views and a written view form on students' awareness about gender equality were used. Research data were collected in the spring semester of the 2017-2018 academic year. As a result of the research, it is thought that an interdisciplinary gender equality education will be beneficial to improve students' awareness.

AB  - Many students who enroll in a first course in linear algebra major in STEM disciplines other than mathematics. Teachers who serve such students may find it difficult to provide authentic problems from these broader areas that ignite students' interest in linear algebra. In this paper, we highlight an interdisciplinary learning activity that engages students in using linear systems of equations to model the behavior of practical electric circuits. This exercise fits nicely into standard introductory linear algebra curricula and is designed to excite students majoring in engineering, physics, or applied mathematics. We also include references to a collection of open-access resources to support instructors who want to use this material in project-based, flipped-learning, inquiry-oriented, or independent-study environments.

AB  - Learning synthetic biology is often seen as a far distant possibility, restricted to those who have the privilege of an academic career. We propose a student-centered discussion group around synthetic biology, aimed at people from high school onwards with different backgrounds to interact and learn about synthetic biology. We developed a 14-week long program with three modules: "Leveling," "Introducing," and "Discussion." By completing the first two modules, the members should be more comfortable with biological names, structures, concepts, and techniques. The modules developed are available in Portuguese, Spanish, and English via the Open Lab Idea Real website (https://ideareal.org/clube-de-biologia-sintetica/) and can be used to implement the Club either in place or virtually around the world. We put it to practice at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) creating the Club named BioSin. There are programs such as the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition focused on disseminating synthetic biology. Although iGEM is one fantastic way of learning about synthetic biology, there is a high cost. Because of that, a study and discussion Club is a tool to spread knowledge and engage with the study area.

AB  - This work presents an experiment that seeks to simulate human color vision through electronic components in an attempt to build, together with the students, a cybernetic 'eye'. The limitation of the cybernetic eye developed here in relation to the standard human chromatic vision, which makes it a 'colorblind eye', is an argument to be explored by the teacher to discuss this predominantly genetic anomaly, raising awareness and discussing the need for public policies aimed at the inclusion of colorblind individuals. It can also be treated as an interdisciplinary manner, bringing physics and biology closer together. Using inexpensive, easy-to-purchase electronic components, the experiment produces data that, when treated, highlight the possibility of using the RGB LED as a light receiver, as well as its limitations for discerning colors.

AB  - In this empirical study, the one-day project Robot Love Design-a-thon was designed for an interdisciplinary group of preservice teachers (in arts, sciences, and primary education), and evaluated through observations and learner reports. An analysis of the observations and the learner reports showed that having to go through a complete design process in a single day worked well: it facilitated the exchange of ideas and critical discussions between students concerning the project's socially engaged theme 'Tenderness and Technology'. In addition, interdisciplinary collaboration emerged as an important learning outcome. All students found working in mixed teams a relevant and educational experience as they could profit from each other's expertise.

Here, we present a model for using cross-disciplinary CUREs to vertically integrate courses from different disciplines. This approach creates opportunities for students to (1) ask and answer authentic research questions, (2) apply knowledge from different disciplines to a research topic, and (3) expand their interest in additional research. To achieve these goals, a research theme of metal-containing anticancer drugs was used to link 100- and 300-level courses in both biology and chemistry. Across four courses, developmentally appropriate strategies were used to investigate the metal complex KP1019 (indazolium "trans"-[tetrachlorobis(1H-indazole)ruthenate(III)]). In chemistry courses, students synthesized KP1019 and quantitatively analyzed how novel environmental variables alter its hydrolysis and redox properties. In biology courses, students used the yeast "Saccharomyces cerevisiae" as a model for characterizing how environmental variables affect KP1019 bioactivity, and they performed a partial phenomic screen to identify yeast genes that influence drug sensitivity. To promote cross-talk between courses, undergraduate researchers uploaded their findings to a wiki that subsequent students used to drive the design of novel experiments. Survey and focus group results suggest the revised laboratory projects successfully engaged students in the scientific process, promoted integration of concepts from biology and chemistry, and led to a disproportionately large number of impacted students participating in mentored research. Importantly, a wide range of interdisciplinary research questions can be adapted for use with this model of vertical integration across STEM disciplines.

AB  - According to extensive research, problem-based learning (PBL) in STEM education improves student learning outcomes and supports them in gaining practical skills necessary for upward future careers. Despite current efforts to promote PBL-STEM activities in education, their uptake in life science remains low. Several types of research involving college instructors indicate that instructor guidance of PBL-STEM activities is one of the crucial aspects for its successful usage in educational settings. However, to our knowledge, little research has been undertaken on the effectiveness of participants' PBL-STEM learning in coping with problems and dilemmas encountered during the STEM learning process. This research intends to investigate the efficacy and provide experiential references to demonstrate the existing gaps by a transdisciplinary approach. The effect on participants' professional learning interest, comprehension capacity, problem-solving ability, self-efficacy, and cooperation abilities is related to five dependent variables. Our findings from paired t-test analysis demonstrate that STEM participants had a significant difference before and after experiencing PBL-STEM learning objectives. In the light of a one-way ANOVA, STEM learner participation in this course was more important than gender and age in improving STEM literacy through classroom activities. In line with feedback interviews, students who engaged in experiential learning favored reciprocal advantages and mutual benefits within their groups through teamwork, practical application, and information acquisition. Given that the participants in this study were early adopters of PBL-STEM, any future research should aggressively encourage these students to create and implement solutions in the classroom based on their ideas.

AB  - The field of DNA nanotechnology has grown rapidly in the past decade and has expanded to multiple laboratories. While lectures in DNA nanotechnology have been introduced in some institutions, laboratory components at the undergraduate level are still lacking. Undergraduate students predominantly learn about DNA nanotechnology through their involvement as interns in research laboratories. The DNA nanostructure biostability analysis experiment presented here can be used as a hands-on introductory laboratory exercise for discussing concepts in DNA nanotechnology in an undergraduate setting. This experiment discusses biostability, gel electrophoresis and quantitative analysis of nuclease degradation of a model DNA nanostructure, the paranemic crossover (PX) DNA motif. The experiment can be performed in a chemistry, biology, or biochemistry laboratory with minimal costs and can be adapted in undergraduate institutions using the instructor and student manuals provided here. Laboratory courses based on cutting edge research not only provide students a direct hands-on approach to the subject, but also can increase undergraduate student participation in research. Moreover, laboratory courses that reflect the increasingly multidisciplinary nature of research add value to undergraduate education.

AB  - Electrochemistry is broad and interdisciplinary by nature and as such has become a powerful tool in science, technology, engineering, math, and medical (STEMM) fields ranging from energy storage to biotechnology. However, traditional undergraduate chemistry education does not offer students the opportunity to create direct connections between topics learned in a lecture course and applications beyond the examples depicted in textbooks. Here, we offer a framework that introduces learners to hands-on cyclic voltammetry in a general chemistry laboratory course setting or in outreach activities. In 2-4 h, learners practice electrode care, data acquisition, and the pattern recognition needed for discerning reversible, quasireversible, and irreversible solution-phase redox events.

AB  - The development of new medicines holds particular fascination for chemistry, biochemistry, and biology students interested in a career in medicine or the life sciences. The identification and refinement of lead compounds to treat diseases requires researchers to be facile in a number of different disciplines including organic synthesis, biochemistry, cell biology, and molecular biology. We have developed an interdisciplinary, inquiry-based laboratory spanning both organic chemistry and biochemistry classes that acquaints students with research in medicinal chemistry. The first part of the exercise takes place in the second semester of organic chemistry, where pairs of students design and execute their own multistep synthesis of a novel compound with anti-inflammatory and/or antimalarial potential. Later, in first semester biochemistry, many of the same students then test these synthesized compounds for cytotoxicity, inhibition of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase, and inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kB. Learning outcomes, measured by the Classroom Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) survey, suggest that students participating in both classes had higher gains than an average student.

AB  - Integrating STEM-ESD enhances educational quality through interdisciplinary, hands-on learning experiences that foster deeper understanding and cultivate skills for real-world challenges. This paper presents a systematic review examining STEM-ESD implementation in Indonesia's educational context. Guided by four research questions, the study investigates the integration of STEM with ESD, its effectiveness, practical implementation approaches, and encountered constraints. Twenty-two articles published between 2018 and 2024 were analyzed from databases using a systematic review methodology, focusing on Scopus-indexed international journals accredited by SINTA. Articles were selected through keyword searches and screened for relevance based on specific criteria. The review involved data selection, adaptation of a coding instrument, identifying article patterns, and synthesizing findings. Results indicate that STEM-ESD is widely implemented in Indonesian education, significantly enhancing students' sustainability awareness and critical thinking skills. Effective approaches identified include project-based learning, the integration of STEM modules with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) principles, and inquiry-based teaching methods. Nonetheless, challenges remain, such as the predominance of scientific perspectives in ESD and the need for holistic approaches incorporating social sciences. This study contributes valuable insights into STEM-ESD integration within Indonesian education. It highlights the need for policy reforms emphasizing interdisciplinary approaches, enhanced teacher training, and a curriculum that comprehensively integrates STEM and sustainability concepts. Such reforms are essential to equipping educators to deliver effective learning experiences that prepare students for the complexities of sustainability challenges.

AB  - A widespread call has been made to develop and support more integrated approaches to STEM education. The first law of thermodynamics serves as a guiding principle for the crosscutting concept of energy and matter. A qualitative interview study was undertaken to support integrated approaches to STEM education by exploring how chemistry, physics, and engineering students (n = 40) transfer first law concepts across disciplinary contexts. Acquired interview data were analysed through the lens of the dynamic transfer framework to reveal the underlying contextual elements students used to know with. Emergent trends across the disciplines revealed how these applied reasoning approaches and epistemologies were realised by each discipline. Productive transfer is shown to be facilitated by the coordination of different disciplinary epistemologies. Suggestions are made to practitioners on how to support students in applying different reasoning approaches when addressing first law problems. The applied methods also serve as a promising methodology for future investigation of students' transfer of crosscutting concepts.

AB  - Situated within the CID (Communication in the Disciplines) theoretical framework that promotes the focus of communication instruction on the oral genre standards of effectiveness, and employing a transdisciplinary approach, the current study explores science students' attitudes and motivation concerning an oral skills development (OSD) intervention. The cross-disciplinary based intervention involved the delivery of an oral skills development module over a ten-week period to thirty-four chemistry students in which staff from the English language section partnered with lecturers in chemistry to enhance these students' oral presentation of chemistry-based content. The performance of students participating in the module was compared with that of non-OSD chemistry students to verify whether there was a significant difference in performance. Surveys were also undertaken on OSD Chemistry students to see whether or not there was a significant change in attitude after the intervention. Results revealed a significant difference between OSD and non OSD students on a similar oral presentation task with OSD students attaining a higher level of performance. OSD students also demonstrated a positive, significant change in attitude post intervention. Implications of the findings, as well as possible areas for further research, are discussed.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic posed many ethical and practical challenges for academic research. Some of these have been documented, particularly in relation to health research, but less attention has been paid to the dilemmas encountered by educational and social science research. Given that pandemics are predicted to be more frequent, it is vital to understand how to continue crucial research in schools and other learning communities. This article therefore focuses specifically on research ethics in educational and social science during the pandemic of 2020-2022. The research involved interviews and workshops with University College London (UCL) academics, professional staff and graduate students and encompassed those involved in reviewing ethics applications, researchers dealing with ethics in projects that continued despite disruptions caused by COVID-19, and successful research projects specifically designed to study the effects of COVID-19 in various contexts. The article discusses some of the crucial knowledge and practical experiences that were accumulated. The operational and epistemological lessons learned from this particular institution may have wider relevance to research ethics processes in higher education environments where academics and students are grappling with post-COVID-19 ethical dilemmas and inform broader debates about how research institutions can build institutional knowledge to improve practices of ethics review at the times of health emergencies in future. Our evidence points to the significance of inter- and multidisciplinary, collaborative approaches that flatten institutional hierarchies and to the crucial role played by professional staff. In addition, we argue that ethics review processes must be underpinned by critical debates about wider issues of unequal power relationships between research partners, the nature of knowledge production, ownership and utilisation. To enhance equity and epistemic justice in research practices, ethics education should be an ongoing integral part of research ethics within research institutions.

AB  - This paper introduces hands-on curricular modules integrated with research in atmospheric ice nucleation, which is an important phenomenon potentially influencing global climate change. The primary goal of this work is to promote meaningful laboratory exercises to enhance the competence of students in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) by applying an appropriate methodology to laboratory ice nucleation measurements. To achieve this goal, three laboratory modules were developed with 18 STEM interns and tested by 28 students in a classroom setting. Students were trained to experimentally simulate atmospheric ice nucleation and cloud droplet freezing. For practical training, this work utilized a simple freezing assay device called the West Texas Cryogenic Refrigerator Applied to Freezing Test (WT-CRAFT) system. More specifically, students were provided with hands-on lessons to calibrate WT-CRAFT with deionized water and apply analytical techniques to understand the physicochemical properties of bulk water and droplet freezing. All procedures to implement the developed modules were typewritten during this process, and shareable read-ahead exploration materials were developed and compiled as a curricular product. Additionally, students conducted complementary analyses to identify possible catalysts of heterogeneous freezing in the water. The water analyses included: pH, conductivity, surface tension, and electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. During the data and image analysis process, students learned how to analyze droplet freezing spectra as a function of temperature, screen and interpret the data, perform uncertainty analyses, and estimate ice nucleation efficiency using computer programs. Based on the formal program assessment of learning outcomes and direct (yet deidentified) student feedback, we broadly achieved our goals to (1) improve their problem-solving skills by combining multidisciplinary science and math skills and (2) disseminate data and results with variability and uncertainty. The developed modules can be applied at any institute to advance undergraduate and graduate curricula in environmental science.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to map trends in literature about digital school leadership over the last decades. Combining bibliometric and automatic content analyses, we map and analyze a sample of 350 documents, retrieved in Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) including titles and abstracts. The software VosViewer and Leximancer are used for analyses. Our sample is divided reflecting an early phase of digitalization in school (1992-2009), a phase of an increasing digitalization in school (2010-2020) and a phase of digitalization related to the COVID-19 pandemic (2021-2023). In general, the research literature on digital school leadership can be characterized as an emerging, fragmented, and inter-disciplinary field. Most literature is published after 2010 with an increase in publications after 2019, resulting in a peak in 2021. The literature is characterized by some influential highly connected authors revealing some changing thematic patterns over time. Further, findings highlight that when research on digital school leadership draws from various disciplines, this also indicates a need for a holistic and multifaceted approach. Scholars from different disciplines contribute to an updated understanding of digital school leadership. This interdisciplinary collaboration thus enriches the discourse, as it demonstrates how various perspectives may add new insights into the conceptualization of digital school leadership.

AB  - Within the context of higher education, the disciplines of science and filmmaking appear disparate, but the importance of storytelling as an integral part of science and research deserves closer examination. Humans have always used stories to share information and convey complex ideas. To those outside science, science communications can be laden with difficult terms and feel exclusive and unrelatable. There has been a recent call to develop science storytelling skills to improve accessibility of science for a general audience. With the rise of video content on social media platforms, short-format videos can reach an untapped audience for science. This case study looks at a unique interdisciplinary course, Science Docs, that encourages students from all areas of study to form a Community of Practice (CoP) that bridges the gap between scientist, storyteller, and science communication evaluator.

AB  - Striking differences between physics and biology have important implications for interdisciplinary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. The author is a physicist with interdisciplinary connections. The research group in which he works, the Center for Nonlinear Dynamics at the University of Texas at Austin, is converting into the physics department home for biological physics. Many of his collaborations have been with faculty in engineering. For the past 15 years, he has been codirector of the program at the University of Texas at Austin that prepares secondary science and mathematics teachers (UTeach, 2012). The future teachers take a course on scientific research he developed and deliver together with colleagues from biology, astronomy, chemistry, and biochemistry (Marder, 2011). This background naturally makes him an enthusiastic advocate of interdisciplinary education at the secondary and undergraduate levels. Yet at the same time, the author is worried by some features of what may be coming. These worries have to do with what can happen as educators are all lumped together under the heading of STEM.

AB  - The knowledge of historically marginalized learners, including racially and linguistically minoritized learners, tends to be obscured in institutionalized learning contexts and by the dominant discourse of "learning loss," which was reinforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on critical ethnography and the methodology of shared walks, this article highlights intergenerational ways of knowing embodied and emplaced in the context of traditional farming sustained and mobilized by a Syrian refugee family. We illustrate what children were indeed learning in the land of refuge during the pandemic, with their family, beyond narrowly defined in-school learning. We conceptualize the recentering of intergenerational ways of knowing, often overlooked in colonial institutionalized learning spaces, as "transdisciplinary" acts for disrupting the hegemonic disciplinary formation of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

AB  - Education is a fundamental tool to make a country's society equitable, just, and respectful of the environment. As primary education is compulsory for a country's population, it allows building knowledge and skills to promote sustainable development, in this sense, it is necessary to examine whether the primary education curricular bases offer learning opportunities and contexts for students at this stage to develop their awareness, knowledge and skills in a sustainable way. The qualitative methodology was used, specifically, the content analysis to analyze the 24 Chilean primary programs of Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences under the cognitive domain of "Education for sustainable development" (ESD) and in terms of their learning objectives with the sustainability development goals (SDGs). The results show that an interdisciplinary stochastic education in the context of the curricular learning of Social Sciences and Natural Sciences provides learning opportunities to develop ESD at the different levels that make up primary education. It is observed that the Natural Sciences and Social Sciences curricula at all levels of primary education lead to ESD are being developed in an interdisciplinary manner (with these two subjects and stochastic themes).

AB  - Due to the increasing presence of the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education paradigm in Spain, many teachers have embarked on the design of specific Teaching--Learning Sequences (TLS) to be implemented in schools. Understanding the views and perceptions about STEM that take shape in specific teachers' designs should enrich the way in which STEM education is designed based on a more focused approach. This study aims to characterise how secondary school teachers from Catalonia (Spain) design STEM TLS, to identify specific design profiles that can be related to different understandings of STEM education based on a mixed-method analytical approach. We collected 345 canvases from teachers participating in a national STEM education training programme, outlining STEM TLS. The canvases were analysed with an assessment rubric consisting of 8 instructional components (Interdisciplinarity, STEM practices, Information and Communications Technology tools, Formalisation, Openness, Alignment, Authenticity and Values). We identified patterns in teachers' designs while implementing a hierarchical cluster analysis of the results, obtaining 6 different clusters of 39, 36, 66, 49, 90, and 65 TLS, respectively. The diverse components prioritised or balanced in each cluster suggest how STEM education can be conceived of differently by participating teachers through the lens of component analysis. While authenticity appears to be a major force in the clustering process, direct relationships between components can be found (i.e., between Formalisation and Alignment), as well as inverse relationships (i.e., between Openness and Practices). These findings provide important clues to understand STEM TLS design and recognise the rubric and the cluster definition as powerful tools for teacher training and evaluation in STEM education.

AB  - This chapter compares two teachers' definitional practices in two Content-and-Language-Integrated-Learning (CLIL) lessons, i.e. physics and history, which are taught in English in Finland. It adopts Dalton-Puffer's (Eur J Appl Linguistics 1(2):216-253, 2013; Cognitive discourse functions: specifying an integrative interdisciplinary construct. In: Nikula T, Dafouz E, Moore P, Smit U (eds) Conceptualising integration in CLIL and multilingual education. Bristol: Multilingual Matters, pp. 29-54, 2016) theoretical construct of cognitive discourse functions (CDF) and showcases how it can be operationalized with empirical grounding. Multimodal conversation analysis (CA) is used to trace and observe how the teachers employ various multimodal resources in performing definitions of key concepts in classroom interaction, whereby they make the conceptual field related to the lessons' topic accessible to the students. The study has two aims. First, it describes the similarities and differences in the teachers' definitional practices and thereby contributes to our emerging understanding of what subject-specific language comprises when approached from an interactional perspective. In doing so, it also provides new insights into the relationship between content and language not only in L2, but also in L1 teaching. Second, by proposing a 'pedagogical reflection tool' that is based on the repeated and comparative practice of viewing either videos or transcripts, it illustrates methods to help raise and broaden teachers' awareness of the notion of subject-specific language and of the relevance of multimodal resources in teaching. The findings can thus serve as a stepping-stone for pre- and/or in-service teacher training, which is not meant to provide 'recipes' of how definitions ought to be done, but rather to demonstrate how locally situated, yet recognizable teachers' definitional practices are. As such, they are also transportable and adaptable to different situations across different subjects.

AB  - This paper aims to present some conceptual insights into the research paradigm of complexity that deals with such problems like sustainability, education, and, more specifically--sustainability education. The transdisciplinary perspective and cognitive approaches of a hermeneutical cycle and semantic waves used in argumentation assist in grasping the essence of complexity and the main principles of complex dynamic systems. The comparison of simple, complicated and complex systems in a field of sustainability education provides an example of using complexity thinking with social systems. Then the complexity in an epistemological context, as the research paradigm, could be used for dealing with the challenging problems of sustainability, education and sustainability education from the point of view of post-normal science. The concept of transdisciplinarity has been developed as a research framework starting from the general approaches to its application for sustainability, education and sustainability education. The specific types of collaboration in educational research for sustainability and the modes of knowledge produced by transdisciplinary research in this field will be described, ending with reflections and suggestions for further analysis.

AB  - Astronomy has great potential to attract children toward science and improve their scientific literacy. However, it has a relatively small presence within the school curricula worldwide. In Chile, home of the world's largest telescopes, astronomy is even more relevant in science education, but the presence of astronomical content within the national curriculum was not studied yet. In this context, this article characterizes the opportunities to learn astronomy within the Chilean science curriculum from grades 1 to 12. A mixed descriptive design with documental analysis is conducted to determine which science learning objectives (LOs) are directly or indirectly related to astronomy and classify them according to astronomical topics, cognitive processes, and Big Ideas in Astronomy. The proportion of LOs related to astronomy within the whole science curriculum and the categories of interest are calculated and compared over the school grades. The results show that the LOs directly related to astronomy are present only in a third of the grades and include a small variety of astronomical topics. Meanwhile, LOs indirectly related to astronomy appear in all grades and include more topics and higher cognitive processes. We discuss the implications of the outcomes and raise some possibilities to promote astronomy literacy through interdisciplinary work.

AB  - Organic molecules are invisible objects, but they can be visualized and manipulated by using molecular models. The object-based learning (OBL) approach, which is an educational tool developed for museums and collection items, is tailored and applied to a first-year bachelor course of organic chemistry. At the beginning of the course, each student is allocated a single organic molecule that they examined using a multistep interdisciplinary approach through weekly activities. The results of this innovative approach are compared with those of a traditional course and indicate that the OBL can effectively improve the performance, learning objective, and creativity of students.

AB  - STEM education is an interdisciplinary educational implementation, and can easily be designed via collaborative efforts of teachers in order to provide students with comprehensive, meaningful and unique learning experiences. For effective STEM practices, the role of teachers is very important. The teachers who are able to handle STEM education are supposed to integrate different disciplines in the teaching/learning situations in the achievement of course objectives. In this sense, awareness and intention of pre-service teachers have a very important place for their future professional implementations. In this study, pre-service teachers' awareness of and intention towards STEM education were examined. The study adopted one group pre-test post-test research design. The participants were composed of 192 pre-service teachers in the departments of Computer Education and Instructional Technology, Science Education, Elementary Mathematics Education and Turkish Language Education in a state university in central Anatolia. The results revealed that the participants who could adopt STEM education, make use of interdisciplinary activities, and who were interested in developing their interdisciplinary knowledge were more aware of STEM and had positive intention towards STEM education.

AB  - The presented research focused on developing and testing an innovative interdisciplinary STEM didactic model. The developed didactic model was introduced in the field of eco-farming. To the participants, it offers the possibility for non-formal training, which can take place anywhere and anytime. Participants require some knowledge of STEM subjects (especially chemistry and biology) as well as knowledge of ecology, technology, and engineering, in order to provide answers and solutions to environmental challenges while using knowledge of mathematics (especially combinatorics and statistics) to search for optimal solutions (in our case, a lean business plan). The model was tested in non-formal education settings, based on an interdisciplinary approach and modern technologies, such as monitoring the effectiveness of training using electroencephalography (EEG) and mobile applications. In the presented didactic model, special emphasis was placed on an interdisciplinary STEM approach to environmental protection, ecology, connatural forms of production and sustainable development. The presented research confirms the hypotheses that non-formal education is becoming an increasingly important form of education and training, and that the use of the interdisciplinary didactic model, contemporary technologies, and mobile applications, increases the time and intensity of concentration in learning and thus improves learning effectiveness.

AB  - The humanities have the potential to enhance STEM curriculum in career-oriented professional degree programs. As part of a larger college-wide initiative to develop interdisciplinary curricula, the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) awarded a grant to New York City College of Technology to explore the relationship between the humanities and career-focused degree programs in STEM departments. This article describes the design and implementation of coursework that bridges the curricular divides between humanities disciplines and technical or career-focused disciplines by bringing the humanities to bear on science and technology-oriented courses. Specifically, the humanities served to improve technical skills for students in STEM-oriented professional degree programs.

AB  - An interdisciplinary laboratory experiment was designed and carried out on the basis of the photo/electrochromism of N,N'-bis(cysteine)pyromellitic diimide (BCPD), suitable for organic chemistry laboratory I and physical chemistry laboratory II students. In the organic chemistry laboratory, students synthesized BCPD and studied its photo/electrochromic properties briefly. In the physical chemistry laboratory, students were asked to explore the photo/electrochemistry of the synthesized dimide through the use of various techniques such as UV-vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and conductometry measurements. By conducting this experiment, students not only learned the basic chemical concepts and techniques, such as photo/electrochemistry of imides, the use of reflux technique in organic synthesis, UV-vis spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry, but also perceived the interdisciplinary nature of chemistry research. Altogether, this experiment was designed to engage students in chemistry by connecting education to real-life situations, as well as indicating that their products in organic chemistry laboratory are valuable compounds.

AB  - This study examined affect during high school students' face-to-face collaborative inquiry learning in science, supported by the web-based software Virtual Baltic Sea Explorer. Self-reported affective states during the inquiry process in peer groups were related to evaluations of a group's collaboration and performance in three phases of interdisciplinary science inquiry (biology and chemistry). Results indicate that despite high cognitive demands, positive affect prevailed whereas negative affect was infrequent. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the significance of affect on collaboration and group performance. The relationship between affect, collaboration, and the groups' productive outcome revealed that self-assurance had a significant effect on collaboration and support, intertwined with scientific understanding and group performance. Furthermore, a cross-lagged analysis showed a reciprocal relation between positive affect, scientific understanding, collaboration, and support. These outcomes contribute to the scarce literature on the nature and importance of affect in the process of face-to-face computer-supported collaborative inquiry and learning in science.

AB  - The general aim of the study was to improve students' awareness of gender equality. An instructional design was developed in which mathematics, science, information technologies and software (ITS) courses were integrated, with the theme of gender equality at the center. The method of the study was determined as a case study. The participants of the study were 21 sixth-grade students at a public school in Turkey. Research data were collected using the "Views Form on Gender Equality" and "Practice Evaluation Form" developed by the researchers. According to the students' views, it was determined that an interdisciplinary education on gender equality had positive effects on improving students' awareness of gender equality. When the students' views about the practice process were examined, it was seen that the positive opinions about the process were high in number, and students presented few negative views.

AB  - Purpose: The literature review explores how multidisciplinary approaches based on critical pedagogy and participatory research can provide frameworks for equitable partnerships and genuine participation in educational design and research practices. Additionally, the essay aims to expand understandings of equitable engagement within educational research and design based on principles from critical pedagogy. Design/methodology/approach: The essay draws from diverse literature in the learning sciences, health informatics, industrial design, disability studies, ethnic studies, rehabilitation science, and to a lesser extent HCI research to understand how critical pedagogy and participatory research methods can provide useful frameworks for disabled peoples' equitable engagement and genuine participation in educational research and design. The literature reviewed in the paper concern topics such as participatory approaches to community development with disabled adults, the implementation of university-initiated community partnerships, participatory research with students and disabled people, and the importance of culturally-responsive research practices. The design literature in this review explores various arenas such as the co-design of assistive technologies with disabled children and adults and the design of curricula for students with and without disabilities. This review focuses on research practices that engender disabled peoples' participation in educational research and design, with focus on developing multidisciplinary frameworks for such research. Findings: The literature review concludes that participatory research methods and critical pedagogy provide useful frameworks for disabled peoples' participation in educational design and research practices. Critical pedagogy and participatory design allow for the genuine participation of disabled people in the research process. Social implications: Emphases on collaboration and collective knowledge-building in social transformation are present in scholarship concerning critical pedagogy, participatory research, and disability studies. However, these connections have been routinely underexplored in the literature. This paper aims to underscore these integral connections as a means to build solidarity between disabled and other marginalized people. Originality/value: The connections between participatory research methods, critical pedagogy, and disability studies have been previously underexplored. The literature review proposes a combined approach, which has the potential to radically transform multiple realms of research beyond the learning and information sciences.

AB  - This article introduces an international and interdisciplinary summer school, 'Living in the Landscape' (LiLa) in 2018. LiLa's practices focused on creating dialogue among art education, anthropology and nature science and developing culturally sustainable methods for investigating cultural heritage in the Komi Republic of Russia. The article's research interest is how dialogue and cultural heritage appear in the artistic processes, artworks and final exhibition of the summer school. These are examined through art-based action research in order to develop international, multidisciplinary and culturally sustainable art education. The four-field model utilised in the research highlights the multidimensional role of dialogue in both individual and collaborative artistic endeavours.

AB  - Purpose: This article argues that in social science teacher education general demands for teacher reflection overlap with subject-specific reflective demands. This calls for conceptual frameworks that account for an extended reflectivity, encompassing both teacher reflection and the subject-specific approach to representing controversial issues. Approach: Concepts of reflective practice and meta-reflexivity in teacher education are presented, and a discussion is provided regarding the challenges inherent in teaching social sciences as a multidisciplinary subject. Furthermore, aspects of meta-reflectivity are identified in a German teacher competence framework (PKP). To enable a broader analysis, frameworks from the field of epistemic cognition are introduced. Findings: Utilizing frameworks of epistemic cognition enables a detailed investigation of how social science teachers manage subject-specific challenges. Epistemic reflexivity offers a concept of teacher reflection that enables a new perspective on connecting theoretical reflection in pre-service teacher education programs with later reflective practice.

AB  - This article critically examines three assumptions underlying recent efforts to advance interdisciplinary research-defined in this article as communication and collaboration between researchers across academic disciplines (e.g. Sociology, Psychology, Biology)--and examines these assumptions' implications for health professions education research (HPER). These assumptions are: (1) disciplines are silos that inhibit the free flowing of knowledge across fields and stifle innovative thinking; (2) interdisciplinary research generates a better understanding of the world as it brings together researchers from various fields of expertise capable of tackling complex problems; and (3) interdisciplinary research reduces fragmentation across groups of researchers by eliminating boundaries. These assumptions are among the new beliefs shaping the contemporary academic arena; they orient academics' and university administrators' decisions toward expanding interdisciplinary research and training, but without solid empirical evidence. This article argues that the field of HPER has largely adopted the premises of interdisciplinary research but has not yet debated the potential effects of organizing around these premises. The authors hope to inspire members of the HPER community to critically examine the ubiquitous discourse promoting interdisciplinarity, and engage in reflection about the future of the field informed by evidence rather than by unsubstantiated assumptions. For example: Should research centres and graduate programs in HPER encourage the development of interdisciplinary or disciplinary-trained researchers? Should training predominantly focus on methods and methodologies or draw more on disciplinary-based knowledge? What is the best route toward increasing the field's profile within academia and attracting the best students and researchers to engage in HPER? These are questions that merit attention at the current juncture as the future of the HPER field relies on decisions made in the present time.

AB  - A major curriculum redesign effort at the University of Maryland is infusing all levels of our undergraduate biological sciences curriculum with increased emphasis on interdisciplinary connections and quantitative approaches. The curriculum development efforts have largely been guided by recommendations in the National Research Council's "Bio 2010" report and have resulted in revisions to courses in biology, mathematics, and physics over a period of 10 years. Important components of this effort included (1) developing online modules to infuse more mathematical content into six biology courses taken by biological sciences majors during their first 2 years of study; (2) strengthening the interdisciplinary connections of ancillary courses in mathematics and physics to support the development of quantitative skills in biological contexts; and (3) creating more quantitatively intensive courses for the final 2 years of the bachelors of science programme. These efforts, carried out by a large, multidisciplinary team of faculty, have resulted in increased coherence in the undergraduate biological sciences curriculum, increased quantitative skills in first- and second-year students, and a greater appreciation among graduates for the essential relationship between mathematics and modern biology.

AB  - Interdisciplinary teaching by teams of diverse faculty is highly effective in providing students with intellectual tools for creating innovative solutions to 21st century problems. This article examines the effective practices for interdisciplinary teaching used by a five-membered, disciplinarily diverse faculty team with expertise in chemistry, design, education, and business/psychology. The team found convergence, reaching a common understanding of information through discussion, to be more important, and difficult, than conveyance, sharing new information. The influence of convergence and conveyance on the faculty team impacted their team dynamic and their content delivery, encouraging similar characteristics from their students. A collaborative case study approach, augmented with interviews and meeting notes, provide the qualitative data from which best practices for fostering an effective interdisciplinary faculty team in higher education are identified. The findings reveal the importance of, and processes for, balancing individual and team priorities within the broad areas of convergence and conveyance: recognizing intrinsic rewards, maintaining a shared focus, developing a team mindset, translating ideas across disciplines, and proactively working on good team practices. The article addresses the dearth of research on the effective practices of interdisciplinary teams in higher education concluding with practical examples and strategies for high performing faculty teams.

AB  - Cyberbiosecurity is an emerging field at the convergence of life sciences and the digital world. As technological advances improve operational processes and expose them to vulnerabilities in agriculture and life sciences, cyberbiosecurity has become increasingly important for addressing contemporary concerns. Unfortunately, at this time, educational opportunities for cyberbiosecurity workforce preparation are limited. Stakeholders' perceptions may help guide cyberbiosecurity workforce preparation efforts and bridge the gap from the classroom to the field. Toward this end, we identified stakeholders in education, private industry, and state agencies in Virginia and sought their input through both an online survey and focus groups. Findings suggest limited awareness and understanding of cyberbiosecurity. Results indicate that both formal and non-formal learning components--including short modules and comprehensive standalone courses--are important for cyberbiosecurity education programming. Stakeholders tied potential success of education programming to systems thinking and collaborative designs. Moreover, results reveal insights into concerns at the convergence of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT), which is central to effective workforce preparation for today's agriculture and life sciences professionals. Continuous interdisciplinary collaboration and academiaindustry partnerships will be critical for developing robust cyberbiosecurity education and securing the future of agriculture.

AB  - Employers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields report that recent graduates are deficient in important skills such as collaboration and professional writing. Scientific societies and science educators have responded to the gap between student skills and employer expectations by recommending that undergraduate STEM curricula focus on cross-disciplinary, workplace-related skills in addition to discipline-specific skills and content knowledge. This study examined the disciplinary cultures in which STEM faculty teach and STEM students learn. We developed and validated the Survey of Teaching Beliefs and Practices for Undergraduates (STEP-U), which assesses the extent to which students value specific cross-disciplinary skills, as well as their experiences with teaching practices thought to reinforce such skills. We surveyed > 2000 students majoring in biological sciences, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and computer science. We interviewed five students from each discipline to supplement survey data. Next, we surveyed faculty members (N = 147) within these disciplines regarding the extent to which they valued the same cross-disciplinary skills and how this influenced their teaching practices. Student values differed according to academic discipline, classroom experiences, and individual characteristics, such as prior research experience. We offer a conceptual framework by which the relationship between faculty values, faculty teaching practices, and student values can be studied. Specifically, it predicts that faculty values are embodied in their teaching practices, and student values are shaped by their classroom experiences, leading to transmission of disciplinary values from faculty to students. Future studies should examine these relationships across different disciplines and institution types.
