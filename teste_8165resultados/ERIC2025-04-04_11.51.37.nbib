AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold: to identify and map contemporary research on advanced technology implementations for problem-solving purposes in the manufacturing industry, and to further understand the organizational learning possibilities of advanced technology problem-solving in the manufacturing industry. Design/methodology/approach: This paper outlines a scoping review of contemporary research on the subject. The findings of the review are discussed in the light of theories of contradicting learning logics. Findings: This paper shows that contemporary research on the subject is characterized by technological determinism and strong solution-focus. A discussion on the manufacturing industries' contextual reasons for this in relation to contradicting learning logics shows that a Mode-2 problem-solving approach could facilitate further learning and expand knowledge on advanced technology problem-solving in the manufacturing industry. A research agenda with six propositions is provided. Originality/value: The introduction of advanced technology implies complex effects on the manufacturing industry in general, while previous research shows a clear focus on technological aspects of this transformation. This paper provides value by providing novel knowledge on the relationship between advanced technology, problem-solving and organizational learning in the manufacturing industry.

AB  - Research in second language acquisition has shown that adjusting classroom discussions, textbook reading, and written activities to the language proficiencies of second language learners triggers second language acquisition in subject matter classrooms. Second language researchers find that subject matter teachers should systematically teach discipline-specific language, pay attention to the functional use of language in classroom discussions, and use writing as a learning tool to promote language development. Subject matter teachers should also identify the language that students specifically need to know, including the language structures and essential vocabulary that a teaching unit requires, and integrate these topics into daily instruction. The author shows how two high school biology teachers and a high school social studies teacher effectively taught subject matter by integrating language and content. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - This paper considers how the idea of "discipline" can best be conceptualised, both in general and particular terms. Much previous research has employed a strong essentialist approach, a model of disciplines which exaggerates the homogeneity of specific disciplinary features and accords disciplines generative powers which they rarely possess. That approach is disabling because it closes down the appreciation of the heterogeneity within disciplines, as well as occluding the reasons for that heterogeneity. However, for researchers this over simplified model offers the attractions of simple research questions and research designs. The consequence of using such a model is, though, that its distortions threaten the robustness of higher education research. The paper argues for a more sophisticated conceptualisation of disciplines, one which deploys a moderate form of essentialism. It applies Wittgenstein's notion of family resemblances to the task of depicting disciplines and explores the implications for research of this more nuanced model.

AB  - The NSF-funded Integrating Data Analysis (IDA) Project undertaken by the American Sociological Association (ASA) and the Social Science Data Analysis Network sought to close the quantitative literacy gap for sociology majors. Working with twelve departments, the project built on lessons learned from ASA's Minority Opportunities through School Transformation (MOST) Program, where curricular change was a departmental (not individual faculty) agenda. A critical mass of faculty in each IDA department developed and used quantitative modules in lower division courses. This article reports on the steps to develop departmental curricular change and the important results for student learning and future professional success. (Contains 4 tables and 3 footnotes.)

AB  - This study aims to reveal the effect of examining photos/documents in museums with traditional and STEM approach on students' success in history lesson, interest, attitude, national value and historical awareness. A control group pretestposttest trial model, which is one of the quantitative research methods, was used in the research. The study group of the research is 2nd year secondary school students. The study was carried out with a total of 60 students, 30 students in the experimental group and 30 students in the control group. The application of the study was carried out in a secondary school and museums in Almaty (Kazakhstan). In the research, four different measurement tools were applied to determine the effect of museum visit and STEM approach, which are independent variables, on students' success in history lesson, attitude, interest and national value and consciousness level. Whether there is a difference between the achievement, attitude, interest, national values and consciousness levels of the experimental and control groups was analyzed with the "Independent t test". According to the findings obtained from the research, it was determined that the museum tour and STEM application studies were more effective in increasing the success, attitudes and interests of the students in the history lesson than the classical narrative-based tour in the museum with the control group. It was observed that both methods were effective in students' national values and historical awareness.

AB  - There is a growing momentum in academia for liberal arts departments to become involved with schools of education in the preparation of teachers and efforts to improve schools.  A major difficulty comes from the stereotypical view that each group has of the other. For example, liberal arts professors accuse education faculty of ignoring content and focusing on ideas like critical thinking and hands-on learning. So long as each group maintains a rigid perception of the other?s view and fails to see that process and facts are not separate domains but rather exist in mutual support, difficulties in collaboration will prevail. This drive has been accelerated by reports indicating substandard performance by students in all areas but particularly in mathematics and science. It is reinforced when we find that school systems lack full complements of certified teachers in these areas. There is general agreement that cooperation between the different academic communities would be helpful. However, if such efforts are to be productive, universities implementing such partnerships should be aware of the problems that will inevitably occur. Despite predictable problems, cooperation and collaboration between liberal arts departments and schools of education can result in  great benefit to schools.

AB  - While X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) is a fundamental analytical technique used by solid-state laboratories across a breadth of disciplines, it is still underrepresented in most undergraduate curricula. In this work, we incorporate XRPD analysis into an inquiry-based project that requires students to identify the crystalline component(s) of familiar household products. Centering the project on materials which students encounter in their everyday lives helps to demystify the technique, making it accessible to everyone with a basic understanding of crystallinity and unit cells. In an XRPD study, each crystalline component generates a unique set of peaks in the diffractogram. Comparing the collected diffractogram to a library of diffractograms for known crystalline materials allows students to identify the crystalline components in their unknown. Students must determine for themselves the chemical compositions of the possible unknowns, and link their findings back to the analysis of the collected data. Initially challenging, this is the part of the work they respond to most strongly. This lab includes a data collection component, but its inquiry-based objectives can still be achieved by providing the students with simulated diffractograms when the appropriate instrumentation is unavailable.

AB  - Students with disabilities often have difficultly applying information learned in one context to another, also called transfer. Music teachers can provide opportunities for students to transfer and make connections between classes to enhance their learning and encourage students to think differently about the content. By including nonmusic ideas, concepts, and skills, music teachers can reinforce learning for all students. This article includes suggestions for how general music teachers can include various nonmusic ideas, concepts, and skills in music instruction as well as specific ideas for inclusive music classrooms with students with disabilities.

AB  - The present article offers comments on the infusion of methodologies, approaches, reasoning strategies, and findings from the fields of genetics and genomics into studies of complex human behaviors (hereafter, complex phenotypes). Specifically, I discuss issues of generality and specificity, causality, and replicability as they pertain to molecular genetic studies of human phenotypes. These issues are illustrated with findings from genetic linkage and association studies investigating the etiology of disorders of spoken and written language--an area of inquiry that has been consistently referenced as one of the most successful in terms of its progress in understanding the genetic bases of human behaviors. I complete this discussion with comments on how the stronger presence of genetics and genomics in psychology is changing the conceptualization and investigation of research questions and affecting the next generation of interdisciplinary research.

AB  - This paper describes a pedagogical technique employed for an interdisciplinary course on Cold War America. Students had to "become" a fictional person and discuss how political and social changes during the Cold War era would have impacted that person. By doing a semester-long project that required primary source research, this "quasi-experiential" technique helped students gain a greater appreciation for Cold War culture and a more thorough understanding of the major political events of the era.

AB  - Educating social work students to address behavioral health needs of youth requires new training approaches that prepare students for interprofessional prevention-focused practice. This study examines whether a newly developed graduate certificate in integrated behavioral health effectively prepares students for prevention-focused behavioral health practice. A mixed method approach is used for evaluation, with 34 students completing the program from 2016 to 2017. Quantitative, qualitative, and employment data are analyzed to identify if and how the program prepares graduates for prevention practice. Results highlight key components that support student attainment of program competencies. Implications for curriculum development, field site training, and future research are discussed.

AB  - One of the greatest goals of the 21st century is the acquisition of high-level skills through the STEM course designs to provide skill-assisted transformation in learning processes. The purpose of this research; The aim of this course is to examine the views of teachers about STEM course designs supported by traditional Turkish games adapted to primary school social studies course. Each teacher who participated in the research was able to videotape all his practices and fill out the observation forms. Through the obtained data, it was shared with the teachers whether the achievements of the course were realized or not. After these practices, the opinions of the teachers towards the research were obtained through a semi-structured interview form. Descriptive analysis technique was applied on the collected data. According to the findings obtained at the end of the study, it was stated by the participants that their students developed a significant sense in cognitive, affective and psychomotor aspects.

AB  - The main purpose of vocabulary instruction is to enhance and support reading comprehension. This goal spans across the grade levels and different disciplines and is supported by a plethora of research. In recent years, a great deal of needed attention has been finally given to academic vocabulary and disciplinary literacy. To contribute to this body of knowledge, we believe it is critical to examine how the complex relationship between vocabulary and comprehension may be addressed in secondary content area classrooms, given the unique nature of the academic vocabulary students encounter daily in school. This conceptual paper contains the following: (1) definition of academic vocabulary; (2) description of what is known about the vocabulary-comprehension relationship; (3) conceptualization of the intersection of academic vocabulary and the vocabulary-comprehension relationship; and (4) instructional implications emerging from this intersection. Perhaps this conceptualization may provide disciplinary practitioners more insight to help them make decisions regarding vocabulary instruction.

AB  - This article discusses "Family Secrets," a problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum module that focuses on the bioethical implications of genetic testing. In high school biology classrooms throughout New York State, students are using "Family Secrets" to learn about DNA testing; Huntington's disease (HD); and the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of genetic testing. Moreover, this article also discusses a five-part progressive disclosure PBL that includes: a family disease; the dilemma; a difficult choice; testing for the HD gene; and making decisions. Furthermore, some teachers reported that the module inspired them to create additional PBLs on topics such as ecology, evolution, and genetic engineering. Virtually all teachers stated that they would continue to use "Family Secrets" in the future and that it has indeed become a valuable addition to their genetics curricula. (Contains 3 figures.)

The authors illuminate course etiquette and a critical thinking model that incorporates SoTL into the ongoing fabric of the classroom. In addition, discussion centers on utilizing SoTL to satisfy colleagues concerned about "loss of content" in process oriented courses, and how to engage students in an ongoing, ever-changing, dialogue that can lead them to accept a more inclusive world view.

AB  - In this article, we assess the state of museum studies, with special attention to programs in the United States. After briefly reviewing the historical trajectory of museum studies, we define this field of study and determine that it should more accurately be called museology. To investigate the most critical issues in current museological pedagogy, we then address museology's current status and, finally, its future through select critical issues in the field: museological thinking, the meaning of "museum professional," museology as an academic discipline, and museological curricula.

AB  - In a recent project involving two midwestern high schools, vocational and academic teachers participated in a project promoting interaction and mutual reinforcement. Innovative matches were found in agriculture and biology exchange classes, a technology outreach program, a study of world protein distribution, and a furniture marketing project. The twin curricular areas remain but are more conversant. (MLH)

AB  - STEM integration holds significant promise for supporting students in making connections among ideas and ways of thinking that might otherwise remain "siloed." Nevertheless, activities that integrate disciplines can present challenges to learners. In particular, they can require students to shift epistemological framing, demands that can be overlooked by designers and facilitators. We analyze how students in an 8th grade mathematics classroom reasoned about circles, across math and coding activities. One student showed evidence of shifting fluently between different frames as facilitators had expected. The dramatic change in his contributions gauge the demands of the activities, as do the contributions of other students, who appeared to work within different frames. Our findings have relevance for the design and facilitation of integrated STEM learning environments to support students in navigating such frame-shifts.

AB  - Evidence is widely recognized as an essential component of argumentation. Existing research has primarily focused on students' use of evidence to construct explanations or claims. In the present study, 54 11- to 12-year-old Chinese students participated in an extended discourse-based argumentation curriculum, along with an equivalent nonparticipating control group consisted of 50 students. We identified and traced progression in students' meta-talk about evidence during peer-to-peer argumentive discourse and found that meta-talk grew more frequent over time, became increasingly focused on evaluating the source of evidence, and became better sustained over successive turns. Separate pre- and postassessments suggested that participants had become more advanced in epistemological understanding, manifested in a shift away from absolutist thinking, and were more likely to endorse the values of argumentive discourse. Implications for epistemic vigilance in the Information Age are discussed.

AB  - There is a consensus that numeracy is important for students to develop logical thinking and reasoning strategies in their everyday activities. As a result, teachers are encouraged to design numeracy rich tasks that incorporate real-life contexts across non-mathematics curriculum areas. However, it is not clear what types of knowledge teachers require to design such tasks. In this study, the authors used the stepwise generalization method and developed a framework for the knowledge required by teachers to design numeracy rich tasks across non-mathematics curriculum areas. The study begins with a brief introduction to numeracy and its definition in various contexts. The nature of knowledge required to design numeracy rich tasks (mathematics content knowledge, a non-mathematics curriculum area knowledge, activity design skills and knowledge of context)) are further described. In the later section of the study, each element of teacher knowledge and the framework to design numeracy rich tasks across non-mathematics curriculum areas are described. The knowledge framework developed in this study can be used to analyze teachers designed numeracy-rich tasks and identify their professional learning requirements.

AB  - This paper utilizes Bourdieu's conceptual frame to examine the mediatized effects of policy processes concerned with the growth and support of knowledge industries in Australia. These policies span education, science, research and other knowledge industries (such as venture capital firms and intellectual property law). The paper argues that some policy processes are best represented as temporary social fields. The nature of these fields can be described by the kinds of cross-field effects that they produce. A case study of an Australian knowledge economy policy, "The chance to change", and associated policy processes demonstrates the broad analytic capacities of Bourdieu's conceptual frame for policy analysis, when combined with the concepts of cross-field effects and temporary social field developed here.

AB  - A simple multidisciplinary and inexpensive laboratory exercise is proposed, in which the undergraduate student may correlate biochemical and anatomical findings. The entire practical session can be completed in one 2.5-3 hour laboratory period, and consists of the quantification of collagen and total protein content from tissue sections--without previous homogenisation--by a colorimetric assay, and a staining method for in situ collagen detection carried out on the same tissue samples using the same chemicals. Because collagen accumulation is a common characteristic of hepatic diseases such as fibrosis and cirrhosis, the experiment may also serve as the basis for discussing the importance of collagen detection and quantification in estimating the degree of fibrosis from subjects with liver disease.

AB  - Purpose--To present the challenge of sustainable development, the way in which technology can address that challenge and the task of engineering education to train engineers for it. Design/methodology/approach--The paper describes briefly the history of the environmental and sustainability discourse in The Netherlands, as a densely populated country. It argues that technology should play a major role in SD, but that technological innovation is not enough. Technological systems renewal is a transdisciplinary activity involving relevant stakeholders and disciplines. "Needs" is the basic starting-point to innovate new systems of provision. The paper reviews relevant literature regarding future orientation of technology development. Based on it, goals for training of engineers are developed. Findings--The engineer has to meet a threefold challenge: providing new creative approaches on the one hand, and setting up and executing R&D programs that produce results, on the other; cooperating with other disciplines and lay stakeholders, on the one hand, and guarding disciplinary quality, on the other; bridging moralism and strategic pragmatism. Research limitations/implications--The paper is an introduction, i.e. it sketches the issues without dealing with them in detail. Practical implications--The paper draws in broad lines a road-map for the future of engineering education and sustainable development. The paper is a useful source for those engineering institutions that are formulating a strategy to introduce sustainable development. Originality/value--The paper goes beyond environmental engineering, not by just adding social and economic issues, but by developing an integrated framework for academic training of engineers.

AB  - Multiclause sentences with the temporal adverbs "while" or "when" referring to simultaneous events (e.g., "While [when] John was writing a letter, Mary comes into the room") were compared in German and Spanish. Following Talmy (2001), we assumed that the event in the main clause is the figure (F; the event to be located in time), and the event in the adverbial clause is the ground (G; the event used as temporal reference). Germans judged as more acceptable the "while" ("wahrend") sentences with the longer duration event as G (e.g., writing a letter) and the shorter duration event as F (e.g., coming into the room) than vice versa. However, they judged "when" ("als") sentences quite acceptable in both duration conditions, suggesting that this adverb is temporally less constrained than "while." Spaniards produced a similar, although less conspicuous, pattern. We discuss the results in terms of the temporal metrics that underlie F-G relations in adverbial sentences, as well as crosslinguistic differences between Spanish and German.

AB  - In 2004, a group of engineering and education faculty at Virginia Tech received a major curriculum reform and engineering education research grant under the department-level reform (DLR) program of the NSF. This DLR project laid the foundation of sponsored research in engineering education in the Department of Engineering Education. The DLR investigators adopted a spiral curriculum approach to reformulate curricula in general engineering (also called freshman engineering) and bioprocess engineering programs. The spiral curriculum concept recognizes the inherently recursive nature of learning. During this recursive process, students elaborate and strengthen earlier learning, correct misconceptions, develop a more holistic picture of their discipline, and become increasingly self-sufficient as learners. This paper documents the step-wise process that we developed and implemented to rewrite the bioprocess engineering curriculum using spiral theory. Specific examples of learning modules from bioprocess and general engineering are discussed. Assessment approaches and results are presented to highlight the usefulness of such efforts. Adaptation of our spiral curriculum efforts by faculty in other engineering programs to develop a nanotechnology option and ethics spirals is described. We describe lessons learned in three key words: (i) "Patience"--Reformulation results may take time to show up, (ii) "Diligence"--Assessment results are powerful, take these seriously, and (iii) "Awareness"--Students' perceptions may be difficult to interpret. Finally, we discuss the challenges encountered in our unique curriculum reform and engineering education research project and also include a few funding related recommendations for the NSF.

AB  - The ill-structured nature of design problems makes them particularly challenging for problem-based learning. Studio-based learning (SBL), however, has much in common with problem-based learning and indeed has a long history of use in teaching students to solve design problems. The purpose of this ethnographic study of an industrial design class, an architecture class, and three human-computer-interaction classes was to develop a crossdisciplinary understanding of the goals and expectations for students in a SBL environment and the ways in which experienced facilitators assist students in solving complex design problems. The expectations that students are to iteratively generate and refine design solutions, communicate effectively, and collaborate with others establishes the studio as a dynamic place where students learn to experiment on their own, to teach and to use all studio members as resources in that search. Instructors support students as they grapple with complexity of design problem-solving through pedagogical practices that include assignments, associated meta-discussions, explicit prompts, reminders, modeling, and coaching. Using sample illustrations from our cross-case analysis, we present the studio method as a legitimate constituent of problem-based learning methods.

AB  - The present analysis revisits the economics of inattention and the resulting commoditization and creation of privileged goods. These act as a significant force that pushes human history toward a future that will be less livable and sustainable. The analysis traces the roots of these developments to the reorganization of human knowing and doing by putting them on a discipline-based footing. It is part of a larger analysis that shows the need to create a different kind of scientific and technical specialization that rebalances breadth with depth, and the accompanying university reforms that will be required.

AB  - Instead of a science fair, the author's intermediate school holds an invention convention. Guided by an Inventor's Log, students must problem solve, think creatively, and budget their time and resources to brainstorm and build an invention. The inventions are built at home, with parental support and supervision. Then, when everyone is ready, the inventors present their work to the class. The entire community is invited to view them during an Invention Gallery Walk held one morning at school. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - This exploratory study examined communications between designers and child development professionals during the preschool design process. Qualitative interviews and focus groups were conducted to investigate the need for communication support between child development professionals, parents, and design professionals (n = 20) during the process of designing preschool facilities. Participants had an interest in successful children's spaces and had been involved in the design and construction of new preschool facilities within the 2 years prior to the study. Data collected indicated a discrepancy in the perceptions of communication levels between participant groups and a desire to improve interdisciplinary communication. Recommendations are made to support the communication process during preschool design phases.

AB  - Faced with globalizing forces that promote universal approaches to knowledge and understanding, indigenous peoples have reacted by abandoning the old ways or alternately seeking to re-discover ancient wisdoms as foundations for pathways to the future. Increasingly, however, a third way has been to focus on the interface between indigenous knowledge and other knowledge systems, such as science, to generate new insights, built from two systems. The interface approach recognizes the distinctiveness of different knowledge systems, but sees opportunities for employing aspects of both so that dual benefits can be realized and indigenous worldviews can be matched with contemporary realities.

AB  - This article seeks to contribute to the evolving literature on the scholarship of teaching and learning. We do this by describing and then reflecting on what we have learned from a year-long freshman applied research seminar, "International Affairs Knowledge and U.S. Foreign Policy Opinions." After surveying the literature on public opinion and U.S. foreign policy and materials on survey research and design, the students devised, pretested, administered (to 1300+ undergraduates), analyzed a survey and presented their findings. To do this, we had to provide them, in an abbreviated time frame, survey design, basic statistics as well as statistical software and work with them on how to summarize and present their findings. Their paper (Arbitter et al., 2010), in which some of their findings from the survey accord with the preexisting literature and much of it go beyond that, is one way of assessing our course. But, in this article, we discuss the ways such a course can meet many of the challenges held out to us as educators by such bodies as the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U), especially if those following this path take advantage of the lessons we have learned.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to present an interdisciplinary project, developed as a collaborative effort by the authors, involving the design of a telescope mirror as it was given to second semester calculus students. The goals of the project are to provide an applied setting for the topics typically covered in this type of course including the following: definite integration, partial fractions, volumes by cylindrical shells, applications of integrals, differentials, first order differential questions, separation of variables, and work. Additionally it motivates and uses the following topics that are not typical of a second semester calculus course: kinetic energy, angular velocity, vector addition, Stephan's Law of Cooling, and mathematical modeling, thereby serving as a springboard for future work in applied mathematics. Students working in groups of three were given two weeks to complete the project. Solutions and instructor notes follow the presentation of the project. (Contains 8 figures.)

AB  - Using a 30-item multiple-choice type test, this investigation focused on the ability of college students to recognise terms and concepts used by librarians. A total of 447 respondents representing the fields of Education, Nutrition, Food Technology, Tourism and Hotel and Restaurant Management took part in this investigation. Data were gathered through "robotfotos" and an inventory of commonly used library jargon, duly identified and validated by academic librarians in one of the biggest multi-disciplinary universities in the Philippines. Data were treated in depth through percentage, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), t-test and Spearman's rank correlation. The results showed that respondents' ability to recognise library terms and concepts posted the highest and lowest ratings of 84 percent and 33 percent, respectively. Further, gender and type of catalogue used (OPAC vs. card catalogue) were found to have a significant relationship with their ability to recognise library terms and concepts. Finally, a moderate positive correlation (rho = 0.58) existed between the respondents' recognition ability and the librarians' ranking of frequently asked questions and terms used by the former.

AB  - This article centers sociocultural and sociopolitical considerations of how young people understand, represent, and use data by presenting findings from a social design research study about how students in a public urban high school authored "data stories" using personal data they curated, collected, and visualized. The study contributes to theoretical understandings of critical data literacies by considering the experiences and practices of adolescents enrolled in a required media arts class as they produced data visualizations drawn from their everyday lives. Findings center on two aspects of critical data literacies youth developed--understanding themselves as people capable of using data for multiple purposes and understanding data as socially situated resources for meaning-making. This study foregrounds the importance of positioning youth as authors and architects of data, making central youth perspectives in understanding the role of data in young people's digitally connected lives and highlighting the importance of expanding what "counts" as data. It also suggests the importance of creating infrastructure to support the development of culturally relevant data practices that highlight the social, cultural, and political uses of data and its racialized dimensions.

AB  - The Graduate Partnerships Program (GPP), established in 2000, links universities with National Institutes of Health (NIH) laboratories for predoctoral training. Several partnerships required that students create collaborative dissertations between at least one NIH and one university research mentor. More than 60 students have entered into these co-mentored research collaborations, and many others established them even though not required. Much was learned about the experiences of these and other GPP students by using structured interviews as part of a formal self-study of the GPP in 2005. Complications of trying to work with two mentors are managed through careful program design and mentor selection. In the collaborative model, students develop a complex set of scientific and interpersonal skills. They lead their own independent research projects, drawing on the expertise of multiple mentors and acquiring skills at negotiating everyone's interests. They develop high levels of independence, maturity, flexibility, and the ability to see research questions from different perspectives. No evidence was found that co-mentoring diminishes the normally expected accomplishments of a student during the Ph.D. Multi-mentored dissertations require skills not all graduate students may possess this early in training, but for those who do, they can promote rapid and extensive development of skills needed for collaborative, interdisciplinary research.

AB  - In recent years, a number of analyses assessments used in different countries have appeared. Analyses emerging from international comparisons such as Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) have focused on what might be termed "cross-sectional" comparisons; examining the differences between the assessments in different national systems for students of the same age. Other studies have focused on the study of systems of assessments within a single country, looking at the articulation between the various assessments taken by students at the same ages (another form of cross-sectional analysis within a single system), and by the sequence of assessments taken by an individual over the course of their schooling (a longitudinal focus within a single system). The purpose of this paper is to try to combine both approaches, through the comparison of assessment   "systems". The authors' aim is to look at the differences in assessment systems in different countries in order to try to identify the critical design issues. In this context, design issues are not just the features that are designed into the system by its architects. Design issues also include those features of the system that emerge unplanned, but might have panned out differently if different decisions had been taken in the development of the system (good examples of this latter category are the issue of the rate of increase of spread of attainment in the cohort over time, or sex differences in performance).

AB  - This paper presents research on how children aged 5-11 can create stories through computer programming (coding). A novel 'Story-Writing-Coding' engine is introduced where children realise their imagined stories through code that results in animations representing their stories. Analysis of how they manipulated code to represent story meaning is presented, together with a hypothetical model of the strategies they used in composition. Using the context of multimodal literacy, it is argued that coding can be thought of as a form of literacy and that taking this perspective may lead to benefits for children as both literacy learners and also learners of computer programming. While the authors have worked with 103 children, the results presented in this paper are drawn from an in-depth analysis of 20 stories with associated code together with observations by the authors. It was found that children are able to manipulate code creatively to obtain meaningful stories and successfully use the modes of print, static and moving images.

AB  - Black, Wilson, and Yao (this issue) commendably attempt to put descriptive theory at the center of pedagogy, assessment, and curriculum. The thrust of their article is that only through theories of learning will student progression be properly understood. Casting a critical eye over the faddish distinction between "formative" and "summative" assessment, they note there is no real substantive difference between them. Recognizing the need for something more solid than the mere labels of "formative" and "summative," Black et al. proposed that both uses of assessment be "based on a common "road map" that can serve as a "backbone" for a learning progression, and that both have been built to be consistent and supportive of that road map." That is, explicit theory as to what is being learned (curriculum) and how (pedagogy) should drive assessment. In particular, the curriculum "reflects and provides a strong model of progression in learning. This "road map" may then inform both pedagogy and the assessments." Black et al. present the atomic theory of matter as an example road map. From a thorough review of students' misconceptions of changes in the state of matter, they deduce yet another road map. Both "road maps" are descriptive theories of how students progress in their understanding of the atomic theory of matter. The striking thing about them is that they imply that student progression is not measurable. In this article, the author commends Black et al. for developing a descriptive theory of learning and attempting to use it as the basis for assessment. This kind of thinking should be encouraged in education and psychometrics generally. Unfortunately, the author contends that despite their critical attitudes, they wavered in the face of the quantitative imperative and attempted the scientifically impossible: the measurement of a partial order.

AB  - An extremely simple, inexpensive, and safe method is presented, which emulates nucleic acids isolation and electrophoretic analysis as performed in a research environment, in the context of a secondary school hands-on activity. The protocol is amenable to an interdisciplinary approach, taking into consideration the electrical and chemical parameters of the electrophoretic system. Furthermore, the laboratory is framed in a more comprehensive pedagogical setting, which addresses the methodological aspects of a pivotal scientific enterprise such as the Human Genome Project. In this setting, the hands-on activity is complemented with animations, paper models, and discussions. Additionally, our results indicate that the use of borate buffer and agar-agar gels suits many of the experiments included in college-level laboratory activities, which currently make use of more expensive agarose gels and TBE or TAE buffers.

AB  - In the digital age, instructional designers must possess both a sound instructional design knowledge base and solid project management skills that will enable them to complete courseware projects on time, on budget and in conformance with client expectations. Project management skills include the ability to apply repeatable processes, along with interpersonal skills such as communication and leadership skills. However, courses in project management are often absent from the higher education instructional design curriculum, creating a gap between what is learned in instructional design programmes and real-world practice. In this paper, the author draws on the education and project management fields to examine this gap. The author argues that the gap between instructional design project management models and how instructional design practitioners view project management is a consequence of the divergent perspectives of higher education subcultures and the extent to which those subcultures are likely to embrace cross-disciplinary subjects such as project management. The author proposes some research and advocacy opportunities for closing the gap between instructional design education and practice.

AB  - The overall aim of this article is to analyze the relationships between the roles of assessment in pedagogy, the interactions between curriculum assessment and pedagogy, and the study of pupils' progression in learning. It is argued that well-grounded evidence of pupils' progressions in learning is crucial to the work of teachers, so that a method is needed which will enable the production of such evidence in relation to the learning strategy of any teacher. The argument starts by proposing a rationale for understanding the central roles of assessments in pedagogy and in particular the relationships between their use for formative and summative purposes. This is then related to a more general discussion of the links between curriculum, assessment and pedagogy which serves to highlight the importance of models of progression. The next step is to consider how assessment evidence of pupils' learning can be analyzed in two ways: By ordering the respondents in terms of overall scores, and by ordering individual items in terms of their difficulty. A method of relating these two in the BEAR assessment system is then explained. This method is then illustrated by a general review of the literature on the study of the atomic-molecular model, leading to detailed consideration of progression in the understanding of melting and evaporation. Results obtained, from a test of eleven items about these two topics, attempted by 665 grade 8 pupils in 11 schools in San Francisco, are then used to illustrate the method of analysis and the nature of the results that it can produce. A final section considers the educational and assessment issues about learning progressions, pedagogy and assessment that we see as being informed by the ideas and practices outlined in the article.

AB  - In this article, the authors describe the Georgetown University Consortium Project (GCP), a three-year assessment study designed to document the learning abroad of students from Georgetown University, The University of Minnesota, Rice University, and Dickinson College. Funded by two Department of Education Title VI grants, this ongoing three-year study seeks evidence of student learning at fifty programs abroad, many of them organized by the four consortial institutions, and others by study abroad providers, including programs operated by the Council on International Education, the International Institute for the Education of Students, and the American University Center of Provence. The study seeks evidence of student learning from, and across, three learning domains: oral second-language acquisition, gains in intercultural sensitivity, and learning within four broad disciplinary contexts. The study, through its development of an interview guide that asks returned students to respond to three hypothetical scenarios, also seeks to provide evidence of learning, beyond oral language acquisition and gains in intercultural sensitivity, that will appeal to faculty from three broad disciplinary areas whose students have traditionally been under-represented in study abroad: (1) business; (2) engineering; and (3) the sciences. This report was written at the half-way mark of the study--a year and a half into it--and presents evaluative reflections on the progress and process of the GCP to date. (Contains 7 notes.)
