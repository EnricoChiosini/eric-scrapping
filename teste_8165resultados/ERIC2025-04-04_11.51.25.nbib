AB  - Environmental problems are generally complex and blind to disciplinary boundaries. Efforts to devise long-term solutions require collaborative research that integrates knowledge across historically disparate fields, yet the traditional model for training new scientists emphasizes personal independence and disciplinary focus. Growing awareness of the limitations of the traditional model has spurred a reexamination of graduate training in the environmental sciences. Many institutions are implementing novel training approaches, with varying degrees of success. In this article, a group of current and former doctoral students evaluates our collective experience in one such program, the Biogeochemistry and Environmental Biocomplexity Program at Cornell University, funded by an Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship grant from the National Science Foundation. We identify aspects of the program that contributed to our integrative research training experience, and discuss stumbling blocks that may arise in such programs. We conclude with recommendations for students and faculty interested in facilitating cross-disciplinary interactions at their home institutions.

AB  - With the advancement of specialized middle schools and high schools focusing on the arts, communication, engineering, mathematics, and science, many students who attend traditional schools miss out on valuable learning opportunities--in particular, when it comes to learning mathematics. Mathematics classrooms can be filled with real-world applications and concepts for all learners, regardless of the school environment. When teachers present middle school students with problems grounded in engineering principles, students will become active learners and will view mathematics as stimulating and useful. They will also learn that through mathematics, they can be innovative. The authors present an engineering project called "Paper Table," an investigation into building a sturdy table out of newspaper and cardboard. Engineering design projects provide an environment in which students can be active, inquisitive, and creative. Producing a paper table can lead to explorations of geometry and measurement. Concepts learned include (1) drawing and constructing polygons; (2) using a protractor to measure and draw specific angles in a polygon; (3) finding the areas of polygons; and (4) finding the surface area of three-dimensional figures. The "Paper Table" project challenges students to build a strong table that is 8 inches tall using newspaper, masking tape, and cardboard. The design requirements specify that the table must be sturdy enough to hold a heavy book. From a mathematical point of view, the "Paper Table" project revolves around properties of polygons and mathematical processes and practices. After producing models, students can ponder ways to find the area of the polygons that comprise the legs of the table. The "Paper Table" project gives students a challenge that can increase their interest in mathematics and let them recognize that engineering has many ties to the math that they study and use in class. Such STEM experiences are likely to excite, stimulate, and motivate students. The authors suggest It is time to include engineering projects in the classroom to allow today's students to embark on processes that they can develop into tomorrow's leaders in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

AB  - One of the most difficult and most important engineering tasks is the integration of a robot-manipulator into material handling, assembly, and production processes, offering the possibility of supervision and control. The knowledge and skills required for these kinds of tasks are purely mechatronic and, thus, multidisciplinary. This paper describes a didactic manipulator, MRA-M01, designed and produced in a mechatronics laboratory of the Faculty of Technical Sciences Novi Sad, Republic of Serbia. This manipulator serves as part of the laboratory equipment used by students enrolled in courses in the Departments of Mechatronics and Industrial Engineering. The manipulator was created to enable students to gain practical knowledge of the integration of diverse engineering fields, including electro-pneumatics, sensors, actuators, programmable logic controllers (PLC), field bus systems, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, material handling, industrial engineering, and intelligent control systems. The manipulator MRA-M01 is a three-degrees-of-freedom manipulator, with three linear actuators. Two of those are pneumatic (one controlled in a standard way by a control valve, and the other using servo-pneumatics), and one is electromechanical (with a dc motor). This manipulator supports hands-on activities in class by assisting students in material-handling tasks, which involve them learning about the structure of the manipulator and its components. Through this learning process, students are able to evaluate the use of different methods of manipulator design. One of the most important learning gains is that of understanding manipulator implementation by working through different scenarios that simulate industrial tasks and conditions.

AB  - In his article, Paul E. Newton has conducted a review of selected perspectives on validity theory with the goal of disambiguating the definition of validity and describing a consensus definition of validity. Newton provides a nuanced discussion of the evolution of the concept of validity over the years. His Focus article has two major goals: (1) to clarify how validity is defined in the "Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing"; and (2) to propose an improved definition of validity. His major critique is that the Standards are too vague as currently written and that they have allowed researchers far too much leeway in determining validity. Newton is also concerned that a number of current researchers have returned to the simplistic conception of validity as the degree to which a test measures what it purports to measure. This commentary stresses the idea of epistemic iterations as a process for evaluating progress in defining the concept of validity. This commentary addresses the following three guiding questions: (1) What are the major aspects of a consensus definition of validity identified by Newton?; (2) What are epistemic iterations?; and (3) Can epistemic iterations illuminate and extend one's views of the concept of validity in the human sciences?

AB  - Significant involvement of students in the development and implementation of college alcohol prevention strategies is largely untested, despite recommendations by the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and others. Objective: The purpose of the Pragmatics Project was to test a student engagement model for developing and implementing alcohol intervention strategies. Participants: The Pragmatics Project involved 89 undergraduate students on a large Midwestern university campus in the design and implementation of projects focused on reducing harm associated with high-risk drinking and off-campus parties. Results: The engagement model used an innovative course piloted in the Human Development and Family Science department. The course successfully involved both students and the community in addressing local alcohol issues. Conclusions: The course design described would fit well into a Master of Public Health, Community Psychology, Health Psychology, or interdisciplinary curricula as well as the service learning model, and it is applicable in addressing other health risk behaviors.

AB  - This article features the workshop titled Exploring New Environments, developed by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's DESTINY Traveling Science Learning Program. Exploring New Environments is a teacher professional development model based on the idea that teachers are also learners who thrive when given the means and encouragement to explore fresh intellectual worlds. Teachers can creatively use what they learn to increase their students' interest in and understanding of science. The author also features DESTINY, a pre-college program that promotes equity of access to high-quality science education for all students. Science teachers are DESTINY's primary focus. The program sought to involve teachers of other disciplines in the process of science education. It initiated its interdisciplinary approach with Frankenstein's Fingerprints, a module that deals with genetics, scientific discovery and ethics, and students' critical-thinking skills. Workshops such as Exploring New Environments have the potential to garner nonscience collaborators for science teachers and also can encourage and prepare nonscience teachers to independently reinforce scientific content in their classrooms.

AB  - I articulate Charles S. Peirce's philosophy of mathematical education as related to his conception of mathematics, the nature of its method of inquiry, and especially, the reasoning abilities required for mathematical inquiry. The main thesis is that Peirce's philosophy of mathematical education primarily aims at fostering the development of the students' semeiotic abilities of imagination, concentration, and generalization required for conducting mathematical inquiry by way of experimentation upon diagrams. This involves an emphasis on the relation between theory and practice and between mathematics and other fields including the arts and sciences. For achieving its goals, the article is divided in three sections. First, I expound Peirce's philosophical account of mathematical reasoning. Second, I illustrate this account by way of a geometrical example, placing special emphasis on its relation to mathematical education. Finally, I put forth some Peircean philosophical principles for mathematical education.

AB  - This article explores the role of contemplative practices within an emerging interdisciplinary area that I refer to as "creativity and consciousness studies." Within this new area, consciousness is studied from an "integral" perspective that brings together insights from a range of wisdom traditions and modern science. Meditation is presented as an essential first-person modality for investigating consciousness, and formal and nonformal approaches to meditation are delineated to establish important guidelines for the introduction of meditation into an academic setting. The role of "first-person" experience helps to develop new notions of rigor and interdisciplinary learning that can lead to an expanded educational experience, which can help to develop qualities such as mental clarity, inner calm, insight, compassion, and creativity. The article closes with reflections on the importance of expanding our approach to education in light of the demanding challenges and creative opportunities in today's world.

AB  - Study abroad provides many opportunities for students. My own college's goals for international programs state that "students are expected to gain new perspectives on their fields of study, develop intercultural competencies and communication skills, learn others' perspectives, and reflect on their own assumptions and values while abroad" (Beloit College Office of International Education, 2005). Research abroad by students ideally provides these same benefits, better preparing them to function in their chosen fields. The views expressed in this essay come from my perspective as a biology and geology professor who has had the opportunity to travel and do research in a number of different and diverse countries. In addition, they stem from conversations with liberal-arts-college students, and with Sarah Davidson. Three aspects of research abroad are pertinent to this discussion: different approaches to science research, the need to have global coverage in our studies, and the site-specific nature of many scientific studies.

AB  - An investigative case study involving the preparation of a library of esters using Fischer esterification and alcoholysis of acid chlorides and their subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis by pig liver esterase and orange peel esterase is described. Students work collaboratively to prepare and characterize the library of esters and complete and evaluate the feasibility of the enzymatic hydrolysis for the goals of the case. Students make extensive use of [superscript 1]H NMR to characterize products and to determine the product or products of the enzymatic reaction. The interdisciplinary nature of this experiment in the context of a case study allows students to make connections to biology; see how chemical and biological approaches to a problem differ and complement each other; gain experience in a sequential three-step synthesis and the characterization of mixtures; and develop group skills and reflective judgment.

AB  - This paper presents a policy decision tree for digital information management in academic libraries. The decision tree is a policy guide, which offers alternative access and reproduction policy solutions according to the prevailing circumstances (for example acquisition method, copyright ownership). It refers to the digital information life cycle, focusing mostly on its creation (digitized or born-digital), acquisition, copyright and availability. The resulting decision tree is based on a policy model, which was initially divided into two branches--one for digitized and one for born-digital information. The decision tree simplifies and unifies commonly adopted rules which were identified through a questionnaire survey on the access and reproduction policies of 67 digital collections in 34 multidisciplinary libraries (national, academic, public, special, etc.) from 13 countries. The results of the decision tree are used to propose alternative policies. (Contains 15 notes and 2 tables.)

AB  - At approximately 9,500 years old, two sets of human remains from La Jolla, California (W-12), known as the University House Burials due to the physical location of their discovery on property owned by the University of California, San Diego, are some of the oldest in the United States. These burials are central to a repatriation controversy between the University of California, San Diego, and the Kumeyaay Cultural Repatriation Committee, which represents 12 federally recognized Kumeyaay/Diegueno tribal governments in San Diego County, California. The story of the La Jolla burials is a politically complicated one involving the Kumeyaay Indian Tribe's efforts to claim and repatriate the La Jolla remains, the University of California, San Diego's property issues and scientific interests, the local community's concerns, federal law, and the question of the population origins of the La Jolla remains. This final point has become central to determining who should ultimately have control over the final disposition of the burials, a point that has been, and will be, at the heart of many repatriation disputes. This article focuses on the science of determining the origins of all remains of great antiquity, including the La Jolla burials themselves. (Contains 64 notes.)

AB  - "European Education" (originally known as "Western European Education") may no longer be directly associated with the field of comparative and international education, yet its establishment in 1969 was an attempt to make a direct contribution to the academic debates about the future of comparative education. The journal emerged at a time when comparative educators in the United States were engaged in a complex process of reexamining historical foundations of the field, exploring its methodological and theoretical directions, and expanding its geographic boundaries. While the debate on comparative education theory and method was often polarized into two extremes--advocating for either cross-national, quantitative research or single-case, historical studies--the journal created an opportunity for comparative educators to engage in a comparative analysis that is both cross-national and contextual. The journal's founding editor (Ursula Springer) and advisory board members (George Bereday, Torsten Husen, Brian Holmes, Saul Robinsohn, and others) envisioned comparative education as an interdisciplinary area of study that would at once capture the importance of the historical context and advance the use of social science methods in comparative research. The journal's task became to translate this vision into reality. Common to all of the journal's editors (and their journal advisory board members) was their commitment to exploring alternative visions in the polarized debate on comparative theory and method in education. It is within the context of these comparative education debates that this study attempts to trace the journal's history. The fortieth anniversary of the establishment of "European Education" provides a unique opportunity to reflect on the journal's role in shaping the contours of comparative education during the past four decades. Through content analysis and interviews with former editors and advisory board members, this study discusses the context within which the journal emerged, its original goals and changing vision during the past forty years, as well as its role in the field of comparative and international education.

AB  - In a world which abounds with digitally-driven changes, an orthodoxy of technology adoption and utilisation in higher education is emerging, and it is deemed critical for steering the discussions of experts for planning and implementing a digitally-enabled ecology where students and faculty members alike will benefit. Although several types of software that host educational or training content for students have been used in previous studies, the aim of this EU-funded project was to design a digitally-enabled platform that would afford culturally-driven exchanges between university students and collaboration among faculty members of the same disciplines across Europe. The platform is based on, but extends beyond, principles of standard Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and Facebook, by affording Web 2.0 tools, Augmented Reality (AR) applications, and QR codes. Further, the platform has been designed based on multiple pilot testing phases, students' individual needs, instructors' constructive feedback, and the tailored needs of each academic discipline. This EU-funded project is a joint effort to guide instructors and students in experiencing the curricula in different academic institutions, to guide instructors and students in understanding the affordances and contradictions of intercultural telecollaboration, and to guide students in developing a conceptual understanding of complex constructs in their discipline.

AB  - Many have warned against a direct "brain scan to lesson plan" approach when attempting to transfer insights from neuroscience to the classroom. Similarly, in the effective design and implementation of learning technology, a judicious interrelation of insights associated with diverse theoretical perspectives (e.g., neuroscientific, pedagogical and classroom praxis) may be required. A design-based research approach to the development of learning technology informed by neuroscience may be one way of achieving this interrelation. Accordingly, here we report on some of the preliminary research of a web app, known as "zondle Team Play", that allows teachers to teach whole classes using a games-based approach and which draws on concepts from neuroscience. Rather than just exploring "what works" in terms of the technology, low-fidelity prototyping and participant design helped us explore aspects of praxis and affordances of the technological design that were contingent upon each other. Five cycles of design, intervention, analysis and reflection revealed some potential benefits of a neuroeducational approach to learning technology design, including the development of related pedagogy, identification of immediate and future neuroeducational research questions and the development of language and terms suitable for communicating across interdisciplinary boundaries.

AB  - On the eastern edge of the Cascade Mountain range in Washington State, high school biology students have a unique opportunity to study the elusive cougar ("Felis concolor"), a large cat native to the area. Nestled in the Cascade foothills is the city of Cle Elum, a small rural community that is expected to soon experience considerable growth from development of a large resort. The community provides an excellent model for scientific study of native animals; students can study and compare the cougar's habitat and behavior before, during, and after resort development. From an instructional perspective, the study of cougars provides an ideal way to engage both introductory and advanced biology students in interdisciplinary science inquiry and problem solving. In this article, the authors describe the design and implementation of the Cougar Conservation Project (CCP), a problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum that provided students and community members with valuable interdisciplinary learning experiences.

AB  - A pilot study provided insight into difficulties experienced by 143 Yr. 2 B.Ed. students in Scotland, writing in a science education context. In studying writing, an 'academic literacies' approach was adopted, focusing on social aspects in addition to identifying flaws. In over 20% of assignments, tutors' assessments identified a need to structure or sequence content. In 15%, a lack of explanation and expansion of ideas was noted. Detailed examination, of a 15% sample of scripts, showed approximately half with errors in punctuation, sentence structure or word use, tending to obscure the intended meaning. A questionnaire, completed by 70% of the student cohort, indicated that the assessed task had been perceived as authentic. 25% of that sample reported finding writing about science more difficult than for other subjects. It is argued that development of writing about science is important for future teachers and must become a stronger part of an overall, inter-disciplinary, course approach.

AB  - Unlike journals and notebooks, scrolls allow for changes over time to be seen at once, providing students with a complete view of phenomena.  Pages can inadvertently segment both the process of investigation and the content being investigated. Scrolls are excellent tools for documenting and displaying the continuity of natural processes that exhibit periodicity, cycles, or predictable patterns. Furthermore, they allow for the easy integration of science and art, providing students with a tangible and creative tool to document scientific phenomena. With scrolls teaching and learning become boundless. The scroll is an excellent tool for both documentation and display, and is a natural vehicle for an interdisciplinary approach to learning. It is also an important tool for student assessment and cooperative learning.

AB  - The increased pressure for gains in academic performance in mathematics and science are not going to dissipate, and rural schools must find a way to meet these challenges. The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and the Carl D. Perkins Federal Vocational and Technical Education Act legislations have also put pressure on career and technical education (CTE) to increase academic standards in CTE curriculum. Infusing mathematics into the curriculum will give students a chance to see the mathematics in a real-world context. The model of infusion proposed by the National Research Center for Career and Technical Education (NRCCTE) has given a viable option to aid in teaching mathematics in context. Further research is needed in order to guide everyone to the best model of mathematics infusion. The NRCCTE model should be tested across more CTE curriculums to determine if it can be implemented nationally. Also, more research is needed on the professional development that CTE and mathematics teachers receive in order to determine its effectiveness. Most of the research in mathematics infusion has taken place with in-service teachers. Mathematics infusion needs to start with the pre-service teachers. An analysis of teacher preparation programs can determine if future CTE instructors are receiving adequate mathematics and science courses to be able to proficiently infuse those academics into the curriculum.

AB  - Many students with reading difficulties in grades 4 through 12 experience challenges in understanding and learning from text. Some of these learners have demonstrated reading challenges from the early grades and have not acquired successful reading skills. Others were adequate readers in the early grades when word reading was the focus and when text complexity was minimal. Improving reading outcomes for both persistently poor readers and relatively newly challenged readers requires school-wide instructional practices integrated into content area instruction in math, science, and social studies. This article describes these practices and provides examples of how to teach reading comprehension within the content area. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - This article describes an interdisciplinary, activity-based lesson plan implemented in a third/fourth-grade classroom. During these activities, students use musical concepts to think about, illustrate, and discuss animal behavior, and they use scientific concepts to motivate musical composition and performance. The lesson ends with small group performances that allow the students to apply their knowledge to a new situation. These activities require no specific background knowledge about birds or music on the part of the students. A classroom teacher familiar with basic musical concepts can teach this unit alone or collaborate with a music teacher and/or science specialist. In addition to science standards, these activities also include the arts education standards of music composition and performance and understanding relationships between music and disciplines outside the arts (CNAEA 1994).

AB  - The use of constructivism and its various manifestations in education has been a topic of much interest in recent years. Inquiry into this theoretical framework has resulted in teacher educators' attempts to help their teacher candidates apply constructivist pedagogy in university classrooms, field experiences and student teaching at two US universities. The instructors developed a set of co-requisite, interdisciplinary methods courses entitled the Schoolyard Lab Program. Composed of two three-credit courses (science methods and language arts methods) and a one-credit field experience, the Schoolyard Lab program utilized the "Cognitive Process of Instruction (CPOI)" as its pedagogical basis. Joan Fulton designed CPOI as a seven-step process that relies on the learner's ability to describe a concept based on its distinguishing attributes, investigate and compare examples of the concept and, finally, apply the concept in new and authentic contexts. The Schoolyard Lab Program is the result of a 6 year period of development and has shown significant positive effects of CPOI on the self-efficacy beliefs of teacher candidates and in-service teachers who have experienced the program. The two faculty modeled CPOI practices in the university classroom. Teacher candidates were then expected to develop an integrated science and language arts unit plan, applying these same principles in elementary classrooms as they completed field experiences and student teaching. The authors of this article explain the CPOI format, how it conforms to important parts of the teacher education curriculum (such as lesson and unit development) and how this relates to the overall objectives of concept development, subject interrelationships and assessment strategies.

AB  - This manuscript asks questions about what may be the naturalized, or taken for granted, ideologies in science education regarding religion. There have been times in history when religion has taken a dogmatic role in limiting the practices of science (e.g., the Roman Catholic Church and Galileo). This manuscript reflects on the dogmatic rule of religion and argues that now science may be in danger of imposing dogmatic ideals through reaching beyond the capacities of an empirical way of knowing. A Science, Technology, and Society (STS) approach to science teaching is considered as a possible mechanism for honoring both science and religion as valid yet different ways of knowing and better addressing students' integration of science learned in school into their everyday lives.

AB  - Although Darwinism has gained a foothold in the social sciences, in the humanities, with a few exceptions, it is still largely rejected--not, as some would claim, because humanists are all radical poststructuralists who deny that material reality exists, but rather because, with notable exceptions, Darwinists who work within the humanities have adopted a trenchant "us against them," in-group/out-group mentality that has done a good deal more harm than good. In order for evolution to be effectively taught as part of a humanistic approach to literature and art, a more productive, truly "two way" approach is necessary, and must do more than impose the scientific method on the humanities. When this kind of imposition occurs, the humanities are treated "only" as subject matter, thereby discounting historical and interpretive research that is invaluable to scientists and claims they might make in these areas. This paper claims that for evolution to function as a paradigm with true explanatory power across disciplines, scientifically oriented evolutionists need training in humanistic methodologies just as much as humanistically oriented evolutionists need training in the scientific method. Evolution, in this context, becomes not the paradigm that can explain everything from a scientific point of view but rather the beginnings of a conversation about lower and upper level questions, and how these questions might inform and enrich each other's research.

AB  - The relevance of the problem under study is based on the influence of the expanding globalization processes that affect the view of life of a modern man: the internal balance is lost due to feeling of chaos, rhythm of life and constant changes. In these conditions there is a tendency to de-humanize the living environment, depersonalization of living space and desacralization of human dwelling which leads to re-thinking of the Home that ensures human existence in the world. The purpose of the article is to state the necessity of new understanding of the Home as the phenomenon of culture which would confront the absolute priority of the rational, pragmatic and utilitarian through the notion of "the innermost", through studying the transformation of the innermost within the historical context and through revealing the dialectics of the innermost and the explicit in living space of the modern culture. The lead method for studying this problem is the interdisciplinary approach that provides the possibility of comprehensive consideration of the results of philosophical, cultural, architectural and other studies. The article reveals the essence and the main philosophical-cultural characteristics of the Home and the essence of the innermost as a special super-value, specifies the traditional image of the innermost in living space related to the Home as the centre of existence and reveals the attributes of transformation of the innermost in the Home resulting from the processes which are characteristic of the modern age. The materials of the article can be useful for developing the scientific-methodological support of general and special courses, for conducting lessons in philosophical-cultural disciplines and for usage for designing and modeling the living environment.

AB  - Each member of the healthcare team has been trained with specific knowledge and skills. Quality patient care is dependent on the collaboration of the various healthcare professionals and their ability to work as a team. In order to be effective, interprofessional collaboration should be included in the academic preparation of each of the various disciplines. If healthcare professionals are trained to perform as interprofessional teams, taking advantage of the skills and knowledge of their teammates, this change can be implemented when these students graduate and enter their chosen profession. In order to promote interprofessional collaboration, the faculty of the health sciences department of an urban university system developed an interprofessional electronic portfolio (ePortfolio) that was used by students in registered nursing, physical therapy assistant, occupational therapy assistant, food and nutrition, and human services programs to serve as an electronic medical record. The goal of this pilot was to create an ePortfolio with tabs for each of the above healthcare disciplines. A case study on a patient with a cerebrovascular accident was created and assignments were developed by the program directors of each discipline. In order for a particular discipline to complete their assignment, the students reviewed the information and findings contained within the tabs of the other four disciplines. The ePortfolio served as an electronic medical record.

AB  - At Montana State University's Master of Fine Arts program in Science and Natural History Filmmaking, our goal is to re-invent these areas of documentary by admitting students with undergraduate science degrees and teaching them both production and film studies in an intensive three-year curriculum. In the course I teach, "Criticism and Theory: Science Studies for Filmmakers," I apply critical theory simultaneously to the study of science and film. There are two significant results: 1) teaching filmmakers using the tools of academic film studies can provide a conduit for the re-invention of a moribund practice such as the "blue chip" nature film; and 2) the disciplines of science studies and film theory, because they draw from the same critical theory substrate, have much more in common than has previously been written about in either the film or science studies literature.

AB  - (Purpose) The purpose of this paper is to describe visual literacy, an adapted version of Visual Thinking Strategy (VTS), and an art-integrated middle school mathematics lesson about scientific notation. The intent of this lesson was to provide students with a real life use of scientific notation and exponents, and to motivate them to apply their skills through their imagination and wonder about Nebulas. A mathematics preservice teacher and middle school mathematics cooperating teachers' thoughts about the value of this art-integrated lesson to enhance students' understanding of the scientific notation are described. (Methodology) An example of a middle school VTS, art-integrated lesson is described. Students were first shown images of water color Nebula and asked questions on different levels of thought. The discussion is a connected to an explanation of the use of the scientific notation to describe huge (and tiny) objects. Students were reminded how to use the scientific notation as well as exponents. Students were then asked to watercolor a Nebula and to measure it using exponents and scientific notation. (Results) The benefits of this lesson were both mathematical and artistic. The lesson gave students a visual example of the need for scientific notation, motivated them to apply this skill, and validated why they were learning this topic. The students also received instruction about and practice watercoloring. (Conclusions) Previously students struggled with this mathematical concept according to Author 2 (a middle school mathematics teacher), but by combining mathematics, science, and art, students were more interested and engaged to spend time and effort to master it. (Recommendations) Middle school teachers are encouraged to take advantage of the synergy possible through art-integrated lessons. (Additional data) (Contains 27 references and 7 figures).

AB  - Although the reform literature in mathematics and science is replete with calls for the integration of math and science, there remain precious few empirical studies examining the prerequisite skills, beliefs, knowledge bases, and experiences necessary for teachers to implement integrated instruction. The initial intent of this study was to examine the content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs (with respect to the integration of mathematics and science) that prospective secondary mathematics and science teachers bring to their respective preparation programs. This study then explored a collaborative model intended to create meaningful educational opportunities within the context of teacher preparation programs to foster preservice teachers' desire and ability to pursue connected teaching in the classroom. Presented in the article are findings related to the initial beliefs and experiences prospective teachers bring to the preparation process, the results of their collaborative work together in the creation of interdisciplinary units connecting mathematics and science topics, and their ongoing efforts to work together once engaged in schools for their student teaching internships. Moreover, this article proposes subtle shifts in both the conceptualization of and language used to describe, the integration of mathematics and science. Building on sociocultural theories, this article proposes the use of connections and pedagogical context knowledge as levers to promote integrated mathematics and science instruction.

AB  - The field of synthetic biology (the name is derived from an analogy to synthetic chemistry) has recognized itself as a "field" only since about 2002. Synthetic biology has gotten some high-profile attention recently, but most people are not aware the field even exists. Synthetic biologists apply engineering principles to genomic circuits to construct small biological devices. The Jamboree, as it was affectionately called, was the culmination of a summer of undergraduate research on five campuses across the United States. The participants shared data, frustrations, lessons learned, and plans for the future. The entire weekend was, to some extent, a pyramid turned upside down. Normally, new fields in biology are explored first by postdocs and graduate students under the watchful eyes of their Primary Investigator (PI) mentors. This National Science Foundation (NSF)-supported Jamboree featured undergraduates (some having just completed one year of college) who were pushing the boundaries of a field so new, its name is subject to debate. This report highlights some of the interesting research conducted by undergraduates during the summer and early fall of 2004. (Contains 5 figures and 1 footnote.)

AB  - The integration of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics content (STEM) has become a mainstream topic within educational systems. This paper discusses the technology integration model for education and the factors to be considered when taking into account technology education as a focal point of integrated curricula. These factors are: (1) academic collaboration; (2) hands-on approaches; and (3) the use of creativity and problem solving. Considering that technology can be the driving force behind integration, the authors suggest cohorts of teachers from all academic areas, including technology education, work together to provide a comprehensive integrated curriculum, with technology leading the process and content.

AB  - Cross-/inter-cultural development, language acquisition, employment potential, and the impact of homestays, program duration, direct enrollment, even grading policies have been analyzed in the pages of "Frontiers" and other journals. This analysis more often than not utilizes methodologies particular to social science research. What has been missing from the profession of education abroad is a parallel development of theory. A discussion of the city's relation to study abroad provides an opportunity to insert a theoretical element into the pedagogy of the profession. Specifically, the author proposes to introduce the Foucauldian concepts of "genealogy" and "heterotopia" to the idea of the "city," and in turn apply those same terms to the place of the city in the study abroad experience. Then, turning from Michel Foucault as "philosopher of space" to Paul Virilio, "philosopher of time," the author demonstrates the interplay between Foucault's heterotopia and Virilio's "anti-city," showing how study abroad in the contemporary, globalized city requires distinct programmatic changes to the (s)pace of education abroad.

AB  - Teachers at universities are facing an increasing disparity in students' prior IT knowledge and, at the same time, experience a growing disengagement of the students with regard to involvement in study activities. As computer science teachers in a joint programme in computer science and business administration, we made a number of similar observations. We also noted increasing difficulties with mathematics and see a growing number of students with previous knowledge in computer science, while others have little or no expertise in this area. These observations cause problems and present a major challenge for teachers. To get a better understanding and as a prerequisite for reforming the programme we posed four research questions: What are the students' motives and expectations with regard to the chosen study programme? To what extent are the students engaged in non-academic work activities? What prior knowledge do the students have about IT and computer science? What off campus access do the students have to IT facilities? Our findings provide a number of interesting indications. The results regarding motives and expectations suggest that there ought to be a good basis for the students to improve their efforts in computer science. However, as the majority does not know what kind of work to carry out in the future, better information about the programme and relevant jobs should be provided. Concerning the students' disengagement and its possible relation to their external workload, no conclusions can be drawn and this issue has to be researched further. The same is true about the students' expertise in mathematics. The students' previous knowledge seems to be so comprehensive that it should be considered in the teaching and inform the whole curriculum design. As there are still a substantial number of students who arrive at the programme with no previous knowledge, it is however necessary to design a syllabus and organise the course programme to accommodate different types of students. The survey also shows that IT is a natural toolset for the students, which in the future should be used more deliberately for the education. The paper provides the opportunity for other faculty to reflect on the role their students' backgrounds and expectations may play in the classroom experience. A copy of the survey is included in the appendix as a guide for those interested in conducting a similar study of their own student population. (Contains 11 tables.)

AB  - If there is a topic on which the humanities might make a distinctive claim, it is that of consciousness--an essential aspect of human being. And within the humanities, music might make its own claims in relation to both consciousness and being human. To investigate this connection, David Clarke and Eric Clarke brought together a wide variety of contributors in the book "Music and Consciousness: Philosophical, Psychological, and Cultural Perspectives" (OUP, 2011). The collection contributes to debates in consciousness studies at large, but also maps out areas peculiar to music and consciousness. Additionally, it lays bare the sheer multiplicity of discourses that emerges when consciousness is approached from even a single field of inquiry, such as music. If this poses a challenge for arriving at any agreed notion of consciousness (in relation to music or otherwise), this instability is something that might be best embraced rather than "resolved". While the study of music and consciousness affirms the importance of the humanities, this is not to foreclose dialogue with scientific disciplines, even as this means maintaining awareness of how the different discursive formations of the humanities and sciences may connote different--and frequently incommensurable--sensibilities and values.

AB  - This paper documents the experience and lessons from implementing an e-learning program aimed at creating research capacity for gender, crisis prevention, and recovery. It presents a case study of bringing together a multidisciplinary group of women professionals through both online and face-to-face interactions to learn the skills needed to be a successful researcher. It reviews the issues related to distance learning programs with particular reference to the e-learning courses and highlights the constraints and challenges in implementing them. Lessons from the experience for future development of similar courses indicate that participant profiling prior to the course, user friendliness of technology, meeting various learning styles, encouraging and rewarding online exchanges, commitment of course moderators, a variety of learning materials, and mixed approaches to learning are some of the factors that can enhance the success of e-learning programs. The paper concludes that enhancing skills of developing country researchers through e-learning programs can increase learning accessibility to those living and working in remote and conflict ridden areas, and bring together a network of professionals to interact and exchange experiences on common problems and solutions.

AB  - Although the important role of providing fieldwork experiences for students in the natural environment is now well-established within environmental education literature, there is still little research evidence to guide teachers in their choice of effective teaching strategies. This paper presents findings from an interpretive case study designed to investigate the value of combining experience-based fieldwork in a mangrove and coastal environment with reflective and metacognitive activities. Analysis of video recordings, researcher observation notes and interviews of a class of Year 11 biology students who participated in the activities resulted in the emergence of five themes. These themes together provided evidence of enhanced student environmental learning, and included student appreciation for various learning contexts, self-awareness of group learning processes, and awareness of the integration of cross-curriculum knowledge. The study supports and illustrates the contention that the most effective environmental learning experiences are likely to be those that integrate learning in the natural environment "with" classroom learning strategies.

AB  - A public Web site (Goolkasian & Van Wallendael, 2001), established to provide educational materials in cognitive science, served as the primary text for an interdisciplinary course. We tracked student use of the Web site online and with self-report questionnaires. A majority (74%) of the students rated the Web site to be as useful or more useful than a traditional textbook. Although time spent online with the Web materials predicted scores for 2 of the 4 exams, class attendance was the strongest predictor of exam performance.

AB  - Something remarkable is happening in programs of liberal education all over the country. The longstanding notion that learning should occur almost exclusively in classrooms is being amended to give a much more prominent place to various forms of experiential education. The belief that liberal education should focus on a narrow range of intellectual qualities is being revised to include an emphasis on connecting ideas with action. These developments constitute a profoundly important, indeed revolutionary, challenge to the version of liberal education that has dominated American higher education since the early years of the twentieth century. The trend to connect liberal education with practice takes multiple forms at the campus level and reflects a range of interests among students, faculty, and administrators. The various developments that make up this trend do not yet constitute a coherent movement, nor are they united by shared purposes. They remain on the margins of mainstream thought about the proper characteristics of liberal education. Yet they should command the attention of thoughtful academics for one basic reason: they seek to enact the traditional mission of liberal education to nurture engaged, effective, constructive professionals and citizens, and they implicitly question whether learning experiences that cultivate analytic skills in classroom settings constitute the most effective way to achieve this purpose. The movement to link liberal education more closely to action and practice is not limited to programs that take students out of the classroom. The trend is also reflected in modifications of arts and sciences coursework. Most liberal arts colleges now offer opportunities to study applied and professional subjects, for example, and many universities encourage liberal arts majors to take minors in professional fields. The Carnegie Foundation has sponsored an effort to enrich the "thinking" orientation of liberal education with the "doing" emphasis of professional studies by incorporating practice-oriented pedagogies, such as simulations and case studies, in liberal arts courses. Many colleges offer interdisciplinary, problem-focused minors like urban studies or international relations through which students learn to think about complex, real-world problems. These programs often provide platforms for community-based research projects, internships and service opportunities, and Model UN-type simulations. (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - This qualitative case study examines the initial implementation of a problem-based version of an undergraduate course in materials science for the purpose of identifying areas of improvement to the curriculum prior to a planned second implementation. The course was designed around problems that students work in small teams to solve under the guidance of facilitators, with early sequence problems designed to foster the problem-solving skills required to succeed in the course. This report describes students' impressions of and experiences in the course as they worked to solve the final problem at the end of the semester and compares those impressions, where applicable, to impressions gathered after they had completed the first problem near the beginning of the semester. Using grounded theory techniques to analyze the data, six central themes emerged from the implementation: course structure, facilitation roles, student roles, group processes, co-construction, and resources. Implications for practice and potential instructional design solutions that may aid in future implementations are discussed.

AB  - Narrated by a "researcher"-teacher, drawing from an interactional ethnographic and sociolinguistics perspective, he re-examines his previous teaching practices as a teacher-researcher in order to build a conceptual model for communities-based learning. This article reveals the discursive ways that linguistically and culturally diverse second and third graders, and their teacher, learned to navigate the complex social spaces within their classroom and into the larger community as interdisciplinary literacy learners of reading, writing, art and science. The students, in a public school in South Coastal California, navigated cultural landscapes of school and the larger community as "texts to be read". The space where their social worlds overlap is conceived of a place for struggling with complex ideas where change can happen and all emerge transformed. Students became young members of disciplines by learning from each other and learning from California landscape painter, centenarian Ray Strong and other accomplished artists. Students learned to view ordinary life and places as locations to learn from the people who make these places spaces for learning. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - This narrative presents the educational route followed by an Intel Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF) winner who was not always recognized for his scientific abilities. Factors contributing to the success of this gifted student are presented, as well as his creative insights for solving the problem that gave rise to the winning project. Further, the major issues that emerged from this student's story can inform both professional development and instructional practice. These issues include: the need to recognize science talent or creative productive behaviors in students with special needs; students' need for an experiential science curriculum that incorporates multidisciplinary perspectives from which to study and apply the discipline of science, not merely the subject matter; the power of collaboration between students with similar interests; and the value of developing instructional strategies that accommodate a variety of learning difficulties and learning styles.

AB  - Students love a good story. That is why incorporating literary fiction that parallels teaching goals and standards can be effective. In the interdisciplinary, thematic six-week unit described in this article, the authors use the fictional book "The Deep Time Diaries," by Gary Raham, to explore topics in paleontology, Earth science, and creative journaling. The "Deep Time Diaries" consists of a sequence of fictional diary entries by 10-year-old Neesha and 14-year-old Jon Olifee, siblings who share the usual combination of love and rivalry. Elements of voice and sensory detail abound in the book, and the characters have qualities that middle school students relate to easily. This article further discusses the concept and provides an overview of The "Deep Time Diaries" unit. It also presents additional teaching labs and activities, as well as author/illustrator-aided activities. (Contains 2 figures and 1 online resource.)

AB  - This study is part of a larger investigation which focused on determining and comparing the perceptions of agriculture teachers and science teachers on integrating science into agricultural education programs. Science and agriculture teachers' perceptions of barriers to integrating science, the support of stakeholders, and collaboration between science and agriculture teachers and programs were investigated. The majority of both science and agriculture teachers were in agreement that funding, equipment, and the science teachers' lack of an agricultural background were barriers to integration. However, they differed in their level of agreement about curriculum and teachers' philosophical differences as barriers. Both groups agreed their school has strong science and agriculture programs, that collaboration would benefit students, and that the two departments have something to offer each other. However, fewer than one-half of teachers in both groups reported they work in a collaborative effort with the other department. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - "Art practice as research" casts artmaking as inquiry--as a particularly experiential and constructivist process of learning in which imaginative synthesis and creative image making are ways of constructing knowledge. This article explores how artmaking functions as research through the creation of visual images, especially images that picture concepts, to create new insights and transform perceptions. It follows a path from mental images that mediate conceptualization in the mind to visible images in the world that shape thought in the social realm. To do this, it takes an interdisciplinary approach, exploring concepts from cognitive science, metaphor theory, and the sociocultural theory of mind, and presenting relevant examples from science and art to explain those concepts.

AB  - Combining both the Western perspective of creativity as productivity and the Eastern perspective of creativity as enlightenment, a Program for Enlightened and Productive Creativity (PEPC) for teaching inquiry was devised. The PEPC describes stages through which a student is guided to solve a problem using increasingly complex observation, inquiry, and experimentation. The use of this model in teaching is illustrated through a physics lesson of moire patterns using overlapping patterns found in our everyday life. A case is made that PEPC can be applied to teaching general students, as well as gifted students, and in different content areas. (Contains 20 figures.)

AB  - This paper explores the contextual value of solitude in learning; in so doing, it attempts to suggest an alternative method of instruction that is based on aesthetics as the reciprocal relationship between emotions and intellect, and between action and contemplation. Such an aesthetic education or method seeks to guide the student towards the attainment of her own life: to perfect, as much as possible, her human qualities in what she does by paying attention to the things of Beauty. The method that the essay uses is both historical and interdisciplinary: it draws from theology, philosophy, the sciences and visual art; and, it is guided by an explanatory perspective that is constructive.

AB  - Much of Mesoamerica's rich cultural heritage is slowly eroding because of acid rain. Just as water dissolves an Alka-Seltzer tablet, acid rain erodes the limestone surfaces of Mexican archaeological sites at a rate of about one-half millimeter per century (Bravo et al. 2003). A half-millimeter may not seem like much, but at this pace, a few centuries of acid rain is sufficient to destroy paintings, frescoes, and other fine detail in ancient art and architecture. This article describes an interdisciplinary educational supplement designed for middle-and high-school classrooms called "Acid Thunder: Saving El Tajin from Acid Rain." This supplement came about as a result of research conducted by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in collaboration with the National Autonomous University of New Mexico (UNAM). The supplement is in the form of a Webquest, an inquiry-oriented exercise focusing on analysis, synthesis, and evaluation, for which the Internet is the primary information source. "Acid Thunder" is  two-week activity that follows the work of a group of UNAM scientists who are researching many aspects of acid rain, including chemistry; meteorology; effects on plants, animals and materials; and measurement. "Acid Thunder focuses on the El Tajin archaeological zone, an important monument site in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. The Webquest is designed as an interdisciplinary unit to facilitate standards-based, active exploration in science and social studies. With "Acid Thunder", teachers have the significant opportunities to integrate topics in science and social studies and can offer students a stimulating experience likewise students can research features of an ancient Mesoamerican culture and compare it with other pre-Hispanic civilizations like the Mayas or Aztecs. In addition, this Webquest serves the important function of demonstrating to students how classroom walls are no longer a boundary for classroom-based activities. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - In May 2008, the worst earthquake in more than three decades struck southwest China, killing more than 80,000 people. The complexity of this earthquake makes it an ideal case study to clarify the intertwined issues of ethics in engineering and to help cultivate critical thinking skills. This paper first explores the need to encourage engineering ethics within a cross-cultural context. Next, it presents a systematic model for designing an engineering ethics curriculum based on moral development theory and ethic dilemma analysis. Quantitative and qualitative data from students' oral and written work were collected and analysed to determine directions for improvement. The paper also presents results of an assessment of this interdisciplinary engineering ethics course. This investigation of a disaster is limited strictly to engineering ethics education; it is not intended to assign blame, but rather to spark debate about ethical issues.

AB  - Biotechnology is an expanding area of scientific and community interest, one that it is important students understand because of its potential to impact on them and their communities. The issue for teachers and science and technology educators is how to provide learning experiences in this area. This paper draws on classroom-based research to describe the challenges teachers face and the successes they can achieve when teaching an interdisciplinary subject such as biotechnology. It describes the components of pedagogical content knowledge that teachers require to teach such a subject and highlights planning strategies to enhance teachers' PCK and subsequent classroom interactions. Evidence is provided that biotechnology engages student interest and that students can develop an understanding of the nature of biotechnology and associated conceptual and procedural learning outcomes.

History reveals that science and theatre arts (drama and dance) have shared a successful symbiosis that has benefited society for at least two millennia. This natural partnership continues to have positive effects on our culture by providing aesthetic satisfaction and educational resources and by influencing public policy.

AB  - This article considers how good teaching in general education classes can be good intervention for students with learning disabilities. It urges combining Big-S Science (the educational research literature) with little-s science (a teacher's study of what works in his/her classroom). It stresses the teacher's beliefs about students with disabilities and their inclusion and the teacher's repertoire of teaching behaviors. (Contains references.) (DB)

AB  - Finding improved ways to train education researchers has taken on new urgency as federal legislation such as the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 call for "scientifically based research in education." The authors of this article suggest an approach to socializing doctoral students to a common "culture of science" (a set of norms for scientific inquiry) and preparing them for interdisciplinary studies that span the natural and social sciences. Drawing on developments in the fields of neuroscience, sociology of natural science, and the learning sciences, the authors argue for an approach to doctoral training that is consistent with a broad definition of scientifically based research.

AB  - In a report entitled "Reshaping the Graduate Education of Scientists and Engineers" (National Academy of Sciences, 1995), the Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy proposed a modified PhD training model that retains an emphasis on intensive research experiences, while incorporating additional experiences to prepare graduates for an increasingly diverse job market. The National Science Foundation (NSF) subsequently instituted the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program to foster interdisciplinary training of doctoral students. Faculty in kinesiology graduate programs are often well positioned to contribute to such interdisciplinary training programs. We highlight an example of such a program, specifically the NSF IGERT program on Musculoskeletal and Neural Adaptations in Form and Function at Arizona State University. Both benefits and challenges of IGERT participation are considered. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - In this article, the authors present a case study of preservice teachers engaged in service-learning in an after-school program while concurrently enrolled in science and language arts methods courses. Two interdisciplinary education faculty worked collaboratively to connect language arts and science methods content with service-learning experiences. Preservice teachers provided a service to elementary school students by developing and teaching integrated, inquiry-based lessons. The after-school program provided a service to preservice teachers by providing opportunities for them to interact with young children and teach integrated science and language arts lessons outside the constraints of a formal classroom setting. The preservice teachers' experience was considered "integrated" in this study because they were required to integrate language arts skills within every science lesson that they taught in the after-school program.

AB  - This article describes a workshop, supported by the National Academy of Sciences and the National Institute of Health, that examines the current state of research about interventions that could significantly influence the participation of underrepresented minorities in pursuing research careers in the biomedical and behavioral sciences and other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The ultimate goals of this workshop are to help researchers develop appropriate kinds of research questions that measure the contributions of various factors to the success of such programs; to offer technical assistance on implementing effective methodologies for studying such interventions; and to encourage the development and coalescence of an interdisciplinary community of scholars and scholarly venues that are relevant to this area of study. The NIH also requested that this workshop provide technical assistance for those interested in conducting this type of research by exploring pertinent issues, such as developing researchable problems, designing experiments, and incorporating appropriate statistical analyses.

AB  - Art, particularly observational drawing, plays an important role in science. Scientific illustrators combine science content knowledge, observation skills, and artistic ability. For students, creating representational artwork helps develop observation skills and an appreciation of the diverse ways organisms have adapted to life on Earth. In this article, the authors describe an interdisciplinary project that combines techniques and design elements of the visual arts with hands-on scientific exploration. For the project, students create masks that exhibit attributes of animals observed at the Smithsonian Institution's Naturalist Center in Leesburg, Virginia. In the process, students develop an understanding of different animal species and learn how masks have been and are currently being used in different cultures. (Contains 1 figure.)

New York: Free Press 2003), Ji, Zhang and Nisbett ("Journal of Personality and Social Psychology," 87(1), 57-65, 2004), Norenzayan (2000) and Peng ("Naive Dialecticism and its Effects on Reasoning and Judgement about Contradiction." University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 1997) Peng and Nisbett ("Cross-Cultural Similarities and Differences in the Understanding of Physical Causality." Paper presented at the Science and Culture: Proceedings of the Seventh Interdisciplinary Conference on Science and Culture, Frankfort, K. Y. 1996), and Peng, Ames, & Knowles (Culture and Human Inference: Perspectives from three traditions. In: D. Matsumoto (Ed.), "Handbook of Cross-Cultural Psychology" (pp. 1-2). Oxford: Oxford University Press 2000). The paper argues that the findings on cultural influences on inference-making have implications for teaching and education generally, and specifically for the debate on conceptions and misconceptions of Asian students studying in western tertiary institutions around the world. The position defended is that, while there seems to be compelling empirical evidence for intercultural differences in thought patterns, these patterns are, for the most part, insignificant in everyday exchanges, though language and culture might subtlety modulate our inference-making at the margins. Linguistic determinism however is not defended. Nonetheless, the evidence provides food for thought, and it needs to inform the recent debates about international students studying overseas.

AB  - In this article, the author explores the question: What if the Hokey-Pokey is "really" what it's all about? He suggests that people would make the Hokey-Pokey the supreme object of their professional enterprise. Everything they would do would be centered on an analysis of, and engagement with, the Hokey-Pokey. It would be the ultimate focus of their professional lives. In fact every conceivable approach to the investigation and engagement with the Hokey-Pokey would be taken. Those approaches would span the traditional disciplinary lines. The author selects biomechanics and social-psychology as examples because, on the surface, they appear to be quite disparate disciplines. One is more in the domain of the classic category of the natural sciences, the other clearly in the domain of the social sciences. However, their epistemological approaches are essentially the same. Because "doing" the Hokey-Pokey is "really" what it's all about, all of those disciplines would recognize that they are engaged in a common mission: the pursuit of the genuine reality of the Hokey-Pokey. There would thus be interaction between the disciplines as they would learn from each other, pursuing, as they do, their common purpose. How might that happen, since each of the disciplines seems to have its own circumscribed areas of competence? In actuality, those areas of competence overlap considerably from one discipline to the next. Biomechanics shares common areas of competence with athletic training; psychology shares common areas of competence with pedagogy; exercise physiology with biomechanics (since movement patterns affect exercise efficiency); psychology with exercise physiology (with the growing area of psychology of exercise compliance); pedagogy with management; and so forth. The result is a scholarly social network of sorts, a network of overlapping scientific neighborhoods, in which a general science of the Hokey-Pokey would emerge. A scientific consensus through the whole range of disciplines would thus be established, and while loosely held and informally operating, the scholarly and scientific standards of the Hokey-Pokey would be maintained.

AB  - Tomlinson and Germundson compare teaching well to playing jazz well. Excellent teaching involves a blend of techniques and theory; expressiveness; syncopation; call and response, and, frequently, improvisation. Weaving in analogies to jazz, the authors delineate four elements of such teaching: curriculum that helps students connect to big ideas, understanding of students, differentiated instruction, and assessment for learning. A description of a middle-school science teacher's effective unit on cells fleshes out the teaching-as-jazz analogy.

AB  - The experimental analysis of behavior (EAB) is in trouble. Financial support for basic operant-conditioning research is difficult to obtain; teaching and research positions in colleges and universities are few; and bright undergraduates join other fields for graduate study. One reason for the difficulty is that EAB basic research does not focus sufficiently on problems relevant to the general population. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other federal granting agencies increasingly support translational research directed at societal problems, and operant researchers are missing out. The author takes two main messages from Critchfield's interesting paper ("Translational Contributions of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior," "The Behavior Analyst," v34, p3-17, 2011): (1) EAB is in bad shape; and (2) the low frequency of translational research contributes to the problem. In this article, the author discusses each of these points. He contends that researchers need to reach out to acquire new skills, construct new types of equipment, learn new fields of study, explore new paradigms, and push the boundaries of science.

AB  - The future curricula of the humanities are discussed in relation to the inclusion of science-fiction as an appropriate subject. It is believed that the curricula of the future will have the following characteristics in common: (1) Although curricula will give due recognition to the contributions of the past, it will begin in the present and will focus on the present and future world. Emphasis on understanding the present will be essential for survival; (2) It will be interdisciplinary and will cut across or eliminate the narrow subject matter compartments into which education is now arbitrarily divided. Three science fiction books that embody these criteria are discussed. (DB)

AB  - Purpose: To describe the development and structure of a new Master's-level subject entitled "Aspects of sustainability: an international perspective" as a potential model, adoptable by other tertiary-level educators. Design/methodology/approach: This paper describes the evolution and re-shaping of a subject designed for postgraduate students from diverse programmes (from science-based to sociology-based). It was re-designed in 2004, in part to support the co-introduction by Lincoln University of two new, globally innovative Masters degrees, but also as a contribution to the Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (DESD, 2005-2014). The two new degrees are taught and awarded jointly by Lincoln University and a partner European University, and thus are based on unique Northern-Southern hemisphere linkages. We describe the subject content (including its major assignment), and its evaluations by students. Findings: A successful subject has been developed, but it required a step change in its structure in order to (a) retain connectedness and common themes across its wide-ranging topics, and (b) meet the expectations and aspirations of multi-disciplinary, multi-national classes. Practical implications: This paper details the key ingredients of a subject designed to prepare postgraduate students for careers involving sustainability at international or regional level. The subject's structure is a potential model for adoption in other tertiary programmes. Originality/value: The subject's structure is highly appropriate for a multi-disciplinary, multi-national student group, and demonstrates one university's efforts to contribute to DESD. The format of the main assignment is offered as a model for adoption by others engaged in education for sustainability. (Contains 1 figure, 2 tables and 1 note.)
