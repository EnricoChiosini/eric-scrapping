AB  - In an era in which time is more compressed than it has ever been before, the life cycle of any innovation is extremely brief, and an unexpected, bold idea that is quickly put to work in the sphere of virtual reality can result in a "super-breakthrough" in the world of new industrial technologies. In order to accomplish cutting-edge technological tasks it is essential to provide for the appropriate training of specialists, based on the integration of education, science, and production. Today's engineers have to pursue the accomplishment of multicriterial tasks; they have to single out, on a well-reasoned basis, the factors that are the most important, model the options that are possible in principle, and select those that are to be given priority on the basis of scientifically substantiated and morally permissible criteria. The quality of the results of the intellectual endeavors of college students, work that is designed to make them ready to engage in creative, innovative professional activity, is very definitely affected by the level of the use of general, interdisciplinary technological knowledge in the learning process. The question of systematizing information that is difficult to formalize is of general importance. It is relevant not only in the sphere of technical education but also in numerous fields of scientific and production activity, where the concentration of common interests leads to raising of the level of integration of the "education--science--production" system. Solving the problem of systematizing information that is of different kinds requires the formulation of an appropriate methodology. In solving problems that have to do with the implementation of the interdisciplinary training of engineers, a methodology for systematizing interdisciplinary information has been tested successfully. This article describes this methodology which is based on the formation of decision-making data bases (DMDB). The results achieved in this field can be used effectively not only to accomplish tasks of production but also to deal with problems of continuous education.

AB  - Interprofessional attitudes existing between healthcare disciplines can negatively impact communication and collaboration in the clinical setting. While human anatomy is a topic central to healthcare trainees, the potential of the anatomy laboratory to minimize negative interprofessional attitudes has yet to be characterized. This study aimed to assess the effects of an anatomy interprofessional near-peer learning activity (AIP-NPLA) on medical and nursing students' interprofessional attitudes at McGill University. The authors employed a convergent parallel mixed methods study to explore participants' AIP-NPLA experiences. The Attitudes to Health Professionals Questionnaire (AHPQ) was used pre- and post-AIP-NPLA to assess participants' attitudes toward their own and their counterpart profession. In addition, a focus group was held immediately following the AIP-NPLA to explore participants' experiences and interprofessional perceptions. Quantitative results using a principal components analysis demonstrated significant changes in nursing students' responses between pre- and post-AIP-NPLA scoring, rating the medical profession as being more caring overall. Medical students' responses pre- and post-AIP-NPLA demonstrated no significant differences. Qualitative results also suggested a breakdown of negative attitudes, an increased understanding of inter- and intra-professional roles, and the importance of interprofessional collaboration and mutual learning for their careers. These findings revealed that attitudes among healthcare trainees may be positively restructured in the anatomy laboratory, allowing for collaborative care to predominate in current and future clinical practices.

AB  - Case studies and current literature are combined with spectroscopic analysis to provide a unique chemistry experience for art history students and to provide a unique inquiry-based laboratory experiment for analytical chemistry students. The XRF analysis method was used to demonstrate to nonscience majors (art history students) a powerful application of chemistry. Spectroscopy was used in the examination of a painting to determine the chemical components of the pigments used. In addition to demonstrating the XRF methods to art history students, chemistry students in instrumental analysis used spectroscopy, including XRF, to examine both the chemical composition of the paints used as well as the presence of an underpainting.

AB  - Briggs and Peck [in "Using Learning Progressions to Design Vertical Scales That Support Coherent Inferences about Student Growth"] call for greater care in the conceptualization of the target attributes of students, or "what it is that is growing from grade to grade." In particular, they argue that learning progressions can serve as valuable bases for the design of assessments and for the interpretation of assessment results, especially in terms of change over time (or "growth"). Against the backdrop of the history of science in general, it must be regarded as remarkable that Briggs and Peck's argument--the core of which is simply that the meaningfulness of claims regarding changes in an attribute depends on clarity about the attribute itself--could be regarded as at all novel. But against the backdrop of (especially, but not exclusively, U.S.-based) educational assessment and psychometrics, in which technical concerns have arguably been foregrounded at the expense of substantive and conceptual concerns, their contribution is valuable and timely. However, I believe their points can be productively pushed even further. In particular, I argue that even greater care can and should be taken in attending to (a) the distinction between claims about the actual state of affairs in the world and claims about the ways in which we choose to model or represent such affairs via our concepts and language and, relatedly, (b) the distinction between elements of our belief systems we take to be immune to revision (i.e., as "assumptions" or "stipulations") versus those taken to be open to revision (i.e., as "hypotheses").

AB  - This study explores "integration", the gathering of multiple disciplines of study into a curricular whole, and "interdisciplinarity", the inclusion of multiple disciplines, in the agricultural college at a land-grant university. We also evaluate the importance that employers place on student abilities to integrate information across disciplines. Interdisciplinary education is important because it provides undergraduates with a balanced educational experience and prepares them to face increasingly more complex and global issues. Survey questionnaires were administered to undergraduate students and faculty advisors in the college of Agricultural sciences and Natural resources at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and to potential employers in agriculture-related fields. Results indicated that employers placed broad knowledge and the ability to integrate information above technical skills. In turn, students chose employment potential as a prime motivator for selection of their majors and minors. Advisors reported that they frequently used interdisciplinary methods in courses, but did not believe the same happened in courses taught by other faculty. Further, the surveys revealed that students perceived the influence of advisors in their choice of majors and minors as minimal. We conclude that interdisciplinary education should receive higher priority in the undergraduate curriculum in agriculture because it is important in student preparation for a more diversified workplace. Such a focus for undergraduates would help to develop the qualities of broad knowledge and integration ability sought by today's employers. (Contains 9 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Writing across the curriculum (WAC) is a way of integrating the teaching of writing into specific academic disciplines. A problem faced in the WAC literature is how to develop a process that integrates the skills of multi-disciplinary teams. In this project, action research was used to develop a team comprising faculty from the applied sciences and a writing teacher which had been commissioned to integrate the teaching of writing into an undergraduate horticulture course. Five features of action research were of particular importance: the foci of change and collaboration, the rational, systematic process it provided, the locating of the research in a real as opposed to controlled context, and the dual foci of action and research. Action research provided a successful process and structure for the project: outcomes included changed attitudes to writing amongst students and a deeper understanding of how students value written assessment. Unexpected outcomes included spontaneous participation of students in the action research process, the provision of useful methods of reflection for teaching staff, and the development of professional trust amongst faculty from different disciplines.

AB  - Food security is researched and dealt with on local, regional, national, and global levels with solutions ranging from local farmers' market initiatives to increasing crop yields through genetically modified plants to streamlining global supply chains. Because of its broad, interdisciplinary nature, it is necessary to narrow the focus of this webliography by limiting resources to those specifically addressing food security. Tangentially-related resources, such as those focused solely on water resources, were excluded; broader related concepts such as "food sovereignty" were also excluded. This webliography focuses specifically on sources that address food security in the United States or at the global scale. This guide is intended to be useful to a broad audience including: academic and public librarians, educators, researchers, graduate students, and nonprofit organizations.

AB  - Reform efforts are often unsuccessful because they failed to understand that teachers play a key role in making educational reforms successful. This paper describes a long-term teacher professional development (PD) program aimed at educating and training teachers to teach interdisciplinary topics using case-based method in science. The research objective was to identify, follow and document the processes that science teachers went through as they assimilated the interdisciplinary, case-based science teaching approach. The research accompanied the PD program throughout its 3-year period. About 50 teachers, who took part in the PD program, were exposed to an interdisciplinary case-based teaching method. The research instruments included teacher portfolios, which contained projects and reflection questionnaires, classroom observations, teacher interviews, and student feedback questionnaires. The portfolios contained the projects that the teachers had carried out during the PD program, which included case studies and accompanying student activities. We found that the teachers gradually moved from exposure to new teaching methods and subject matter, through active learning and preparing case-based team projects, to interdisciplinary, active classroom teaching using the case studies they developed.

AB  - Participants with teaching and research experience across eight disciplinary areas were introduced to the idea of "threshold concepts" and were then invited to identify potential threshold concepts in their own disciplines through small-scale research activities. Participants conceptualized their involvement in different ways: for some it provided a means of initiating changes in practice at faculty, department or course level, while others couched their involvement in terms of professional development or intellectual curiosity. This article describes how three selected disciplines--Sports Science, English Literature and Engineering--carried out enquiries into threshold concepts, and the ways in which they reflected on their participation in interdisciplinary seminars and disciplinary enquiry. These accounts highlight the importance of promoting a culture in which enquiry and reflection are central, while at the same time recognizing the value of appropriate "points of focus" for these activities and the importance of context-specific ideas of "quality" in practitioner research.

AB  - Virtual microscopy (VM) is a relatively new technology that transforms the computer into a microscope. In essence, VM allows for the scanning and transfer of glass slides from light microscopy technology to the digital environment of the computer. This transition is also a function of the change from print knowledge to electronic knowledge, or as Gregory Ulmer puts it, a shift "from literacy to electracy." Blended learning, of course, is capable of including a wide variety of educational protocols in its definition; it is also at the heart of electronically mediated forms of education. Since 2004, VM has been introduced into Dentistry, Medicine, Biomedical Science and Veterinary Science courses at the University of Queensland, a project aimed at consolidating VM techniques and technologies into their curricula. This paper uses some of the evaluative survey data collected from this embedding process to discuss the role blended learning plays in electronic styles of learning, or "electracy", before finally reflecting on the quantum world represented in VM imagery.

Alonzo and Ke outline important resources available in large-scale assessment and in curriculum-embedded contexts for STEM. Large-scale assessments in the United States are increasingly better representing hard-to-measure constructs. However, Scalise points out, that being said, the message of Alonzo and Ke is that a lot exists--but is it really available? Due to the nature of large-scale trend assessments, not enough of the latest types of new STEM assessments are available to be fully released by international and domestic contexts described in the manuscript. So providing lessons learned from the extensive studies taking place in these new STEM assessments is key to sharing the intellectual capital. Scalise concludes that crafting high-quality assessment resources and making them available for K-12 isn't far from what the STEM community is already doing. They do offer intellectual capital, either in the form directly of the assessments themselves, if available, or of what has been learned to create them. But the lack of coordination, alignment, release, quality, teacher materials, professional development, and logistics is a problem for schools.

AB  - At many universities, much of the learning in the undergraduate curriculum is discipline based, with very little integration of material from different subject areas. Furthermore, not all undergraduate business students have the opportunity to take courses with a diversity component that exposes them to the cultural and other differences that exist in various parts of the world. While it would be optimal for all students to study abroad for at least one semester during college, financial and other considerations make this goal unattainable for many students. For this reason, structured study abroad trips may present the only opportunity for some students to incorporate a global experience into their education. In order to achieve the dual goals of fostering integrated learning and global studies, Rider University, a private, coeducational university located on two campuses in Lawrenceville and Princeton, New Jersey, offers interdisciplinary "business-science" courses with a travel component so that undergraduate science and liberal arts students and undergraduate and graduate business students can not only study, but also experience, the complex interaction of legal, economic, social, and environmental factors in an international setting. This article explains the importance of introducing global studies, interdisciplinary learning, and environmental law and sustainability into the business school curriculum and describes how the Nature's Business program accomplishes its goals.

AB  - Size and scale cognition is a critical ability associated with reasoning with concepts in different disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. As such, researchers and educators have identified the need for young learners and their educators to become scale-literate. Informed by developmental psychology literature and recent findings in nanoscale science and engineering education, we propose an integrated knowledge framework for characterizing and scaffolding size and scale cognition called the FS2C framework. Five ad hoc assessment tasks were designed informed by the FS2C framework with the goal of identifying participants' understandings of size and scale. Findings identified participants' difficulties to discern different sizes of microscale and nanoscale objects and a low level of sophistication on identifying scale worlds among participants. Results also identified that as bigger the difference between the sizes of the objects is, the more difficult was for participants to identify how many times an object is bigger or smaller than another one. Similarly, participants showed difficulties to estimate approximate sizes of sub-macroscopic objects as well as a difficulty for participants to estimate the size of very large objects. Participants' accurate location of objects on a logarithmic scale was also challenging. (Contains 8 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - UNESCO's challenge to Higher Education institutions to provide educational leadership in sustainable development, provides an impetus to develop innovative, interdisciplinary curricula and pedagogy. Whereas Higher Education curricula in sustainability and sustainable development have tended to come from the environmental sciences, recent studies have highlighted the need for more holistic, experiential, interdisciplinary approaches. As a pedagogical approach, outdoor learning may have something to offer since it lends itself to holistic and experiential learning and enables integration of knowledge and skills from a range of discipline areas. Outdoor and environmental education research suggests that educational experiences in outdoor settings can be significant in developing environmental sensitivity and knowledge. Such knowledge and attitudes are components of ecological literacy and, more recently, sustainability literacy. This paper considers how outdoor experiential pedagogy might contribute to the current sustainability education agenda. It focuses on Higher Education since this sector has the obligation and the capability of instigating a "ripple" effect in developing sustainability-literate citizens. It discusses possibilities and issues arising from a review of outdoor, environmental and sustainability education literature, particularly, but not exclusively, from the UK. The paper is a precursor to an empirical study into how outdoor learning might contribute to the development of sustainability-literate graduates. (Contains 11 notes.)

AB  - Despite their common history, there are many cultural, attitudinal and practical differences between the professions of medicine and pharmacy that ultimately influence patient care and health outcomes. While poor communication between doctors and pharmacists is a major cause of medical errors, it is clear that effective, deliberate doctor-pharmacist collaboration within certain clinical settings significantly improves patient care. This may be particularly true for those patients with chronic illnesses and/or requiring regular medication reviews. Moreover, in hospitals, clinical and antibiotic pharmacists are successfully influencing prescribing and infection control policy. Under the new Irish Pharmacy Act (2007), pharmacists are legally obliged to provide pharmaceutical care to their patients, thus fulfilling a more patient-centred role than their traditional "dispensing" one. However, meeting this obligation relies on the existence of good doctor-pharmacist working relationships, such that inter-disciplinary teamwork in monitoring patients becomes the norm in all healthcare settings. As discussed here, efforts to improve these relationships must focus on the strategic introduction of agreed changes in working practices between the two professions and on educational aspects of pharmaceutical care. For example, standardized education of doctors/medical students such that they learn to prescribe in an optimal manner and ongoing inter-professional education of doctors and pharmacists in therapeutics, are likely to be of paramount importance. Here, insights into the types of factors that help or hinder the improvement of these working relationships and the importance of education and agreed working practices in defining the separate but inter-dependent professions of pharmacy and medicine are reviewed and discussed.

AB  - Within the past 10 years severe weather has been responsible for an annual average of 278 fatalities in the United States (National Weather Service, 2013). During severe weather special populations are populations of high concentrations of people that cannot respond quickly. Schools show both of these characteristics. The average lead time for tornadoes is only 11 minutes (Simmons & Sutter, 2008), so decisions must be made decisively and leaders must be prepared in advance. This paper describes how an instructional design process was used to develop an interdisciplinary problem based learning training for both school personnel and emergency managers. In this real world based activity, participants simulated difficult decisions that must be made during severe weather to develop a better understanding of each others' roles and responsibilities.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to provide initial validity evidence for measuring multidimensional subjective well-being in a Hispanic sample with the Interpersonal, Community, Occupational, Physical, Psychological, Economic (I COPPE) Scale. Participants were 641 English-speaking adults who self-identified as Hispanic. Bi-factor analyses were used to evaluate (a) the a priori measurement theory for responses to the I COPPE Scale and (b) convergent relationships of the seven I COPPE subjective well-being factors with scores from established comparison instruments. There was evidence that (a) the a priori hypothesized measurement theory for responses to the I COPPE Scale emerged in an exploratory bi-factor analysis and (b) the I COPPE subjective well-being factors exhibited convergent relationships with scores from comparison instruments. Use of the I COPPE Scale to derive multidimensional measures of subjective well-being may be of potential utility to future research in the interdisciplinary study of human movement and in a diversity of populations in which health disparities may exist.

AB  - Technologically enhanced learning environments raise complex challenges for their designers, developers and users. Design patterns and pattern languages have recently emerged as a potential framework for addressing some of these challenges. However, the uptake of design patterns has been slow outside of the computer science community. We argue that this is largely a consequence of a weak positioning of pattern languages, as a form of delivering expert knowledge to layperson, and suggest an alternative view: the development of a pattern language as a community endeavour. In terms of open education, the workshop model can be viewed as an open production process for developing educational resources, in our case design patterns. We propose a model of pattern elicitation workshops, in which collaborative development of a pattern language provides a framework for sharing design knowledge within interdisciplinary communities. This model was iteratively developed at five international conferences. It was then postulated as a design pattern itself, encompassing a series of practices and a set of supporting tools. We believe this model could be applied in a broad range of communities concerned with the development of open digital educational resources. (Contains 2 figures and 2 footnotes.)

AB  - Study abroad is the latest "must have" experience for undergraduate students according to an article in the November 4, 2007 "New York Times" (Pappano, 2007). University mission statements increasingly emphasize internationalization and employers increasingly seek graduates with experience in the global arena. This focus on international experience has led to the development of a variety of models for study abroad, including research abroad programs. To assess the value of an international research experience for undergraduates,  the authors examined the impact of two international programs on their respective participants and compared these to the gains achieved by students participating in research on their home campus. They surveyed students from two study abroad programs along with a comparison group of students doing research on the University of Arizona (UA) campus. The two study abroad programs were the Biomedical Research Abroad: Vistas Open (BRAVO!) Program and the Semester at Sea (SAS) Program. Subjects for the domestic comparison group were recruited from the UA Undergraduate Biology Research Program (UBRP). The authors provide a brief description of each program, then go on to discuss more specific conclusions they draw from their data, based on classifying the data into Meyers-Lee and Evans's three categories of direct impact of international experience: (1) gains in disciplinary knowledge; (2) intercultural competence; and (3) social growth.

AB  - This article discusses a dilemma that engineering educators encounter when attempting to develop pedagogical methods: that of finding efficient and scientifically valid didactic practices. The multitude of methods offered by educational consultants is perplexing. Moreover, the popularity of commercially offered solutions such as learning styles testing makes them appear attractive. The study presents one case of application of learning styles, the consequent problems and evaluation of results. It concludes that the use of learning styles is not supported by current pedagogical theories. Practices to foster interdisciplinary understanding between learning sciences and engineering are proposed in order to improve engineering education, most notably collaborative projects between university departments.

AB  - The core argument is that social science must re-examine its mission and praxis in order to be a significant player in future higher education. This article reviews the results and prospects arising from a four-year international project. Originating in Greenwood and Levin's concern about the social sciences, the project, funded by the Ford Foundation, was organised as an action research network of social scientists. Meeting several times over four years, the assembled group of scholars shifted focus from the future of the social sciences to broader questions of the future of higher education as a whole and the possible role of the social sciences. Four issues emerged as vital future challenges: (1) Collective denial among academics that knowledge production (research and teaching) is a collaborative effort and that individual academics depend on and are responsible for contributing to the health of the academic collectivity; (2) Academic freedom, conceived as an individual right is under siege and will have to be reconstructed to include both individual rights and collective and institutional responsibilities and rights in higher education; (3) An appreciation of the multiplicity of teaching, research and organisational factors that interact to constitute healthy universities is lacking in most quarters; and (4) Technologies of accountability now drive the development of higher education towards a focus on an artificially narrow metrics of knowledge-generation and away from inquiry into what constitutes relevant and sustainable knowledge-generation practices.

AB  - Politics and economics interact. As a consequence, political science textbooks must often relate to the economic dimension--implicitly or explicitly. But we know very little about how these textbooks relate to economics. Are they merely unreflective customers of neoclassical economics or do they strive for a cross-disciplinary approach? An analysis of five American textbooks identifies two very different and concurrent interactions between politics and economics. The first is a theoretically conceived market economy in which market forces independently drive growth and create equilibrium, where politics has a rather secluded role. The second is the actually existing mixed economy, characterized by increased inequality, economic concentration, power, and environmental problems, influenced by a state forced to regulate. The problems of operating with such a dichotomy--and possible solutions to it--are being explored in the article. (Contains 3 tables and 23 notes.)

AB  - The present article describes and evaluates collaborative interdisciplinary group projects initiated by content lecturers and an English-as-a-Foreign-Language (EFL) instructor for the purpose of teaching technical writing skills in an aeronautical engineering degree program. The proposed technical writing model is assessed against the results of a learner survey and refined accordingly. The survey showed that learners appreciated the cross-disciplinary collaboration in projects, and it delivered important insights into learning effects and student progress in both language and content matters. The article concludes with a list of recommendations for the implementation of project-based collaborative technical writing instruction, which may support or complement academic writing courses in similar contexts. The proposed model considers the circumstances of students in workload-intensive tertiary settings and synthesizes approaches such as problem-based learning, content-based instruction, task-based language teaching, a guided product approach to collaborative writing, and learner autonomy.

AB  - This research aimed at investigating the effectiveness of STEM approach in developing visual reasoning and learning independence for preparatory stage students. To achieve this aim, the researcher designed a program based on STEM approach in light of the principles of nanotechnology. Twenty one preparatory stage students participated in the research. The researcher applied one-group research design through application of the research instruments to the selected group before the program, administration of the program, and post application of the instruments. This research design is appropriate for educational researches which present new processes in the content of programs or curricula that the students have not previously studied and these processes may take the form of new information, skills, or teaching methods. After data collection and application of the appropriate statistical treatments, the researcher reached the following results: there is a statistically significant difference at the 0.01 level between the students' mean scores in the pre and post-application of the achievement and visual reasoning tests in favor of the post-application. The results of the portfolio assessment of students also indicate the development of the students' ability to take responsibility of their learning, their ability to choose, their confidence, and consequently their competency in the aspects of learning independence.

AB  - In the wake of the September 2001 attacks, the U.S. government founded the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with responsibility to develop a National Infrastructure Protection Plan for securing critical infrastructures and key resources. DHS established interdisciplinary networks of academic expertise administered through Centers of Excellence across the country, each addressing a different aspect of homeland defense. The National Center for Food Protection and Defense (NCFPD), created in 2004, organized over 150 experts around five theme groups: Agent Behavior, Event Modeling, Systems Strategies, Risk Communication, and Educational Programs. The fifth theme group, Educational Programs, was the focus of a special library project to assist experts in delivering "high-quality education and training programs to develop a cadre of professionals equipped to deal with future threats to the food system." An initial database provided National Center for Food Protection and Defense experts with a listing of educational resources and their uniform resource locators (URLs). In 2009, NCFPD formed a team of librarians and subject experts to finalize the framework for a working collection of food protection educational resources. The framework consisted of 1) a scope of work for the database, 2) descriptive metadata elements and classification decisions, and 3) a vetting instrument to maintain the utility and currency of selected information. This paper describes the work performed by the database team to create criteria for inclusion and classification of resources consistent with NCFPD end-users' evolving needs. A content validity method is described that was used to gauge whether the team's conceptual definition of the domain of information was congruent with that of the expert community being served.

AB  - This chapter is a call for consequential education research that has transformative potential: intellectually, educationally, and socially. It is about learning to see differently. It is an argument about seeing our work with youth and communities in ways that can help education researchers see ingenuity instead of ineptness and inability, to see resilience instead of deficit, and to imagine futures with youth from nondominant communities instead of imposing failure. We use the notion of "learning to see" both metaphorically and as a theoretical lens and methodological guide to illustrate how rigorous and consequential education research can help us imagine and design new forms of learning and schooling. We argue that rupturing educational inequality also involves new forms of inquiry that help reconceptualize what it means to work with nondominant communities.

AB  - Unilateral enterprise resource planning (ERP) curriculum improvements from the instructor's perspective are likely to generate only limited success. Understanding student motivations and beliefs with ERP systems is the missing link to effective ERP education. Relatively little attention in the ERP literature has been given to student learning associated with ERP experience, and almost none to factors influencing current and expected student beliefs and behaviors relative to ERP. The complexity of ERP systems demands that beliefs and behaviors be considered when planning ERP curricula. In the present study, the Theory of Planned Behavior was extended to examine students' intentions to explore additional aspects of ERP after their class exercises. When considering all students, attitude and subjective norm had positive and significant effects on intentions to continue ERP learning. Subjective norm also affected attitude, and availability of support materials had a positive effect on subjective norm. Distinctive patterns are found for the construct relationships between student groups who valued ERP education (the engaged) and those who placed little or no value on ERP education (the undecided). Results from competing model analyses indicate that support materials influenced the engaged and undecided groups differently. Strategies for ERP curriculum design are provided.

AB  - In Europe, there is a growing interest in honors education, not only in the bachelor's but also in the master's degree. The Dutch government, for instance, is actively promoting excellence in both bachelor's and master's degrees through honors programs (Siriusteam). Most Dutch universities have honors programs at the bachelor's level or are developing them. Some universities have also recently introduced honors into their master's programs, stimulated by recent publications (van Eijl, Wolfensberger & Pilot). Because honors master's programs are a new phenomenon in higher education and are still exceptional in the United States of America, the authors have undertaken a research project to study them (van Ginkel & van Eijl). For this exploratory project, a mixed method approach was used (Creswell & Plano-Clark; van Ginkel & van Eijl) in a study that was carried out at the start of the academic year 2009-2010. First, an Internet search identified Dutch and non-Dutch honors master's programs. Second, a literature review facilitated a comparison between Dutch honors master's programs and Dutch honors bachelor's programs. Third, staff members provided insights into the honors master's within the discipline of law at the University of Utrecht. Interviews with teachers revealed specific information about a representative example of Dutch honors master's courses. Fourth, in line with the interviews, a small quantitative survey yielded an impression of the interest of students in supplemental activities included in the master's stage of their study. Thirty-seven master's students from different disciplines completed the survey. The study revealed the existence of different kinds of honors master's programs not only in The Netherlands but also in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Germany, Italy, and Ireland. These honors master's programs are found in the humanities, social sciences, hard sciences, and professional schools. The programs are diverse with respect to content, focus, and scheduling, and they are, as far as the authors could trace, very new. It is concluded that the emergence of honors master's programs shows a new focus on promoting excellence in university teaching and learning not only among undergraduates but now also at the master's level.

AB  - A new program, On Recent Discoveries by Emory Researchers (ORDER), has been developed as a bridge across the ever-widening gap between graduate and undergraduate education in the sciences. This bridge is created by merging the needs of graduate/postdoctoral students to educate more interdisciplinary scholars about their research discoveries with the need for the entering freshman to understand the process of discovery and the scientific method.

AB  - Despite the increasing importance of robotics, there is a significant challenge involved in teaching this to undergraduate students in biomedical engineering (BME) and other related disciplines in which robotics techniques could be readily applied. This paper addresses this challenge through the development and pilot testing of a bio-microrobotics case study that can be integrated into curricula in BME, electrical and computer engineering (ECE), and other disciplines. This case study is based on the existing technology of wireless capsule endoscopy and centered on a "grand challenge" of building a capsule robot to navigate the human gastrointestinal tract to detect abnormality or to destroy malignant tissues. First, a conceptual design example for building such a capsule robot is presented, followed by a laboratory module that demonstrates robot navigation techniques using Webots simulation. The case study introduces robotic technologies, including robot building components, operating modes, and behavior-based programming, and students experience robot simulation in the laboratory module. The case study developed was pilot tested in three BME and ECE courses at the authors' institution. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the case study in enhancing students' understanding of robotics, interdisciplinary skills, and critical thinking. The case study is shown to support challenge-based learning, which promotes adaptive expertise through rapid knowledge building and innovation.

AB  - The matter of cities is, as urban critic Jane Jacobs argued, a complex problem akin to the life sciences. As a rich tradition of philosophical and geographical thought has suggested (Bergson, Lefebvre, and Harvey), the city is not a thing but a process. In order to reconcile process methodology and pedagogy, this essay explores six key ideas distilled from Jacobs' classic work "The death and life of great American cities". These six pedagogical tenets suggest a radical departure from the framework of "banking education", denounced by both Paolo Freire and bell hooks, and emphasize the need to engage students in an interdisciplinary and self-directed investigation of the city rooted in their own experiences. Incorporating the ideas of thinkers from many disciplinary traditions, this essay emphasizes that knowledge is a process involving the ongoing formulation of complex questions rather than the search for simple answers.

AB  - Undergraduate programs across the nation are increasingly offering interdisciplinary study programs as markers of their commitment to educate individuals for the demands of contemporary life. Yet, as students engage in interdisciplinary learning projects, an unaddressed question looms large: how to adequately assess student interdisciplinary work. How can faculty, trained to be disciplinary experts, properly determine what constitutes quality work when familiar disciplinary standards do not suffice? Adequately assessing student learning in higher education remains more a matter of collective hope than of convergent and well-tested practice. The issue is marred by controversies over the purposes, methods, and most importantly, the content of proposed assessments.  In this article, the author proposes a definition of interdisciplinary understanding and a framework to inform the assessment of student interdisciplinary work. The arguments presented stem from an empirical study conducted at the Harvard Interdisciplinary Studies Project. It examines interdisciplinary research and educational practices in well-recognized research centers and educational programs like the Media Lab at MIT, the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, and the Human Biology Program at Stanford University. Assessment of student interdisciplinary understanding was a central focus of this analysis of 50 faculty interview transcripts and more than 50 pieces of student work. Interdisciplinarity is an elusive concept. Stated definitions in the literature are varied, as are the enacted definitions that tacitly guide real teaching practices. The term is employed to describe a broad array of endeavors ranging from a biochemistry student learning about gene regulation, to a faculty member using the visual arts to introduce a mathematical concept, to a student's post-structuralist critique of the nature of disciplinary authority. This semantic elusiveness is exacerbated by the fact that current scholarly debates about interdisciplinarity involve social, political, cognitive, and epistemological dimensions. In interdisciplinary work, many possible integrations are viable. For example, autism can be explored at the crossroads of psychology and sociology by examining the unique forms of social discrimination associated with autistic children. Or it could be investigated at the crossroads of neurology and medical ethics--if one were to consider experimenting with novel medical procedures. The merit of an interdisciplinary integration should be assessed against the specific goal of each interdisciplinary enterprise. A rigorous account of the nature of interdisciplinary understanding--the epistemological foundations on which it stands and the cognitive challenges it presents--provides a blueprint for examining student interdisciplinary work, to find evidence of accomplishment, and to identify ways to support improved understanding.

AB  - The topic of psychoactive drugs is one of inherent interest to college students. We used this insight to design and implement a multidisciplinary undergraduate course with psychoactive drugs as the central theme. The Medical Science of Psychoactive Drugs examines the biological mechanisms underlying all major effects of psychoactive drugs, including the effects on the brain and other organs and tissues. Physiological principles, molecular mechanisms, and genetic factors involved in drug-induced therapeutic and adverse effects are emphasized. The course is open to undergraduate students at all levels and carries no prerequisites, and enrollment is limited to [similar to] 50 students. Major teaching modes include lecture, short homework papers on topics related to the previous class meeting, small-group discussions at several points during each class, and whole class discussions. Because of the diversity of students' knowledge of basic science, we employ a variety of methods designed to help students grasp the necessary scientific concepts. Our methods are intended to be inquiry based and highly interactive. Our goals are 1) to foster the development of an organized knowledge base about psychoactive drugs that will have practical applicability in the daily lives of the students; 2) to promote the rational application of this knowledge in thinking about current medical, social, legal, and ethical issues involving psychoactive drugs; and 3) to cultivate science literacy, critical thinking, and communication skills among students.

AB  - The geology program at Clemson University has instituted a new, six-semester-long undergraduate research course sequence that requires student participation in ongoing departmental research projects from their sophomore through senior years. As a part of a university-wide initiative focusing on undergraduate research, termed Creative Inquiry at Clemson University, the experience provides students with the opportunity to address real research problems in Earth science, gather their own data, and interact with a diverse group of students through interdisciplinary group projects that culminate in group presentations and the publication of research results. Students may choose from a variety of research project options, most of which involve environmental monitoring of selected parcels of an extensive tract of university-owned forest land near campus. Assessment of the pilot offering of the sophomore research experience indicated that students recognized the effectiveness of these courses in fostering better inquiry, analysis, and presentation skills.

AB  - In an effort to address K-8 teacher confidence in STEM and increase basic genetics knowledge to a level consistent with its importance in society, we have developed, implemented, and evaluated a 7-day teacher professional development workshop. The overarching goal of our workshop is to facilitate the implementation of innovative DNA-based classroom activities in K-8 classrooms by (i) increasing teacher content knowledge, (ii) increasing teacher confidence in teaching STEM, and (iii) developing teacher interest in using engaging activities, so they are empowered to teach new content in compelling ways. We relied on case-based learning to provide relevance and context to scientific content that was not initially familiar to many of the teachers. Here we describe the workshop and its evaluation. Overall results suggest positive gains in teacher learning, confidence, and interest in the scientific content, as well as the intention to incorporate the scientific content and activities into their teaching.

AB  - A focused scientific research effort on writing research and its relationship to language development and reading is needed to address the writing and broader literacy needs of today's and tomorrow's learners and workers. In the United States, as well as in many other nations, research on writing has been neglected in relation to the emphasis on reading and oral language more generally. The authors argue first for "why" there is a need for this refocused effort, "what" should be focused on, and "how" as a field we should consider moving forward and addressing this imperative. In addressing the "why," the authors argue that need is not limited to a particular age or developmental range but rather is broad-based, beginning with our youngest learners and continuing through those transitioning into post-secondary and the workplace. The clear message is that the picture is surprisingly similar across age ranges with a demonstrated need beginning with those coming from less advantaged backgrounds into formal education to the majority of students transitioning from twelfth grade into the workplace or post secondary settings. The authors suggest next steps for research addressing both "what" and "how": "what" areas of science are areas of high need and "how" the field may consider moving forward to address these needs. Interdisciplinary research on writing is needed that addresses and integrates cognitive, biological, and social-cultural traditions, contributions, and methods.

AB  - Students must be able to evaluate primary literature, yet few options exist within the undergraduate curriculum to develop the necessary skills. In this article, we offer an adapted journal club that provides students opportunities to critically analyze selected research articles, emphasizing scientific communication, critical thinking, and practical application of coursework. We include the primary instruments of the adapted journal club, teaching tips, and guided implementation recommendations, including tools to pre-designate student roles to examine specific aspects of the article. Using their preclass homework as a guide, students present their respective portions to the class as the class gains a collective understanding of the research design, experimental approach, and relative merits. This student-centric learning approach achieved significant gains in scientific literacy. Our data show a 37% increase in student abilities to analyze study design, a 61% gain in discerning primary from secondary sources, and gains of between 61% and 76% in the confidence to lead content-specific scientific discussions. We present this approach and suggest that grades, self-assessments, and surveys illustrate the benefits of the adapted journal club for the undergraduate learning experience.

AB  - This paper reports the findings of a study of the literacy perceptions and practices of general primary teachers (Key Stage 2) and post-primary science teachers (Key Stage 3) within two clusters of schools. The study also explores the possible impact on pupils of any difference in the language climate which may accompany them on their journey across this curricular interface. Interviews with science managers and teachers suggest a quite restricted view of literacy is taken in both phases of schooling with no evidence of any practices which may support the notion of curricular continuity. The different approaches to the introduction of scientific terminology, writing, reading and classroom discussion were reflected in pupils' accounts of their experience and clearly posed a problem for some. We suggest there would be merit in teachers adopting a much wider perspective on literacy which recognises the opportunities for developing the interrelated strands of "general literacy" and "the discourses of science" alongside "learning through language". By addressing each of these domains, and sharing practice across the key stages, a more comprehensive and coherent approach to "language, literacy and science learning" may result, in turn helping minimise the adverse effects of "language climate change".

AB  - In response to international concerns about scientific literacy and students' waning interest in school science, this study investigated the effects of a science-writing project about the socioscientific issue (SSI) of biosecurity on the development of students' scientific literacy. Students generated two "BioStories" each that merged scientific information with the narrative storylines in the project. The study was conducted in two phases. In the exploratory phase, a qualitative case study of a sixth-grade class involving classroom observations and interviews informed the design of the second, confirmatory phase of the study, which was conducted at a different school. This phase involved a mixed methods approach featuring a quasi-experimental design with two classes of Australian middle school students (i.e., sixth grade, 11 years of age, n = 55). The results support the argument that writing the sequence of stories helped the students become more familiar with biosecurity issues, develop a deeper understanding of related biological concepts, and improve their interest in science. On the basis of these findings, teachers should be encouraged to engage their students in the practice of writing about SSI in a way that integrates scientific information into narrative storylines. Extending the practice to older students and exploring additional issues related to writing about SSI are recommended for further research. (Contains 1 note, 3 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - Nanotechnology is viewed by those in favor of its development in two different ways, and the divide is not recent. This article describes the origins of the differing visions of nanotechnology and examines their broader impacts. The typical history of the field tells nothing about these differing visions, which perhaps misleads. At least two distinct camps among scientists and engineers pursue work on the nanoscale, but they rarely interact, and when they do, they get nowhere. This article looks first at definitional issues in the field; then turns to the common history of nanotechnology, the history's shortcomings, and one particular episode that highlights the divide; and then examines the broader impacts of this dispute. The divide among those interested in nanotech tells something about the way different groups of people see technology and the application of science. This historical review clarifies controversy over societal issues and terminology in nanotechnology. (Contains 2 figures and 17 notes.)

AB  - In 2017, the International Bureau of Education (IBE) at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) put forth seven global competences to address accelerating technological progress and increasing levels of complexity and uncertainty affecting many facets of society (Marope, 2017). These competences were used in examining participant discourse in a global, collaborative digital makerspace environment, where students ages 12 to 17 from six countries develop and share STEM-focused media artifacts. The participants communicate synchronously through video conference calls, referred to as online global meet-ups. The meet-ups allow students to present media artifacts they have created, share ideas, exchange information, and provide feedback. In this analysis, epistemic network analysis (ENA), a technique in quantitative ethnography, is used to examine the connections made among the IBE-UNESCO global competences in a meet-up involving participants from Finland, Kenya, and the U.S. ENA network models were created initially for the three sites, then further disaggregated by time segment to analyze how participant discourse patterns may have evolved in each context. Through this approach, the paper explores more broadly the interactive role of media making, cross-cultural engagement, and collaborative learning in the development of global competences in students.

AB  - A communicating science module was introduced into an advanced undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory course. The module was integrated into the course such that students received formal instruction in communicating science interwoven with the chemistry laboratory curriculum. The content of the communicating science module included three units: communicating science to different audiences, oral and poster presentation skills, and interviews and the press. To demonstrate their communicating science skills, students prepared poster and oral presentations on laboratory experiments conducted in the course. The oral and poster presentations replaced written laboratory reports for two of the experiments.

AB  - The current study investigated the effects of repeated readings to a fluency criterion with science text for seven students with disabilities using multiple probe multiple baselines across participants. Results indicated students met criteria on four consecutive passages. As shown on Standard Celeration Charts a majority of students' correct words per minute accelerated while incorrect words per minute decelerated on successive initial, intervention readings demonstrating reading transfer. Students' reading scores during post-test and maintenance out performed pre-test and baseline readings providing additional measures of reading transfer. The study also suggested a relationship with comprehension; students scored higher on oral retell measures after meeting criterion when compared to initial readings. Overall, repeated readings to a fluency criterion intervention improved science reading fluency for students with disabilities. (Contains 3 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - Drawing on what researchers and professionals in the field internationally report, this paper reviews educational technology as an emergent field. The review reveals the continuum of perspectives on what the field is, and how it is bounded or fragmented. The paper describes the field from two perspectives: the professional and scholarly and considers how the forms of knowledge differ and overlap in each domain. It posits some dichotomies which may frame the field such as science/social science and positivist/post-modernist. Finally the paper provides conceptual frameworks for distinguishing fields from each other and suggests what the categorisation of the field might mean, especially considering its emergent status in a rapidly changing context.

AB  - A simple and cost-effective laboratory experiment is described that extracts protoporphyrin IX from brown eggshells. The porphyrin is characterized by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. A chemiluminescence reaction (peroxyoxalate ester fragmentation) is performed that emits light in the UV region. When the porphyrin extract is added as a fluor to this chemiluminescence reaction, an eye-catching deep red glow is emitted from the solution. Using a familiar object, an egg, the experiment touches upon many aspects in chemistry (natural products isolation, structure and photophysical properties of porphyrins, photochemistry). Focus is placed on the understanding of the optical properties of protoporphyrin that enable the final chemiluminescence experiment. This project is appropriate for upper-level organic chemistry students, but might also serve in the advanced physical chemistry laboratory to facilitate a more detailed discussion of photophysical phenomena. Finally, the chemiluminescence experiment is suitable as an impressive stand-alone demonstration. (Contains 1 table, 3 figures, and 2 notes.)

AB  - By 2001, 15.9 million students were enrolled in 4,074 American colleges and universities; 2.2 million were enrolled in graduate and first-professional programs, more than half of them--1.4 million--at the master's level. Graduate enrollments rose about 38% between 1985 and 2001; first-professional enrollments increased 13% between 1990 and 2001 (Snyder, Tan, and Hoffman, 2004). More than 1.8 million degrees were awarded in 2001, 482,118 of them at the master's level and 308,647 at the first-professional level. Three times as many institutions award master's degrees (1,508) as doctorates (548). The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) projects that in 2013, 556,000 master's degrees will be awarded (Gerald and Hussar, 2003). This study provides analyses of the meaning of these numbers in terms of the multiplicity of clienteles enrolling in traditional and innovative master's programs, the factors that have historically motivated their participation, and current and future trajectories for the growth and diversity of master's education. Theoretical studies of the restructuring of disciplinary knowledge and the extent of its professionalization provide a conceptual vocabulary for understanding the complex factors and manifold mechanisms that contribute to its development in the professions and in the liberal arts and science. This study provides some historical background about the master's degree and looks at some of the trends in master's education. Throughout, this study takes the position that the master's degree has become a pivotal force in the economic growth of the university. Operating at the interstices of academic degrees, it contributes to the discourse of interdisciplinary innovation and organizational change. Its compatibility with emergent institutional forms and its short-term nature enhance its potential for development by master's and doctoral-granting institutions, whether they are public, private, or for-profit, operating in traditional or nontraditional modes of teaching and learning. The core of this report describes five fields that exemplify fully professionalized programs (accounting, business, education, engineering, and public administration). A separate chapter is devoted to the natural sciences (bioscience, geoscience, chemistry, and physics) where the master's degree plays a more prominent role, and another discussion reviews mixed trends in the humanities and social sciences where professionalization has assumed multiple meanings in some disciplines and, in the same institutions, interdisciplinary degrees are promoted as "nonprofessional." Interdisciplinary fields focus on the early examples of American Studies and liberal studies, now being reconceptualized to encompass disparate fields, and the emerging but vibrant  field of women's studies. The last two chapters look at some of the trends in master's education and summarize the findings of this study. This report also discusses the four mechanisms that will continue to propel the professionalized trajectory of master's education: (1) relation to technological advances; (2) global initiatives; (3) quality control and accountability; and (4) the convergence of academic and professional fields across disciplinary, departmental, and institutional boundaries.

AB  - As the healthcare climate shifts toward increased interdisciplinary patient care, it is essential that students become accomplished at group problem solving and develop positive attitudes toward teamwork. Team-based learning (TBL) has become a popular approach to medical education because of its ability to promote active learning, problem-solving skills, communication, and teamwork. However, its documented use in the laboratory setting and physical therapy education is limited. We used TBL as a substitute for one-third of cadaveric dissections in the gross anatomy laboratories at two Doctor of Physical Therapy programs to study its effect on both students' perceptions and academic performance. We surveyed students at the beginning and completion of their anatomy course as well as students who had previously completed a traditional anatomy course to measure the impact of TBL on students' perceptions of teamwork. We found that the inclusion of TBL in the anatomy laboratory improves students' attitudes toward working with peers (P?<?0.01). Non-TBL students had significantly lower attitudes toward teamwork (P?<?0.01). Comparison of academic performance between TBL and non-TBL students revealed that students who participated in TBL scored significantly higher on their first anatomy practical examination and on their head/neck written examination (P?<?0.001). When asked to rate their role in a team, a 10.5% increase in the mean rank score for Problem Solver resulted after the completion of the TBL-based anatomy course. Our data indicate that TBL is an effective supplement to cadaveric dissection in the laboratory portion of gross anatomy, improving both students' grades and perceptions of teamwork.

AB  - An element of current reform in science education worldwide is the shift from the dominant traditional algorithmic lower-order cognitive skills (LOCS) teaching, to the higher-order cognitive skills (HOCS)-promoting learning; that is, the development of students' capabilities including those of question asking (QA), critical/system thinking (CST), decision making (DM), problem solving (PS), conceptualisation of fundamental concepts (CFC) and the transfer of these within both the science disciplines and real life interdisciplinary situations. Accordingly, an innovative metacognition-promoting science teacher professional development course, integrating formal and informal science education, was developed and implemented within a traditional model, focusing on the HOCS skills of QA, PS, and CFC. The HOCS promoting teaching and assessment strategies of this course not only enabled participants to reflect on their own learning, but also facilitated their self-reflective assessment, utilising a pre-post designed research-based methodology. The results suggest that such, or similarly appropriate, metacognition-oriented courses can contribute positively to the development of science teachers' HOCS capability.

AB  - As networked digital information proliferates and modern society's need to have access to information irrespective of location rises, the education needed for the digerati, defined loosely as the digital intelligentsia, the whole class of "expert" digital information professionals, becomes an important area about which all information professionals should stay informed. This paper describes the three concepts--interdisciplinarity, interactivity, and interoperability--that are an integral part of digital library research and their use in the curriculum development, teaching, and learning of a specific area of study within Library and Information Science (LIS), namely knowledge organization (KO). KO, studied intellectually, self-referentially, and immersively, it is argued, can provide the foundation for the modern digerati. (Contains 3 tables and 5 footnotes.)

AB  - The "New Humanities" has called for new ways of engaging with Humanities texts; the European Science Foundation is just one major research funder to demand that the Humanities contribute to interdisciplinary collaborations. Meanwhile, traditionally trained disciplinary academics have resisted bringing traditional texts into interdisciplinary courses as "dumbing down the curriculum". This article analyses briefly the different epistemological, narratological and disciplinary genres in one text: Herodotus' "Histories" or "Enquiries". It concludes that Humanities study must include such texts, not only as disciplinary but also as supra-disciplinary exemplary ways of knowing. It sketches a New Humanities curriculum based on such a text that could fit the twenty-first century student to live in a super-complex, multi-paradigmatic and radically interdisciplinary world.

AB  - Undergraduate research experiences provide students with opportunities to engage in high-impact experiential learning. Although prevalent in the sciences, there are now extensive banks of case studies demonstrating the use of undergraduate research as an educationally enriching activity across many disciplines. This study investigated the diversity of undergraduate research opportunities available across a wide range of disciplines at a large, research-intensive, Australian university. Through extensive interviews, 68 undergraduate research programmes across 26 discipline-based schools were characterised. A typology of undergraduate research models is proposed, revealing key characteristics underlying the ways in which research experiences are embedded in undergraduate curricula across a diverse range of disciplinary contexts. This provides guidance to academics, administrators and policymakers seeking to improve student access to undergraduate research experiences.

AB  - This paper explores the influence of symbolic or representational learning materials on pupil engagement or learning outcomes, when 14-16 year old pupils use common types of science simulations. The project pilot phase involved three (15-16 year old) male pupils and a main phase involved twenty-one (14-15 year old) pupils. A retrospective accounts methodology (Clarke, 1998) presented pupils with a digital record of their "think aloud" (Ericsson & Simon, 1984) behaviour with the simulations, and they were asked for retrospective comment. Pre- and post-surveys were also used. This interaction record for two boys is used to illustrate the findings. This record was chosen, because the boys spoke aloud throughout the period of engagement, which generated useful data for microanalysis. Findings suggest that pupils working with science simulations face a trans-disciplinary demand (computer competence, information processing skills, traditional language proficiency, and science understanding.) In terms of traditional and subject literacy, pupils have to make sense of linguistically complex information when using common science simulations. They need to understand their subject, be confident and competent with the available technology, and possess language skills that enable them to establish links between the microscopic, macroscopic and symbolic components of science.

AB  - When times are good, there is little urgency to evaluate fundamental assumptions, as investments can be made in new projects and structures while the old continue. Constrained resources do not allow this luxury. The current economic crisis and associated budget woes in universities requires individuals to be open to more radical and rapid change than they are used to. This article describes a method to transform the academic organization of the university to fit the current mode of intellectual inquiry--which is broader, more individualistic, and more interdisciplinary than previous modes--and at the same time to conserve university resources. The method described in this article offers an alternative: to reduce the number of academic departments by combining faculty and their related intellectual interests into larger multidisciplinary groups. Such a strategy, not incidentally, also conserves university resources in hard times. (Contains 1 table, 4 figures, and 4 resources.)

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the implications of Media Literacy Education (MLE) in Turkey by analyzing the Primary School Curricula in terms of MLE comparatively in Turkey, Ireland and Finland. In this study, the selection of Finland and Ireland curricula is related with those countries' being the pioneering countries in MLE and the structural differences in their curricula. In other words, the selection of these countries serves as a model in terms of approaching to MLE as a separate course (Turkey), in a strand unit (Ireland) and interdisciplinary manner (Finland). The method used in this study was document analysis. The documents analyzed in the study were the Primary School Curriculum of these countries and also documents, such as reports, books and journals, published by governmental and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working on Media Literacy Education. Since a standard MLE for European countries does not exist, the curricula of Primary school education of Turkey, Ireland, and Finland were analyzed and interpreted in terms of (a) general outcomes and learning outcomes of the curricula, (b) content, (c) learning situation (methods and techniques) and (d) assessment and evaluation strategies. This study revealed that in the vision of Primary school curricula of Turkey, there are not any objectives related to MLE unlike Finland and Ireland Curricula. When analyzed the curriculum of each course this study also revealed that the objectives related to MLE are only implemented in Turkish Curriculum (1-5). On the contrary, in Ireland there are objectives related to MLE in English, Visual Arts, Mathematics, Irish language, and mostly in Science and Social Personal and Health (SPHE) curricula and it is included in the objectives of core curriculum in Finland. In addition to this, the objectives and learning outcomes of Turkey's MLE curriculum seems to aim at gaining knowledge and understanding the issues although they are focused on developing attitude, skills and values; and also developing active citizenship, intercultural communication, critical thinking skills and creativity in Finland's and Ireland's curricula. Considering the findings of the study, it is suggested that MLE should be a skill-based teaching rather than a stand-alone subject in Primary school curricula. (Contains 1 footnote.)

AB  - Both the National Science Education Standards (NSES) and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) recommend appropriately incorporating mathematics into other disciplines (NRC 1996; NRC 2003; NCTM 2000). With this in mind, an interdisciplinary, inquiry-based project was undertaken to incorporate mathematical analysis of data into a physiology course and to give both physiology and statistics students' real data with which to work. The project involved collaboration between the two classes in data collection, analysis, and presentation. Results of the pre- and post assessments indicate that the attitudinal and cognitive objectives were met using this model. (Contains 4 figures and 5 tables.)

AB  - Social work research and teaching draw on the literature of other disciplines. While the use of interdisciplinary sources has been discussed at length and citation patterns in social work literature have been studied, no research has identified specific sources from other disciplines that are important for social work scholarship. Based on analysis of citations from core social work journals, several journals from both social work and other disciplines are identified as important to social work. Interdisciplinary citing patterns are discussed, and the coverage of various subjects in "PsycINFO", "SocINDEX", "Social Work Abstracts", and "Social Services Abstracts" is compared.

AB  - "Health, Technology, and Aging" is a course developed to address three significant contemporary trends: aging populations, increasingly ubiquitous technology, and the economic imperative to encourage entrepreneurship. Course content is a blend of gerontology, informatics, and entrepreneurship designed for nonbusiness majors. Six interdisciplinary faculty modeled synergistic teamwork for the student teams. Findings suggest that students appreciated the interdisciplinary approach to teaching and learning and perceived gerotechnology as a promising market for business development. An external panel of judges scored student projects as well described, persuasive, and creative. Two plans of the four projects were judged to have potential for funding. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - This article explores microprocesses and transactions during 7 months of collaboration for sustainable food education involving two teachers of home economics and a school food manager in a Finnish secondary school. Data sources included interviews and multi-professional meetings, the professional reflections of participants and a researcher's diary. Leaning on previous literature, we revisit and develop the concept of shared food sense (joint understanding, collective application, redefinition of co-action) as a tool for analysing the learning outcomes of collaborative multi-professional work. Accordingly, the outcomes were conceptualized as context-bound decisions and compromises that were collaboratively reached after the emergence of tensions in the process. The results highlight the need to acknowledge the complex relationships among systemic, institutional, interpersonal and intrapersonal tensions in multi-professional work, as well as to conduct a critical review of the work division, the professional motivations and the opportunities for mutual communication among participants in such alliances.

AB  - Electronic textiles are a part of the increasingly popular maker movement that champions existing do-it-yourself activities. As making activities broaden from Maker Faires and fabrication spaces in children's museums, science centers, and community organizations to school classrooms, they provide new opportunities for learning while challenging many current conventions of schooling. In this article, authors Yasmin Kafai, Deborah Fields, and Kristin Searle consider one disruptive area of making: electronic textiles. The authors examine high school students' experiences making e-textile designs across three workshops that took place over the course of a school year and discuss individual students' experiences making e-textiles in the context of broader findings regarding themes of transparency, aesthetics, and gender. They also examine the role of e-textiles as both an opportunity for, and challenge in, breaking down traditional barriers to computing.

AB  - The first Master of Science in Information Quality (IQ) degree is designed and being offered to prepare students for careers in industry and government as well as advanced graduate studies. The curriculum is guided by the Model Curriculum and Guidelines for Graduate Degree Programs in Information Systems, which are endorsed by the Association for Computing Machinery and the Association for Information Systems. The curriculum integrates two key educational innovations: (1) an interdisciplinary approach to curriculum design, and (2) a balance between theoretical rigor and practical relevance. In response to the demand from industry, the curriculum aims to educate students who can lead the effort to solve current and future information quality problems. As such, "problem-based learning" is balanced with "foundation-building learning" to effectively deliver the intellectual contents of the curriculum. Much of the individual course content is based on cumulated research results and practices developed over the last two decades. The curriculum is designed to balance information quality theory with industry best practices using modern tools and technology. It includes the skill sets that are critical to succeed as IQ professionals. Since IQ is an inter-disciplinary field, the curriculum draws upon total quality management, database, core knowledge of IQ, change management, project management, and IQ policy and strategy. The courses are delivered using case studies, hands-on laboratories, theory building, and team projects to enhance the student's learning experience. Upon completing the program, students will be equipped with sufficient breadth and depth in the IQ field to solve real world problems and pursue further studies. (Contains 2 tables and 3 notes.)

AB  - The Humanities have much to offer 21st-century Europe, in terms of both method and issues which may complement and correct those of Science and Social Science. These include, for instance, humanities' generation of plural narratives and plural explanations, of attention to singularity and complexity, and to others' sensibilities and ways of knowing. These disciplines provide higher order skills needed to engage and engage with the New Europe--rhetorical and communication skills, networked knowledge sharing, responsive and responsible citizenship. In interdisciplinary partnership with "hard" science research, the Humanities can offer ways of dealing with particularity and imagination, with issues of identity and sensibility, with encountering the other. At the same time, the humanities' own complex interpretative narratives and ability to generate and cope with complexity are vitalizing and enabling in a fearful, complex and supercomplex world.

AB  - Twentieth-century novelist and physicist C. P. Snow famously stated that solving the world's complex problems requires collaboration between humanists and scientists. Here, the authors agree with Snow and illustrate one integrated educational approach that bridges the two cultures of science and religion to transform the learning and teaching of science. George Ellis, the renowned humanitarian and physicist, refines and enhances Snow's vision, describing the need for three integrated and equally important kinds of experts required to address contemporary complex issues. These are focused basic researchers, generalists who take a broad view, and synthesizers who integrate the two (Ellis 1994). They believe there are approaches to enhancing science education and developing learners of all three types Ellis identifies. (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - Background: In this paper, we consider music education in a broad sense-not merely pertaining to the development of exceptional levels of artistry in talented performers, but also to notions of musical listening and appreciation enjoyed by the casual listener. Purpose: This review cannot be exhaustive, but aims to illustrate what we already know about the neuroscience of how music is perceived, appreciated, learned and performed, and the implications that this knowledge has for music education in this broadly defined sense. Design and methods: Extant studies from across the fields of neuroscience, psychology, education and music were surveyed using mainstream Internet databases (e.g., PubMed), as well as specific Internet cites promoting interdisciplinary exchange among musicians and scientists (e.g., Music and Science Online: http://www.science.rcm.ac.uk). The result is a review of some 50 studies from across this relatively young field. Conclusions: To date, examples of tangible, practical advice from neuroscience that can be applied directly to musical learning and performance are relatively scant. However, the field is growing rapidly, and collaborations between musicians and scientists are becoming more common. We argue that the scope for neuroscience research to inform and shape musical education is ripe for development, particularly when musicians and scientists work together to address questions of musical relevance with scientific rigour.

AB  - This article uses "fibbin" (Fibonacci poems) as an instructional strategy to teaching reading and writing across the curriculum. It describes fibbin from a historical and mathematical perspective and discusses it as an adaptation of the famous Fibonacci sequence to teaching content area material (e.g. science, math, and social studies). This instructional strategy is described and samples of student work that resulted from these strategies are presented and discussed. Variations to this strategy and lessons learned from the whole experience are included. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - This paper is an essay on the state of Australian education that frames new directions for educational research. It outlines three challenges faced by Australian educators: highly spatialised poverty with particularly strong mediating effects on primary school education; the need for intellectual and critical depth in pedagogy, with a focus in the upper primary and middle years; and the need to reinvent senior schooling to address emergent pathways from school to work and civic life. It offers a narrative description of the dynamics of policy making in Australia and North America and argues for an evidence-based approach to social and educational policy--but one quite unlike current test and market-based approaches. Instead, it argues for a multidisciplinary approach to a broad range of empirical and case-based evidence that subjects these to critical, hermeneutic social sciences. Such an approach would join educational policy with educational research, and broader social, community and governmental action with the aim of reorganising and redistributing material, cultural and social resources.

AB  - The Department of Chemistry at American University has replaced its junior- and senior-level laboratory curriculum with two, two-semester long, student-led research projects as part of the department's American Chemical Society-accredited program. In the first semester of each sequence, a faculty instructor leads the students through a set of previously performed experiments and introduces the students to a research project, specific laboratory techniques, and instrumentation. As such, the first (fall) semester takes the form of a control experiment. During the second (spring) semester, students design and carry out experiments of their own choosing that are based on their research interests and that build upon the first semester's work. In the subsequent academic year, the research is continued by a new set of students. The research from the previous academic year's second semester becomes the control experiments of the current academic year's first semester. In this way, the research project continually grows and develops according to student decisions. During these two semesters, students are assessed on their ability to perform experiments, maintain proper record keeping, designing and following safety protocols, proposal writing, and written and oral presentations of their work. This program, which grants ownership, or autonomy, of a research project to our student body, has been well received by the students, helped to meet departmental objectives, and led to a research publication and a funded grant proposal.

AB  - This article surveys historical scholarship on science education over the last 15 years and lays out a map of the different approaches to writing about this topic found in a variety of disciplines and fields. The hope is to provide scholars interested in science education past and present a better understanding of how this enterprise has functioned in western culture, both in terms of training future scientists and managing the relationship between science and the lay public. Highlighted in this article is the compartmentalised nature of current work which, I argue, presents an obstacle to more productive thinking about the history of science education in modern society.

AB  - The aim of this experiment is to study and calculate the kinetic constant of a Heck reaction: the arylation of but-3-en-2-ol by iodobenzene catalyzed by palladium acetate in presence of triethylamine in DMF. The reaction leads to a mixture of two ketones. Students use GC analysis to quantify reagents and products of reaction. They control the global order of the reaction and prove that the two products are formed by two reactions that are in parallel. Finally, they calculate the rate constant for each reaction. Students calculate iodobenzene conversion, each product selectivity, yield, and catalyst turn over number (TON). These calculations are controlled using an internal standard, (-)-fenchone. This experiment is completed by students during their second-year kinetic laboratory and is done in pairs in a four-hour laboratory. This work allows students to work in the fields of organic and analytical chemistry, catalysis, and kinetics at the same time. (Contains 5 schemes.)

AB  - This paper describes the details of a National Science Foundation multi-year educational project at the University of Oklahoma (OU). The goal of this comprehensive active-learning and hands-on laboratory program is to develop an interdisciplinary program, in which engineering, geoscience, and meteorology students participate, which forms a community of university scholars. The program is intended to generate a unique, interdisciplinary, research-oriented learning environment that will train future engineers and meteorologists in the full set of competencies needed to take raw radar data to detect weather and aircraft. The program involves new coursework and is oriented around other successful programs to ensure wide distribution by many students and scientists. Supported by the Division of Undergraduate at the NSF, the project began with a Phase II grant in the fall of 2004, which also recently received a Phase II grant to refine the project through 2010. In keeping with the global movement of electronic knowledge delivery via written, as well as visual media, several weblinks have been established for this paper.

AB  - Mathematics can be defined as "the science of pattern and order" (Van de Walle, Folk, Karp, & Bay-Williams, 2009, p. 10). But because there is often a perceived spectrum of approachability to mathematics (based on common misconceptions that envision the subject as a sort of elitist wizardry) it is important to bear in mind different definitions of mathematics when exploring applications of mathematics in the classroom. This is especially true when considering the instruction of mathematics for social justice. In this article, the authors explain how the study of social justice is increasingly in need of empirical methods to describe, defend, and advise the critical analysis of the systems of domination and subjugation that permeate human power structures. The study of mathematics, which often needs a meaningful context in which abstraction and anxiety can be nullified, is the ideal symbiotic partner for the study of social justice in the greater pursuit of equipping students with the effective tools needed to thrive in the 21st century. Without a literacy of mathematics and social justice, students will be at the mercy of sociopolitical and economic systems of oppression.

AB  - The author examines how problem-based learning (PBL) and technology may be combined in the English literature classroom in order to inspire various types of collaboration, which, in turn, improves critical reading, thinking, and writing skills; hones research skills; encourages interdisciplinary study; energizes discussion; enforces connections between class content and students' lives; and establishes learning practices to be used beyond the confines of the classroom and the course term. To date, PBL has been used the most in math and science courses in higher education. The author demonstrates how this pedagogy may be implemented successfully in humanities-based courses.

AB  - This study examined the development of two Distance Learning (DL) courses and their effect on students' perceptions and learning experiences. Our study included about 260 science and engineering graduate students. Among them, 105 students were divided into two research groups: on-campus students (N=70) and DL students (N=35). These two groups served as a traditional classroom setting and an online setting, respectively. Data was collected through an online questionnaire consisting of both open-ended and close-ended questions and analyzed via the mixed methods model. Findings indicated that the DL students asserted positive perceptions of their learning experiences compared to the on-campus students. Female DL students were more confident about their ability to communicate with their classmates and lecturers in comparison to their male DL peers. We also found that younger students, in comparison to older ones, held higher positive opinions about the quality of the DL courses and the support they received from the lecturer and the teaching assistants. Content analysis revealed four main categories related to lifelong learning via DL: cognitive and professional skills, affective learning, social interactions, and resource management. Learning about students' perceptions of and experiences in DL is an important step toward improving the next generation of online courses in higher education.

AB  - The Massachusetts Institute of Technology started the first US chemical engineering program six score years ago. Since that time, the chemical engineering curriculum has evolved. The latest versions of the curriculum are attempts to broaden chemical engineering to add product engineering, biology and nanotechnology to the traditional process engineering, chemistry and energy. Although there have been attempts to add flexibility, the chemical engineering curriculum remains monolithic (all students take almost identical sequences of courses) and hierarchical. Chemical engineering textbooks have tremendous staying power because authors have time to adapt to slow changes in the curriculum. Chemical engineering has been somewhat schizophrenic--chemical engineering research has covered all areas in which chemical engineers believe they can make a contribution, but departments have been notably unwilling (until recently) to expand the borders of the undergraduate curriculum. Despite the conservatism of ChE departments, chemical engineering has been at the forefront of helping new professors learn how to teach and individual chemical engineering professors have been leaders in the push for engineering education reform. Examples of chemical engineering leadership in pedagogy include the Chemical Engineering Division of ASEE Summer School every five years, the Division's publication of the journal Chemical Engineering Education, and leadership in teaching professors how-to-teach. Individual efforts include the development of the guided design method, introducing Problem Based Learning into engineering, laboratory improvements and hands-on learning, the textbook "Teaching Engineering," and the championing of cooperative group learning. Despite these efforts, most ChE professors insist on lecturing. This paper will provide a brief history of chemical engineering programs, curricula and pedagogies.

AB  - Given the low turnout among younger voters, it is important to seek innovative ways of engaging students in the electoral process, and a presidential year like this one offers exciting opportunities for doing so. In this article, the author describes her experiences with a schoolwide project designed by herself and colleagues that simulates the election campaigns by having students run as the presidential and vice-presidential candidates of each party. The project engages several school departments as well as social studies: English (which provides a press corps and media coverage), math (which conducts surveys and tallies results), science (which identifies candidates' policies on the environment), and foreign languages (for a review of candidates' policies toward countries associated with a designated language).

AB  - This paper focuses on the concept of extracognition. It reports a qualitative study that explored the perceived experiences of doing science with an artistic spirit through the voices of living scientists who also engage in the arts. The purpose was to understand how accomplished scientists who engage in the arts make sense out of their experience of doing science. Four highly able scientists with expertise in their field who also self-identified as actively engaged in the fine arts were given voice on their perceived experiences of doing science. Through hermeneutic phenomenological methodology using thematic analysis, four major themes emerged. This paper focuses on one theme, "Feeling Connected to Something More through the Arts." Three sub-topics are explored in relation to extracognition: (a) intuition, (b) serendipity, and (c) spirituality. The role of the arts is emphasized in attaining such experiences. Educational implications, limitations and strengths, and future directions are discussed. (Contains 2 tables, 4 figures, and 1 footnote.)

AB  - Founded 25 years ago, The City College Center for Worker Education (CWE) recently became a division of the college's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the Department of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences. CWE, as it is known, caters to working adult students. All classes are held one evening per week for three hours and 20 minutes, and all carry four credits. Approximately 80 percent of the students are female; most are more than 30 years old. Due to a university-Â­wide change in admission policy, most students currently entering CWE transfer as rising juniors. Virtually no students enter without some earned college credits, and most have already earned credit for college-level "composition" courses, often within the City University of New York system. And yet, many, if not most, admit when entering to feeling ill equipped to write for their upperÂ­-division, interdisciplinary electives at CWE. A brief overview of the program is provided in this article. The following topics are presented: (1) Program History and General Description; (2) Theory Informing the Program; (3) Mechanics of the Program; and (4) Restraints Guiding the Program's Growth.

AB  - A unique, interdisciplinary collaboration between chemistry and classics has led to the development of an experiment for nonscience majors. This instrumental analysis experiment was designed for use in an archaeology course to quantify the amount of lead in ancient bronze coins. The coins were corroded beyond visual identification, so provenance could be determined only through chemical analysis. Students digested coin subsamples in acid, prepared and diluted the resulting solutions, then utilized flame atomic absorption spectroscopy for the measurements. External calibration with acid-matched lead standards was used. A certified reference material was analyzed with the coins for method validation. Results were compared to published data to obtain a list of possible coin identities. (Contains 3 tables, 1 list, and 1 figure.)

AB  - We report the results of a study focused on identifying and articulating an ''epistemic foundation'' underlying a pre-collegiate focus on engineering. We do so in the context of UTeach"Engineering" (UTE), a program supported in part by funding by the National Science Foundation and designed to develop a model approach to address the systematic challenges facing this work--from identifying learning goals, to certifying pre-and in-service teachers for engineering courses to developing a research-based high school engineering course. Given the systemic nature of the UTE approach, this model is positioned to serve as a starting point to further the conversation around two of the National Academy of Engineering Committee on Standards in K-12 Engineering Education (2010) central recommendations for future work in this area: (1) Identification of core ideas in engineering, and (2) creation of guidelines for instructional materials. Toward that end, project faculty and staff were interviewed and/or surveyed about their views on the goals and outcomes of engineering and engineering teacher education, as well as strategies design to reach these goals and the warrants for them. Data were analyzed following a grounded protocol. The results align well with previous efforts to identify ''core engineering concepts, skills, and dispositions for K-12 education'' (National Academy of Engineering Committee on Standards in K-12 Engineering Education, 2010, Annex to Chapter 3).

AB  - This article discusses a class project on residential segregation in Florida's metropolitan areas for which students analyzed trends regarding African Americans relative to white populations using data from 1980 to 2000. The project provided a means of teaching the importance of geographical perspectives to nongeography students in an interdisciplinary learning environment. In a literature search that assessed nationwide trends, students identified a mixed outcome for Florida's urban areas. Through the research process, students learned the value of spatial concepts from geography in relation to other social science perspectives. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - Of the 205,000 U.S. students abroad during the 2004-2005 academic year, only 6,557 or slightly more than 3% of them studied in Germany. The Ohio Alliance reports that only 13% of all U.S. students who studied abroad during the 2004-2005 academic year were from the STEM fields of study. The Institute of International Education Open Doors Report, however, does not provide a breakdown of the number of American students per academic field of study in specific countries or regions. For this reason it is difficult to know how many U.S. students in the STEM fields are actually studying and/or researching in Germany each academic year. This report maps patterns of study abroad in Germany by U.S. students in the Scientific, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields and to learn what, if anything, Germany is doing to attract these students to its universities and research institutions. It also looks at the academic trends in the STEM fields in both the United States and German higher education systems in order to better understand the international educational opportunities for U.S. students to study these disciplines abroad in Germany. Finally, it investigates if there are current developments or policies in Germany to attract U.S. students and in particular students in the STEM fields to study and/or research in German universities and institutes.

AB  - Through a grant from the Regional Alliance for Science, Engineering, and Math (RASEM[squared]), funded by the National Science Foundation, a research study was conducted to explore the use of handheld technology with students with disabilities in elementary and middle school settings. The purpose of the project was to (a) introduce electronic task analyses to teacher candidates during their student teaching semester, (b) integrate technology into K-12 classrooms, and (c) determine the effectiveness of handheld technology with students with disabilities. The research questions addressed were: What happens when pre-service teachers are asked to create task analysis for students in their classroom? How will the use of task analyses help individuals with disabilities become independent learners? The overall impact of the project was positive. K-12 students increased their time on task, submitted more assignments, worked independently, and posed fewer questions to their teachers. Process information, case studies, and data analysis are presented. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Prevention science, like service learning, is a relatively young field. However, in a short period of time, prevention has made significant progress in its scientific maturation, while SL research has lagged behind. Prevention science has made rapid progress because of its recognition of a multistage research cycle, reliance on interdisciplinary work, and success in developing strong university-community partnerships. Given the prevailing climate for accountability in education, SL researchers will need to increase the scientific rigor of their work. SL researchers should become more familiar with how prevention scientists conduct research. By following the lead of our prevention science colleagues and, where possible, teaming with them as interdisciplinary colleagues, SL researchers may move the field forward more rapidly.

AB  - This article will define the engineering design process used to create an integrated curriculum at STEM Center Middle School, and it features the planning, implementation, and revision of the Deconstruction Geography unit. The Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) Center opened in the fall of 2009 as a way to relieve overcrowding at the district's only other middle school. The teachers at the new STEM Center were a mix of volunteer transfers and new hires, empowered by the opportunity to create a school from the ground up. The experience of a metadisciplinary (Werth, 2003), fully connected, and integrated curriculum was transformative for the teachers at the STEM Center. Consistent with the middle school ideal of teacher teams, the metadisciplinary approach erases lines among disciplines and creates "a larger curricular focus that transcends or supersedes traditional disciplinary boundaries to create a truly holistic, systemic, integrative worldview uncluttered by familiar limits and barriers" (Werth, 2003, p. 36). While experiencing this curriculum, the teachers quickly realized that it was the Engineering Design Process (EDP) that allowed the deep connection among the content. The EDP from the Museum of Science, Boston (2012) has five steps including: (1) Ask: What is the problem? What have others done? What are the constraints?; (2) Imagine: What are some solutions? Brainstorm ideas. Choose the best one; (3) Plan: Draw a diagram. Make lists of materials you will need; (4) Create: Follow your plan and create it. Test it out; and (5) Improve: Talk about what works, what doesn't, and what could work better. Modify your design to make it better. Test it out. The idea for the Deconstruction Geography unit evolved from a story in the news. The news clip described a conflict over minerals in Africa that were being used to assemble products in Asia that were sold and consumed in the US and Europe. That news story inspired the idea that technological artifacts could be used to travel the world, thinking about why certain products were manufactured in particular places and how all of these items journeyed to the classroom. Drawing from the state standards, a teacher developed a set of prioritized learning goals that he called power standards, in order to encourage students to analyze primary sources to understand people, places, and environments; explain patterns of trade and global interdependence in a changing world; and identify how people organize for the production, distribution, and consumption of goods.

AB  - For successful and productive careers, undergraduate students need effective communication and critical thinking skills; information literacy is a substantial component in the development of these skills. Students often perceive communication courses as distinct and separate from their chosen discipline. Faculty from the Departments of English and Horticulture and the library at Iowa State University collaborated in a foundation communication course (English 250). The course incorporates five components--finding information sources; evaluating information sources; and preparing an annotated bibliography, a research paper, and a research poster--all within the context of horticulture. The objective of the collaboration was to integrate communication and information literacy concepts into English 250 and relate these concepts to the students' discipline of horticulture. Assessment data and focus group discussions strongly validate students' appreciation for an interdisciplinary approach to teaching communication and information literacy skills within the discipline.

AB  - In contrast to typical National Science Foundation program evaluations, the Utah State Math Science Partnership-Research, Evaluation and Technical Assistance Project (MSP-RETA) provided technical assistance (TA) in two forms: direct TA for up to 10 projects a year, and professional development sessions for a larger number of project staff. Not surprisingly, the two forms led to different results in terms of involvement and use. Most of those who participated in the direct technical assistance activities were positively affected and sought additional support and development. Project staff who were not included in the direct assistance efforts were more likely to report limited involvement and use.

AB  - "Flipping" the classroom employs easy-to-use, readily accessible technology in order to free class time from lecture. This allows for an expanded range of learning activities during class time. Using class time for active learning versus lecture provides opportunities for greater teacher-to-student mentoring, peer-to-peer collaboration and cross-disciplinary engagement. This review of literature addresses the challenges of engaging today's students in lecture-based classrooms and presents an argument for application of the "flipped classroom" model by educators in the disciplines of family and consumer sciences.

AB  - This interdisciplinary paper is about applying Adult Education methods of learning and teaching to higher education. I argue that higher education students need to be stimulated via interactive methods that improve their motivation and lead them to question the value system/s that exist around them. A Freirean approach as used in the teaching of Adult Literacy and English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) was applied to a group of "elite" students at the University of Birmingham who were taking a language foundation course. As a sociolinguist and ESOL practitioner from a black perspective, I argue that the understanding of concepts of language and racism, imperialism and social class can best be facilitated using such an approach. Taking groups of students through this learning journey is challenging for higher education practitioners and the results add a relatively new dimension to the collective reflection on learning and teaching in higher education today.

AB  - In a 2012 blog post, John Maeda discusses the idea that while science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education plays an important role in innovation, limitations exist when we focus exclusively on STEM. Maeda advocates for the addition of the "A" for Art to the acronym, insisting that the arts promote the creativity and ingenuity necessary for economic progress in our nation. Providing students with opportunities in which they can access all the integrated components of STEAM makes sense: STEAM engages students and results in more permanent learning by allowing them to see how the knowledge and skills are developed and applied across content areas. Situated within Oregon's "Silicon Forest" where high-tech industry abounds, Hillsboro School District's Quatama Elementary School educators have prioritized providing these kinds of opportunities for their students. Because Quatama is a designated STEAM school, students regularly experience integrated STEAM lessons, many of which have been developed through partnerships with the Portland Metro STEM Partnership (PMSP) and the Right Brain Initiative. These organizations have supported Quatama throughout the STEAM-transformation process, offering guidance in determining both student and teacher outcomes, establishing partnerships with local STEM and art professionals, and providing professional development opportunities. This article describes how one collaboration emerging from these partnerships resulted in the development of an instructional unit in which wire sculptures were used to reinforce concepts about electrical circuits. As Quatama teachers continue to participate in these types of collaborative opportunities that put the "A" in STEAM, students are benefited as they develop the creativity and persistence needed for learning in STEM subjects. While the process described was originally used with second-grade students, the article includes recommendations about how the unit can be modified to increase the rigor so that it is appropriate for fourth-grade students. A materials list is included for the activity in the instructional unit.

AB  - Studies of protein function increasingly use multifaceted approaches that span disciplines including recombinant DNA technology, cell biology, and analytical biochemistry. These studies rely on sophisticated equipment and methodologies including confocal fluorescence microscopy, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography that are beyond the scope of traditional laboratory courses. To equip the advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students with an enabling base of knowledge and initial experience with advanced protein research methodologies, a laboratory course entitled "Plant Cells and Proteins" was developed in a partnership between Washington University and the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis. In this one semester course, 10-12 students obtain hands-on experience with plant tissue culture, gene transformation, subcellular localization of fluorescent recombinant proteins using confocal microscopy, purification of affinity-tagged recombinant proteins, isolation of total protein extracts, enzymatic assays, one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, MALDI-TOF and ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometry, protein crystallization, and X-ray diffraction. The course is taught as a series of modules, each led by an expert researcher. Students are evaluated based on a series of graded written reports and tests of their mastery of key concepts, interpretations, and the limitations of the experimental methods.

AB  - Given that postsecondary institutions are increasingly seen as sites to promote health, critical scholars are calling attention to how the contemporary Western weight-centred health paradigm reinforces a "size matters" message that is fueling harmful attitudes towards and judgments of bodies. As such, research that highlights strategies to promote safe teaching and learning environments for students and faculty, regardless of body shape and size, is of utmost importance. Through 26 participant interviews, this study examines the experiences of critical obesity scholars who teach courses that engage critical approaches to obesity, fatness, and body size. The findings of this study shed light on the developing field of critical obesity scholarship, the types of challenges faced by critical obesity scholars in higher education, and how these scholars are building community as a way of coping with challenges facing the emerging field.

AB  - Teamwork and the interprofessional collaboration of all health professions are a guarantee of patient safety and highly qualified treatment in patient care. In the daily clinical routine, physicians and nurses must work together, but the education of the different health professions occurs separately in various places, mostly without interrelated contact. Such training abets mutual misunderstanding and cements professional protectionism, which is why interprofessional education can play an important role in dismantling such barriers to future cooperation. In this article, a pilot project in interprofessional education involving both medical and nursing students is presented, and the concept and the course of training are described in detail. The report illustrates how nursing topics and anatomy lectures can be combined for interprofessional learning in an early phase of training. Evaluation of the course showed that the students were highly satisfied with the collaborative training and believed interprofessional education (IPE) to be an important experience for their future profession and understanding of other health professionals. The results show that the IPE teaching concept, which combines anatomy and nursing topics, provides an optimal setting for learning together and helps nurses and doctors in training to gain knowledge about other health professionals' roles, thus evolving mutual understanding.

AB  - In 1959 C.P. Snow believed that communication and education could span the cultural gap between the sciences and the humanities. In the twenty-first century, language, research models, and academic structures hinder intellectual communication between art history, cognitive neuroscience and perceptual psychology--three disciplines dedicated to researching vision and visualization. Multiple definitions of basic words such as image, perception, and perspective invite confusion and differences in professional tone can lead to misinterpretation about the validity of research. Standards of evidence vary according to assumptions about what is real, such as the use of photographs in brain scan research to study visual responses to physical objects. However the reward system of universities creates barriers that are harder to surmount than disciplinary differences. American universities promote interdisciplinary research in theory, but in practice faculty evaluation reinforces disciplines by following a vertical path from the department to the administration. Universities prioritize original research delivered in conventional text publications and devalue research, original or synthetic, that aims for an audience beyond fellow academics. Ironically, universities tend to denigrate "educational" publications and the lower the age of the audience, the less value accorded the research. This creates another cultural divide where interdisciplinary concepts long rejected in the face of academic research persist in K-12 education and popular culture. Examples include Betty Edward's "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" and Jean Piaget's developmental model of children's art that associates western linear perspective in art with maturity.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: To examine how positive/negative message framing -- based on peripheral cues (regarding popularity, source, visuals, and hyperlink) -- affects perceptions of credibility of scientific information posted on social networking sites (in this case, Facebook), while exploring the mechanisms of viewing the different components. Background: Credibility assessment of information is a key skill in today's information society. However, it is a demanding cognitive task, which is impossible to perform for every piece of online information. Additionally, message framing -- that is, the context and approach used to construct information-- may impact perceptions of credibility. In practice, people rely on various cues and cognitive heuristics to determine whether they think a piece of content is true or not. In social networking sites, content is usually enriched by additional information (e.g., popularity), which may impact the users' perceived credibility of the content. Methodology: A quantitative controlled experiment was designed (N=19 undergraduate students), collecting fine grained data with an eye tracking camera, while analyzing it using transition graphs. Contribution: The findings on the mechanisms of that process, enabled by the use of eye tracking data, point to the different roles of specific peripheral cues, when the message is overall peripherally positive or negative. It also contributes to the theoretical literature on framing effects in science communication, as it highlights the peripheral cues that make a strong frame. Findings: The positively framed status was perceived, as expected from the Elaboration Likelihood Model, more credible than the negatively framed status, demonstrating the effects of the visual framing. Differences in participants' mechanisms of assessing credibility between the two scenarios were evident in the specific ways the participants examined the various status components. Recommendations for Practitioners: As part of digital literacy education, major focus should be given to the role of peripheral cues on credibility assessment in social networking sites. Educators should emphasize the mechanisms by which these cues interact with message framing, so Internet users would be encouraged to reflect upon their own credibility assessment skills, and eventually improve them. Recommendation for Researchers: The use of eye tracking data may help in collecting and analyzing fine grained data on credibility assessment processes, and on Internet behavior at large. The data shown here may shed new light on previously studied phenomena, enabling a more nuanced understanding of them. Impact on Society: In an era when Internet users are flooded with information that can be created by virtually anyone, credibility assessment skills have become ever more important, hence the prominence of this skill. Improving citizens' assessment of information credibility -- to which we believe this study contributes -- results on a greater impact on society. Future Research: The role of peripheral cues and of message framing should be studied in other contexts (not just scientific news) and in other platforms. Additional peripheral cues not tested here should be also taken into consideration (e.g., connections between the information consumer and the information sharer, or the type of the leading image).

AB  - Metabolism, the sum of all chemical reactions within a living organism, is one of the most fundamental concepts presented in introductory microbiology courses. However, it is often difficult for instructors to effectively translate perfunctory diagrams of glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain in a way that is meaningful to students. An understanding of metabolism is integral to the appreciation of microbial life, and it behooves microbiology instructors to place the study of metabolism in a context that facilitates this appreciation. The electrochemical nature of many biological processes may provide an avenue for such an endeavor. Biological fuel cells link respiratory reactions within a microbial cell with reactions that occur in electrochemical cells. The generation of an anodic electrode potential, or flow of electrons, within the biological fuel cell is catalyzed by the oxidative degradation of substrates by microorganisms. This article presents an exercise that describes the construction and testing of a simple biological fuel cell. While this biological fuel cell is not highly efficient or state-of-the-art in its design, it can be constructed and run with materials common to most biological laboratories. The exercise requires students to think in a multidisciplinary way, drawing on their knowledge of biology, chemistry, biochemistry, and physics. This system can serve the dual purpose of demonstrating the potential benefits of microbial life as well as providing context for the study of metabolic pathways. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - While teaching science in an alternative arts high school, the author continuously addresses the challenge of welcoming creative, right-brained students into the world of systematic inquiry. Busily mixing paint colors, choreographing futuristic dances, performing comedic theater, and practicing the banjo, the students rarely initiate authentic science endeavors. In this article, the author assigns two arts-based science projects to bridge the gap between students' artistic reality and scientific possibilities. These two projects focus on immunology and human evolution. Immunology lends itself to a guided inquiry lesson in which students receive specific direction regarding the nature and content of their projects. Students completing artwork related to human evolution explored the subject via an open inquiry format. These lessons guide students through diverse avenues of creative thought that lead to a common understanding of science principles. Based on their success with these projects, the students gain an increased comfort level in science. These activities are useful to teachers in a variety of school settings, as the lessons embrace differences in student learning styles. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - A qualitative model of a system is an abstraction that captures ordinal knowledge and predicts the set of qualitatively possible behaviours of the system, given a qualitative description of its structure and initial state. This paper examines an innovative approach to science education using an interactive learning environment that supports learners in expressing and simulating conceptual knowledge by building qualitative models in ecology. The learning environment and tools are being developed as part of the DynaLearn qualitative modeling research project, funded by the European Union's 7th framework programme and carried out by a consortium of eight participant universities. In summing up the results, it is clear that from the perspective of systems thinking, the modeling activity affected students' perception of systems making them able to represent it in a more dynamic and comprehensive way.

AB  - A kindergarten class learns about inventions, inventors, and how to be an inventor. Engaging students in learning about pencil sharpeners led to researching and developing a lesson plan designed so students could learn how inventions are solutions to problems. Through identifying, researching, and brainstorming new inventions, the students practiced inventing a solution for a mock problem. As a class, in small groups, and individually, students were able to use scientific inquiry by posing questions, designing, and building solutions with natural and human-made materials. They tested their inventions, revised them, and reported results to the class. This lesson integrated subjects such as language arts, social studies, math, and art while meeting national science education standards. (Contains 2 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - An important objective of science and technology education is the development of pupils' capacity for systems thinking. While in science education the term system relates mainly to structures and phenomena in the natural world, technology education focuses on systems designed to fulfill people's needs and desires: examples include systems to control the local environment, or the position or motion of objects. Despite the centrality of the system concept to technology and technology education, issues relating to the teaching and learning of systems within the technology curriculum have been little addressed. This paper explores some elemental structures common to technological feedback control systems, and highlights the relationships between the structural nature and the dynamic behavior of these systems. It is argued that the study of systems and control concepts in technology has the potential to promote higher learning skills such as interdisciplinary thinking and modeling, and an instructional framework for achieving this goal is proposed. Questions and research issues on the fostering of systems thinking in technology education are identified.

AB  - Because innovation is essential to the future of our society and because there is a need to prepare college students to succeed in business organizations, it has become increasingly important to investigate the factors that enhance or discourage creativity and innovation. College professors have a vital role in introducing students to the fundamentals of innovation and, depending on how they do, can potentially encourage or discourage the innovation process. This study focused on the communication and motivation in the innovation process of faculty in a multidisciplinary course comprised of agricultural economics, biosystems and agricultural engineering, and agricultural communication majors at a large land-grant university. Results demonstrated that students did not always find faculty communication effective, and findings among students in the three majors were different in faculty communication ratings. The data show there are positive relationships between students' perceptions of faculty communications and students' motivation in capstone courses. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - Evidence-based practice (EBP) is now a well-known paradigm for the athletic training (AT) profession. The Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education accredited programs have required EBP as an explicit focus for professional education, and researchers are gradually producing insightful and relevant evidence concerning the education and implementation of clinically based EBP in educational programs. Likewise, many clinicians are attempting to incorporate EBP into their daily practice in order to guide and enhance patient care, and the Board of Certification has mandated regular EBP education in order to maintain national certification status. Although there remains much work to be completed before AT can claim to be a health care profession that is saturated with EBP, there is growing evidence of positive momentum toward that goal. However, the extent of EBP implementation remains limited to clinically based, patient-oriented outcomes. To date, there is little suggestion that the profession of AT has used an evidence-based approach for other related aspects of its professional practice. To that point, a multifactorial and more comprehensive model for evidence-based AT (EBAT) is presented with the intent of better situating and centering the potentiality for a larger evidence-based culture to inform and guide the AT profession's 3 critical subcomponents practice, regulation, and education. We attempt here to expand upon the paradigm for EBP as a precondition for an overarching, more inclusive EBAT model. To do this, we will introduce and interconnect 2 other critical aspects of professional practice: evidence-based regulation and evidence-based education. Alongside EBP, both evidence-based regulation and education are fundamentally interrelated and vital components of an effective, comprehensive, and progressive evidence-based profession of AT, or EBAT.

AB  - Learning modules provide an effective means of encouraging cognition and active learning. This paper discusses several such modules that have been developed within a course on weather radar applications intended for students from Electrical Engineering and Meteorology. The modules were designed both to promote interdisciplinary exchange between the students and to guide them from a theoretical to an applied understanding of weather radar and the interactions of radio waves with geophysical media. The learning modules introduce students to various means of acquiring weather radar data from real-time and archival sources and ways in which to query and visualize them. They are also tasked with analyzing data from several actual and significant meteorological events and asked to assess the strengths and limitations of current methods of retrieving rainfall rates. Data sources include both weather radars and complementary surface-based instrumentation. The modules may be used in a variety of locations and by a diversity of students. Although developed for weather radar applications, the concepts discussed are applicable to other interdisciplinary classroom environments. (Contains 3 tables and 5 figures.)

AB  - Science and design and technology (D&T) are often linked, either formally in the curriculum or by making connections in and between lessons. There has been much debate about how this linking serves the needs of the two subjects and what, in practice, the actual relationship is, as the current English National Curriculum (DfEE, 1999) identifies them as separate subjects. This is in opposition to an earlier view, that is pre National Curriculum, that they could be treated as one indistinguishable area of learning characterised by problem-solving activities. In this article the authors discuss the whys and hows of linking science with design and technology. (Contains 4 figures and 2 boxes.)

AB  - The relevance of the investigated problem is caused by the objective necessity of construction of the Russian examination practice, taking into account the leading trends in the education system development, where student-activity approach advocates the dominant, and insufficient development of this issue in both the theoretical and methodical plan, based on the primary focus of the examination content on reproductive component, does not dock with the modern educational realities. Objective of the research: to develop and pedagogically substantiate the didactic conditions and means of improving the examination control procedures at a vocational school in the conditions of modernization of Russian education, drawing on diagnostically specified learning objectives and focus on personal characteristics of the student. Leading approach to the study of this problem was the holding of a retrospective analysis of the literature on the quality control of the educational process, the analysis of the actual state of the problem of examination quality control of preparation of students of professional institutions in theory and practice, with the purpose to identify the didactic conditions and means of improving the examination control in a vocational school. The author's version of pedagogically-based examination procedures in a vocational school in the conditions of modernization of education is represented in the article, developed on the basis of the revealed didactic conditions (diagnostic mission objectives, focus on level and student-activity approaches, reflected in the structure and content of the exam, correcting pre-exam training) and means (typology of examination tasks, complex advisory activities). The article represents practical significance for using by vocational school teachers in the process of organizing and carrying out the examination; researchers in the field of vocational training in the study of problems related to the examination control.

AB  - A systematic and longitudinal analysis of all of the education-related articles published in two of political science's oldest journals reveals that political science has aided our knowledge of education by focusing on the distribution of power in the decision-making process, the organization and governance of public school systems, and the outcomes and effects of education policy decisions. Moreover, the present data suggest that only a tiny fraction of the major articles published in traditional political science journals have focused on education and that those political scientists conducting education research turn to multidisciplinary education journals as outlets for their scholarship.

AB  - Educators expect students to question, explain, hypothesize, and devise tests to determine validity concerning science and its applications. The traditional approach of presenting individual courses concentrating on single disciplines and ignoring linkages to other disciplines is abysmal. If we expect students to understand how science is related to the humanities, it is important to provide the links and bring the disciplines together in a coherent interdisciplinary course using Science, Technology, and Society together in a constructivist methodology. Science, Technology, and Society and constructivism recognize that science does not operate in a vacuum nor does student learning. Knowledge is continuing being assembled by learners and science learning must be taught in the scope of the human experience and understanding.

Simple and creative methods of conveying information--such as humorous, light-hearted analogies to lighten the mood--reduce the abstractness of the material and alone can effectively relieve anxiety and facilitate learning. Students then become active learners through creative writing assignments. (PVD)
