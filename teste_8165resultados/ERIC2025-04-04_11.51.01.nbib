AB  - Objective: This systematic review examined the impacts of therapy dogs on the social and emotional wellbeing of K-12 students. Procedure: Five electronic databases (PsycINFO, Informit A+ Education, PubMed, Web of Science and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global) were searched to find English language, grey literature and peer-reviewed articles up to November 2020. Results: A narrative synthesis of 23 articles indicated that therapy dogs may enhance students' mood and positive emotionality, social and communication skills, confidence and their relationship with teachers. Inconsistently, other studies reported that therapy dogs may not enhance the social and emotional wellbeing of students. Conclusion: The current research is characterised by methodological limitations and an over-reliance on the perceptions of students and teachers. To enhance the quality and reliability of the evidence, future researchers are encouraged to adopt more rigorous methodologies with larger sample sizes and control procedures. It is also recommended that the perceptions of school leaders, other educational personnel and interdisciplinary health professionals are incorporated into future studies. This may contribute to a greater level of consensus in the educational sector about the impacts of therapy dogs on the social and emotional wellbeing of K-12 students.

AB  - "Online learning"--learning that involves interactions that are mediated through using digital, typically internet-based, technology--is pervasive, multi-faceted, and evolving, creating opportunities and challenges for educational research in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this special issue, we advance an interdisciplinary agenda for online learning research at the intersection of educational technology, educational psychology, and the learning sciences. In this first article in the issue, we define online learning including its variants, review historical and current contexts, explore its multidimensionality, and assert key issues shaping contemporary online learning. We propose five important lenses: "community," "engagement," "pedagogy," "equity," and "design-based research," through which scholarly communities are creating knowledge that influences research and practice in online learning contexts. These lenses highlight points of conceptual overlap between the online and psychological learning literatures. The special issue is organized around these lenses and includes an article representing each one, complemented by commentaries that offer critical appraisal and synthesis.

AB  - San José State University, in partnership with California State University-Los Angeles and Cal Poly Pomona, was awarded a prestigious 2015 First in the World grant, sponsored by the Department of Education. The multi-campus effort is focused on bringing the flipped classroom model to seven STEM gateway courses over three years that have high failure rates through collaborative efforts from faculty on the three partner campuses. SJSU, CSULA, and CPP are all designated Hispanic-Serving Institutions and Minority-Serving Institutions, though their demographics are very different. High impact practices like the flipped classroom approach have been shown to increase URM student success and retention. Development/selection of course materials that promote active learning and student engagement is shared among the faculty collaborators, a divide-and-conquer approach to overcoming the often overwhelming challenge of creating a full length flipped classroom. The first courses currently being flipped are Calculus I and Physics I. In addition to promoting student success through active learning pedagogy, our approach also includes a multi-disciplinary, cross-campus faculty learning community (FLC) that serves as a model of active learning for our faculty, as well as providing training and support during development and implementation of the flipped classroom. Our flipped classroom model and FLC are based on the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework, which states that an educational experience is a blend of social presence (establishing strong relationships), cognitive presence (moving beyond understanding to exploration, integration, and application), and teaching presence (a combination of environment and directed facilitation components). Initial data on student success as a result of the flipped classroom implementation in Calculus I and Physics I will be presented. In addition to student success data, qualitative data on student and faculty satisfaction with the flipped classroom will also be presented.

AB  - This study examines students' reflections on how concepts covered in a marketing course are applied to the broader liberal arts curriculum. The objective was to demonstrate when given a chance with an Interdisciplinary Reflection Assignment, students can articulate interdisciplinary relevance. The study collected sample data from six classes over three years. The assignment embodies the areas of metacognition, reflection, and integration of interdisciplinary knowledge. A content analysis approach was utilized to review both quantitative and qualitative data. Students' comments are categorized as follows: 32 in "Humanities & Fine Arts"; 31 in "Natural Sciences & Mathematics"; 93 in "Social Sciences & History"; 6 in "Professional Studies" (College, 2019). The assignment results strongly suggest that, when asked, students can articulate the integration of a business marketing course with other liberal arts subject areas. Thus, demonstrating business has a legitimate place in the liberal arts curriculum. This study contributes to education literature by providing a specific pedagogical example that can be easily replicated by other educators at other higher education institutions. The assignment offers added value to enhance student learning and appreciation of how marketing concepts integrate with other academic disciplines.

AB  - Higher education is based on a disciplinary system and science-specific educational programmes, but multi/interdisciplinarity (MD/ID) knowledge, working methods and collaboration are becoming common in the workplace with complex tasks and digital work environments. This article will provide an insight into these issues by presenting a study of the organisation of work in the high-tech metals industry, studying firms whose production is based on specialised technology, i.e. in the convergence of industrial branches. Given that knowledge of many disciplinary fields and methods are prerequisites, this convergence suggests a MD/ID work organisation to cope with the specialised technological infrastructure. The aim of these case studies is to examine how MD and ID are actualised in the organisation of work sites in the converged metals industry. The data consist of interviews collected from firms and expert organisations.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the science teachers' perceptions of and beliefs about integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in the science curriculum. A case study research method was used to determine teachers' perceptions and beliefs of integrated STEM education in the science curriculum. The research was conducted with the participation of ten science teachers who worked in secondary schools located in different regions of Turkey. In this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted for data collection. The data obtained from the study were analyzed using content analysis. During the content analysis process, open and axial coding steps that are based on grounded coding were followed. According to the findings, teachers' perceptions of STEM education knowledge were examined under three categories: STEM education concept knowledge, curriculum knowledge, and STEM education implementation knowledge. In the study, it was determined that most of the teachers considered themselves inadequately prepared for integrated STEM education in the science curriculum. When teachers' beliefs regarding the problems that might be encountered during an integrated STEM education process were examined, it was found that the emphasis was especially on teacher-based problems. Furthermore, teachers believed that integrated STEM education would have positive effects on teachers, students, and science education.

AB  - Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education has emerged as a powerful tool for boosting students' mathematics achievement. By integrating these disciplines, students are equipped with essential skills for the 21st-century workforce and can develop a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts. Through hands-on experiments, problem-solving activities, and real-life applications, STEM education offers a dynamic approach to learning mathematics. This quasi-experimental study aimed to investigate the impact of STEM education on mathematics achievement among 8th-grade students. Although the study lacked the full randomization typically seen in experimental designs, it meticulously designed and validated its measurement tool for assessing mathematics achievement. The pre-and posttests administered to both the experimental and control groups provided valuable data for evaluating the effectiveness of the STEM education intervention. The statistically significant difference in mathematics achievement between the two groups, with a significance level of = 0.05, strongly suggests that the STEM education program had a positive and meaningful impact on the experimental group's math skills. As a result, the study offers valuable insights into the potential benefits of integrating STEM education into the curriculum for middle school students. Students are encouraged to think critically, collaborate with their peers, and utilize their creativity to solve complex problems. This interdisciplinary approach fosters a deeper engagement with the subject and ignites a passion for learning.

AB  - Cornell University has long offered a Calculus for Life Sciences course. In this case study, we report on how a team of pure mathematicians has modernized both the content and teaching methods of this course. The content went from a standard calculus course with few genuine applications in the life sciences to a course focusing on dynamical systems and bifurcation theory with deep connections between two disciplines. We describe how we have determined the new content, created the teaching materials using active learning and implemented the course in the classroom. We show how bifurcation theory can provide a fruitful framework to study interesting applications of mathematics in the life sciences. Finally, we report on the challenges we have faced and what we have done to mitigate them.

AB  - Geography as a discipline is a multi-disciplinary science which has an ability to reach out to masses through its very nature. It has an in-built affinity towards technology which has been integrated in the subject even before many other Social Science subjects adopted it. The visible collaboration of Geography with technology started during the post Quantitative Revolution period when computer was adopted for research and study of various aspects of the subject. Since then, integration of technology into the subject has come through various ways and has resulted in achieving far reaching goals. The focus of the paper primarily rests at discussing various ways in which ICT can be integrated in teaching and learning of Geography at the school level. This has been reached through tracing the origin and implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in India, its components and tools.

AB  - In our interconnected world, what does it mean to teach global environmental issues to young children? Using theoretical foundations from the social justice learning community and child-directed, inquiry-based learning best practices, this practitioner reflection details a seven-week, student-centered, interdisciplinary learning experience conducted in the author's classroom. This exploration of the Amazon rainforest and deforestation promoted content knowledge development across fine arts, math, earth science, English language arts, and social studies disciplines; standards-based skills acquisition; collaboration; self-determination; and critical engagement among students in a diverse kindergarten class at a public school in Los Angeles County, California, in the United States. To guide the development of the project, an appropriate social studies framework was utilized along with the popular culture resource "3 Questions That Can Change The World" from the Kid President enterprise. Students conducted research and took concrete action through a variety of projects, including raising and donating funds for injured wildlife and reporting on their experiences verbally, in writing, and graphically. I analyzed my field notes, reflective teacher journal, and student work samples to improve my practice and pedagogical progress in teaching young students about global environmental issues. In this process of critical reflection and action inspired by Freire's (1993) concept of praxis, I found that inquiry-based learning that encourages students to ask meaningful questions, investigate answers through interdisciplinary learning, and find meaningful solutions to the problems they encounter increases their self-determination.

AB  - This study focused on teachers' transfer of a variety of teaching methods from a teaching module on nanotechnology, which is an example of a topic outside the science curriculum, to teaching topics that are part of the chemistry curriculum. Nanotechnology is outside the science curriculum, but it was used in this study as a means to carry out a change in the way chemistry teachers teach. The participants in the study included nine high school in-service chemistry teachers. Three research tools were used: (1) semistructured interviews that were conducted with the teachers, after they had finished teaching their nanotechnology module, and follow-up semistructured interviews that were conducted 2 years after the teachers had taught the nanotechnology module , and teachers' assessment and evaluation of their own teaching method, determining how the nanotechnology modules influenced the students who learned according to this program. The data collection process continued for 5 years. Most of the teachers indicated that they continued teaching the nanotechnology module that they designed and all of them stated that they integrated the unique teaching methods into their teaching of chemistry. High efficacy beliefs were built based on the self-evaluation process that was part of the teachers' professional development program. Teaching self-efficacy beliefs and organization efficacy beliefs was found to contribute to teachers' sustainable changes. The findings in the current research are only limited to the topic of nanotechnology; however, we believe that similar results can be obtained for any modern scientific topic that is outside the high school science curriculum. We suggest that more research should be done to determine whether the same findings emerge by using the same approach but on another topic.

AB  - Successful integration of digital technologies in the education of young children still needs to be solved. Despite a growing body of research focusing on learning through digital technologies in childhood, there are areas of knowledge where the impact of digital technologies has yet to be explored. A prominent example is nanoscience and nanotechnology (NST), a new interdisciplinary field that promises to solve long-standing global challenges. Considering that NST concerns elements that cannot be observed with the naked eye, their understanding by young children requires appropriate teaching methods. These distinctive aspects of NST align well with the capabilities of smart mobile devices, the critical feature of which is their ability to display interactive simulations and playful visualizations. This study investigates and compares the effect of using tablets and alternative experiential teaching on developing the ability to understand nanoscale elements. To implement the research, we conducted a week-long intervention, including experimental and control groups. Children in the experimental group participated in a nanoteaching session during the school curriculum, using educational software on tablets. The children in the control group participated in a precisely similar instruction but without using technology. To assess the children's performance, the Nanoscale Elementary Knowledge Comprehension Test (TENANO) created for the needs of this study was used. The sample consisted of 101 s-grade primary school children in Greece. The results showed that teaching with tablets compared to alternative experiential teaching contributed significantly to developing young children's nanoliteracy level. Moreover, gender and non-verbal cognitive ability did not seem to differentiate the development of children's ability to understand nanoscale entities.

AB  - Scientific literacy can be promoted through oral and written argumentative practice. Collaborative discourse has proven effective in fostering conceptual understanding, especially when discussions are developed under deliberative goals. Likewise, writing tasks as argumentative syntheses stand out for its epistemic value and its contribution to constructive learning processes. However, there are no known educational interventions that have combined these two didactic activities to teach science. The objective of this research was to compare the impact of four intervention programs, based on deliberative dialogues and argumentative synthesis writing activities, on the learning of socio-scientific content. The four programs resulted from the combination of two instructional components (Explicit Instruction; Guide), while deliberative dialogues and argumentative syntheses were constant elements. We conducted a pre-post quasi-experimental study in which participated 151 Spanish third grade secondary school students. Socio-scientific learning was evaluated through a content test made up of open questions. The results showed all students progressed in their socio-scientific knowledge. Instructional practices did not have a direct effect on content learning. However, we observed an indirect effect of explicit instruction on learning socio-scientific content, through learning of argumentative synthesis writing. Besides, we found a positive relation between progression in synthesis writing and knowledge acquisition.

AB  - Purpose: Free and open-source software (FOSS) has been used worldwide because of the advantages of user control, cost-saving, flexibility, openness, freedom, more security and better stability. The purpose of this study is to explore the status quo of educational application of FOSS and the trends from international perspectives and its implications for higher education in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach: The method of cluster analysis was used in this study. The Web of Science database was used as the data source and all relevant literature for the year 2010-2020 on the theme of "FOSS" was collected for analysis. The information visualization software CiteSpace was used for citation visualization analysis, revealing the research results of FOSS worldwide, including hot spots and development trends. Findings: This paper found that FOSS has become an important research area and is playing an important role in the reform and development of education. Meanwhile, the development and application of FOSS have regional imbalances and strong differentiation, including the educational sector. The paper also found that although FOSS has entered the stage of interdisciplinary development, the research and development of FOSS in the field of education is insufficient, which poses a huge challenge to decision-makers, teachers and students. Originality/value: Implications for higher education in Hong Kong including: attach importance to and vigorously promote FOSS research and practice to benefit more teachers and students; teachers and students need to be trained for acquiring the awareness and skills of FOSS applications and formulate different strategies; the government should provide greater support to formulate and implement a short and middle-term development plan to facilitate the application of FOSS; and Hong Kong higher education institutions may strengthen exchanges and cooperation with counterparts around the world to jointly promote the development of FOSS. It is hoped that the findings will provide a reference for the study and application of FOSS in higher education in Hong Kong.

AB  - By framing entrepreneurship courses in the context of interdisciplinary team projects, students build important work-related skills whether they pursue an entrepreneurial path or employment after graduation. However, the traditional classroom environment is not conducive to realistic interdepartmental interactions found in most corporations or startups. The authors describe a model for interdisciplinary collaboration between students in entrepreneurship and computer science engineering programs to cultivate the development of real software products. The authors outline the partnership and illustrate how sister courses covering lean startup and agile software development methodologies complement each other to foster realistic projects.

AB  - This paper reflects on teaching sport in political geography undergraduate courses in the United States, through which I simultaneously aim to de-essentialize geopolitics and de-essentialize sport. I integrate sport examples in diverse courses on political geography and teach a dedicated "Geopolitics of Sport" course. By framing my approach to the political geographies of sport around the specific term "geopolitics," I deliberately tap into a sense among Americans that it is a "more serious" topic than "geography." Since students in my courses rarely come from Geography, but are primarily majors in Political Science and International Relations, "geopolitics" invites them to approach sports geography as a serious subject and to be more open to the field of geography. Since geography remains a neglected subject in US schools and universities, teaching sports geography through geopolitics, and geopolitics through sports geography, can be a powerful way to encourage critical geographic reasoning, especially among non-geography majors.

AB  - This work is a course proposal for a stronger ethics education component for chemistry undergraduates. We propose that this course should integrate different approaches in ethics with the value-laden and scientifically complex issues that arise in chemistry. Although some programs require that students take some ethics as a core requirement, for many it is just an option among many humanities courses. Alternatively, ethics may arise passively during courses devoted primarily to chemistry. For our proposed course to be maximally effective, we believe it should integrate both ethics and chemistry, inviting students to think about complex real-world problems. This allows students to identify ethical considerations in the context of cases they might encounter as part of their careers in chemistry. It would also provide them with resources to identify the best course of action.

AB  - Looking at the current discourse on how to teach disaster, one apparent gap is that the scientific aspect of disaster is discussed and taught mostly in isolation from its human aspect. Disaster educators seem to be primarily interested in addressing issues such as social vulnerability, community resilience, personal action-related knowledge and emotion rather than the scientific basis of disasters, whereas science educators often fail to make connections between the scientific accounts of disasters and the social and political contexts that surround them. In this theoretical paper, I claim that this disconnect is problematic and that overcoming it is a key to understanding and teaching disaster in a more nuanced and comprehensive manner. Drawing primarily on science and technology studies (STS) on disaster, I explore the potential of interpreting disasters as failures of socio-technical systems, which helps us unearth the inner workings of the complex network of science, technology and society in the wake of calamities. STS challenges the dichotomous understanding of the material and social worlds and takes a view that they shape each other to constitute socio-technical systems. Taking such an approach to disaster allows a synthetic understanding of the natural, technological and human-made disasters that we are faced with in the age of uncertainty and complexity. Based on the ideas of STS and examples of recent disasters in East Asian countries, I argue that disaster education and science education can cross-pollinate in tackling the post-disaster hardship and cultivating responsible citizens.

AB  - Connections among the mathematics, science, and engineering disciplines have been recognized and affirmed in national standards. For example, the application of mathematical ideas and skills within science has been highlighted in national science standards for over 20 years. More recently, the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS; NGSS Lead States, 2013) incorporated computational thinking (Wing, 2006), engineering design, and a K-12 strand of performance expectations in engineering, technology, and applications of science. To ensure opportunities for mathematical development within a science context, a focus on mathematical modeling can be productive (Stohlman, 2018): a process of using mathematics to represent, analyze, and make predictions regarding complex, reality-based phenomena (Garfunkel & Montgomery, 2019). The importance of developing students' capacities for mathematical modeling at every grade level is underrealized, yet it offers noteworthy advantages for deep mathematical learning while also charting a way forward in mathematics and science integration. This article examines how an elementary teacher integrated mathematics and science to engage fourth graders in an authentic inquiry exploring sustainability solutions for their school.

AB  - Purpose: There are different perspectives about STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education. Understanding in-service and pre-service teachers' views plays an important role in supporting K-12 students to choose careers in science, technology and engineering. This research aims to understand science and mathematics in-service and pre-service teachers' views about STEM integration and robotics applications. Research Methods: The participants of this study were 240 science and mathematics pre-service teachers and 27 science and mathematics in-service teachers. Participants answered open-ended questions. Data were gathered to find the differences between teachers and future teachers from different disciplines (science and mathematics) with emphasis on their views about STEM and robotics implementation. Findings: Analysis showed that there were some differences based on disciplines (mathematics and science), but also there are some similarities between in-service and pre-service teachers' views. Mathematics in-service and pre-service teachers provided few details when explaining the effect of STEM and robotics applications. Science in-service and pre-service teachers, on the other hand, presented more ideas about STEM integration while including fewer ideas about robotics applications. Implications for Research and Practice: There are differences between disciplines in favor of science in-service and pre-service teachers. However, it is hard to say that in-service and pre-service teachers from each discipline were able to present strong examples of STEM implementation. These results suggest the necessity for more interdisciplinary support provided to in-service and pre-service teachers from different disciplines.

AB  - In 2019 India was ranked seventh most affected nation by climate change, yet 65 per cent of the Indian population had not heard of climate change. India's revised National Education Policy mentions climate change and environmental issues as part of its work towards reaching the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. However, to date, climate education in India has tended to remain the responsibility of the secondary science teacher in many schools where resources are limited. Following calls for a more holistic and multidisciplinary approach -- where students can link environmental issues with their lives -- we reflect on three arts-based climate education exemplars with students from the East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW) (n = 150, 10-17-year-olds). We consider how these frame climate change and sustainable education as a collective learning experience, rather than as scientific concepts alone. We respond to Szczepankiewicz et al.'s model for climate education and propose that teacher training in the EKW context can be conceptualised through a three-stage, interconnected approach to pedagogy: building concepts, learning through hands-on activities and building communities is central. We suggest that these three generalisable tenets of student teacher practice should be explored in other areas of ecological fragility, as well as in spaces of economic insecurity.

AB  - The combination of organic synthesis and analytical chemistry into a related laboratory experiment is an excellent demonstration of the utility of making a compound to then be used further. Herein we describe an undergraduate laboratory experiment that involves the straightforward synthesis of an internal standard, ethyl 6-acetyloxyhexanoate, for the quantification of various aroma compounds in juice through GC-FID analysis. In addition to the organic synthetic procedures of undertaking a reaction under reflux, separation, and extraction protocols followed by determining the purity of a synthesized compound, this experiment also facilitates the teaching of making standard solutions, using solid phase extraction, preparing samples, and performing and interpreting the results of GC-FID analysis.

AB  - The complex nature of contemporary challenges requires a culture of cooperation between academic disciplines. However, to what extent do educational systems prepare students to think beyond the boundaries of austerely defined and often entrenched academic fields? UNESCO has successively called for Environmental Education, Education for Sustainable Development, and Education for Global Citizenship to incorporate complex socio-environmental issues into mainstream education. Despite the presence of strong institutional support by governments and international organizations, the introduction of these interdisciplinary approaches into actual educational settings has been slow. With no intention to underestimate the pertinence and agency of strong political will in promoting educational change, we explore the presence of deeper, epistemological issues that may account for the generally slow progress of interdisciplinary pedagogies. To elaborate on this discussion, we focus on pragmatic solutions that can promote the integration of environmental, sustainability, and global citizenship education into the existing educational ethoi.

AB  - This study focuses on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education teachers' perspectives on integrating indigenous knowledge systems (IKS) into a multidisciplinary STEM framework to promote sustainability. The aim is to understand how integrating the values, ethics and worldviews of the global community can contribute to a sustainable mindset. Through an examination of the research background and pedagogical foundations, as well as a review of existing literature, it becomes evident that teachers' perspectives are pivotal in fostering a sustainable mindset among students. To encourage social dialogue that has the potential to evolve teachers' perspectives, a 6 month workshop focused on dialogic argumentation was provided to a group of basic education and university STEM teachers. The workshop aimed to explore the evidence- and reasoning-based arguments that influenced their perspectives regarding the role of IKS in STEM education. Analysis of data collected through questionnaires and interviews yielded the following findings: (a) initially, most teachers had mixed feelings about the role of IKS in STEM education for sustainable development; (b) a significant number of teachers reported that the dialogic argumentation workshop helped them transition from a negative to a positive attitude towards acknowledging the complexity of the role of IKS in promoting various approaches to achieving sustainability goals; and (c) several others, particularly university teachers, attributed IKS with the potential to enhance reflective reasoning in order to solve complex sustainability problems. The implications of these findings for classroom practice, particularly in terms of utilising IKS to enhance STEM teacher education, are highlighted in the paper.

AB  - During a classroom-based study, Grade 4 students were provided with multiple opportunities to develop their visual meaning-making skills and competences, as well as their aesthetic understanding of and critical thinking about multimodal texts. Intentionally designed instruction during the research included a range of activities focused on specific elements of visual art and design. Student participants read and discussed, and wrote about selections of children's literature during Language Arts, Social Studies, and Science. "The Sea Book" was one of the books featured during an interdisciplinary unit on Ocean Literacy, a component of the overall case study research. Content analysis of the students' responses about the trade book revealed their capacity to engage in five synergistic visual reading skills. As well, data analysis revealed how the students perceived, described, and interpreted the use of color, visual point of view, typography, framing and line in Milner's artwork as fulfilling multiple, and often concomitant, meaning-making purposes. The findings demonstrated that instruction about how to read and understand visual representations can enhance students' knowledge and interpretation of content conveyed through multiple modes of representation, and develop students' capacity and agency for critically reading visual and multimodal texts.

AB  - The integration of faith and learning (IFL) is an integral part of Christian higher education. The recent years have seen a spate in published studies testifying to an intense pursuit of meaningful IFL by many institutions of Christian higher education. However, little scholarship has been devoted to explore the influence of faith integration in science and its effect on the spiritual growth of students. A private, Christian university in the Southwest United States, has integrated the Christian worldview (CWV) in at least 30% of courses in college programs. Instilling the core Christian convictions into each student's total college life has been one of the distinctive tasks of the University. The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) to understand how CWV develops in Biology and (2) how IFL affects the personal faith of students. The data was collected, over a period of three consecutive years 2016 to 2018, from students preparing for Health Care and Science careers. Using the survey design with open-ended questions, 489 participants provided responses to articulate the Christian worldview perspective of microorganisms and diseases. Findings reveal a positive impact of IFL on the personal faith of students. The results also indicate students demonstrating growth in their understanding of the biblical worldview within the context of Biology.

AB  - Teamwork skills are an important part of business school curriculum typically taught using project-based experiential methods. This paper presents best practices for teaching teamwork skills to Gen Z students using a project-based learning, peer mentoring approach. With experiential learning theory as a guide, an interdisciplinary process was developed between an introductory programming course and a capstone business project management course to improve experiential learning and overcome issues like the free-rider problem. The opinions and sentiments of peer mentors were examined using text analysis and sentiment analysis. Peer mentoring between two interdisciplinary courses was found to reduce the free-rider problem and was beneficial for both classes.

AB  - Laboratory classes are a central element of all biochemistry and molecular biology programs. These play a role in developing students' hands-on and technical skills and also offer much more. The design of laboratory classes depends on many factors including the programs the students are enrolled in, the level they are at, employment destinations, and learning outcomes. This conference session considered the design and outcomes of laboratory experiences for undergraduate students.

AB  - Social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic presents mental health and academic obstacles for students. As mental health can strongly influence academic performance, addressing the loss of community by transitioning to distance education, midsemester, is imperative. This work draws upon the community and wellness benefits associated with online gaming and applies it to ChemDraw. The goal is to improve the class' wellness and social community while teaching valuable organic chemistry skills. In this paper, a molecule, speed-drawing tournament (Molecule Madness) is presented along with reflections describing the impacts on student wellness and organic chemistry skills. Gamification of ChemDraw is achieved by (1) treating at-home practice as video-game training and (2) using video-conferencing software as a medium for multiplayer gameplay. As the primary focus is placed on education rather than entertainment, ChemDraw is subclassified as a serious educational game. Community is developed by in-game, online chat: observers, announcers, and competitors all interact with each other in real time. The tournament provided students an event to look forward to, helped maintain/improve class community, and developed organic chemistry skills (molecular drawing, history of molecules, and conversational IUPAC) in addition to increased appreciation for IUPAC nomenclature. Although an online community cannot substitute for in-person classroom experiences, this activity supplements the loss of community associated with social distancing and could be extended to enhance community within a face-to-face environment. Additionally, ideas are presented that illustrate how other chemistry classes and topics can be gamified in computer environments (both single- and multiplayer) by drawing upon well-established gaming modes (story mode, maker mode, and speed runs). Overall, this work highlights the supplemental role that chemistry video games can play in learning chemistry: by engaging students in an alternative, yet familiar to many format, classroom community and student confidence are maintained/strengthened.

AB  - The high demand for the integration of sustainable topics into university curricula presents new challenges for the way chemistry is traditionally taught. New teaching concepts are required that consider and connect different disciplines to achieve a higher student awareness of the importance of these topics for humanity, the environment, and the future of our planet. This article describes a uniquely multidisciplinary graduate course on solar energy; the course may serve as an example of how to incorporate sustainable topics into chemistry programs, and as a starting point from which to build for others. It combines different scientific, industrial, political, and humanitarian approaches to the topic and provides a broad overview of one of the main future energy resources. New teaching methods are introduced, combined, and evaluated with respect to their effectiveness for a sustainable education within science and, in particular, chemistry. The success of this new course concept is demonstrated by high student satisfaction in a trial course evaluation and impressive exam results.

AB  - This text offers an educational perspective on the challenges surrounding the implementation of integration (and interdisciplinarity) of mathematics and sciences and technology (M-S&T) in education and in the initial training of secondary school teachers. We find that the core nature of scientific and school disciplines in initial teacher training and in youth education needs to be redefined. This study is partly based on our past and present research on the teaching and learning of M-S&T. The main results show that the challenges of integration (and interdisciplinarity) are multiple mainly because of strongly established academic traditions in teacher training and also because of other variables explored in this text. Even though progress was made in the way didactics classes are taught in universities, much remains to be done. We will conclude with four avenues of future study and research development considering that M-S&T have very similar program contents.

AB  - Interdisciplinary inquiry is widely perceived to be essential for tackling the most pressing social and environmental issues we face (Brown, Harris, & Russell, 2010). Scholars from many different traditions have argued that the magnitude and complexity of such problems require the integration of perspectives and expertise from multiple disciplines to see "the whole" of the problem (Callahan, 2010; Kinzig, 2001, p. 709; Lubchenko, 1998). Federal funding agencies have sought to encourage both interdisciplinary research and interdisciplinary graduate training (Committee on Facilitating Interdisciplinary Research [COFIR], 2004); (National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2006); (National Science Foundation [NSF], 2011), and the strategic plans of universities across the United States have placed increased emphasis on interdisciplinary research and teaching (Borrego, Boden, & Newswander, 2014; Kezar & Elrod, 2012). In response, graduate training programs that seek to prepare students as interdisciplinary scholars have proliferated (Fitzgerald & Stronza, 2009; Klingenberg & Rothberg, 2010; McBride, Brewer, Bricker & Machura, 2011; Martin & Umberger, 2003; Vinhateiro, Sullivan, & McNally, 2012; and for a review: Clark et al., 2011). Graduate student interest in interdisciplinary training is strong, and the experiences they seek range from workshops and short-courses to full-fledged interdisciplinary degree granting programs. Faculty members often argue that interdisciplinary programs draw the "best and brightest" students (e.g. Buss 2003). Though it is difficult to find systematic analyses of the quality and quantity of applicants to interdisciplinary programs across universities, the authors write that their experiences at the University of Georgia support those arguments. The University of Georgia offers six doctoral programs that bring together faculty from different disciplinary units. These programs have a disproportionately high number of students who enter with outside fellowships or who have received university honorific awards. Cross-university data on student placement by program are similarly difficult to access, but there are indications that students who do interdisciplinary work--as part of a traditional department or in an interdisciplinary program-- do at least as well as their peers who conduct disciplinary research.

AB  - The demands for academic research placed on contemporary universities are closely related to the levels of innovative research they are expected to produce. Concurrently, both governments and university management strive to make the production of academic research more cost-efficient and have implemented measures to ensure this. Top-down policies influenced by the concepts of new public management and managerialism have been introduced, pushing for competitiveness and increased performativity in academic research setups. These policies and guidelines have been criticised by academics as having eroded collegiality and autonomy, which are considered necessary to achieve quality research. The focus of this study is on the social sciences and aligns with this critique, demonstrating that autonomy and collegiality are the key organisational features fostering multidisciplinary, collaborative and riskier research agendas that lead to breakthroughs. Academics with high levels of organisational commitment are more likely to create research agendas that assume more conservative, discipline-bound and risk-averse traits, with less potential to achieve the intended innovative research outcomes.

AB  - The present study examined middle school teachers' perceptions of literacy demands in their disciplines and specific literacy strategies they used to teach their disciplines. The eight participants in this multiple case study included 2 middle school teachers from each of 4 disciplines (i.e., English/language arts, science, social studies, and mathematics) who had completed 6 weeks of online professional development on disciplinary literacy. Data sources comprised 2 classroom observations and 2 semi-structured interviews following observations for each of the 8 teachers, as well as classroom and school artifacts. Qualitative analyses included within-case and cross-case themes. Findings indicated participants used a range of content area literacy and discipline-specific literacy instruction. Based on cross-case analysis, 4 themes emerged from the 4 discipline-based cases: (a) interdisciplinary literacy, (b) power in disciplinary language, (c) pedagogical tensions related to end of grade exams, and (d) individualized access. Two pedagogical tensions emerged from the data: the tension between content area literacy and disciplinary literacy and the tension between disciplinary-based instruction and interdisciplinarity, which permeates the middle school curriculum. Future research should explore how middle school teachers navigate the pedagogical tensions of disciplinary literacy within interdisciplinarity in light of Common Core State Standards and other current policy initiatives.

AB  - Evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-devo) is a vibrant area of contemporary life science that should be (and is) increasingly incorporated into teaching curricula. Although the inclusion of this content is important for biological pedagogy at multiple levels of instruction, there are also philosophical lessons that can be drawn from the scientific practices found in Evo-devo. One feature of particular significance is the interdisciplinary nature of Evo-devo investigations and their resulting explanations. Instead of a single disciplinary approach being the most explanatory or fundamental, different methodologies from biological disciplines must be synthesized to generate empirically adequate explanations. Thus, Evo-devo points toward a non-reductionist epistemology in biology. I review three areas where these synthetic efforts become manifest as a result of Evo-devo's practices (form versus function reasoning styles; problem-structured investigations; idealizations related to studying model organisms), and then sketch some possible applications to teaching biology. These philosophical considerations provide resources for life science educators to address (and challenge) key aspects of the "National Science Education Standards" and "Benchmarks for Scientific Literacy."

AB  - For graduation, high school students with learning disabilities and other high-incidence disabilities need sufficient science credits. For many students, their success is dependent on how well they learn in co-taught classes. However, students seldom have a voice about co-teaching in science. In this study, high school students with and without learning disabilities and other high-incidence disabilities provided their perspectives about co-taught science classes. Disproportionate stratified random sampling was used to select students from 17 co-taught science classes. Ninety-nine students completed the Co-Teaching Student Questionnaire (CTSQ) about science co-teachers' roles and level of agreement with statements about co-taught instruction. Additionally, students' written responses about co-teaching benefits and suggestions for improvement were analyzed. Results indicated similarities and differences in perceptions from students with and without disabilities. More than half of all students accessed both co-teachers when they needed help, and almost all students agreed the teachers seemed comfortable sharing responsibilities when co-teaching. Students were divided about whether co-teachers distributed tasks evenly. A benefit noted in qualitative themes was having support and help from co-teachers, whereas an improvement was ensuring special educators had sufficient science content knowledge. Implications for practice and future research, including eliciting and using students' perspectives, are presented.

AB  - Computer programming provides a framework for interdisciplinary learning in sciences, arts and languages. However, increasing integration of programming in K--12 shows that the block-based and text-based dichotomy of programming environments does not reflect the spectrum of their affordance. Hence, educators are confronted with a fundamental hurdle of matching programming environments with learners' cognitive abilities and learning objectives. This study addresses this challenge by analyzing 111 articles evaluating the affordances of programming environments to identify both structural and theoretical models to support educators' choice of programming environments. The following dimensions of programming environments were identified: connectivity mode, interface natural language, language inheritance, age appropriateness, cost of environment, output interface, input interface, and project types. For each of these dimensions, the synthesis of the literature ranged from examining its nature and effect on learning programming to the implications of choosing an environment and the critical gaps that future studies should address. The findings offer instructors useful parameters to compare and assess programming environments' suitability and alignment with learning objectives.

AB  - Recent reforms in science education have supported the inclusion of engineering and their practices in K-12 curricula. To this end, many classrooms have incorporated engineering units that include design challenges. Design is an integral part of engineering and can help students think in creative and interdisciplinary ways. In this study, we examined students' conceptions of design during and after participation in a design-based science curriculum unit. Our study was guided by the following research question: What are students' views of design after participation in an engineering design-based science curriculum unit and how are these views reflected in their enactment throughout the unit? Using a qualitative approach, we examined students' conversations throughout the enactment of the curriculum and interviews conducted after the completion of the unit. We found that students had complex and diverse views of design, and these views were reflected in their group discussions throughout the curriculum and design challenge. Students most frequently expressed design as learning and as a process of integration into a coherent whole. These aspects of design were also frequently observed in students' conversations during the unit. Interestingly, we found evidence of students demonstrating several aspects of design throughout the curriculum that were not explicitly expressed during the student interviews. Taken together, these findings support the complex nature of design as seen at the middle school level.

AB  - Many institutions are preparing graduate students and postdoctorals (future faculty) for effective teaching in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Interestingly, little is known about beneficial features of teaching-development (TD) programs for future faculty after they transition into professoriate roles, and how these features are useful. We investigated the features of a TD program for STEM future faculty that were influential to their current teaching as faculty members, and in transitioning into faculty positions. Data were collected using in-depth interviews with 10 alumni (current faculty) from different STEM disciplines one to five years after participating in the TD program. Three themes emerged from this study: (1) exposure to multiple effective teaching approaches and pedagogy literature; (2) opportunities for experiential learning, active learning, a multi-disciplinary learning community, and diversity and inclusion; and (3) the impact of the TD program on participants' career choices. Findings imply the need to develop TD programs that expose participants to multiple evidence-based pedagogies, and that weave in opportunities for experiential learning, interactive-workshop activities, and a learning community.

AB  - Educators often ask how to motivate PhD students. Before addressing how to motivate students, we should know what motivates prospective doctoral students. Motivational support has been shown to lead to overall satisfaction with the educational process, better engagement, and persistence. Using the interdisciplinary field of library and information science, this research offers insight on doctoral student motivation through quantitative analysis of results from administration of the Academic Motivation Scale. The instrument measures and classifies motivation from the perspective of self-determination theory. Results suggest PhD students are motivated by several types of intrinsic motivation as well as identified regulation, a type of extrinsic yet autonomous motivation. Findings can be used by program administrators, faculty, and other stakeholders to address the "how" of motivation through better alignment of teaching practices, research activities, and student services based on students' motivation types.

AB  - As in any professional field, aspiring video game artists, designers, and developers must acquire the necessary skills and knowledge for a successful career. Higher education institutions offer varying video game Bachelor's degree programs to meet the diverse needs of the industry. Our objective in this study was to explore these curricula to gain insight into and understanding of the contemporary video game higher education landscape. We explored 113 Bachelor's degree curricula in Europe that had publicly available information in English about their courses. We classified the courses within each curriculum using ten devised classifiers based on the IGDA Curriculum Framework 2008 but modified them to suit our interests. The content of the classified curricula was then used to create curriculum profiles -- data vectors that characterize a curriculum based on its contents. These profiles allowed for hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify and investigate the three common types of video game curricula: video game art, interdisciplinary video game design, and video game technology/programming. Our results indicate that art and programming curricula are highly specialized, with clear distinctions in yielding Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. Curricula focused on interdisciplinary video game design do not have such clear distinctions in the degree titles and content specialization. They are more varied in their profiles and tend to bridge the gap between art and programming curricula, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of game design as a profession. Compared to results from previous studies, we found that contemporary curricula place a greater emphasis on graduation projects, internships, and soft skills. Our findings provide an overview of the current state of higher education in video games, which may prove helpful for those working with or interested in these curricula.

AB  - This research compares the industry readiness, product development skill level, and overall knowledge gains of students taking an undergraduate research course (treatment) to those who did not (control). This 2-semester Applied Interdisciplinary Product Development (AIPD) course for sophomores brought together interdisciplinary teams of food science, nutrition, and packaging science students in a hands-on setting to create healthy food products for children, complete with retail packaging. A Subject Knowledge Assessment (SKA) was used to evaluate the mean percent difference value (MPDV) of food science, nutrition, packaging science, and general product development knowledge gained through the course. SKA results indicated that the MPDV were significantly different (a = 0.05) between the treatment and comparison groups in the overall score and in every subject area score except packaging science. Data from an Exit Questionnaire (EQ) was used for evaluation of attitudes pertaining to product development knowledge and skills, department engagement, and pedagogy. EQ results indicated that mean scores between the treatment and comparison groups were significantly different (a = 0.05) in 7 of the 9 statements on product development knowledge and skills, both statements pertaining to pedagogy, and the statement pertaining to department engagement. Overall, the research project was considered a successful intervention for educating sophomores at the University. Overall, the research project was considered a successful intervention for educating sophomores in the Food, Nutrition and Packaging Science department at Clemson University. The student-lead teams were held to a greater degree of accountability for their success in terms of education gleaned and value of experience gained as metric for the University and other IFT Accredited programs.

AB  - Collaborative learning (CL) can be a powerful method for sharing understanding between learners. To this end, strategic regulation of processes, such as cognition and affect (including metacognition, emotion and motivation) is key. Decades of research on self-regulated learning has advanced our understanding about the need for and complexity of those mediating processes in learning. Recent research has shown that it is not only the individual's but also the group's shared processes that matter and, thus, that regulation at the group level is critical for learning success. A problem here is that the "shared" processes in CL are invisible, which makes it almost impossible for researchers to study and understand them, for learners to recognize them and for teachers to support them. Traditionally, research has not been able to make these processes visible nor has it been able to collect data about them. With the aid of advanced technologies, signal processing and machine learning, we are on the verge of "seeing" these complex phenomena and understanding how they interact. We posit that technological solutions and digital tools available today and in the future will help advance the theory underlying the cognitive, metacognitive, emotional and social components of individual, peer and group learning when seen through a multidisciplinary lens. The aim of this paper is to discuss and demonstrate how multidisciplinary collaboration among the learning sciences, affective computing and machine learning is applied for understanding and facilitating CL.

AB  - Out-of-school science education institutions, such as museums, science centres, zoos and aquaria, have strong potentials to promote sustainability, yet seem to lack an operational definition of sustainability that aligns with their specific characteristics and institutional remit. Here, we use the anthropological theory of didactics to systematically develop such an operational definition, designated as the reference model. We draw on literature from research and practice to account for the features of sustainability science and policy, as well as the different specific strengths of out-of-school science education institutions, to identify unique potentials for sustainability education. These potentials are synthesised and illustrated in a set of institutionally specific guidelines that optimise the organisation of sustainability for each kind of out-of-school science education institution. We conclude by considering the implications of our findings for sustainability education.

AB  - To equalize access to science learning across genders and demographic groups, access to the disciplinary language of science is one place to start. The language of science is highly challenging and specialized, and difficulties acquiring this language contribute to disparities in science achievement across diverse student groups. This study used a pre/post design to analyze effectiveness of a brief classroom science vocabulary assessment designed to assess receptive and productive vocabulary knowledge across multiple sections of one seventh-grade science teacher's class. Vocabulary was selected and analysis conducted by an interdisciplinary research partnership, including the science teacher, a literacy specialist, and a scientist. The resulting model presents an assessment that evaluates receptive knowledge and productive use of science language and reinforces vocabulary theory: learning words is incremental and multidimensional, and assessment should address this specialized skill in principled, disciplined ways.

AB  - Creative writing offers a critical and innovative form of inquiry promoting integrative learning that transcends disciplinary barriers. Authors first provide an overview of the scholarship on creative writing pedagogy, its unique capacity to engage a range of knowledge domains, and its significance for honors education. They then offer primary examples of incorporating creative writing projects into two honors classes that bridge STEM fields and the humanities. Analyses of student reflections (n = 35) in relation to learning outcomes strongly suggest that creative writing helps students explore course concepts through several ways of knowing--critical, situational, and affective--while fostering new perspectives on these concepts, their interconnections, and their implications. The value of creative writing as a platform for self-directed and interdisciplinary learning within the transdisciplinary context of honors is discussed.

AB  - Brewing science is an interdisciplinary course taught at many universities in both lecture- and lab-based modalities. The laboratory component of this class typically focuses on the brewing process from malted barley to beer. However, this ignores the malting process--an essential step in making beer, although one typically performed by maltsters outside of the brewhouse. In this report we discuss the development of a malting lab that is suitable to incorporate into introductory brewing science courses in order to help students demonstrate and explain the key process of converting raw barley into malt. During this week-long experiment, students start with raw barley (commercially available in scales that work for all course sizes) and, using small scale and inexpensive custom-made equipment, malt the barley at home for later use in the course. This experiment is suitable for hybrid course laboratories in student homes and apartments with minimal course expenses or requirements and can be implemented in any brewing science course--even those that are predominantly lecture-based.

AB  - Helping students understand "chemical energy" is notoriously difficult. Many hold inconsistent ideas about what energy is, how and why it changes during the course of a chemical reaction, and how these changes are related to bond energies and reaction dynamics. There are (at least) three major sources for this problem: 1) the way biologists talk about chemical energy (which is also the way we talk about energy in everyday life); 2) the macroscopic approach to energy concepts that is common in physics and physical sciences; and 3) the failure of chemistry courses to explicitly link molecular with macroscopic energy ideas. From a constructivist perspective, it is unlikely that students can, without a coherent understanding of such a central concept, attain a robust and accurate understanding of new concepts. However, changes are on the horizon, guided by the increasing understanding that difficult concepts require coherent, well-designed learning progressions and the new National Research Council Framework for K-12 Science Education. We provide supporting evidence for our assertions and suggestions for an interdisciplinary learning progression designed to better approach the concept of bond energies, a first step in an understanding chemical energy and behavior of reaction systems that is central to biological systems.

AB  - Interdisciplinary exploration is vital to education in the 21st century. This manuscript outlines an innovative laboratory-based teaching method that combines elements of biochemistry/molecular biology, kinesiology/health science, computer science, and manufacturing engineering to give students the ability to better conceptualize complex biological systems. Here, we utilize technology available at most universities to print three-dimensional (3D) scale models of actual human muscle cells (myofibers) out of bioplastic materials. The same methodological approach could be applied to nearly any cell type or molecular structure. This advancement is significant because historically, two-dimensional (2D) myocellular images have proven insufficient for detailed analysis of organelle organization and morphology. 3D imaging fills this void by providing accurate and quantifiable myofiber structural data. Manipulating tangible 3D models combats 2D limitation and gives students new perspectives and alternative learning experiences that may assist their understanding. This approach also exposes learners to 1) human muscle cell extraction and isolation, 2) targeted fluorescence labeling, 3) confocal microscopy, 4) image processing (via open-source software), and 5) 3D printing bioplastic scale-models (×500 larger than the actual cells). Creating these physical models may further student's interest in the invisible world of molecular and cellular biology. Furthermore, this interdisciplinary laboratory project gives instructors of all biological disciplines a new teaching tool to foster integrative thinking.

AB  - Background: Few tools or rubrics exist to assess the quality of integrated STEM curricula, and existing tools focus on checklists of characteristics of integrated STEM. While such instruments provide important information about the presence and quality of certain curricular components, they do not assess the level and nature of integration of the curriculum as a whole. Thus, this study explores the development of a process focused to understand the nature of integration within a STEM curriculum unit. Findings: A conceptual flow graphic (CFG) was constructed for 50 integrated STEM curriculum units. Patterns in the nature of the interdisciplinary connections were used to categorize and understand the nature of integration and curricular coherence within each unit. The units formed four broad types of integrated STEM curricula: (i) coherent science unit with loosely connected engineering design challenge (EDC), (ii) engineering design-focused unit with limited connections to science content, (iii) engineering design unit with science content as context, and (iv) integrated and coherent STEM units. All physical science units were in the integrated and coherent category with strong conceptual integration between the main science concepts and the EDC. Curricula based in the Earth and life sciences generally lacked conceptual integration between the science content and the EDC and relied on the engineering design process to provide a coherent storyline for the unit. Conclusions: Our study shows that engineering practices can serve as a contextual integrator within a STEM unit. The utilization of an EDC also provides the potential for conceptual integration because engineering is grounded in the application of science and mathematics. Integrated STEM curricula that purposefully include science and mathematics concepts necessary to develop solutions to the EDC engage students in authentic engineering experiences and provide conceptual integration between the disciplines. However, the alignment of grade-level science standards with the EDC can be problematic, particularly in life science and Earth science. The CFG process provides a tool for determining the nature of integration between science and mathematics content and an EDC. These connections can be conceptual and/or contextual, as both forms of integration are appropriate depending on the instructional goals.

AB  - Purpose: Little is known about the use of think tanks in higher education to support faculty growth and organizational culture. The purpose of this study is to explore potential benefits of think tanks within a health sciences department at a large regional university. Methods: Seven qualitative interviews of faculty that participated in at least one think tank session during the preceding year were conducted by a trained researcher. Interview questions were designed to be succinct, conversational, and open-ended. Audio recordings of interviews were transcribed, then two researchers coded responses according to recurring themes; a third researcher resolved discrepancies. Results: Central themes to emerge from the interviews include benefits for relationships, personal/professional development, and the generation of research ideas. Participants also shared barriers to attending think tanks, such as scheduling. Conclusions: Overall, think tank sessions provide a flexible environment that can encourage collaboration, promote discussion, and encourage the advancement of teaching practices and research projects. Recommendations: Universities should consider offering think tank sessions to faculty in order to forge relationships and promote collaborative work, especially within multidisciplinary departments where faculty tend to isolate into their respective disciplines.

AB  - While medical improvisation is emerging as a promising strategy for communication training, little is known about its effects on interdisciplinary healthcare teams and there is a need to advance knowledge about the impact of engagement during the training on communication skill improvement. We evaluated changes in communication skills among 132 healthcare professionals from one department at a large U.S. medical center who participated in medical improvisation (improv) communication training developed by a multidisciplinary team at a provost-level university-based center dedicated to communicating science. Participants took part in one of 15 single session in-person workshops delivered in October 2020 and co-facilitated by an improv expert and a seasoned clinician-scientist leader. Participants completed questionnaires regarding their communication skills before and after taking part in the training. Most of the self-reported communication skills that were assessed showed improvement following the workshop. Improvements were reported in 7 out of 8 communication skills that were assessed. Moreover, engagement moderated the effects of the training -- among those with lowest pre-training communication skills, higher levels of engagement predicted greater improvement in communication skills, whereas low engagement predicted little change following the training. Medical improvisation is a promising approach to improve communication in healthcare. Further research is needed to estimate long-term effects of medical improvisation training and investigate ways to increase participant engagement.

AB  - Background: Argumentation, the justification of claims with reasons and/or evidence, has emerged as a significant goal in science education in recent years. Yet, there is limited understanding of secondary students' arguments and particularly their use of warrants in interdisciplinary contexts such as science and religious education. Furthermore, research on argumentation in science education has not paid sufficient attention to how students' arguments may potentially reflect intellectual humility. The concept of intellectual humility reinforces the view that one is not excessively arrogant regarding their beliefs, or excessively dismissive of their or others' beliefs Purpose: It is important to understand students' engagement in argumentation particularly in the context of topics such as evolution and creationism that often present tension and conflict. For classroom argumentation activities to be fruitful, students' understanding of warrants as well as their intellectual humility are prerequisite. Sample: The data are drawn from Year 9 students' engagement in a card sort activity in the context of a funded project in England. The activity engaged the students in a task on the origins of life, where evidence and reasons were related to evolution versus creationism. Design and Methods: The card sort activity was designed to limit students' contributions about different evidence and emphasise specifically, the link (warrant) by providing fixed evidence and claims. During the activity, students were presented with 'evidence cards'. Students were asked to consider each card and place it under the claim that they felt the card supported even if the student did not support that claim personally. They were further asked to explain why they thought the evidence might be used to support that claim. Students' verbal accounts of their warrants for placing cards were explored. Conclusion: Students' warrants included repetition of evidence statements without articulating the reasons. As intellectual humility concerns accurately tracking the positive epistemic status of a belief or argument, a lack of coherence within students' arguments contradicts the embodiment of intellectual humility.

AB  - The COVID-19 global pandemic created new challenges for teachers and school systems as teachers were forced to rapidly transition to remote learning using new digital tools and resources. Teaching elementary science in "normal times" is challenging due to issues involving teacher preparation, limited access to materials and lack of administrative support due to emphasis on tested subjects, among others. Using reform-based, inquiry practices is challenging when teaching science face-to-face and even more so in an online environment. Compounded with issues of access and equity, teachers faced many problems with moving elementary science instruction online due to COVID-19. This study reports on the experiences of 10 early career teachers who were graduates of a specialized elementary science concentration. Teachers reflect on the challenges faced, how they adapted, and how they designed new learning contexts to teach science. Teachers report on resources they found beneficial, assess needs for the future, and explain how they worked to maintain a sense of community for their students during this unprecedented critical time.

AB  - Living in a Delta, amidst water, land and air, means living and engaging with complex concerns. To address these concerns the Rotterdam Arts and Sciences Lab (RASL) has developed an education- and research program for Higher Education in which the (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-) sciences and the arts are combined to engage with with all of the scales, entanglements and complex societal concerns of this Delta-multiple: Delta Studies. Delta Studies can therefore be understood as a companion to the alpha, beta and gamma sciences, as it sets out from and blurs, 'composes' (Latour, 2010) and 'composts' (Haraway, 2016) with, the sciences and the arts. Delta Studies exists through combining and composing with the skills and knowledges of the arts and the sciences as well as the situated knowledges of societal partners. In this manner, it questions existing hierarchies of ways of knowing and making public(s) in order to create new ways to engage with complex concerns and reimagine our collective futures. This article presents the guiding propositions of Delta Studies.

AB  - The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) delineate three interrelated dimensions that describe what students should know and how they should engage in science learning. These present significant challenges for assessment because traditional assessments may not be able to capture the ways in which students engage with content. Science simulations engage students with science phenomena while collecting data on student simulation use. However, there are limited guidelines on how to analyze this type of complex data for assessment. This study aims to investigate how two statistical approaches (Bayesian Networks and Item Response Theory) model student learning in a science simulation. The simulation data included process data, embedded table responses, and open-response reflection answers. The results did not suggest a best model for this data, but highlighted uses and challenges of the different models and illustrate a method for utilizing complex data to help understand both what and how students are learning.

AB  - People who do not know theatre may think the only creative artist in the field is the playwright--with actors, directors, and designers mere "interpreters" of the dramatist's vision. Historically, however, creative mastery and power have passed through different hands. Sometimes, the playwright did the staging. In other periods, leading actors demanded plays be changed to fatten their roles. The late 19th and 20th centuries saw "the rise of the director," in which director and playwright struggled for creative dominance. But no matter where the balance of power rested, good theatre artists of all kinds have created powerful experiences for their audience. The purpose of this volume is to bridge the interdisciplinary abyss between the study of creativity in theatre/drama and in other fields. Sharing theories, research findings, and pedagogical practices, the authors and I hope to stimulate discussion among creativity and theatre scholar/teachers, as well as multidisciplinary research. Theatre educators know from experience that performance classes enhance student creativity. This volume is the first to bring together perspectives from multiple disciplines on how drama pedagogy facilitates learning creativity. Drawing on current findings in cognitive science, as well as drama teachers' lived experience, the contributors analyze how acting techniques train the imagination, allow students to explore alternate identities, and discover the confidence to take risks. The goal is to stimulate further multidisciplinary investigation of theatre education and creativity, with the intention of benefitting both fields.

AB  - This two-year case study examined multi-modal, interdisciplinary approaches to engage both immigrant English Second Language (ESL) and English Language Learners (ELL) in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) learning and to build STEM identity and self-efficacy. Leveraging innate abilities, multiple intelligences, and self-identified interests, children in Grades 3 through 8, new to America and STEM, became inquiry-based researchers of sound-making, soundscapes, and nonverbal communication systems in diverse species including human music-making using technology, analysis, communication research, and observation skills. Using generative and lateral thinking methodology for science translation, interdisciplinary methods, and team-based learning, the students demonstrated increased STEM interest, STEM learning, and STEM skill sets while developing self-efficacy as STEM learners and communicators.

AB  - Like several scientists, Isaac Newton has been represented many times over many different periods, and portraits of Newton were often commissioned by the scientist himself. These portraits tell us a lot about the scientist, the artist and the cultural context. This article examines two very different portraits of Newton that were realized more than a century apart, to show how the observer's attention can be focused on the history of physics, the history of art, their relationships and the use of the history of science in science education.

AB  - Exploration of the breadth of the Arts and Sciences lies at the core of liberal arts education and gets prominently featured in most undergraduate general education programs. The authors of this study investigated student perceptions of the three branches of the Arts and Sciences using cohorts of high-achieving first-year college students enrolled in an innovative 3-week course designed to increase interest, familiarity, and research competency within each of the three branches. Stated and revealed preferences of these students were measured through student surveys and course work. The data often showed a retreat to pre-existing disciplinary preferences, particularly the data on revealed preferences. Students became more familiar with all three branches during the course, but their interest in Arts and Humanities and STEM decreased unless they were majoring in the branch. Also, despite the course's emphasis on crossdisciplinarity, students informally sorted themselves into two groups: STEM students (who avoided Arts and Humanities), and non-STEM students (who avoided STEM). Faculty and administrators of general education programs will therefore need to think carefully about how to structure disciplinary and interdisciplinary coursework, especially when it comes to bridging the perceived divide between the STEM and non-STEM disciplines.

AB  - Earth's critical zone (CZ) is the uppermost layer of Earth's continents, which supports ecosystems and humans alike. CZ science aims to understand how interactions among rock, soil, water, air, and terrestrial organisms influence Earth as a habitable system. Thus, CZ science provides the framework for a holistic-systems approach to teaching Earth surface and environmental science, especially related to environmental sustainability. Here, we describe efforts by an interdisciplinary team to create a full-semester, university curriculum that introduces upper-division students to CZ science. Course topics include a background in CZ science, key concepts and methods of CZ science, and units on land-atmosphere interactions, water budgets, landscape evolution, and biogeochemistry. The course culminates with a unit on human interactions within the CZ. Through interactive activities that use data sets from U.S. CZ observatories, the course emphasizes how a CZ framework is appropriate for teaching concepts across scientific disciplines, concepts of environmental sustainability, and the usefulness of CZ science for considering humanity's grand challenges. Materials can be integrated into existing courses or used as an independent course to maximize instructor flexibility; all materials were piloted in eight separate courses across a range of university settings. Although preassessments and postassessments of geoscience literacy did not show much change, students overwhelmingly agreed that they could use what they learned to help society overcome grand challenges. Thus, the holistic-systems approach advocated by CZ science and explored throughout this curriculum provides a unique opportunity to engage students in thinking about complex issues related to environmental sustainability.

AB  - Biochemistry has always been a mandatory topic within BS courses aimed at food science students at the University of Milan, namely: Food Science & Technology and Catering Sciences. Addressing biochemistry topics in this peculiar setting requires: (i) specific focus on topics that are seldom considered in courses offered in bio-medical curricula; (ii) close integration with other area disciplines, such as food biotechnology; (iii) ad hoc design of laboratory classes; and (iv) an array of elective courses covering specific aspects of biochemistry. In this context, for example, protein chemistry is presented by using food proteins of known structure and discussed in terms of structural features in the raw materials and of structural and chemical modifications occurring upon processing. Along the same lines, metabolic pathways and their regulation are presented starting from widespread metabolism-related issues and to issues related to food safety (including food allergies and intolerances). A similar "hands on" approach is used for laboratory classes, that cover about one third of total credits and are aimed at providing fundamental-type information by analyzing practical situations in the food chain. In spite of their inherent complexity and volume, biochemistry courses score very well with the students in mandatory anonymous surveys. Our approach to biochemistry courses seems to help the students in "visualizing" the practical implications of concepts acquired in other courses within their curricula. The students' appreciation is confirmed by the sizeable attendance to elective and specialized biochemical-themed courses.

AB  - This article shares the "Paper Circuit Story Timeline" and the "Story Quilting" project from the Elementary STEM Teaching Integrating Technology and Computing Holistically (E-STITCH) curriculum, a free curriculum and project guide set for grades 3-6. The E-STITCH curriculum is designed as a method for teaching science and social studies together in order to teach both in more culturally responsive and inclusive ways. Students learn science content around energy transfer and circuits as a means to produce projects that highlight their social studies learning about immigration, migration, and forced relocation--topics that are relevant to children living across the United States. This article outlines how these projects were implemented as part of an energy transfer unit within a fourth-grade classroom, but they can be easily modified to meet the needs of students in grades 3-6.

AB  - An important element of STEAM education that teachers struggle with is the adoption and application of digital technologies. Digital technologies have the potential to enhance social inclusion and student-centred learning, and for this reason it is important for teachers across all levels of schooling to develop skills and confidence in this area (Digital Education Advisory Group, 2013). The aim of this article is to illustrate innovative teaching practices through an integrated STEAM project using Kitsi Blocks (Kitsunei, 2019) as the core digital technology. Kitsi Blocks may be described as a fabrication technology, enabling students to collect digital data for analytical purposes and/or to send data to instruct physical things to move, light up or make sounds. The technology is comprised of physical Kitsi Blocks, which house different electronic components in a small plastic casing, and virtual blocks that build the computational logic in a visual programming system called the Kitsunei Creator. The authors demonstrate a thematic STEAM approach to the ideas of 'beat' and 'rhythm' by describing the integration of science, mathematics, digital technologies and music that is aligned with the Australian Curriculum (ACARA, 2020).

AB  - This book contains the full text of papers and posters presented at the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2020), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (W.I.A.R.S.), that this year had to be transformed into a fully Virtual Conference as a result of the Coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic. Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2020 received 459 submissions, from more than 40 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Virtual Presentations and Posters. The conference accepted for presentation 125 submissions (27% acceptance rate), from which, 106 submissions are published in full text in this book. The conference also includes a keynote presentation from an internationally distinguished researcher, Prof. Dr. Joy Kutaka-Kennedy (Ed. D., Department of Special Education, Sanford College of Education, National University, San Jose Campus, USA), to whom we express our most gratitude. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. To develop the conference program, we have chosen four main broad-ranging categories, which also covers different interest areas: (1) In TEACHERS AND STUDENTS: Teachers and Staff training and education; Educational quality and standards; Curriculum and Pedagogy; Vocational education and Counseling; Ubiquitous and lifelong learning; Training programs and professional guidance; Teaching and learning relationship; Student affairs (learning, experiences and diversity; Extra-curricular activities; Assessment and measurements in Education.

AB  - There is a growing number of products for learning the interdisciplinary application of science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) in K-12. However, there is no general assessment tool for those STEAM creations, so as to help parents or instructors to experience and evaluate the STEAM products created or sold by companies or proposed by academic institutes when they want to introduce one to their children or students. Therefore, this study developed and validated an assessment of STEAM Creation with formative constructs by utilizing the PLS-SEM technique. The four constructs taken into account based on the theoretical foundations were computational thinking (CT) levels, design thinking (DT) levels, STEAM interdisciplinary levels, and literacy-oriented (LO) levels. CT was operationalized as four indicators (i.e., problem decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm steps), and DT was operationalized as another four indicators (i.e., analysis of design requirements, creative brainstorming, hands-on experience, and test and verification). Meanwhile, STEAM was operationalized with five indispensable indicators, where each indicator refers to one discipline. LO was operationalized with three indicators (i.e., cooperation and co-creation, problem solving, and daily application). There were 16 indicators in total. Therefore, the formative relationship was established and evaluated in this study. This paper assessed STEAM creations with a formative measurement model comprising four hypotheses indicating that CT has a significant direct effect on STEAM and LO, DT has a significant direct effect on STEAM while STEAM has a significant direct effect on LO. The results reveal that all four hypotheses were accepted and the paths in the model were confirmed. CT has a significant indirect effect on LO through STEAM, which was also deeply discussed.

AB  - Recent research indicates that the majority of postsecondary students in North America "feel overwhelming anxiety," an issue that has also been observed in many other regions and is negatively impacting students' academic performance and overall well-being. This article reports the results of our interdisciplinary analysis of innovative ideas in cognitive science, learning models and mindsets, and current technological approaches that are aimed at understanding and addressing these anxiety and academic engagement issues. We identify the knowledge gaps and propose critical insights and research directions, such as the use of virtual reality (VR) and computer games, to fill those gaps and deal with the anxiety problem.

AB  - Place-based education (PBE) is a situated, context-rich, transdisciplinary teaching and learning modality distinguished by its unequivocal relationship to place, which is any locality that people have imbued with meanings and personal attachments through actual or vicarious experiences. As an observational and historical science, geoscience is highly dependent on place, and place-based curricula and instructional methods apply to geoscience education. The sense of place operationalizes the human connection to place and functions as a definable and measurable learning outcome for PBE. Although PBE is rooted in historic and indigenous teaching philosophies, it has gained particular notice and traction in concert with more recent interest in environmental education, sustainability, and diversity in geoscience. This paper presents a current review of theory and research methods that have directly informed development of curriculum and instruction in, authentic assessment of, and implementation of PBE in geoscience sensu lato (Earth-system and environmental sciences); a survey of place-based teaching in geoscience currently or recently practiced across different grade levels and situated in different places, regions, and cultures; information about teaching and assessment methods for those who may be interested in adopting the place-based modality; and suggested future directions for research, practice, and assessment in PBE in geoscience.

AB  - The persistent fear of physics by learners motivated the author to take action to increase all students' interest in the subject via a new curriculum for introductory college physics that applies Greene's model of Aesthetic Education to the study of contemporary physics, utilizing symmetry as the mathematical foundation of physics as well as the conceptual link between physics and the arts. The author describes the curriculum and suggests how students' drawings and written commentaries can provide insights into students' preferred learning modalities, promote understanding of abstract concepts through visualization, and reveal students' preexisting attitudes toward science. Outcomes align with the goals of improving students' attitudes toward physics, indicated by their comments, written work, and results of the Maryland Physics Expectations Survey.

AB  - Traditional Knowledge (TK) is a qualitative and quantitative living body of knowledge developed locally and regionally across generations over thousands of years. This study aims to show through authentic voice the importance of centering TK systems and cultural needs to provide equitable geoscience education programs. TK can be communicated through a variety of methods, such as story and song, dance, paintings, carvings, structures, and textiles. TK is interdisciplinary within anthropological and ecological subsistence and provide enhanced cultural and spiritual context. Research findings are enhanced by the exploratory and inquiry-based design of TK and provide insight into the anthropogenic impacts on the environment allowing researchers to gain a rich understanding of human behaviors and patterns when collecting and analyzing data. This study examines factors influencing Indigenous students' participation and retention in the geosciences, specifically gauging opinions on the incorporation of TK systems into geoscience education. Data was collected using an electronic survey to identify factors that inform students' decision to enter geoscience disciplines and better understand the importance of role models and mentors for retention. Our findings indicate that Indigenous students were interested in using both TK and Western science in geoscience learning spaces, Indigenous role models played an important role in sense of belonging and identity in the geosciences, and the incorporation of culture into learning experiences played an important role in retention. Findings from this study, if operationalized, would allow geoscience departments to increase retention of Indigenous students and faculty, provide equitable educational opportunities, and to better understand how to effect cultural change in the geosciences by providing a welcoming and affirming space for Indigenous scholars.

AB  - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics or "STEM" focused pedagogy has been influenced changes in education for decades. Responding to the need for interdisciplinary skilled workforces, the STEM approach has been revised firstly to reflect the incorporation of Arts, (STEAM) and, more recently, to place stronger emphasis on cross-disciplinary connections. However, there is little empirical evidence to drive the development of a practical model for classroom implementation. This systematic review aims to consolidate existing empirical evidence on the incorporation of interdisciplinary learning via a STEM/STEAM approach in high-school environments using a PRISMA review scaffolding. The review identified ninety-nine articles that addressed interdisciplinary learning. However, the majority of them were excluded due to the lack of empirical evidence for such improvements, resulting in only eleven studies being included in the final synthesis. This suggests that more research is required prior to wide-scale implementation within high school education systems. Of those that met the selection criteria, the overarching theme was that improved outcomes were best achieved via either a real-world project-based or problem-based learning pedagogy with the use of community and industry support. However, due to the low number of studies found to fit the criteria, it is recommended that further research is conducted to provide greater empirical evidence to support this finding.

AB  - The American Psychological Association (APA) has called for psychologists to become more involved in addressing climate change. One way to address this pressing issue is through curriculum. To this end, we describe an undergraduate course that we created and teach exclusively focused on the interface of psychology and global climate change. The course is a seminar structured around three broad themes: science and impacts, adaptation, and solutions. To support others developing curriculum in this area, we explain these themes and share the course organization and structure, along with our experiences in teaching it. We provide relevant examples of activities and resources in the context of the goals and outcomes of APA's "Guidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major." We discuss considerations of competence and interdisciplinarity in teaching on this issue. Finally, given the magnitude and significance of climate change, we consider experiential aspects of students in the course related to stress.

AB  - An interdisciplinary laboratory experiment involving second-year undergraduate organic chemistry and introductory inorganic chemistry undergraduate students is described. Organic chemistry students prepare a series of amine-bis(phenols) via a Mannich reaction, and characterize their products using melting point; FTIR; and [superscript 1]H, [superscript 13]C, DEPT-135, and HSQC NMR experiments. In the inorganic chemistry laboratory, students utilize these amine ligands to prepare a series of octahedral titanium complexes, and characterize the resultant complexes using FTIR, and [superscript 1]H, [superscript 13]C, DEPT-135, and HSQC NMR spectroscopy. Students are asked to revisit concepts such as the two- and three-dimensional representations of their target molecules and reaction mechanisms throughout both experiments. From these experiments, students gain an appreciation for the multidisciplinary nature of chemistry.

AB  - In this commentary, I build on recent interdisciplinary models for embodied cognition with additional perspectives from affective neuroscience, educational psychology, creativity theory, and science education. I invoke William James and John Dewey, pioneers of an embodied philosophy of mind, alongside recent affective neuroscience theory about the role of bodily emotional response in learning. I present educational implications of the need for meaning making through body-mind and affective interaction with a social learning environment. I reformulate the problem of learner engagement in school to look beyond the need for autonomy, belonging, and competency to include the need for creative meaning making in learner engagement. To provide context, I explore the experience of adolescent students using a drama-based pedagogical tool to learn an abstract science concept. This example illustrates how embodied, creative learning rich with metaphor shapes meaning making in science learning. I conclude by elaborating further on a proposed model of creative engagement.

AB  - With the continuous development of education informatization, STEM education has become the global trend of education. Project-based learning is widely discussed and applied as a learning method suitable for combination with STEM education concept. Currently, the problem of "how to teach" in STEM education is widely focused on two typical teaching methods, namely problem-based learning and project-based learning. Project-based learning is also learner-centered and tends to comprehensively apply multidisciplinary knowledge, which attracts more attention. Based on the analysis of the impact of combining applied subjects and STEM education with project-based learning on students and other aspects, this paper proposes the connotation of middle school information technology project-based learning under STEM education concept and how to practice the application of project-based learning in junior high school information technology classrooms under STEM education concept in order to promote the further development of STEM education.

AB  - Over the past 20 years, the authors have designed an interdisciplinary approach that integrates Arts-based methods into STEM education. This integrated STEAM education perspective is particularly useful for enabling students to develop (i) not only their traditional scientific (and mathematical) understanding of the outer world but also (ii) their critical reflective understanding and capabilities as societal change agents (Taylor & Taylor, 2022). This integrated curricular approach employs an arts-based teaching and learning method called 'ethical dilemma story pedagogy' (Settelmaier, 2003) that is described in this article. Running parallel to the authors' interest in developing STEM students' (and teachers') higher-order abilities as change agents for resolving sustainable development ethical dilemmas, is the rapidly developing issue of the global role of artificial intelligence (AI) in transforming the world, in both ethically sound and unsound ways (Lorenz et al., 2023; Nam & Bai, 2023). As John--a highly experienced science teacher--started experimenting with the AI tool of ChatGPT (Open AI, undated) to help design his mathematics instruction the authors were interested in its potential for enabling him to develop an ethical dilemma story approach for use in his mathematics class. Of broader significance, the authors wanted to investigate the potential of this AI tool for use by all mathematics teachers interested in preparing their students as change agents for a deeply troubled world. This article recounts in personal narrative form (Reed-Danahay, 1997) John's 'reflective practitioner inquiry' (Schon, 2017; Simanjorang et al., 2022) into his endeavour to employ ChatGPT for this novel purpose.

AB  - This study employed a multi-phased process to guide the development of an approach for integrating socio-scientific issues (SSI) and science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education in a way that can reform how science is taught in schools to improve scientific literacy. This approach can help teachers connect science authentically to real-world issues that have social and cultural relevance to students' everyday lives. To demonstrate how the approach could be used for curriculum development, the authors defined the dimensions and key principles of SSI-based STEAM teaching and translated the approach into a climate change program by using a 6E inquiry model, which emphasizes an "enactment" stage. This program was used to discuss the benefits and challenges of employing an SSI-based STEAM approach in classroom contexts. We conclude by discussing implications for using this approach to improve science learning opportunities in cross-cultural contexts, and we raise questions about the need for future research.

AB  - This article reports on the efforts of a political science professor teaching a multidisciplinary course focused on New York City to develop an interdisciplinary class project designed to lead students to an appreciation of the immigrant experience in the United States "From Ellis Island to JFK" (Foner, 2000). The particular interdisciplinary project that the article describes employs work from philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and political science in an effort to help students grasp more fully the often contentious and always complex process of immigrant acculturation from traditional cultures to life in a modern capitalist society. The project culminates with students considering how the narrative in Mario Puzo's novel "The Fortunate Pilgrim," which chronicles the fortunes of an early 20th century Italian immigrant family in New York, reflects the academic work covered previously in class and whether the story line applies more generally to the experiences of recent immigrants to the United States. It is notable that the venue within which this class occurs, St. John's University, has had as part of its larger mission for nearly 150 years the education of first-generation college students. This mission is a particularly telling one in a classroom peopled with first-generation Muslim immigrants as well as fifth or sixth generation descendants of the southern and eastern European immigrants of the turn of the last century.

AB  - In April 2023, a group of 1 administrator, 5 faculty, and 20 students from the University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) traveled to the Dominican Republic to participate in an interdisciplinary service-learning project lasting six days. Disciplines involved included pharmacy (2 faculty members and 9 students), physical therapy/kinesiology (1 faculty member and 5 students), social work (1 faculty member and 4 students), and political science (1 faculty member and 2 students). The home base for the group while in the Dominican Republic was Abba's House Children's Center, a nonprofit Christian organization tasked with feeding, educating, and providing limited medical care to approximately 125 children living in the barrio of Cienfuegos. During the service-learning experience, ULM students engaged in various service and learning activities tied to their programs of study. Students and faculty completed the "Community Service Attitude Scale" (CSAS) before and after the service-learning experience (Schwartz & Howard, 1977). A total of 14 students (70%) submitted both a pre- and post-trip CSAS survey. There was a significant improvement in scores for 21 out of 25 items on the CSAS. This international interdisciplinary service-learning program positively impacted students' attitudes toward community service including awareness of global needs.

AB  - This manuscript reports on findings from the implementation of the EU project "Science Fiction in Education" (Sci-Fi-Ed). The project provides teachers with tools, training, and guidance that will assist them in enhancing their teaching, making science more attractive to students, connecting it with real-life issues such as the environment, and providing girls and other marginalised groups with access to science resources, material, and learning opportunities. The central project idea is to achieve this by incorporating science fiction (Sci-Fi) in science teaching. The aim of this paper is to present the framework and the lessons learned from designing and implementing the project. We focus on the following topics: (1) theoretical and empirical underpinnings of Sci-Fi narratives in education: the importance of narratives in education, their benefits, and challenges; (2) interdisciplinary teaching and learning: the interdisciplinary approach, its benefits, and challenges; (3) practical guidelines and innovative teaching ideas: introducing Sci-Fi-Ed; and (4) briefly discuss the lesson learned from the implementation of the project in classrooms in five countries.

AB  - Transdisciplinary approaches increasingly are needed to address complex environmental problems. Students can benefit from research and learning opportunities in which they investigate issues, integrate knowledge across disciplines, engage with stakeholders, collaborate with others, and devise solutions. This paper presents information on a 1-week intensive transdisciplinary course focused on climate, water, and agriculture for undergraduate and graduate students. The course, which was held at The Ohio State University's Stone Laboratory on Lake Erie, was offered over 3 years and utilized the local and regional context for investigation and inquiry. Presentations, discussions, experiential and field activities, and guest presentations were used as a way to promote student learning. Students felt positive about their participation and rated the transdisciplinary aspects of the course highly. Ideas from this course can be used to develop similar courses and learning experiences in other settings and on other environmental topics. Instructors are encouraged to utilize campus and local resources, recruit students from a diversity of disciplines, and align content and activities to build transdisciplinary skills.

AB  - The importance of data literacies and the shortage of research surrounding data science in elementary schools motivated this research-practice partnership (RPP) between researchers and teachers from a STEM elementary school. We used a narrative case study methodology to describe the instructional practices of one music teacher who co-designed a data science curricular unit during a summer professional development program and implemented it in her 5th-grade music classroom. Data collected for this study include in-person and video observations, reflective journals, artifacts, and interviews. Findings suggest that this teacher integrated data science literacies into her classroom by supporting multiple avenues for data storytelling and relying on learners' everyday discourse and experiences. Our study details a practical example of implementing data science with non-STEM domains in elementary classrooms.

AB  - Recently, pedagogical approaches have focused on creating arts-integrated STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) or STEAM classes, which have drawn attention to the importance of the arts in science education. Despite increasing development and implementation of STEAM initiatives in science, there is limited discussion on the theoretical foundations, which could provide sound guidelines for science educators and teachers in planning and teaching STEAM curricula. In this paper, we set out the theoretical framework that explains and justifies integration of the arts and socio-cultural interaction into science teaching and learning. We explain in some detail the component theoretical elements and describe how these elements translate into teaching/learning practices in STEAM lessons. We conclude by re-emphasising the application of theoretical frameworks for the design of teaching/learning practices in an intercultural STEAM program.

AB  - A drug discovery project has been successfully implemented in a first-year general, organic, and biochemistry (GOB) health science course and second-year organic undergraduate chemistry course. This project allows students to apply the fundamental principles of chemistry and biology to a problem of medical significance, practice basic laboratory skills, and understand the interdisciplinary aspect of the drug discovery platform. Students collectively synthesize a small library of antituberculosis compounds and subsequently screen them using a Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion assay for inhibitory activity against "Mycobacterium smegmatis", a known safe surrogate of "Mycobacterium" tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. The last unit of the project involves students using PyMOL, a free computer program, to examine a cocrystal structure of the activated inhibitor-enzyme complex, allowing students to identify the molecular interactions responsible for the binding affinity.

AB  - The development of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Liberal Arts, and Mathematics) curricula has emerged in the past decade. A pedagogical STEAM (Scaffolding, Tutoring, Engaging, Argumentation, and Modeling) model was proposed in this study to implement interdisciplinary STEAM curricula. The effects of this model on students' project competence and learning motivation were evaluated. A quasi-experimental design was adopted in the study. One hundred fourteen participants were recruited from a high school in southern Taiwan. There were 57 students in the experimental group (27 males; 30 females) and 57 in the comparison group (35 males; 22 females). The results revealed that the implementation of the pedagogical STEAM model was able to enhance the project competence and learning motivation of the students in the experimental group. Qualitative data from student interviews also revealed that the students had positive perceptions of the model. The main implication of this study is that the pedagogical STEAM model has the potential to be used as a teaching guide for the high school interdisciplinary curricula.

AB  - Three dimensional (3D) design and printing are customizable and cost-effective approaches to developing small equipment and other items for use in various interdisciplinary applications. However, many pedagogical approaches to 3D printing focus more on the generation of artifacts than on the involvement of students as creators. Moreover, library makerspaces offer 3D printing services but cannot always engage the students with practical applications of their designs. We sought to determine if promoted use of 3D printing could be developed in biology laboratory trainees, ranging from undergraduate students to postdoctoral fellows. We combined two instructional workshops in the San Diego State University Library build IT makerspace, with two individual assignments to build items for the research laboratory. Evaluation of the course revealed that participants had expected the design and print processes to be of high complexity, but learned that the necessary skills could be acquired and applied in a relatively short period of time. Also, we found that trainees became proficient in 3D design and printing, and that a majority of individuals used 3D printing for subsequent applications. This effective translation of 3D printing to the research laboratory can be a paradigm for how 3D fabrication is taught. Moreover, this approach required the collaboration of library makerspace and research faculty, underlining the value of embedded librarianship in enhancing training and knowledge.

AB  - Creating explanations is an important process for students, not only to make connections between novel information and background knowledge, but also to be able to communicate their understanding of any given topic. This article explores students' explanations in the context of computational science and engineering, an important interdisciplinary field that enables scientists and engineers to solve complex problems. Specifically, this study explores: (a) students' approaches to create written explanations of programing code and (b) the relationship between students' explanations and their ability to do computer programing. Students wrote in-code comments for 3 MATLAB® worked-examples, which were qualitatively analyzed using a coding scheme. Different approaches to self-explain were identified using hierarchical cluster analysis, and differences in students' ability to do computer programing were identified using analysis of variance. The resulting approaches to self-explain were: original solution, mechanistic, principle-based, limited, and goal-based. The findings suggest that experienced students wrote simple in-code comments to self-explain, but students with lower ability to do computer programing wrote more comprehensive explanations, as they may take this as a learning opportunity.

AB  - This paper highlights the design process and implementation for an "all majors" undergraduate course that allows students a chance to reconnect with the natural world. During this course students explore a wide range of biological and physical science based topics that seek to highlight human intervention and our impacts on the planet. The course prepares students to engage with scientific inquiry and research methodologies across a variety of disciplines. At the end of this course, students will be asked to engage in project-based learning experiences that ask them to identify, explore, and create potential solutions for problems in their local communities.

AB  - Interest in interdisciplinary programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-related fields at the graduate-degree level is widespread across American higher education. Using longitudinal qualitative interviews, this article considers the early career experiences of scholars who hold an interdisciplinary PhD in neuroscience. The scholars were interviewed first as doctoral students and then 6 years later. The findings illustrate the challenges of marketability, professional development, and balancing personal and career demands for interdisciplinary PhD recipients in STEM-related fields.

AB  - This paper proposes a study of the various ways in which social and ethical issues are integrated in the curricula of nanoscience and nanotechnology master degrees. During the last decade, new types of courses have appeared in science and technology universities, first in the United States and now reaching Europe and France, associating a call for interdisciplinarity with a strong convergence of science and industry and new ways of integrating social and/or human sciences in scientific curricula. These courses entitled "science and society", meant for science students, lean on (and participate in the construction of) specific ways of describing science, technology, and the social world, generally saturated with political values. The integration of these courses in science education, linked with a strong effort to specify new institutional organizations of scientific practice and education (in particular through political support of emerging fields like nanoscience, synthetic biology, or the cognitive sciences), may play an important role in the acculturation of future scientists and engineers to "good" scientific practices and discourses. The case of nanoscience and nanotechnology is particularly revealing of the changes which are now taking place in some universities. This paper will strive to identify different types of courses called "nano and society", taking examples from both French and American contexts, and linking them to more or less implicit socio-epistemic and political values.

AB  - Background: To inform STEM education for benefiting emerging bilingual (EB) and English fluent (EF) students, the present study evaluated the order effects of integrating science and arts within a large-scale, ongoing effort investigating the efficacies of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)-aligned Science Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) methodologies to provide more equitable opportunities to students to learn science through Arts integration (STEAM). The experiment examines the curriculum integrating order of implementing combinations of STEM and STEAM approaches in fifth grade life and physical science instruction, comparing (STEM [right arrow] STEAM) vs (STEAM [right arrow] STEM). Results: T tests and a three-way between-groups analysis of covariance examined the impact of instructional order, language fluency, and teachers' implementation fidelity. Findings indicate similar results in life and physical sciences, in which the STEAM first approach produced significantly higher science learning gains for both EF and EB students, revealing some higher learning gains for EF students, but with greater STEAM first order effect advantages for EB students overall. While EF students show higher learning gain scores in the high fidelity classrooms, the advantage of the STEAM first order is greater for EB students in all classroom fidelity levels and even within low to moderate implementation fidelity classrooms, as may commonly occur, such that the integration order of STEAM before STEM strategy is particularly advantageous to EB learners. Conclusions: The integration pattern of leading with STEAM and following with STEM offers an important opportunity to learn for EB students, and increases equity in opportunities to learn among EB and EF learners of science. Both EB and EF students benefit similarly and significantly in high fidelity implementation classrooms. However, the gains for EF students are not significant in low fidelity implementation classrooms, while in such low fidelity implementation classrooms, the EB students still benefited significantly despite the poor implementation. These results suggest that a strong compensating STEAM first order effect advantage is possibly involved in the implementation system for the EB population of learners. Teaching science through the arts with STEAM lessons is an effective approach that can be significantly improved through introducing STEM units with the STEAM first order effect advantage.

AB  - We study the interconnection between Physics and Mathematics in concrete instances, departing from the usual expression for the Coulomb electric field, produced by a point-like charge. It is scrutinized by means of six epistemology-intensive questions and radical answers are proposed, intended to widen one's understanding of the subject. Our interventions act along two complementary directions. One of them regards ontology, since questions induce one to look closely at the electric charge, from different perspectives, promoting reflections about its nature and reinforcing the corresponding concept. Formal manipulations rely on the identification of concepts with symbols, and the other direction concerns the spatial extension of mathematical structures. Our questions and their somewhat unusual answers help disclosing information which is not present in many textbooks, and show that Mathematics can be used as an efficient epistemological tool in Physics teaching.

AB  - Futures studies is usually a transdisciplinary study and as such embraces the physical world of the sciences and system sciences and the subjective world of individuals and cultures, as well as the time dimension--past, present and futures. Science education, where student interests, opportunities and challenges often manifest themselves, can provide a suitable entry point for futures work. In this paper, we describe how we have used futures themes, concepts and techniques both implicitly and explicitly in our undergraduate middle school teacher education courses and, in particular, science curriculum and general studies courses. Taking a critical orientation to the past and the present in these courses enables the future to be more than a mere reproduction of the status quo and opens up a range of possible futures in the areas of current interest. For example, having studied middle school teaching and learning in mathematics and science, students explore the past, present and possible future of a natural part of a university campus. In a general studies course on the science of the Earth's atmosphere, students construct a normative futures scenario on living in a changing climate. One way to gain insight into an uncertain future is to construct scenarios. This technique has been used since the 1970s to bring issues of environment and development--areas with strong science content--to the attention of both scientists and policymakers.

AB  - Strong communication skills, in varied professional settings, have become an absolute necessity for young professionals. Therefore, university educators are challenged to provide novice specialists with the effective foreign language training that could bring the real professional world into the classroom. This study suggests an innovative method for teaching communication skills to students, through the use of real-life scenarios, drawn from the professional context. The core objective of the research was to define whether the scenario-based instruction could effectively enhance the development of professional communication skills of students in the context of university foreign language training. The data were collected through active observation and critical incidents technique, analyzed and summarized by means of descriptive statistics. The results of the study indicate the efficacy of scenario-based communication training in higher education. However, scenario-based instruction requires careful assessment of learners' needs and expectations, thoughtful selection and design of teaching materials, and the development of an active learning environment.

AB  - This article reveals the meaning and content of the linguistic and cultural studies integration into social and political science course in the training of future politicians. The article reflects the importance of linguistic and cultural studies for the formation of language competence of students as well as skills of political communication, for understanding the characteristics of the country's social and political issues. The interdisciplinary approach emphasises the relationship in the study of linguistic, cultural, and political agenda, characterises the interdisciplinary essence of regional studies. The critical discourse analysis (CDA) of political texts was chosen as the key methodological strategy for the efficient development of political communication and problem-solving skills. The authors propose the implementation of a special interdisciplinary course for the first-year students majoring in philology and political studies, focused on the studying the political and cultural features of a language-targeted country by means of CDA. We compared the results of students' political communication skills development prior and post- course period and we observed the improvement according to the following criteria: perception of the vocabulary and functional language structures (by 17%); analysis of cultural and political agenda from the explicit and implicit language structures (by 23%); text annotation (by 50%); text production, distribution and target audience analysis (by 10%). Moreover, it was observed that CDA implementation facilitated the development of critical thinking skills as well as the skills of texts decoding.

AB  - Learning at Scale is a fast growing field that affects formal, informal, and workplace education. Highly interdisciplinary, it builds on solid foundations in the learning sciences, computer science, education, and the social sciences. We define learning at scale as the study of the technologies, pedagogies, analyses, and theories of learning and teaching that take place with a large number of learners and a high ratio of learners to facilitators. The scale of these environments often changes the very nature of the interaction and learning experiences. We identify three types of technologies that support scale in education: dedicated content-agnostic platforms, such as MOOCs; dedicated tools, such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems; and repurposed platforms, such as social networks. We further identify five areas that scale affects: learners, research and data, adaptation, space and time, and pedagogy. Introducing the papers in this special issue on the topic, we discuss the characteristics, affordances, and promise of learning at scale.

AB  - This paper examines the implementation practices of a 6th grade middle school teacher enacting STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and math) teaching in his classroom after participating in a 45-hour STEAM professional development. Case study is used to detail the process, successes, and challenges. Project-based learning, technology integration, and transdisciplinary teaching are the lens from which the teacher's lesson and reflections are deconstructed. Challenges in STEAM teaching are discussed including the shifting role of the teacher, determining student collaboration, and time. This is part of a larger study examining the STEAM teaching practices of 43 middle school science and math teachers.

AB  - Reported herein is a multidisciplinary laboratory experiment for advanced undergraduate students that includes elements of material synthesis, in the synthesis of cyclodextrin-containing metal-organic frameworks (CD-MOFs), and environmental chemistry, in the use of these MOFs for pollutant removal. This multiday laboratory experiment starts with the synthesis of cyclodextrin-containing metal-organic frameworks (CD-MOFs) using vapor diffusion crystal growth procedures, followed by the use of the CD-MOFs for a pollutant removal application. Specifically, the CD-MOFs were used for the removal of a methylene blue dye (a common mimic of aromatic pollutants) from an organic solution, with the monitoring of the success of the removal procedures using UV-vis spectroscopy. This experiment was implemented as part of a larger multiday unit, and undergraduate students were particularly engaged with and excited by the CD-MOF synthesis and methylene blue removal experimental modules. As a result, the decision was made to make these two components a stand-alone multidisciplinary laboratory experiment, the results of which are reported herein.

AB  - Ecology involves learning the multiple processes that occur in an ecosystem in a non-linear manner. For students to understand the complexity of an ecosystem and the processes, an interdisciplinary teaching and learning strategy is essential. Crossing the four disciplines that constitute STEM education, characterizes STEM education as an interdisciplinary approach. This study prescribes Facebook incorporated STEM education to conduct the lessons on a dynamic ecosystem, and the effects are reported. Mixed method research encompassing experimental research and qualitative interviews conducted with From Four students (equivalent to grade 9) revealed that the new strategy, Facebook incorporated STEM education fostered students understanding of ecosystems. The paired sample t-test analysis indicated significant differences between the pre and post understanding scores. The qualitative interview analysis informed how Facebook incorporated STEM education resulted in students acquiring better understandings. The study entails an interdisciplinary strategy is essential for effective teaching of a complex process such as the ecosystem.

AB  - STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education is vital for incubating future scientists, engineers, and inventors. Teaching and learning in STEM education require teachers and students to employ design thinking and multi-disciplinary knowledge to formulate new solutions for emerging problems. School teachers are facing multiple challenges in implementing STEM education. With the application of the Self-efficacy and stages of concern theories, this quantitative study (with 235 teacher respondents) aims to unearth Hong Kong teachers' responses regarding STEM education. The results show that 5.53% of the respondents regard themselves as "well prepared" for STEM education. On the other hand, the respondents have intense "information", "management", and "consequence" concerns about implementing STEM education in schools. The findings reflect that there is an urgent need to provide teachers with articulated professional development, pedagogic support, and curricular resources for empowering them to implement STEM education in practice.

AB  - While education increasingly relies on social media technologies to provide richer learning experiences, the rigid and course-centric design of curricula still imposes a challenge for students to construct meaningful connections between social media and formal learning. Building on the knowledge graphs' potential to establish semantic links among data entities, this paper investigates to what extent knowledge graph-based tools help students with integrating and accessing transdisciplinary social media content in formal courses, and contribute to constructivism in online learning environments? This study proposes a framework that includes a set of tools built on a novel knowledge graph designed to help educators in exposing detailed coverage of their formal courses through explicit concepts, which can serve as building blocks for students to integrate and access transdisciplinary social media content in formal learning settings. The framework is piloted in a business school where 180 students used these tools in an information systems (IS) course. The preliminary results indicate the majority (around 68%) of materials shared and accessed by students through this framework was connected to other disciplines beyond IS, reflecting the possible creation and exploration of transdisciplinary links between social media content and formal courses. Thirty-three students were interviewed to evaluate their opinion on the tools with respect to social constructivism in online learning environments. The interviews provide initial insights on the tools' potential to promote constructivism by supporting collaborative, learner-centered, high-quality, authentic, facilitated, and interactive learning principles. The study helps students and educators better integrate and access emerging social media content in formal courses.

AB  - The implementation of science reform must be viewed as a systems-level problem and not just focus on resources for teachers and students. High-capacity instructional leadership is essential for supporting classroom science instruction. Recent reform efforts include a shift from learning about science facts to figuring out scientific phenomena in which students use science practices as they build and apply disciplinary core ideas. We report findings from a research study on professional development (PD) to support instructional leaders' learning about the science practices. After participating in the PD, the instructional leaders' familiarity with and leadership content knowledge of the science practices significantly improved. Initially, principals used their understandings from other disciplines and content neutral visions of classrooms to make sense of science instruction. For example, they initially used their understandings of models and argument from ELA and math to make sense of science classroom instruction. Furthermore, some principals focused on content neutral strategies, like a clear objective. Over the course of the PD workshops, principals took up the language of the science practices in more nuanced and sophisticated ways. Principals' use of the language of the science practices became more frequent and shifted from identifying or defining them to considering quality and implementation in science classrooms. As we design tools to support science, we need to consider instructional leaders as important stakeholders and develop resources to specifically meet their needs. If the science feels too unfamiliar or intimidating, principals may avoid or reframe science reform efforts. Consequently, it is important to leverage instructional leaders' resources from other disciplines and content neutral strategies as bridges for building understanding in science. We argue that the science practices are one potential lever to engage in this work and shift instructional leaders' understandings of science instruction.

AB  - Introducing Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (NST) topics into school science curricula is considered useful for an in-depth understanding of the content, processes and nature of science and technology, and also for negotiating the social aspects of science. This study examines (a) the development of an inquiry-based Teaching-Learning Sequence (TLS) on NST topics, which incorporates socio-scientific issues and out-of-school learning environments and (b) the dissemination of the developed TLS through the training of further teachers. In both cases, a participatory design, in particular Communities of Learners (CoLs), was established, consisting of teachers, science researchers, science education researchers and science museum experts. As a theoretical framework for the TLS development, the Model of Educational Reconstruction is used. The qualitative analysis of the obtained data highlights that teachers' interactions with colleagues in the CoL on issues regarding the educational reconstruction of the different aspects of the TLS impact the process of its development. Regarding the dissemination of the TLS, the findings indicate that teachers modified several elements of the TLS and particularly the included activities, influenced by their mentors' prior experience and their own rich contextual knowledge. Finally, guidelines for the development and dissemination of a TLS are discussed.

AB  - This article considers developments in conceptualising and responding to student disruption and disaffection. Commencing with the educational sociologist John Furlong's attempt to fuse psychology and sociology to better understand disaffected students, this essay also engages with a recent attempt at transdisciplinary considerations of student disaffection. It is argued that the biopsychosocial model as advocated by Paul Cooper promises to extend the analysis of student disaffection and disruption. The biopsychosocial model as postulated by Cooper is weighted towards the biopsycho and is limited by scant consideration of the biopolitics of the increasing prevalence of behaviour disorders. Nikolas Rose's examination of the development of medical knowledge is enlisted to suggest broader possibilities for transdisciplinary lines of inquiry. The transdisciplinarity of Cooper's suggested model is important and points to the potential of the responses from across fields of knowledge to assist in building more nuanced understandings of social organisation and behaviour.

AB  - This article provides a case study of student experiences working as part of an interdisciplinary research team. A team of graduate-level students from social work, civil engineering, and computer science collaborated on the design of a mobile device application that captures data regarding how transportation disadvantage affects the lived experiences of community-dwelling older adults and single parents experiencing homelessness with dependent children. An online survey (N=5) was used to assess student experiences on the team. Findings from this case study have important implications for engaging students in interdisciplinary applied research, including challenging them to expand their knowledge base beyond the traditional confines of their disciplines, encouraging critical and creative thinking skills, and harnessing technology for the greater social good.

AB  - In light of the increasing frequency of misleading information in social media regarding environmental issues, this study aimed to identify misleading information spread through TikTok videos and to discuss why such content is considered misleading, drawing on relevant literature. Hashtags with large numbers of views, such as #climatechange, #sustainability, #pollution, #biodiversity, #environmentalprotection, #environmentalissues, #energysource, and #environmentalproblems, were used for data collection through web scrapper called Apify (https://apify.com/). A total of 29 misleading videos were found. Content analysis was applied to identify and classify the topics and misleading claims. The topics of misleading videos, according to the most frequent mentions, were energy sources, followed by climate change, pollution, biodiversity, and environmental degradation. Among the misleading claims, videos related to pyramids as nonpollutant power plants and conspiracy related to pollution exhibited the highest frequency. The results show various misleading claims in videos related to environmental topics. Also, emphasized the importance of science education in addressing misleading information. In addition, the importance of an interdisciplinary approach for addressing environmental issues was reinforced.

AB  - The use of system dynamics as a learning tool for developing sustainable energy strategies and environmental education has advanced in recent years with the availability of new modelling software and webtools. Among the existing models, we highlight the online 2050 Calculators, which aim at simulating scenarios for greenhouse gas emissions, energy planning, sustainable land use, and food consumption. The objective of this study is to assess the available calculators and their contribution to an interdisciplinary education via systems thinking. We carried out a review of the existing models worldwide and ran some of the tools with students from three different postgraduate programmes at master's level at Imperial College London (United Kingdom) and IFP School (France), whilst also assessing their individual views afterwards. The assessments were conducted once a year during three subsequent years: 2019, 2020, and 2021. The results are discussed under the epistemology of critical pedagogy, showing that the use of webtools, such as the 2050 Calculators, can significantly contribute to the students' environmental awareness and political engagement, providing important lessons about the use of system dynamics for policy and science education.

AB  - Purpose: A modern trend in the educational environment in recent years has been the permanent education system with the involvement of online study modes. It is based on multidisciplinarity and adaptivity of educational technologies, starting with the basic level of education -- bachelor's degree, and ending with gaining competences in the field of engineering and economics throughout the whole professional life of a student. The purpose of this paper is to perform a detailed analysis of development of permanent education in Russian universities, focusing on statistical data on popularity of jobs as to professional groups among employers and determining peculiarities of permanent education, based on the distinguished peculiarities of permanent education and requirements of business to develop a model of engineering and managerial education that would integrate two blocks of the educational process -- engineering and economic, as well as include modern technologies of teaching. Design/methodology/approach: The authors propose the modern model of engineering management education that is implemented in the Russian technical universities. Its distinctive feature as compared to the conventional educational technologies is gaining competences in the field of economics and management at the same time with engineering education at the second stage of education -- the master's program. The proposed model of engineering and management education results in obtainment of two diplomas by the student who is awarded with a master's degree in engineering and a master's degree in economics. A difference of the offered model from the traditional educational technologies is obtaining competences in the sphere of economics and management together with engineering education at the master's program. The result of the offered model of engineering and managerial education is graduate's receiving two diplomas with master's degree of engineer and master of economics. The paper shows the existing mechanism of implementing the model of engineering and economic education in a technical university by the example of the master's program in Economics "Evaluation of economic risks during technological decisions (in oil processing and oil chemistry)." Findings: The offered model of engineering and managerial education will allow training the engineers of a new type, who will be able to adapt to new tendencies and initiate the changes that are necessary for effective functioning of business in the conditions of digital economy. Originality/value: The offered model of engineering and managerial education should be acknowledged as an innovational educational project that raises demand for graduates through their adaptability to employer's needs and their usage of new tools of management that are based on exchange of information data and that form managerial task for information provision of the process of decision making and their further execution.

AB  - The diversifying impacts of global disasters such as climate change and COVID-19 call for systematic consideration of how disasters can be addressed in different school subjects. In this paper, we discuss how the relationship between disaster and science education has been codified and framed in South Korea through an analysis of national curriculum and policy documents from the 2010s, a period marked by several human-caused disasters with lingering social impacts. A genealogical reading of policy documents reveals how disaster emerged as a curricular theme at the intersection of two policy discourses: the discourse of safety and the discourse of integration. Further analysis of the documents points to three tensions about science education that underlay this process, as disaster, a non-traditional topic, was introduced into the science curriculum. Our findings provide insights into the tensions and conflicting ideas about what should be learned in school science. We contend that a stronger theoretical and empirical base is needed when introducing new curriculum topics such as disaster into the curriculum. More effort is needed to justify the new topic against the existing aims and structures of school subjects, to consider the unique social and political context, and to bridge the gap between curriculum policy and classroom practice.

AB  - To successfully solve the complex challenges facing us in the 21st century, people with expertise in the science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) fields and other fields are needed, especially for their interdisciplinary way of thinking and working. These competencies should be learned in school, which first implies teacher education to that effect. In this article, a detailed theoretical reflection on the connections or overlapping areas between STEAM education and the dimension of sustainability in a model-like way is presented. It is also argued that mathematical modelling can be a possible instrument for promoting pre-service teachers' professionalism in STEAM education and education for sustainable development (ESD). Based on authors' developed model of this theoretical framework, an ESD-modelling seminar was created for pre-service mathematics teachers in which they also worked on that ESD and STEAM-based modelling problems. In the written reflections on the seminar, which were used as the survey instrument within the conducted empirical study, the teachers presented their subjective views on the connection between modelling and ESD. Based on an evaluation of these written reports by type-forming qualitative content analysis, three teacher profiles for handling ESD within mathematical modelling were developed. These types of teachers illustrate a strong awareness of promoting STEAM and ESD through modelling activities in their upcoming teacher life.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) has been recognized as one of the fundamental skills that all graduates should acquire. For this reason, motivational concerns need to be addressed at an early age of a child, and reaching students who do not consider themselves candidates for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines is important as well if the broadest audience possible is to be engaged. This article describes a framework for teaching and assessing CT in the context of K-12 education. The framework is based on Agile software engineering methods, which rely on a set of principles and practices that can be mapped to the activities of CT. The article presents as well the results of an experiment applying this framework in two sixth-grade classes, with 42 participants in total. The results show that Agile software engineering methods are effective at teaching CT in middle schools, after the addition of some tasks to allow students to explore, project, and experience the potential product before using the software tools at hand. Moreover, according to the teachers' feedback, the students reached all the educational objectives of the topics involved in the multidisciplinary activities. This result can be taken as an indicator that it is possible to use computing as a medium for teaching other subjects, besides computer science.

AB  - At Education Development Center, the authors developed professional learning for teachers that reflects the vision of the "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS") and makes explicit connections between science and language. In the authors' recent project, Literacy and Academic Success for English Learners through Science (LASErS) they worked with preK, Kindergarten, and Grade 1 teachers in an urban district in which approximately 50 percent of students are DLLs. In this article, the authors focus on their work with Grade 1 teachers who participated in a Living Things module. This module consisted of four full-day face-to-face instructional sessions--designed to build teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) in life science and support their integrated science and language teaching with a focus on DLLs.

AB  - During the last decade, different values, tools and practices promoted by maker culture have been adopted in formal educational settings with the aim of reinvigorating Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education. Higher education institutions (HEIs) have also engaged with maker culture to explore its potentialities regarding education, entrepreneurship and innovation. However, these collaborations with various stakeholders are not always smooth and educators need to deal with significant challenges that arise in these engagements, despite the problem-solving learning opportunities that they can offer their students. This paper presents the results of a case study that dealt with these issues through the establishment of an open and collaborative learning ecosystem (OCLE) between different educators, students and external stakeholders. The empirical work was based on thirty-three semi-structured interviews across four countries, eight focus groups and a final participatory workshop. The study argues that maker culture can offer several potentialities for pushing forward an integrative vision of STEM education as well as other disciplines from social sciences and humanities. An emphasis is placed on how tertiary education can benefit greatly from the adoption of OCLEs and how these communities of practices can encourage an education oriented to meeting societal challenges. The paper also warns that these kinds of interventions face significant organisational challenges in HEIs that demand significant institutional recognition and support to overcome this organisational resistance.

AB  - The X-Men are an ensemble of superheroes whose powers are associated with the X-Gene, a mutant genetic factor. The powers exhibited by each character differ and are dependent on how the X-Gene has modified their individual genomes. For instance, Wolverine possesses regenerative healing, Storm can control local weather systems, and Colossus can create an impenetrable "organic steel" layer around his body. Thanks to the establishment of the superhero genre in modern cinema, audiences are familiar with Colossus from films such as "X-Men: Days of Future Past" and "Deadpool." While attaining this power might be attractive to many people, there are innumerate scientific obstacles to be overcome to replicate this "organic steel" layer. Due to its unique combination of high strength and flexibility, a graphene-based layer might be a more realistic material for Colossus' impenetrable skin and would also address a number of physiological issues associated with an "organic steel" layer. The actualization of this layer would depend on complex processes associated with protein folding, protein self-assembly, and changing the structure of his skin. In the classroom, Colossus can foster a multidisciplinary learning environment where concepts in physiology can overlap with topics in physics, engineering, and materials science. Just like other superheroes, Colossus can also be used to promote scientific content in outreach for the general public.

AB  - Interdisciplinary science learning can play a central role in promoting students' 21st century skills. However, students tend to have low perceived self-efficacy towards 21st century skills, thus limiting the application of their actual scientific competence. This study seeks, based on a 1.5-year intervention study, to promote students' perceived self-efficacy towards 21st century skills through science learning compared to a non-experimental group. During the intervention, everyday life-related scenarios were utilized, with students guided to create core idea maps. Data on students' perceived self-efficacy were collected before and after the intervention. Results showed that students' perceived self-efficacy towards 21st century skills changed in a significantly positively way after the intervention.

AB  - This paper presents specific reference tools to provide institutional language integrated support with a specific language plan for a bilingual programme at the University of Malaga. This follows experts' opinions that claim the need of such a plan. While studies show the importance of language support in bilingual instruction, they rarely address specific content professors' needs tending to remain distant from real teaching contexts. The title "The language of learning" highlights the reality of bilingual classrooms to address specific needs of this unique academic scenario. The article examines how language support has a dual focus that includes both students and instructors. The paper concludes with a reflection on interdisciplinary innovation projects that provide professors with the tools to ensure the quality of bilingual programmes.

AB  - Interdisciplinary teaching has been advocated as a means to foster cooperation between traditionally separate fields and broaden students' perspectives in the classroom. We explored the pedagogical difficulties of interdisciplinary team teaching through a first-year seminar in magic, religion, and the origins of science. Although many accounts in the literature suggest a more cohesive approach to interdisciplinary teaching, we first introduced the separate fields, their methodologies, and limitations before combining the insights from all three fields to analyze case studies relating to the main themes of the course. In this case study, we reflect on how this "pieces-to-picture" method reduced student confusion when confronted with several disciplines in our classroom.

AB  - In primary and secondary schools, the disciplines encompassed in "STEM"--Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics--have usually been studied as separate subjects, with little effort directed towards non-anecdotal integration. "Integrated STEM education" is one of the most recent interdisciplinary proposals and, under its umbrella, school disciplines are beginning to be integrated in an educationally fruitful way. STEM as a renovated approach is gaining ground, despite the infancy of its philosophical analysis. Explicit epistemological discussion of integrated STEM proposals is either absent or blurred. The overall aim of this paper is therefore to establish an initial framework for philosophical discussion, to help analyse the aims and discourse of integrated STEM education, and consider the implications that adopting any particular epistemological view might have on the aims for general education, and on the construction of science curricula oriented towards citizenship and social justice. We envisage humanist values for integrated STEM education and, after revisiting the currently proposed relationships between the STEM knowledge areas, we adopt a model of a "seamless web" for such relationships that is coherent with humanist values. A few issues emerging from this model are addressed through the lens of the so-called "family resemblance approach", a framework from the field of research on the nature of science, in order to identify some potential central features of "nature of STEM".

AB  - We report a series of experiments based upon cinnamon oil that were developed to provide a practical integration of green and sustainable chemistry concepts for the organic chemistry laboratory. Five experiments centering around cinnamaldehyde as a green, plant-based chemical were performed by undergraduate students in a second-year organic chemistry class. Cinnamon oil was obtained through hydrodistillation, and cinnamaldehyde was used to demonstrate the use of a secondary metabolite in chemistry laboratories. Subsequently, a reduction reaction, aldol reaction, and Schiff base formation were carried out. Through these experiments, students are able to practice techniques such as thin-layer chromatography, column chromatography, recrystallization, and measurement of melting points along with UV, FTIR, and [superscript 1]H NMR spectroscopy. Microscale practices were employed in each of the reactions, and microscale column chromatography was used for purifications. The final experiment was an antimicrobial activity assessment of cinnamon oil and the cinnamaldehyde derivatives obtained from the previous experiments. Along with an interdisciplinary component, students were exposed to sunscreen chemistry and were led to consider the many uses of each product obtained. These experiments were based upon a single, inexpensive plant metabolite and biobased material to educate students about green chemistry and its practical applications in the undergraduate laboratory.

AB  - Interest has grown in the past few years about the place of social work in science. Questions remain, such as whether social work should be considered a science, and if so, where it fits into the constellation of sciences. This article attempts to shed light on these questions. After briefly considering past and present constructions of science and reflecting on views of science within the social work profession over time, we present an argument for how social work contributes to predominant questions facing science today through its unique ability to draw together and integrate knowledge from a variety of disciplines. Finally, we address how the profession can best prepare the coming generation of social workers to operate to their full potential in the current transdisciplinary world of science.

AB  - The growing number of faculty positions in biology education, the formation of professional societies focused specifically on biology education, and the increasing number of publications in biology education over the past decade
point to the emergence of biology education as a relevant area of research for biologists. Doctoral programs focused specifically on biology education are explicitly designed to produce scholars prepared to advance knowledge
in the field, answering important questions inherent to biology education and serving as leaders in biology education reform. However, the limited number of doctoral programs specifically focused on biology education and the growing number of faculty positions advertised for scholars with this specialization suggests there is a need for additional programs with this focus. To address this need, Middle Tennessee State University recently developed an interdisciplinary PhD with a specific concentration in "biology
education." The program is a collaborative effort between the College of Basic and Applied Sciences and the College of Education and brings together faculty with expertise in basic biology, biology education, and
educational theory and practice to prepare scholars who possess the expansive set of professional skills that will allow them to advance the field of biology education. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - This paper presents a set of ideas about the basics for developing interdisciplinary dialogues between content (science) and language (English) in bilingual educational processes, under the premise that a satisfactory relationship between those elements help guarantee successful content-based instruction (CBI) in its form known as "sheltered instruction." Additionally, a practical example (based on a science curriculum) is presented to demonstrate some principles that inform approaches to teaching such content. Finally, based on the authors' interdisciplinary work and pedagogical experiences, some recommendations on teaching content and language in bilingual settings are presented in the form of cautions (a balance of actions) and challenges (prospects).

AB  - Teaching disciplinary literacy in the elementary classroom provides rich potential for bridging the literacy-content divide, building background knowledge, extending learning, and deepening student thinking. This article explores how six elementary teachers tried and tested approaches to embedding literacy in three very different subjects: science, history, and visual arts. Drawing on data from a design-based research project, we provide suggestions for how teachers can embed high-quality literacy instruction in multiple disciplines.

AB  - Collaborative statisticians are instrumental to maintaining the rigor and reproducibility of multidisciplinary projects on which they collaborate. Clear, complete, well-annotated records of data, its revising, analysis, interpretation, and presentation are essential. Many students do not know how to systematically and consistently organize their digital files and cannot reliably replicate (or find!) work that may have been performed on a collaborative project. This article describes a newly developed and required one semester collaborative statistics course that includes the explicit teaching of project organization in lecture, emphasis of these skills on linked homework assignments, and their closely supervised practice through a mentored collaborative project with multidisciplinary researchers. The tripartite design provided exposure to project organization concepts during the course, encouraged straightforward implementation through homework assignments, and then challenged students with a real-world experience during a collaborative project. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: The purpose of this systematic literature review is to evaluate the application of UTAUT and UTAUT2 frameworks in K-12 education. Background: This study included an analysis of peer-reviewed empirical studies that use the UTAUT and UTAUT2 frameworks to understand the factors that influence technology adoption among K-12 educators. New constructs were identified, and core determinates of the models were studied. Methodology: The researchers used a systematic literature review. Inclusion criteria required articles to be written in English, non-duplicate, peer-reviewed, focused on K-12 educators, and employing quantitative methods to test or extend the UTAUT or UTAUT2 models. We used a strategic search string to conduct standardized searches across multiple databases in education, psychology, business, engineering, and multi-disciplinary publications. We conducted a screening process on the initially identified 98 articles. We kept 14 articles for final analysis, as they met the inclusion criteria. Contribution: This study contributes to the fields of (a) information science, (b) information technology (IT), and (c) education by offering a more detailed analysis and understanding of the use of UTAUT and UTAUT2 in studying technology adoption among K-12 educators. Findings: The results show performance expectancy and social influence are the most used core factors. A total of 27 new variables were identified and organized into a taxonomy. Discrepancies in the application of the models were identified and further discussed. The use of UTAUT and UTAUT2 in K-12 education is minimal. Recommendations for Practitioners: Findings inform stakeholders in education (e.g., directors of technology operations, administrators, educators) and educational technology businesses (e.g., software engineers, interface and content designers, and user experience designers) how to create and integrate products that fit the true needs of the end-users. Technology must align with the tasks needed to accomplish educational objectives (performance expectancy), and certain environmental conditions are needed to support technology usage. Educators should also be aware their decisions regarding technology adoption are influenced by social factors, such as their superiors and peers. Recommendation for Researchers: Researchers need to conduct more studies using UTAUT and UTAUT2 within K-12 education. It is likely that teachers are influenced by their students, although little research exists to study this relationship through the lens of these models. Moreover, consideration should be given when renaming variables, using certain relationships, and developing research models. Impact on Society: Findings support our understanding of educational technology adoption, which benefits our education system, especially teachers and students alike, when done successfully. Future Research: Future research should include a meta-analysis exploring the statistical extent of relationships and new variables identified.

AB  - The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Inner Development Goals argue that addressing the world's challenges in the 21st century requires people to develop diverse skills. On the one hand, anyone, regardless of age and educational level, can develop multifaceted, transdisciplinary, and integrated competencies to address these challenges. On the other hand, people must work on skills and qualities relevant to inner growth to contribute to a more sustainable global society. Latin America is one of the regions in the world with the lowest skills indexes. Developing complex thinking competency allows individuals to increase their ability to address problems and challenges in their environment, a necessary skill for any professional. However, little progress has been made in documenting pedagogical implementations that develop disciplinary and transversal competencies, such as complex thinking competency, and students' results in mastering this competency. The present contribution identifies the units of analysis for an educational ethnography focused on recording the complex dynamics of educational systems and the implications of a competency-based educational model and presents students' perceived achievement of complex thinking competency as measured by a validated instrument.

AB  - Educators and researchers have been fighting the reading wars for the last century, with battles see-sawing literacy instruction in American schools from phonics to whole language and, most recently, back to phonics again. Over the last decade, 32 states and the District of Columbia have adopted new "science of reading" laws that require schools to use curricula and instructional techniques that are deemed "evidence-based." Such reading programs include direct instruction in phonics and reading comprehension skills, such as finding the main idea of a paragraph, and efforts to accelerate learning tend to double down on more of the same skill-building practice. The authors conduct the first-ever experimental study of this topic, based on randomized kindergarten-enrollment lotteries in nine Colorado charter schools that use an interdisciplinary knowledge-based curriculum called Core Knowledge.

AB  - Science courses employ instructional strategies that are based on lecture, drill, and practice to help students memorize collections of facts and procedures of increasing complexity. These strategies emphasize the acquisition of knowledge through the development of logical-mathematical skills employed in problem solving and verbal-linguistic abilities to make sense of the concepts and jargon in the field. Due to its highly abstract character, these science courses deal with complex representations that require an understanding of the role of mental models. Learners need to develop their visual-spatial skills as a means of gradually acquiring visual literacy while grappling with the symbols and conventions displayed in the figures, diagrams, and charts in textbooks. The Art & Science Project started at Vanier College as part of the History of Science course in the liberal arts program and was later adapted for use in three core chemistry courses (General, Solution, and Organic Chemistry) in the science program. The project uses a cross-disciplinary integration between visual arts and the natural sciences to promote a deeper understanding of the role of models. The liberal arts students analyze the parallels between the evolution of modern scientific concepts and the art movements from the same historical periods. Science students create visual representations that portray core ideas and threshold concepts in the field. The goal is to portray these abstractions using visual arts as means of creating meaning through symbolic visual representations while developing new perceptions of visual forms.

AB  - University students, faculty, and staff from science, engineering, education, entrepreneurship, and design (SEE(E)D) backgrounds developed a video game to leverage outreach efforts promoting sustainability, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ((S)STEM) to underserved students. This was accomplished by transforming a board game--previously developed and used to teach elementary students about complex and often misunderstood energy and sustainability issues--through a collaborative design process. The process of taking a tangible board game into the digital realm required significant design and pedagogical adaptations to maintain student learning outcomes and content delivery. Scientists, educators, and designers strengthened the graphical and pedagogical aspects of the game collaboratively to ultimately expand and deepen the energy literacy of elementary school students. This design case seeks to elucidate the multidisciplinary collaborative design process used by SEE(E)D faculty and researchers as well as students to redesign a board game into a didactic video game that is easier to both deploy and disseminate for the benefit of K-12 students and teachers.

AB  - The question of renaming graduate psychology programs to psychological science is a timely and contentious issue. To better understand why some programs, but not others, are changing names, we surveyed chairpersons (Study 1) and faculty (Study 2) within graduate psychology and psychological science programs. Within psychology programs, a name change was often perceived as unnecessary, nonrepresentative, or intimidating to science-averse students. Within psychological science programs, a name change was often perceived as better conveying the science of psychology to others, a scientific/research focus, or interdisciplinary partnerships. Differences of opinion may be due to psychological science, as compared to psychology, faculty's greater concern about conveying psychological science to others, clarifying their program's focus, and partnering with other sciences.

AB  - The paper reports an empirical study on the relationship between middle school students' understanding of nature of science (NOS) and their metacognitive awareness. The reconceptualised family resemblance approach to the nature of science (RFN) (Erduran & Dagher, 2014; Kaya & Erduran, 2016) as a holistic framework that covers science as epistemic-cognitive and social system guided the study. A total of 701 students (180 5th, 167 6th, 170 7th, and 184 8th grade) and 3 students from each grade level (in total 12 students) who have low, moderate, high-RFN understanding, and metacognitive awareness levels were interviewed. The data sources are the "RFN Student Questionnaire," "Metacognitive Awareness Inventory for Children," and interviews. The data was analyzed with Pearson product-moment and thematic analysis. The results indicated that there is a statistically positive relationship between middle school students' RFN understanding and their metacognitive awareness. Furthermore, the results of the interviews showed that students' responses to RFN and metacognitive awareness questions were aligned and compatible. The students with high metacognitive awareness had higher RFN understanding and those with lower metacognitive awareness had lower RFN understanding. This relationship was evident for each grade level student separately as well. The study opens a new study area in terms of the use of metacognitive strategies in RFN-enriched lessons for experimental and causal-comparative designs. The teacher education programs or curriculum studies can consider utilization of metacognitive prompts in NOS teaching.

AB  - TNT is both toxic and explosive, and therefore, the detection of TNT represents an environmental concern and a security concern. Dogs are often used for detection, but other methods are needed. This laboratory investigates a ruthenium bipyridine ([Ru(bpy)[subscript 3]][superscript 2+]) luminescence-based trinitrotoluene (TNT) sensor. Students will synthesize [Ru(bpy)[subscript 3]][superscript 2+], investigate sensors, and consider possible mechanistic pathways of quenching. Students are unlikely to have analyzed luminescence quenching data previously, and using TNT shows how important the technique is for problems like national security, environmental contamination, and land mine deactivation. The content of the lab is ideal for upper-level laboratories, when students have the foundational coursework to appreciate the interdisciplinary nature of chemistry as the experiment integrates inorganic, analytical, and physical chemistry.

AB  - In 2008, we established the Integrated Graduate Program in Physical and Engineering Biology (IGPPEB) at Yale University. Our goal was to create a comprehensive graduate program to train a new generation of scientists who possess a sophisticated understanding of biology and who are capable of applying physical and quantitative methodologies to solve biological problems. Here we describe the framework of the training program, report on its effectiveness, and also share the insights we gained during its development and implementation. The program features co-teaching by faculty with complementary specializations, student peer learning, and novel hands-on courses that facilitate the seamless blending of interdisciplinary research and teaching. It also incorporates enrichment activities to improve communication skills, engage students in science outreach, and foster a cohesive program cohort, all of which promote the development of transferable skills applicable in a variety of careers. The curriculum of the graduate program is integrated with the curricular requirements of several Ph.D.-granting home programs in the physical, engineering, and biological sciences. Moreover, the wide-ranging recruiting activities of the IGPPEB serve to enhance the quality and diversity of students entering graduate school at Yale. We also discuss some of the challenges we encountered in establishing and optimizing the program, and describe the institution-level changes that were catalyzed by the introduction of the new graduate program. The goal of this article is to serve as both an inspiration and as a practical "how to" manual for those who seek to establish similar programs at their own institutions.

AB  - While interdisciplinary collaboration is desired among researchers, traditional science instruction generally results in science disciplines being taught as separate entities. This study focuses on student understanding of concepts at the intersection of two isolated disciplines--geoscience and bioscience--across two purposeful samples of college-aged students (United States, Germany). Specifically, we explored: (1) how students conceptualize large-scale biologic and geologic changes on Earth over deep time; (2) the relationship between student's conceptions and their understanding of evolutionary and geologic theories; and (3) how those conceptualizations explicate the need for integration of concepts within school curricula. Students were asked to respond to items about seven major evolutionary events in Earth's history (biosciences) and perceived changes to Earth's size and continental positions over time (geosciences). Both groups exhibited difficulties understanding absolute ages in deep time, although Young Earth and Young Life perspectives were present in the U.S. group and absent in the German group. Conceptions about changes to Earth's size and continental positions over time were consistent across both groups. Findings highlight the need for scientific education instruction in both countries that is interdisciplinary in content.

AB  - Countries with well-trained and qualified labor force today make a significant difference with other countries in areas such as economy, education and industry. One of the important reasons for this difference is that these countries have made innovations in the fields of science, technology and education policies as well as economy. STEM, which is composed of the abbreviations of the first letters of the words Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, is an interdisciplinary approach. The aim of this study is to gather the experimental dissertations examining the effect of STEM education on students' academic achievements in order to determine the effect of STEM education on academic success and synthesize the study findings. The research was conducted in a screening model. In the study, as there is heterogeneity among the publications included among the scope of the meta-analysis, the size of the impact was calculated utilizing the random effects model. The dissertations examined within the scope of this study were accessed from the Higher Education Institution (HEI) National Study Search System databases using the keywords STEM, academic achievement and experimental model. In this study, dissertations were examined by taking a certain time criterion. A total of 26 dissertations (19 postgraduates and 7 doctoral) examining the effect of STEM education, which is the post-test scores of the experimental and control groups conducted in 2018-2020, on academic achievement were accessed from the database. It was concluded in the study that STEM education has a positive effect on the academic achievements of students.

AB  - Creative virtual teamwork (CVT) has become relevant for many domains of our daily lives: during the pandemic, school classes, business collaborations, and even private personal interactions took place online. However, virtual teamwork is still a challenge for creative collaboration. Research on CVT started decades ago, yet an overview of the field is lacking. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a bibliometric analysis, including 153 high-quality publications, to provide insights into the development of CVT research across disciplines and a thematic content analysis of trends in research streams and measurements. The results list the most impactful authors and journals, research disciplines and trends, as well as measurements of CVT. Research on CVT is growing exponentially and is conducted across various disciplines, mostly in education, followed by computer science, management and psychology. The results of the bibliometric analysis suggest a scattered research landscape, which calls for more interdisciplinary research, including common measurements for CVT across scientific fields.

AB  - Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are textbook model systems to introduce "Nanomaterials" and "Nanotechnology" to students and laypersons. AuNPs are also suitable materials to raise awareness about the "Green Chemistry" principles. The unique optical and catalytic properties of nanosized gold make it ideal to timely develop hands-on experiments for nanomaterial synthesis requiring only few chemicals and simple equipment, such as a UV-vis spectrophotometer. While the Turkevich-Frens synthesis has been a preferred model system to date due to its simplicity, it still requires access to specific equipment and chemicals, e.g., to heat up the solution at relatively high temperature of ca. 100 °C. Various room temperature syntheses have been reported but suffer from relatively poor size control and/or the need for relatively harmful chemicals such as NaBH[subscript 4]. In contrast, room temperature and surfactant-free syntheses that only require HAuCl[subscript 4], water, an alcohol, such as ethanol, ethylene glycol, or glycerol, and a base at relatively low concentration (<10 mM) are presented and their benefits to develop hands-on experiments are highlighted. The concepts that these simple syntheses can convey cover topics as broad as "Nanotechnology," planning experimental screening of multiple variables, collaborative and open data science, or "Green Chemistry."

AB  - Laboratory work in chemistry has been extensively researched in the last decade but the gap between research and practice is still broad. This "Perspective" shares 10 guiding principles relating to university laboratory education, drawing on research over the last decade. Written with an audience of practitioners in mind, the "Perspective" aligns with Hounsell and Hounsell's congruence framework, so that the 10 principles consider all aspects of the laboratory curriculum: design, teaching approaches, and assessment approaches as suggested by Biggs, but additional contextual factors relating to teaching context: backgrounds of students and their support, and overall laboratory organisation and management. After discussing the rationale for each guiding principle, examples of approaches are given from recent literature along with prompts to help enact the guiding principle in practice.

AB  - The STEMITL project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between a Southeastern University's middle grades education department and local PDS partner school districts incorporating six full-day immersive projects for seventh-grade students. During the 2016-2017 academic year, seventh-grade students were brought to the university's newly constructed STEAM Center where middle grades practicum students implemented day-long interdisciplinary lessons co-designed by faculty and teacher candidates. Lessons incorporated social studies, science, mathematics, and literacy around a central theme of water pollution in China. The practicum student teachers (PSTs) fully executed the STEMITL curricula three times per semester allowing for hands-on application of lesson design and implementation as well as real-world teaching experience with integrated, interdisciplinary learning. Further, PSTs and middle school students collaborated with secondary school students and teachers in a partner school in Hong Kong via online communication, videos, and data sharing. Lessons learned are shared.

AB  - One of the main objectives of education, which raises individuals that the society needs, is to resource labor force that will provide the development of the society by maintaining the economic, social, scientific and technological advances. Many countries that aspire to have an advanced economy and technology aim to build a society that is advanced at Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and have sustainable development in these fields, and this has been one of the main educational strategies of those countries. STEM education has a strategic importance for our country to maintain the competitive power on international scale. This research aims to conduct a needs analysis towards the curricular design of STEM education to be proposed for the undergraduate programs of science education at education faculties. The study holds a descriptive model and qualitative methods were used. The study group consists of 12 faculty from Science, Mathematics, Computer and Instructional Technologies at Faculty of Education, and from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering at Gazi University; 15 science teachers who work at the schools which have different socio-economic levels in Ankara, and 42 sophomore students who study at the Department of Science Education at Gazi University Faculty of Education. Content analysis was used as the data analysis method. Findings of the study reveal that there are no studies conducted to integrate different fields into teacher education programs, there are no courses related to STEM education integrated into the curriculum, and the knowledge and skills pre-service teachers should gain to implement this approach in their professional teaching career do not exist in the curriculum. In addition, it was found that most of the teachers believe teacher collaboration; they associate their courses mostly with mathematics and information technologies. Likewise, it was identified that the main reason behind why the teachers cannot teach through interdisciplinary approach is due to teacher related reasons. Concerning the pre-service education, The Ministry of National Education and education faculties should work collaboratively, determine the teacher competencies and try to develop undergraduate curriculum for pre-service teachers to gain these competencies. Training teachers during pre-service period rather than in-service training will play a crucial role to gain the expected results from the approach.

AB  - Teaching in higher education poses unique sets of challenges, especially for academics in the engineering, built sciences and information science education disciplines. This article focuses on how reflective collaboration can support academics in their quest to find unique solutions to challenges in different academic contexts. A reflective collaboration framework was applied during a three-year interpretive research process at an Engineering, Information Technology and Built Environment Faculty in a residential research intensive university in South Africa. Interdisciplinary reflective collaboration was found to bring richness and depth into investigations of complex teaching challenges. This framework provides a structure to support the transformation of teaching challenges into learning opportunities through the promotion of dialogue, critique and reflection between engineering and education academics.

AB  - Aviation is a multidisciplinary subject that has influenced human development over the last century. Learning about aviation exposes students to principles of flight, earth science, aeronautical engineering, language, aviation communication and airmanship. In higher education, many non-aviation undergraduates participate in aviation related activities to have a first glimpse of the aviation industry and equip themselves with basic concepts. This study aims to examine learning perception among 82 university students who have participated in a series of online aviation career exploration activities during the pandemic in Hong Kong and China. They participated in virtual visits and career talks led by aviation professionals, hands-on flight simulation activities and online discussion in an online lab setting. A mixed research method was employed with the use of a motivational survey, teachers' observation and semi-structured interviews to understand students' learning perceptions. This study found that flying laboratory activities could effectively motivate students to learn aviation and improve their aviation knowledge. This could promote students' aviation industry optimism, which may help the industry to recover in the post-pandemic world. This article offers recommendations for online engineering educators to use emerging technologies to teach aviation for future career preparation.

AB  - This article is about an intervention introducing prehistoric life in primary education. Its objectives were to foster openness and interest for prehistory and archaeology, as well as content knowledge and conceptual learning with a focus on four main facets: basic knowledge about prehistoric life; conceptual learning/change regarding prehistory; learning about archaeologists and archaeology as a scientific discipline; and learning about interactions of archaeology and other disciplines (interdisciplinarity). Students participated in two workshops about the creation of a prehistoric object, highlighting the close interaction between the natural sciences and humanities within archaeology. The workshop emphasised dialogue between students, teachers and researchers, as well as active participation by the students. The educational effects of the workshops were studied using a pre-post design (N = 439, ages 8-10 years). Results show that the workshops had sizeable positive effects on both affective and cognitive variables. The appreciation of the workshops ranged from ˜ 70 to 90% (of maximum value) for interest, perceived educational value and further aspects. We also found a positive impact of the intervention on cognitive variables, e.g. for several elements of key knowledge about prehistory (such as where prehistoric people lived and with what resources; medium to large effect sizes: d > 0.9 and d = 0.46, respectively). Regarding conceptual learning, we found improved understanding of the link between climate change and long-term changes in wildlife in a given area (medium to large effect sizes, d = 0.5-0.8). A positive impact was also found for the understanding of archaeology encompassing both humanities and the natural sciences (e.g. understanding of climate change as inferred from archaeological knowledge, d = 0.3-0.5). No differences of the various outcomes were found between girls and boys; the workshops appear suitable for both genders. We conclude with a discussion of the interpretation of our findings, of some limitations and possible improvements, and of future perspectives, in particular for further classroom implementation.

AB  - This paper delves deeply into the creative pedagogies which support cutting edge digital STEAM practice across primary and secondary school settings. It contextualises the research within current STEAM agendas including transdisciplinarity, and STEAM and technology and goes on to offer insight from the novel context of ocean learning to develop and extend a theorisation of creative pedagogies as entwining both creative teaching and teaching for creativity as embodied, democratic, dialogic and material processes. Intra-action between theory, praxis, nature, culture, the digital and humans enables an emergent perspective about changing the dynamics of power to develop ocean or environmental learning and related activism. Derived from research into an ocean education project, which aimed to develop students' ocean literacy through the combined educative principles of creative pedagogies and digital technologies (Augmented and Virtual Realities), the research draws on data from six projects across primary and secondary school settings in Denmark, Spain and England. It used a "diffractive" analytic technique, inspired by new materialist theory, to explore the messy mixtures of natural, cultural and technological environments that were being learned through. This involved the development of four material-dialogic assemblages each including diffractive switches. Each is presented first through a "piece" which demonstrates each assemblage's connection to the core question, followed by "ripples," which briefly articulate the new learning and questions arising from that assemblage. The four assemblages cover the irresistibility of making kin, the relationships between lively bodies and virtual environments, the importance of spacetimematter in environmental edu-activism and trajectories between transience, stability and dialogic space. The paper leaves the reader/engager with a selection of prompts to highlight the research's contribution to current STEAM agendas related to changing power dynamics, and to provoke reader/engagers' own practices. These can include new pedagogies and activisms, as well as theoretical developments to the combined educative principles of creative pedagogies and digital technologies within STEAM education.

AB  - The local environment can be explored to sustain effective sustainability learning. With this aim, new learning methodologies can be fostered, namely mobile and game-based learning, as is the case of the EduPARK app. This app supports innovative learning strategies through treasure hunt games, integrating multimedia and augmented reality resources, in natural spaces. This paper presents a pilot case study of a pedagogical approach based on the exploration of a game in the EduPARK app, in the outdoors. The game was developed to be explored in the largest annual event of the University of Aveiro (UA)--XPERiMENTA 2022--where students of several ages and the wider community are invited to participate in diverse activities on the campuses. The main goal of the activity "XPERiMENTA with EduPARK in the UA Campus" was to raise basic education students' awareness towards nature conservation. Eighteen students (14 and 15 years-old) explored an interdisciplinary educational game that encouraged them to follow a path through the UA Campuses to promote learning related to recycling, renewable energies, food waste, and ocean plastic pollution. Simultaneously, curricular contents of Science, Mathematics, Education for Citizenship, and cultural aspects of the city of Aveiro were articulated. At the end of the activity, an individual and anonymous questionnaire to evaluate the activity was applied. Students revealed a positive attitude towards the EduPARK app, as their answers revealed they felt motivated to learn during the game. Additionally, students reached a good performance in the game, although difficulties in one specific question were identified. This paper presents preliminary results that will inform the development of a new related project, the EduCITY, that aims to promote education for sustainability through a smart learning city environment.

AB  - An authentic, interdisciplinary, research and problem-based integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) project may be ideal for encouraging scientific inquiry and developing teamwork among undergraduate students, but it also presents challenges. The authors describe how two interdisciplinary teams (n=6) of undergraduate college students built integrated STEM projects in a research based internship setting, and then collaboratively brought the project to fruition to include designing lessons and activities shared with K-12 students in a classroom setting. Each three person undergraduate team consisted of two STEM majors and one Education major. The Education majors are a special focus for this study. Interviews, field observations, and lesson plan artifacts collected from the undergraduate college students were analyzed according to authenticity factors, the authentic scientific inquiry instrument, and an integrated STEM instrument. The authors highlight areas of strength and weakness for both teams and explore how preservice teachers contributed to integrated STEM products and lessons. Teacher educators might apply recommendations for teacher preparation and professional development when facilitating authentic scientific inquiry and integrated STEM topics with both STEM and non-STEM educators. Undergraduate college students were challenged to fully integrate the STEM disciplines, transitions between them, and the spaces between them where multiple disciplines existed. By describing the challenges of integrating the spaces between STEM, the authors offer a description of the undergraduate college students' experiences in an effort to expand the common message beyond a flat approach of try this activity because it works, to a more robust message of try this type of engagement and purposefully organize for maximum results.

AB  - An integrative introduction to the sciences and an introduction to scientific writing can provide a strong foundation for broadly trained STEM majors to explore the interconnectedness of STEM disciplines and prepare them for scientific research. These goals have been accomplished through a sequence of two first-year courses, STEM 101: Integrative STEM Freshman Seminar and STEM 105: Inquiry Seminar. In STEM 101, students define the STEM disciplines, see the interconnectedness of the disciplines, learn scientific ethics, and develop team-building skills as they complete a group project that explores the nature and process of science. In STEM 105, students learn about and then engage in a variety of forms of scientific communication as they develop and present an independent research proposal.

AB  - The "BIO2010" report recommended that students in the life sciences receive a more rigorous education in mathematics and physical sciences. The University of Delaware approached this problem by (1) developing a bio-calculus section of a standard calculus course, (2) embedding quantitative activities into existing biology courses, and (3) creating a new interdisciplinary major, quantitative biology, designed for students interested in solving complex biological problems using advanced mathematical approaches. To develop the bio-calculus sections, the Department of Mathematical Sciences revised its three-semester calculus sequence to include differential equations in the first semester and, rather than using examples traditionally drawn from application domains that are most relevant to engineers, drew models and examples heavily from the life sciences. The curriculum of the B.S. degree in Quantitative Biology was designed to provide students with a solid foundation in biology, chemistry, and mathematics, with an emphasis on preparation for research careers in life sciences. Students in the program take core courses from biology, chemistry, and physics, though mathematics, as the cornerstone of all quantitative sciences, is given particular prominence. Seminars and a capstone course stress how the interplay of mathematics and biology can be used to explain complex biological systems. To initiate these academic changes required the identification of barriers and the implementation of solutions. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - In this paper we combine a philosophical theoretical analysis with human movement science empirical studies, in order to provide a better understanding of the possible links between free play and creativity. We deal in particular with some dialectical dynamics inherent to free play: the relation between rules and freedom, spontaneity which often leads to imitation, the presence of a purpose as a necessary element to makes novelty creative, innovation as an essential part of adaptive processes. We remark the topic into a developmental perspective including the role of play tutoring. We advocate an interdisciplinary criticism for approaching the paradigm of free play and creativity. Our aim is to show that free play in itself does not always and necessarily imply creativity, but can easily foster it in the presence of certain specific conditions.

AB  - The emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines in schools has caused advocates for art education to propose the addition of the arts to the study of STEM, transforming STEM into STEAM. One method of implementing STEAM is Design Thinking (Henriksen, 2017). STEAM education and Design Thinking are both models for interdisciplinary collaboration and problem solving to foster economic innovation, develop 21st-century skills and entrepreneurial literacy, and prepare students to work within a capitalist designer economy (jagodzinski, 2012; Kalin, 2019). But what is often missing in arguments for arts integration, STEAM education, or Design Thinking is the power of art to encourage rebellion, critical self-awareness, refusals, reconstructions, and provocations (Greene, 1978, 1995; Kalin, 2019). The emphasis on developing creativity to contribute to a capitalistic, designer economy may neglect other important purposes of art and education. It is important to imagine relationships between art, science, and technology that draw on the deeper purposes of art and education.

AB  - Despite the increasing availability of gerontological training programs, knowledge of their contents, characteristics, methods, and outcomes remains limited. However, the transition from multidisciplinarity to interdisciplinary orientations is now fundamental to such training, providing participants from diverse academic orientations and professional backgrounds with opportunities to interact across boundaries. In response to recommendations of the European Union Futurage "A road map for European ageing research" (FUTURAGE, 2011) concerning training and career-development needs of future cohorts of practitioners and scholars in aging, an International Summer School on Ageing (ISSA) was developed in 2012. Its aim was to initiate the practical implementation of some of the capacity building goals identified by Futurage. The design and structure of the ISSA was informed by the experience of Canada's Summer Programme in Ageing--run by the Institute of Aging of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research--and by the cross-border academic training activities organized by Lund University (Sweden) in Scandinavian countries. As Italy has lacked a tradition of comprehensive, interdisciplinary training programs in gerontology, the Italian National Institute of Health and Science on Ageing undertook to launch the inaugural ISSA. In this article, the core aims and methodology of the ISSA are presented, together with an analysis of its main outcomes, as measured by participant evaluations. These are discussed in the context of international debate on this topic.

Despite the need for increased IPE/IPC, most faculty remain siloed by discipline, offering an opportunity for teaching centers to serve as IPE/IPC hubs. This article explores faculty perceptions of how faculty learning communities (FLCs) promote IPE/IPC. Using a qualitative design, researchers administered a survey to FLC participants using purposeful sampling. Thematic analysis of responses revealed that participants do not perceive FLCs as opportunities for IPE/IPC. Findings, however, hold implications for how FLC facilitators can foster IPE/IPC among participants.

AB  - STEM education should be grounded in our knowledge of how students think in STEM-focused learning environments. However, little is currently known regarding specific types of thinking in these contexts. We explore the theoretical notion of STEM Ways of Thinking (SWoT) in interdisciplinary learning situations. Our primary focus is not on the curricular content of STEM education, but rather on the nature of the cognitive activity at play during STEM-focused activity. We give particular focus to students' claim making and reasoning during interdisciplinary STEM activity. Our framework focuses on the disciplines of science, engineering, and mathematics. While these disciplines have vastly different practices and epistemologies, we argue that claim making and reasoning provide an avenue for considering student thinking at their intersections. A brief literature review of SWoT is provided that illustrates trends and limitations amongst current theories and studies. After a detailed discussion of our own theoretical perspective of SWoT, we provide an illustrative learning segment to explore the explanatory and analytic power of our theoretical perspective. Implications of our work on curriculum and instruction are provided.

AB  - The human resource skills gap in cybersecurity has created an opportunity for educational institutions interested in cybersecurity education. The current number of schools designated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and National Security Agency (NSA) as Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) to train cybersecurity experts are not sufficient to meet the shortfall in the industry. The DHS has clearly mapped out knowledge areas for cybersecurity education for both technical and non-technical disciplines; it is therefore possible for institutions not yet designated CAEs to generate cybersecurity experts, with the long-term goal of attaining the CAE designation. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the need for a top-driven, multidisciplinary approach to cybersecurity education especially at schools that have not yet been designated as Centers for Academic Excellence. The paper also suggests a multi-faceted approach and the important considerations needed to achieve a successful cybersecurity educational program.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to reconstruct and critically assess the evidential relationship between neuroscience and educational practice. To do this, I reconstruct a standard way in which evidence from neuroscience is used to support recommendations about educational practice, that is, testing pedagogical interventions using neuroimaging methods, and discuss and critically assess the inference behind this approach. I argue that this inference rests on problematic assumptions, and, therefore, that neuroimaging intervention studies have no special evidential status for basing educational practice. I conclude arguing that these limitations could be resolved by integrating evidence from neurocognitive and educational science.

AB  - This quasi-experimental study aimed to examine content-area literacy instruction in comparison to a science-infused literacy instruction (SILI) to determine how these two approaches influenced 2nd grade students' ability to read and write science informational text and the students' attitude and motivation towards reading. After professional development, five teachers taught their classes twelve thematic lessons designed using either the content-area literacy (N = 37) or the SILI (N = 40) instruction to 2nd grade students. Teachers in both groups implemented thematic lessons that taught the life cycle of plants and included interactive read-alouds, graphic organizers, watching time lapse videos of plant growth, and reading digital texts independently and in small groups to support students in building the content knowledge and vocabulary necessary to write science informational texts. Students in the SILI group also participated in hands-on science activities including planting seeds and documenting plant growth, exploring the parts of a live basil plant, and taking walks outdoors to observe plants at various stages of the plant life cycle. Lessons took place over four weeks to assist students in acquiring science content knowledge so as to transfer this knowledge into science informational texts and to determine the influence of both instructional approaches on reading comprehension and reading attitude and motivation. Findings resulted in the content-area literacy instruction producing higher and statistically significant reading comprehension and writing rubric scores than the SILI group with medium effect sizes reported. The SILI group produced higher reading attitude and motivation scores, but these results were not statistically significant. Implications for both early childhood science and literacy classroom instruction as well as multiple implications for future research are discussed.

AB  - The need to focus on a transdisciplinary approach in education for sustainable development (EDS) has been reflected in research and especially action research as a possible solution, which can open a new perspective for understanding and interpretation of the complex phenomenon of sustainability as well as for developing new open continuing education programmes by integrating research and learning activities in the context of open transdisciplinary research. The content structure of the article: (1) it describes the experience that has evolved at one faculty and its subordinate scientific institute and has been proposed to be used within the entire institution; (2) it generalises issues arising from the extensive experience, which in action research manifest themselves as issues relating to the appropriate perspective choice in terms of sustainability, approaches that in education make it possible to understand the sustainability phenomenon, as well as features that help identify sustainability at different levels. Well-known cases in the history of science, philosophy of science, and systems development research have been used to highlight the relationship among the dynamic interaction of complex problems that can systematically appear as sustainable or unsustainable. Therefore, the article provides insight into a specific relationship among science development, integration and Anthropocene phenomena with sustainability/non-sustainability phenomena and their interaction; (3) it offers the experience necessary for the creation of participatory action research ideas and research base to expand the cooperation of university and its graduates using a stakeholder approach and connecting it with a transdisciplinary research framework, which envisages an activity around the sustainability phenomenon and its deep relationship to the openness for the evolution of sustainability consciousness as concerns individuals and societies; (4) it describes the first three activities of the first phase of the undertaken action research, which allowed determining the participants' motivation to take part in the action research, identifying participants' attitude and understanding sustainability and Anthropocene phenomena, as well as establishing a strategic vision of open transdisciplinary framework benefits and opportunities through participatory action research to develop open evolutionary study programs for continuing education, which would extend and deepen the cooperation of university and its graduates for social innovation creation and achieving quality education for sustainable development by reorienting the society and education towards sustainability and sustainable development. The present article aims at establishing an open transdisciplinary research framework, which is necessary for undertaking action research, and outlining a strategic vision for developing continuing education programs in the participatory action research that will help reorient continuing education to sustainable development.

AB  - Although education research in critical thinking is a rapidly emerging field, how teachers can facilitate, monitor, and support critical thinking in primary science remains a challenge. This paper builds on recent semiotics mediated scientific reasoning research to present a fresh perspective of critical thinking in primary science. Analysis of student and teacher interactions in an innovated semiotics grounded learning design and pedagogy demonstrates a recursive process of collaborative construction, reviewing and refinement of representational systems and models. The multimodal epistemic practices of the discipline, involving the generation, evaluation and refinement of the semiotic systems that frame scientific ideas and practices are presented to both stimulate and support generative critical thinking. How semiotic systems in primary science can provide a focus, stimulus, and tool, for not only students' generative critical thinking but also teacher monitoring and support is presented.

AB  - Writing has an important role in science education and practice. Emphasizing the interdisciplinary collaboration between English rhetoric studies and biology, seemingly disparate disciplines, we describe a model for a scientific writing and communication course. The goals of the course were to prepare students for science-oriented careers, as well as for professional and graduate schools, by teaching the various conventions of science communication and writing. Toward these aims we assigned a research proposal, the major assignment of the course, patterned after the National Science Foundation's Graduate Student Research Fellowship application. For this assignment we encouraged students to research topics in their preferred fields. They continued engaging their chosen topics of interest through other innovative assignments, which spanned multiple communication genres: a rhetorical analysis, a popular science article, a science poster analysis, and other related projects. We incorporated a peer-review element into each assignment to emphasize revision and collaborative learning. The students acknowledged our collaboration and the course as beneficial to their academic and future professional careers.

AB  - St. Olaf College recently restructured its Summer Bridge Program (SBP) course for incoming low-income (LI) and first-generation (FG) college students from a non-major biology course, "Issues in Biology," to an interdisciplinary "Explorations in Science" course. Two significant changes were made with the intention of giving students more agency as scholars: a) lab-based research projects vs. library projects and b) explicitly taught quantitative skills. Both courses used a coherent theme, outside readings and provided opportunities to practice study and exam taking skills. Here we describe the "Explorations" course in detail and compare the outcomes of its first two offerings to those of the original "Issues" class. Both SBP cohorts were compared to students who were neither LI nor FG. We learned that global outcomes such as average retention rate and major selection were not affected by the new format. However, students in "Explorations" mastered more quantitative skills, succeeded in their independent lab research and met higher cognitive skills on exams while tending toward higher grades. Students in the updated SBP course met our learning goals preparing them to apply critical thinking, writing and analytical reasoning skills as learning tools in subsequent classes.

AB  - Purpose: This study reports the process and results of a professional development program (PDP) carried out with science, mathematics and technology (SMT) teachers throughout Thailand. Method: One hundred and three teachers participated and completed the professional development program which is comprised five of phases: (1) commit to a vision and standard, (2) develop theoretical-based lesson plans, (3) participate in a four-day workshop, (4) implement and follow-up, and (5) conduct of teacher conference and lesson learned from evidence-based teaching. Findings: The results showed that most SMT teachers were able to design teaching plans consistent with the goals of improving critical thinking and problem-solving skills and designed activities in the form of integrated multidisciplinary learning activities. All SMT teachers adopted real-life situations as learning activities, engaging students and allowing them to learn through a contextual basis. However, some teachers remained unclear on how to transform general rubrics to the task-specific rubrics needed for an accurate assessment. Significance: The research finding showed that the PDP could improve the understanding of Thai SMT teachers' concepts in regard to both thinking and problem-solving skills. Training teachers generated useful insights from the PDP allowing them to help better design instruction programs in the future to further help bridge the gap between expected performance and current teaching practices.

AB  - Optometry is becoming more and more interdisciplinary and gives new opportunities for collaborative research due to the accumulative complexity of knowledge and the rapid transformation of the technological capabilities in domains such as information technology, optics, applied engineering, health sciences, and entrepreneurship and management. Therefore, the paper presents a study case of a master organized at the University Politehnica of Bucharest related to the current challenges of optometrist education in Romania. The master program is carried out within the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics of the University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, being organized by the Department of Mechatronics and Precision Mechanics and it falls within the Field of Mechanical Engineering specialization, according to Government decision no. 1609/30.09.2004, published in the Official Gazette of 18.10.2004. Conceived as a continuation of the bachelor's studies, the Advanced Optometry master program ensures the deepening in the field of the Optometry license program. It is an attractive option for the graduates of the Optometry program, accredited for the first time in 2007 and reaccredited in 2011. It ensures the development of scientific research capacities and is a mandatory preparatory basis for doctoral studies. [For the full proceedings, see ED652228.]

AB  - Undergraduate biology programs in smaller liberal arts colleges are increasingly becoming focused on health science fields. This narrowing of focus potentially decreases opportunities for these students to explore other sub-fields of biology. This perspectives article highlights how one small university in Connecticut decided to institute a required integrated biological systems course into their biology degree. The course focuses on empowering biology students to view science topics through multiple scales.

AB  - Langara College, as one of the leading undergraduate institutions in the province of British Columbia (BC), offers the "Applied Science for Engineering" two-year diploma program as well as the "Engineering Transfer" two-semester certificate program. Three project-based courses are offered as part of the two-year diploma program in Applied Science (APSC) and Computer Science (CPSC) departments: "APSC 1010--Engineering and Technology in Society", "CPSC 1090--Engineering Graphics", and "CPSC 1490--Applications of Microcontrollers", with CPSC 1090 and CPSC 1490 also part of the Engineering Transfer curriculum. Although the goals, scopes, objectives, and evaluation criteria of these courses are different, the main component of all three courses is a group-based technical project. Engineering students have access to Langara College's Makerspace for the hands-on component of their project. Makerspaces expand experiential learning opportunities and allows students to gain a skillset outside the traditional classroom. This paper begins with a detailed review of the maker movement and the impact of makerspace in higher education. Different forms of makerspace and the benefits of incorporating them on first-year students' creativity, sense of community, self-confidence, and entrepreneurial skills are discussed. This paper introduces Langara's engineering program and its project-based design courses. Langara's interdisciplinary makerspace, its goals and objectives, equipment, and some sample projects are introduced in this paper in detail. We then explain how the group-project component of APSC 1010, CPSC 1090, and CPSC 1490 are managed and how using makerspace improves students' performance in such projects. In conclusion, the paper describes the evaluation of learning outcomes via an anonymous student survey.

AB  - Background: Current reforms in K-12 STEM education call for integration between science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Such integration of STEM disciplines at the K-12 level offers students an opportunity to experience learning in real-world, multidisciplinary contexts; however, there is little reported research about teachers' experiences in engaging in integrated STEM instruction. The purpose of this phenomenological multiple case study is to understand nine science teachers' first-time experiences in implementing integrated STEM curricular units in their middle school physical science classrooms. This study draws upon both classroom implementation data and teacher reflective interviews to illustrate different degrees of integrated STEM instruction and to understand teachers' challenges and successes with these varying approaches. Results: Our results indicate three distinct cases of integration within our sample that represent low, medium, and high degrees of STEM integration throughout curriculum implementations. Interviews with teachers from each case revealed three themes that varied across teachers' experiences: the nature of integration, choosing between science and engineering, and student engagement and motivation. Teachers in all three cases were challenged to make explicit connections between science, engineering, and mathematics while simultaneously maintaining a motivating and engaging context for their students throughout their instruction. Further, it appears that the degree of STEM integration that occurs in instruction may be related to teachers' ability to make explicit connections between the disciplines. Conclusions: The work presented here informs educational researchers, policy makers, and K-12 STEM educators that there are several challenges when it comes to implementing new STEM initiatives in K-12 education. Although this work is limited to middle school physical science teachers' experiences with first-time STEM instruction, many of the identified themes are not content-specific; therefore, this work may shed light on general struggles that are common to educators who are integrating across content disciplines for the first time.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions around the world were forced to close and the academic process continued online. Online teaching can support students' learning, but little research exists in the foundational early primary years (children aged 4-8). The purpose of this study was to investigate teachers' practices and experiences in implementing online teaching during the pandemic period. The participants were 14 Greek teachers of early primary years, and data were collected via interviews. The findings indicated that most of the teachers used a combination of teaching practices-approaches, while the learning activities implemented mainly regarded language, psychomotor activities, display of videos, mathematics and interdisciplinary activities. Teachers' feelings were initially negative, while afterwards they experienced more positive feelings. Disadvantages of online education, as experienced by teachers, mainly regarded technical problems, followed by limited resources/support for children at home, and limited training in online methodology. Teachers' positive experiences regarded children's familiarization with the technology and maintenance of contact with the school environment, while the role of the parents was revealed as essential. Implications and suggestions for future online education in early primary years include maintenance of good high-standard teaching practices, enhancement of digital culture and parents' involvement with children's activities at home.

AB  - In the past few decades, we have seen a rapid proliferation in the use of quasi-experimental research designs in education research. This trend, stemming in part from the "credibility revolution" in the social sciences, particularly economics, is notable along with the increasing use of randomized controlled trials in the strive toward rigorous causal inference. The overarching purpose of this chapter is to explore and document the growth, applicability, promise, and limitations of quasi-experimental research designs in education research. We first provide an overview of widely used quasi-experimental research methods in this growing literature, with particular emphasis on articles from the top ranked education research journals, including those published by the American Educational Research Association. Next, we demonstrate the applicability and promise of these methods in enhancing our understanding of the causal effects of education policies and interventions using key examples and case studies culled from the extant literature across the pre-K-16 education spectrum. Finally, we explore the limitations of these methods and conclude with thoughts on how education researchers can adapt these innovative, interdisciplinary techniques to further our understanding of some of the most enduring questions in educational policy and practice.

AB  - A Wiki research project was created in the Functional Foods for Health (FST/HNFE 2544) as an instructional tool and assignment for improving undergraduate students' proficiency in evaluating appropriate information sources for rapidly evolving science and research. The project design targeted improving students' information literacy skills including how students obtain, discern relevant and reliable scientific information from propaganda, critique information, and communicate scientific language. In addition to the Wiki research project, guest experts in political science, statistics, and human nutrition discussed their expertise as related to functional foods to the class. A reviewer rubric was developed to evaluate and compare Wiki project assignments from the Fall 2013 course (experimental; cross-disciplinary topics) with the previous course offering (control, Fall 2012; no cross-disciplinary lectures) to establish a directionality of academic performance change between the 2 course years. Eight rubric criteria were categorized as critical thinking, cross-discipline, and communication (scoring: 1 [lowest] and 3 [highest]). We observed that the critical thinking criteria (n = 5) had improved scores (P < 0.05) from Fall 2012 to Fall 2013. Cross-discipline criteria (n = 2) had one categorical improvement (P < 0.05) but one category did not have improved scores (P > 0.05) in the experimental year (Fall 2013) despite the multidiscipline guest lectures. This educational intervention provides value to instructors for incorporating critical thinking, information literacy, and communication assignments that encourage skill development and practice to improve student proficiency. Students felt their skills and knowledge increased based on this project. This manuscript provides assignment guidelines and teaching techniques used to assist in development and improvement of students' critical thinking skills, communication, and information literacy.

AB  - The application of chemistry concepts in biological settings plays an important role in the interdisciplinary field of drug discovery and development. This is true for molecular docking, where an understanding of intermolecular forces and noncovalent interactions is useful for rational drug design and development. Here we report the design and use of a molecular docking activity for cancer drug discovery for users that requires minimal coding knowledge. Although used in a drug discovery context, this activity can be incorporated into a range of undergraduate/graduate chemistry and biochemistry courses either as a stand-alone activity or integrated into existing curricula. The activity uses AutoDock Vina, AutoDockTools, Strawberry Perl, and PyMOL, all of which are free, open-source software. The activity is used to carry out molecular docking of multiple ligands at once and predict the binding energy of hits identified from a high-throughput drug repurposing screen against a target enzyme overexpressed in human tumors. Students analyze their docking results to determine drugs that should go on to further "in vitro" testing based on the predicted noncovalent ligand--protein interactions. This activity serves as an introduction to molecular docking and as a review of intermolecular forces, highlighting their importance in biological fields.

AB  - The need for addressing global and societal problems is stronger than ever, as demonstrated by the UN Sustainable Development Goals and National Academy of Engineering Grand Challenges. However, engineering undergraduate students rarely get to experience engaging with the associated real-world projects and challenges. This has the potential to result in attenuation from engineering education and career pathways. This study aimed to overcome this issue by reaching the United States' untapped future engineering workforce via an engineering educator professional development "train-the-trainer" program. This train-the-trainer program guided engineering educators to apply evidence-based pedagogical methods (e.g., backward course design) to couple entrepreneurial mindset (EM) development with STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, math) and bio-inspired design in an effort to improve the retention of underrepresented engineering students via a transdisciplinary, humanistic approach. This study employed a mixed methods approach including retrospective post-then-pre items based on perceived learning gains, rating the overall satisfaction with the program, and open-ended questions to better understand what went well, what did not go so well, and what can be improved. From a practical perspective, this study shows that integrating STEAM (with a specific focus on the arts) into the engineering classroom promotes problem-solving and critical thinking across disciplines. Here, applying STEAM principles encourages diverse perspective taking and making by bridging paradigms and theoretical frameworks across a variety of humanities and technical disciplines. As a result, combining STEAM with bio-inspired design and the EM has the capacity to increase engagement and broaden participation among students traditionally underrepresented in engineering, including females and minoritized populations.

AB  - This study aimed to examine project productions of gifted youths with real-life problems in the STEM domain in the Upper-Lower Groups according to their program evaluations. A mixed research design was used. Education program evaluations of 105 gifted youths, who were attending the Project Production and Management Program at Science and Art Centers in the Republic of Türkiye, were analyzed. It was found that even though they had positive views on the effectiveness of program, there was a significant difference between the lower-27% and upper-27% groups. In the second part, project productions of gifted youths in the Lower-Upper Groups were examined. Even though they were able to produce projects with real-life problems in the STEM domain, differences in favor of the Upper Group were concluded in terms of interdisciplinary connections, complexity of real-life problems, originality of ideas, creative productivity, validation of the solutions, transformation into products, and universality of dissemination.

AB  - To address the need for STEM reform in K-12 schools, this article describes the design and implementation of a rigorous, interdisciplinary science and research program (ISR) in two local high schools (HS-S and HS-H). The ISR, adapted from the successful School for Science and Math at Vanderbilt program, provides seven courses over four years that focus on the development of critical thinking skills and the ability to construct and perform hypothesis-driven research projects. The courses are co-taught by a science teacher (masters or doctoral level) and a Ph.D. scientist. Overall, students in both programs showed higher science end-of-course test scores and ACT composite scores compared to their non-ISR peers, completed research internships at Vanderbilt, and presented their research at local and regional meetings. Currently 62 of the 77 ISR graduates are attending college, with 62% of the declared majors in STEM areas. As the programs have matured, challenges such as low student preparation (ISR-S) and competition with other school academic offerings (ISR-H) have been addressed, resulting in increased numbers of students participating in the program. The school district has demonstrated the value of the ISR program by providing funding for the scientists and expanding to a third school in 2016.

AB  - To prepare students to integrate diverse perspectives, colleges nationwide offer a wide range of interdisciplinary learning experiences. Within this educational context, students often need more than exposure to multiple perspectives in order to integrate ideas across disciplines. They benefit from instruction that scaffolds their efforts to integrate ideas. Yet, even faculty may find it difficult to identify the points of integration between disciplines that are rarely put in discussion with one another. In this Quick Fix article, we suggest that annotating a common text can help faculty uncover core concepts that bridge their respective disciplines. We describe the ways in which this preparation strategy informed an undergraduate-level interdisciplinary experience with students in microbiology and history courses.

AB  - Shifts in generations from Millennials to Generation Z have brought changes to today's classroom. In turn, these changes indicate the need for reform and innovation in education. If the goal for education remains to put contributing members into society, then educators must search for the most effective ways to prepare students to enter society today, rather than in the past. The purpose of this article is to introduce creative ways to share the lives and work of outstanding ecologists to enhance students' knowledge in both English language arts and science, while also addressing state and national standards. Integrating the lives and work of well-known ecologists or environmentalists into middle school science has the potential to enhance the understanding our students have of what it means to be a scientist. Taking these small steps to broaden students' understanding of science and scientists may inspire a young person to consider a science career for themselves someday. The nation and the state have done their parts in giving teachers the outline for student learning and success in science. Now, it is up to teachers to utilize the standards within their classrooms to make science come to life.

AB  - The classroom is where the student and teacher interact, while traditional education uses a Face-to-Face classroom. The unprecedented COVID-19 forced education to shift into an online classroom. Still, numerous researches demonstrate that the pedagogical quality in online classrooms is thus compromised as the educators tend to convert existing face-to-face curriculum that less prioritize intellectual interaction into online ways. Blended learning is not a new yet effective teaching pedagogy, which seems suitable to overcome the challenges as mentioned above as it is a combination of traditional and online modes. Thus, this article summarizes the current trend of blended learning implementation in the Malaysian setting into valuable insight for the practitioner to redesign their pedagogy to meet new norms. This paper assessed and analyzed a total of 22 recent publications that extracted from the Web of Science Database based on three themes that are participant, instrument, and disciplinary. All researches address higher education context, mainly the students' perspectives and neglecting other stakeholders' perspectives. Blended learning is proven practical in multidisciplinary but independent curriculum, and pedagogy redevelopment is mandated. The quantitative methodology is preferable by the researcher in the identification of critical governing factors. Overall, the context of blended learning development in Malaysia remains progressively developing by time. In conclusion, the practice of blended learning implementation is getting diffused in Malaysia due to its flexibility and versatility. However, such effective pedagogy lay on collaborative efforts between various stakeholders, including educators, students, institutional management, policymakers, and parent.

AB  - Generational differences in the way knowledge-makers negotiate shifts in relation to interdisciplinary knowledge-making at one Canadian university are studied. Semi-structured interviews with 20 participants in science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines were conducted. Using a Foucauldian approach, transcripts were read to determine how academic identities and subject positions are formed and reformed through time as different discursive spaces are experienced. The historical perspective of older participants revealed the complex interplay between private and public "scripts". Participants demonstrated agency on behalf of themselves and their institution by engaging in practices they thought would provide space for research that "really mattered". Older participants who were administrators promoted instrumental forms of interdisciplinarity that did not challenge the central role of disciplines in the construction of expertise. Younger participants were more likely to resist being "disciplined"; they identified strongly with conceptual forms of interdisciplinarity and derived both satisfaction and creativity from working in the margins of knowledge spaces.

AB  - The notion of interdisciplinarity in higher education raises significant questions about the very nature of knowledge and knowing. Are there fundamental knowledge bases associated with particular disciplines that cannot be understood through interdisciplinary teaching and learning? Or is there a common knowledge base across the disciplines that can be accessed--linguistically and metaphorically--through interdisciplinary teaching and research? These questions are not inconsequential, particularly for faculty members who invest their time and energy in interdisciplinary work. In this article, the authors explore interdisciplinarity in relation to faculty work, especially in terms of pedagogy and scholarship. First, they review the literature on definitions of interdisciplinarity, its applications in higher education, and why this is important in light of traditional faculty reward structures that privilege disciplinary expertise. Second, they present the methods and findings of a case study of how science faculty at one institution developed and managed an interdisciplinary curriculum across their programs. Third, they discuss the implications of innovative curricular efforts that present a challenge to both the traditional departmental separation of the disciplines and conventional faculty reward structures.

AB  - The aim of this research is to investigate the aspects of science education, which are pedagogically desirable for the individual in the society of 21st century. The research was conducted by Curricular Delphi Study method in three rounds with international comparisons. In the first round, an open-ended survey was used, and in the next two rounds the instrument was structured to answer the refined research questions of the study, such as the priorities and practices towards the inquiry-based science education. The paper reports on the findings of a survey collected from 125 stakeholders of science education, including scientists, science educators, and education administrators from Turkey. In the results of the differentiated analyses according to the sample groups, all stakeholders emphasize the role of science education in the survival of a country. They all put a great emphasis on the curriculum. The stakeholders emphasized the significance of engagement with the interdisciplinary relations of the sciences, their findings and their perspectives with regard to their role in enhancing individual intellectual personality development. It is suggested that scientific inquiry includes the ability to consolidate the inquiry processes with scientific knowledge, scientific reasoning and critical thinking to advance scientific knowledge.

AB  - As massification of higher education developed, employment challenges in changing labour markets aroused the attention of scholars globally. An interdisciplinary approach called world-system theory is applied by scholars from the social sciences, history, anthropology and cultural studies. This study applied the theory in a bibliometric analysis of graduate employment research using R and CiteSpace. It identified the main characteristics (e.g. authors and countries) of relevant research, investigated the social and economic context of certain milestone publications and visualised research hot spots. World-system theory, as a macrosociological approach to describing the world economy and social system, is innovatively applied in illustrating the findings of the current work. Results indicate that core countries not only are economically influential but also dominating the academic research. Scholars in semi-peripheral and peripheral countries are encouraged to establish transnational networks and foster academic collaborations.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the value of teachers guiding students to generate their own representations to support conceptual learning in science and across complementary subjects such as mathematics. However, this approach to an interdisciplinary focus poses challenges for programme design and learning assessment. In this paper, we report on a 10-week study with a class of Year 5 students designed to (a) facilitate learning of key concepts in the topic of optics (e.g. reflection), and (b) make meaningful links between these concepts and relevant mathematical ones (e.g. symmetry and angles). Students were expected to construct, evaluate and refine representations to explain various experienced phenomena. We report on an assessment framework developed and applied to student work. Our findings indicate (a) some subject and interdisciplinary learning gains, and (b) specific challenges around designing this kind of programme, student learning assessment and teacher understanding to support this learning.

AB  - Laboratory experiments that offer interdisciplinary experiences for students are appealing and are increasingly popular additions to undergraduate chemistry curricula. Students can capitalize on their knowledge of multiple areas of chemistry while working through an application, and this fosters the development of progressive problem-solving skills. In this laboratory experiment, students combine the fields of inorganic chemistry with biological chemistry to synthesize and test the catalytic activity of a model of vanadium haloperoxidase, an enzyme naturally produced in certain brown- and red-seaweed species. Students use [superscript 1]H NMR spectroscopy to monitor the oxidation of thioanisole to methyl phenyl sulfoxide using their prepared vanadium complex as the catalyst.

AB  - As newcomers in the field of science education research we discuss our perspectives on critical scholarship in the academy. Using the metalogue approach we explore our perceptions of science education, our experiences of the barriers to critical science education research, our analyses of why these barriers exist, and imaginings about how these barriers could be removed. In this paper, metalogue provides us with a way to retain our individual voices, thoughts and ideas, yet challenge our pre-conceived notions about finding a critical space in science education. Through an interaction with each other's thoughts and past experiences we outline some aspects of the field of science education as we see it; for example, we discuss why the field may be seen as rigid as well as the contexts that surround possibilities for interdisciplinary, critical, social justice research. We conclude that a larger, multi-vocal discussion is necessary to locate the possibilities for critical, social justice oriented science education.

AB  - This systematic review explores the intersection of race, gender, and social class in the context of internationalization of higher education (IHE) research in Brazil. Historically, the development of the Brazilian educational system has responded to the elite's demands and reproduced Western-European values and knowledge. The exponential growth of IHE has led to increased scholarly interest in various interdisciplinary research areas, with a possible move in studies and practices from a neoliberal to a more critical, decolonial, and diverse perspective. This article aims to investigate to what extent Brazilian researchers have investigated the intersectionality of gender, race, and class in IHE. Using two scientific databases, the published between 2015 and 2022. The theoretical framework of intersectionality (Crenshaw, 2002; Collins & Bilge, 2021; Akotirene, 2019) is presented to help recognize the interaction of different social markers of inequalities in IHE. The results pointed to a small number of publications related to this theme and continuous interest in the Science without Borders (SwB) mobility program. A particularly privileged profile of participants in academic mobility programs across various higher education institutions (HEI) in Brazil demonstrated the need for planning and actions to understand the social, historical, and political aspects that perpetuate exclusions. Moreover, this review indicates the importance of addressing colonialism in social dynamics and recognizing the coloniality of power in language policies in IHE. It calls for further investigations that explore the intersections of social markers in IHE processes from a more politically engaged perspective.

AB  - Hands-on and practical learning has been key to cybersecurity education and training success. Cyber Defense Exercises (CDX) are a common approach to training, testing, and verifying technical and soft skills. However, full-scale CDX implementation is also an expensive training event. In order to advance such exercises to the next level, CDX organizers should further focus on educational, psychological, and cross-domain relationships. The paper discusses and proposes a multidimensional approach for CDX that balances cognitive, emotional, and social aspects critical for successful interdisciplinary learning. We share our experience incorporating knowledge from well-known psychology theories to CDX. We derive and describe seven elementary ingredients if a CDX is to meet the interdisciplinary and critical thinking needs of defensive cyberspace operations.

AB  - Although human patient simulation (HPS) began more than a decade ago, substantial evidence argues for increased use of simulation in teaching basic science courses, such as physiology and the full integration of simulation into medical school curricula so as to benefit both educators and learners. The introduction and application of simulation in medical education is considered to be one of the most important steps in curriculum development. One of the main concerns with widespread use of simulation during the nonclinical phase curricula is the prerequisite for highly trained simulationists and dedicated facilities capable of supporting the development and implementation of conceptualized scenarios emulating human physiology. At Howard University College of Medicine (HUCM), physiologists, clinicians, and simulationists recently implemented a case-based simulation for first-year medical students (MDY1) enrolled in a structure and function (S&F) basic science anatomy and physiology course. From the pedagogical point of view, simulation was employed as a means of linking didactic lecture objectives with specific clinical skills used for cardiorespiratory clinical evaluation. The focus was on interdisciplinary integration employing medical simulation as a complementary teaching tool for medical physiology and correlation of clinical skills germane to patient assessment. This article summarizes voluntary feedback for each of the five simulation evaluation categories obtained from MDY1 students, where researchers hypothesized that students would view the simulations as an effective teaching tool for the integration of didactic lecture objectives with clinical skills, and an acceptable pedagogical approach for MDY1 learners. This study lends support to existing evidence indicating that HPS, computer-assisted instruction, and advanced technologies have tremendous potential when meticulously linked to basic science learning objectives, thereby making simulation an attractive and effective teaching approach, especially for MDY1 learners.

AB  - Social and economic transformations which are taking place in the Ukrainian society, the development of market relations, fast scientific and technical progress require the introduction of the model of the continuous knowledge upgrading that is necessary for the successful professional and personal development. The problem of educational needs is an interdisciplinary field which is defined by the complex of social and humanitarian sciences. The determining place among these sciences belongs to philosophy of education, sociology and pedagogy. The author is of the opinion that the investigation of educational needs of Ukrainian citizens will allow characterizing the educational situation in the country, substantiating the mechanisms of regulating separate subsystems of modern adult education and identifying some problems which hinder the development of this educational branch. There have been considered the questions of meeting the educational needs of the population as well as the peculiarities of forming the educational needs. In addition, the author's understanding of the term "educational needs" and their characteristic features have been offered in the paper. The article represents the results of investigating educational needs in one of Ukraine's regions, the purpose of which was to identify the requirement level of educational needs, to assess the quality of the provided educational services, to distinguish the motives of their use and the perspectives of their dissemination in the region.

AB  - The article focuses on the re-constructions of power-securing structures behind social inequalities. This conceptual study aims to synthesize different transdisciplinary studies from critical age, gender, race, and disability studies to gain an intersectional view of the power effects of discriminatory social habits, practices, and structures. The results show an intersectional synthesis regarding the phenomenon of adultism. A typical definition of adultism is the abuse of power by adults towards children while adulthood/childhood are socially constructed. Adultism can be seen as the discriminatory axis of social positioning according to age or generation, consisting of subordinating social practices and attitudes that subsume into social norms and structures. The theoretical concept of adultism contains various methodological approaches and paradigms. Different fields according to social constructivism like ethnomethodology, poststructuralism, linguistics, and symbolic interactionism emerge into a new theoretical framework. Their offered terms like Doing Difference or Age, Subjectivation, and Generationing, are contrasted and brought together into a new theoretical framework and a Theory of Childilization. This theory shows a necessary shift of perspectives to the approach of critical adulthood and the question of how childhood is performed by adulthood regarding generationing practices, structures, and privileged adult acting. The new theory reveals recurring patterns, discriminatory structures, and dominating practices based on the example of adultistic narratives. These narratives combine the mentioned disciplines around the subject related to structures, interactions, and cultures. Here, using a relational perspective, unseen, unspoken, and unheard practices by adults are uncovered, and can be applied to a reframing of education and learning environments, or of negative power effects on the lower-status group of children. The theory of Childilization is enfolded in a triad of mature-normative framing, re-framings, and counter-framings to new perspectives on adultism. With empirical evidence, the article shows a re-framing of learning and identity-building on a community-based level and examples of counter-framings by young actors. In the context of a Hawaiian case study, age-different learning environments of progressive education at six schools in Oahu (n=6) can be shown. The case study illustrates examples of critical adulthood in contrast to common adultistic narratives like pathologizing, or educative ordering and the realization of some counter-framings of children. And finally, it emphasizes the necessity of conceptualizing adultism on the part of those affected--accompanied by the demand to equalize children's rights and to deconstruct adultistic concepts of "being a minor child" vs. "being a mature adult". The article is therefore challenging "good" norms and orders of adult societies, citizenship, education, and even research and sciences.

AB  - Students were asked to each create an infographic on the basis of one of their host department's research articles as a new exercise within the "science communication" training program of the University of Leicester's undergraduate chemistry degree. The use of local articles helped to connect students to the research of their lecturers, and the assignment helped to contextualize why certain lecturers had been chosen to teach their allocated subjects. Students also agreed that the activity helped them to recognize what research is associated with the traditional inorganic-, organic-, and physical-chemistry lecture themes. There was some benefit to this approach in helping students distill out key information.

AB  - Topology optimization (TO) has been a useful engineering tool over the last decades. The benefits of this optimization method are several, such as the material and cost savings, the design inspiration, and the robustness of the final products. In addition, there are educational benefits. TO is a combination of mathematics, design, statics, and the finite element method (FEM); thus, it can provide an integrative multi-disciplinary knowledge foundation to undergraduate students in engineering. This paper is focused on the educational contributions from TO and identifies effective teaching methods, tools, and exercises that can be used for teaching. The result of this research is the development of an educational framework about TO based on the CDIO (Conceive, Design, Implement, and Operate) Syllabus for CAD engineering studies at universities. TO could be easily adapted for CAD designers in every academic year as an individual course or a module of related engineering courses. Lecturers interested in the introduction of TO to their courses, as well as engineers and students interested in TO in general, could use the findings of this paper.

AB  - Background: In recent years, computer science education has emerged as a necessary part of school curricula for students of all ages. With such momentum in this direction, it is essential that program designers, educators, and researchers ensure that computer science education is designed to be inclusive, effective, and engaging for all students. Objective: Accordingly, this paper reports on the design and implementation of an inclusive digital learning platform and accompanying curriculum for scaffolding and integrating coding into writing instruction for elementary-aged students (approximately ages 9-12). In this paper, we report on teachers' uses of the Compose and Code (CoCo) platform and curriculum, how students used its features, and its influence on students' computational thinking skills and attitudes about coding. Method: Data analysed in this mixed-methods study come from 11 teachers and 595 students in Grades 3-6. Data sources included teacher reflections and interviews, an assessment of computational thinking for students, and a coding attitudes survey for students. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively and using paired sample t-tests. Qualitative data were analysed inductively using open coding to determine emergent categories. Results and Conclusion: Findings indicate that (1) a majority of students effectively used the CoCo platform to plan their work and code in Scratch, with a smaller percentage using the self-evaluation and self-monitoring features, (2) teachers indicated overall positive perceptions of the CoCo platform and curriculum, with strong support for using it in the future, (3) students' computational thinking skills improved over the course of the project, with results indicating a large effect size (g = 1.24), and (4) student attitudinal results were mixed, providing insights to the barriers that students face when learning to code. Overall, this study indicates that the CoCo platform and curriculum show promise as a scaffolded, structured, and integrated tool for teaching elementary computer science to elementary grade students.
