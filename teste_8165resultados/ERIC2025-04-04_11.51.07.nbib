AB  - Aboriginal people are alarmingly under-represented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-related careers. This under-representation is a direct result of the lack of academic success in science and mathematics, an issue that begins early in elementary and middle school and often escalates in secondary school with the majority consequently doing poorly, not completing these courses and often dropping out. This makes them ineligible to pursue STEM-related paths at the post-secondary level. The greatest challenges to success in these courses are the lack of relevancy for Aboriginal learners and, as importantly, how they are taught; impediments that are also paramount to the increasing lack of success for many nonAboriginal students in STEM-related courses. This paper explores how Aboriginal ways of knowing and learning and those of the 21st century learners of today very closely parallel each other and illustrates how the creative multidisciplinary approach of a liberal education might be the way to enable early academic engagement, success and retention of Aboriginal learners in the sciences and mathematics.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: This paper investigates the gaps between industry and academia perceptions of information technology fields, such as computer science, software engineering, and computer engineering, and it identifies areas of asymmetry between curricula and industry expectations. The study mainly focuses on the skills required of IT professionals (graduated students) and on how higher education institutes equip students for industry. Background: Higher education institutes have several IT-related departments. However, it is not clear whether these departments have sufficient content to equip students with industry-related skills. Rapid advances mean that some curriculum topics are redundant before the end of a standard two- or four-year degree programs. Balancing the technical/non-technical skills and adjusting the curricula to better prepare the students for industry is a constant demand for higher education institutions. Several studies have demonstrated that a generic curriculum is inadequate to address current IT industry needs. Methodology: The study involved a comprehensive survey of IT professionals and companies using a Web-based questionnaire sent directly to individual companies, academics, and employers. 64 universities and 38 companies in 24 countries were represented by the 209 participants, of whom 99 were IT professionals, 72 academics, and 38 employers. Contribution: This paper is intended to guide academics in preparing dynamic curricula that can be easily adapted to current industry trends and technological developments, with content directly relevant to student's careers. In addition, the results may identify the skills that students need to secure employment and the courses that will provide skills in line with current industry trends. Findings: The results indicate a lack of emphasis on personal and non-technical skills in undergraduate education compared to general computer science, software development, and coding courses. Employers' and software experts' responses emphasize that soft skills should not be ignored, and that, of these, analytical thinking and teamwork are the two most requested. Rather than a theoretical emphasis, courses should include hands-on projects. Rapid developments and innovations in information technologies demand that spiral and waterfall models are replaced with emerging software development models, such as Agile and Scrum development. Recommendations for Practitioners: A multidisciplinary approach should be taken to the teaching of soft skills, such as communication, ethics, leadership, and customer relations. Establishing multiple learning tracks in IT education would equip students with specialized knowledge and skills in IT. An effective communication channel should be established between students and industry. It is also important to reduce the distance between academics and students and to provide an interactive environment for technical discussions. Enterprise level computing and Framework use provide job market advantages. Recommendations for Researchers: Researchers and department heads, particularly those involved in curriculum design and accreditation, could use the results of this exemplary study to identify key topics for attention. Impact on Society: Changes of various degrees are required in the current curricula in many higher education institutions to better meet student needs. Societies and technology are dynamic in nature, and information technology-related curricula in higher education institutions should be equally dynamic. Future Research: Since technology (especially information technology) transforms and advances itself so rapidly, this study should be replicated t to investigate how these changes affect the gap between revised curricula and current industry expectations.

AB  - This paper reflects on how the issue of climate change and the general state of our planet is, among other causes, a main factor in the paralyzing divisions ailing Western societies. This situation, while unsettling to democracies, is promoting a kind of education "in" and "through" fear and I question if education can succeed under these circumstances without becoming indoctrination. This paper does not try to diminish the urgency and the importance of current environmental problems but rather expands today's perspectives and incorporates research in more constructive ways of thinking and doing. I use scientific contributions in climatology, evolution, environmental conservation, economics, and neuroscience to bring new light to today's investigations about the human and the non-human world. Finally, I propose Deep Ecology's principles of "deep questioning," "deep experience" and "deep commitment," as a guide for new educational and ecological practices.

AB  - The aim of this article is to address some of the questions Dr. Paula S. Nurius presents in her article, "Innovation and Emerging Scientific Careers: Is Social Work Prepared to Compete in Today?s Scientific Marketplace?" Specifically, this article will focus on what we can do to better prepare our emerging research scholars to be successful innovators through trans-disciplinary training and educational activities. This article recommends two main ideas. The first main idea is that social work co-host meetings, lectures, roundtables and trainings with disciplines we do not tend to collaborate with, in order to build inter-disciplinary partnerships. The second suggestion is that students are socially integrated, via extensive interaction of outside disciplines, through customized semester-long rotation style trainings. By implementing these suggestions, we will be providing a space for our doctoral students to gain an understanding of how different disciplines? researchers, technologies, and/or methods can add to their ability to produce innovative ideas, encouraging creative and complex thinking and problem solving.

AB  - Because students have often been conditioned as passive learners and receivers of knowledge, it can be difficult for them to persevere in solving authentic problems. Nevertheless, teachers must persist in preparing students as problem solvers and critical thinkers. In an urban inner-city neighborhood school in the southeast, students embarked on a unique adventure created to engage them as scientists and engineers on an interdisciplinary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) adventure. In this article, the authors share how connections between the STEM disciplines can be meaningfully constructed for elementary students. In the inquiry, third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade students modeled, designed, evaluated, and tested Lego WeDo 2.0 robots as solutions to crossing a river in the Amazon Rainforest. The Amazon Rainforest River Task showcases an interdisciplinary integration in which each of the STEM disciplines were incorporated meaningfully. Furthermore, this inquiry highlights an authentic learning opportunity for students to collaborate as learners and problem solvers. Students were critically engaged in their learning as evident in their designs and through the rich conversations centered on the inquiry.

AB  - To become scientifically literate, students need to interpret science concepts using numbers, text, and visuals (Lemke 2004). Scientists use multiple modes to communicate their ideas to each other and the public, including images, text, mathematical notations, symbols, diagrams, charts, and graphs. Several of the science and engineering practices in the "Next Generation Science Standards" (NGSS Lead States 2013) incorporate multiple modes of representing information: developing and using models; analyzing and interpreting data; using mathematical and computational thinking; and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating data. In addition, using multiple modes in science instruction allows teachers to integrate other subject skills within a science unit, such as English language arts standards for reading, writing, and speaking and mathematics standards for numbers and operations and measurement and data. When other subject skills are integrated, science becomes more relevant for students. Furthermore, having facility with multiple modes of representation in science instruction benefits student learning and increases their depth of understanding (Wilson and Bradbury 2016). Finally, science instruction presented in various modes can provide greater access to science information for all students.

AB  - "Educational administration and the social sciences", the landmark text coedited by Baron and Taylor in 1969, represented the study of educational administration as an applied interdisciplinary field. George Baron's own academic career reveals the struggles involved in the construction of this new field and the resistance and opposition that it encountered. It also highlights both the strengths and the incipient tensions of the field that "Educational administration and the social sciences" failed to take into account in its optimistic narrative of expansion and partnership.

AB  - The research study reported here was conducted to investigate the implementation of integrated STEM lessons within courses that have a single subject science focus. The purpose also included development of a pedagogical theory. This technology-based teaching was conceptualized by school administrators and teachers in order to provide middle school science students with a formal classroom instructional session in which science curricular were modified to include an integrated STEM activity. To this end, the authors examined and generated an account of the implementation processes including: the nature of the instruction, type of scaffolds, challenges teachers faced, the interaction among teachers, and students and teachers' perceptions of the integrated STEM instruction. Qualitative data were collected from interviews and classroom observations and then analyzed using grounded theory methods, specifically the constant comparative method. The results of study showed that teachers required support in the form of an expert technology teacher in order to accomplish a successful classroom implementation of integrated STEM with robotics. Additionally, it was found that teachers did not revise their existing science curriculum but rather selected integrated STEM activities that fit into the overall science course objectives and goals.

AB  - The scientific process is nonlinear, unpredictable, and ongoing. Assessing the nature of science is difficult with methods that rely on Likert-scale or multiple-choice questions. This study evaluated conceptions about the scientific process using student-created visual representations that we term "flowcharts." The methodology, Scientific Process Flowchart Assessment (SPFA), consisted of a prompt and rubric that was designed to assess students' understanding of the scientific process. Forty flowcharts representing a multidisciplinary group without intervention and 26 flowcharts representing pre- and postinstruction were evaluated over five dimensions: connections, experimental design, reasons for doing science, nature of science, and interconnectivity. Pre to post flowcharts showed a statistically significant improvement in the number of items and ratings for the dimensions. Comparison of the terms used and connections between terms on student flowcharts revealed an enhanced and more nuanced understanding of the scientific process, especially in the areas of application to society and communication within the scientific community. We propose that SPFA can be used in a variety of circumstances, including in the determination of what curricula or interventions would be useful in a course or program, in the assessment of curriculum, or in the evaluation of students performing research projects.

AB  - Postsecondary curriculum is designed to prepare students for their careers following graduation, which traditionally revolves around technical aspects of their respected career field. Capstone courses were introduced to help ease students' transition from the university into their careers. However, little research containing empirical evidence exists on the effectiveness of capstone courses in natural resources. This study evaluated 6 yr of course graduates from an interdisciplinary problem-solving capstone course in natural resources, seeking to understand the skills gained and what portions of the course were most useful in transitioning students to their future careers. Results show the course was able to enhance students' writing, communication, job preparation, and teamwork skills. Students valued knowledge gained on soft skills, such as communication and teamwork, over technical skills specific to their major. Overall, the students valued the interdisciplinary problem solving nature of the course, as most natural resource issues are interdisciplinary. Areas that could be improved in this capstone model were focused on improving individual student's verbal communication and presentation skills. Information from this study is useful to colleges and universities considering and using capstone courses to determine skills that can be taught and to determine if using real world problems in an interdisciplinary setting in their courses would be beneficial.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to explore the holistic picture of sustainability curricula in Asian higher education. Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis was conducted based on Asian management education for sustainability in higher education. Online courses arrangement, teaching methods, instructors' educational background and cross-referencing data between triple bottom line and sustainability courses have been investigated. Findings: The paper provides empirical insights about the current state of sustainability education in Asia. The results show that there is an opportunity for interdisciplinary integration, as there are imbalanced sustainability courses offered by business, science and engineering schools. It also suggests that Asian universities should add an international connection and active promotion of sustainability education on their Web sites. Research limitations/implications: Findings are based on web-based sustainability-related courses. Future research could apply method of case study to do a deeper study. Practical implications: The paper provides an overview of Asian management education for sustainability and curricula analysis through our research, and that this will further assist in the development of interdisciplinary integration in Asian management education for sustainability. Originality/value: This paper is the first attempt to gain better understanding of sustainability-related courses offered in leading business/management colleges in Asia.

AB  - In 2019, The Open University celebrated its 50th anniversary. For most of its fifty years it has been delivering statistics education to both specialists and non-specialists, simultaneously and at scale. A single module must deliver statistics teaching across multiple qualifications in many different disciplines which means it is not possible to tailor module material and examples for each individual qualification. This is contrary to the way many service teaching modules are designed. For example, the introductory statistics module at The Open University delivers basic statistics and probability to around 1500 students a year. By structuring the material around topics to which everyone can relate; money, education and health, the module is able to engage students across a range of different qualifications from mathematics to economics, business studies, computing and natural sciences. Feedback from students has been overwhelmingly positive. Students are provided with printed material, which is supplemented with a variety of interactive elements, which will be described in this paper. Online forums provide a place for peer support. Small group tutorials, both face to face and online, are provided by tutors. Each tutor will typically support 20 students and provide feedback to those students on their assessable work. The students in an individual tutor's group could be studying one of many different qualifications. All the module material, including all the interactive elements, are embedded in the university's virtual learning environment which has made it possible to monitor how students engage with the material. This knowledge, and qualitative feedback from students, has provided support for the idea that by teaching through a narrative approach, with examples based on scenarios which have a broad interest to everyone, it is possible to engage all students with statistics regardless of their qualification. By taking this same narrative approach a new module is being created which will be studied concurrently by students in the final stages of their qualifications in mathematics, statistics, data science and economics. This paper will outline how the module will utilize Jupyter notebooks to deliver practical modelling with real data sets chosen to be of interest to all the different cohorts of students. During the last 50 years The Open University has always had to deliver modules at scale to students across many disciplines. With the increased use of data across qualifications, and the need for people to upskill in data analysis, it is essential to explore ways in which statistical training can be delivered at scale.

AB  - Typical data science instruction uses generic datasets like survival rates on the Titanic, which may not be motivating for students. Will introducing real-life data science problems fill this motivational deficit? To analyze this question, we contrasted learning with generic datasets and artificial problems (Phase 1) with a community-sourced dataset and authentic problems (Phase 2) in the context of an 8-week virtual internship. Retrospective survey questions indicated interns experienced increased motivation in Phase 2. Additionally, analysis of intern discourse using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) indicated a significant difference in linguistic measures between the two phases. Phase 1 had significantly greater measures of pronouns with a small-medium effect size, 2nd person words with a medium-large effect size, positive emotion with a medium effect size, inter-rogations with a medium-large effect size, question marks with a medium-large effect size, risk with a medium-large effect size, and causal words with a medium effect size. These results in conjunction with a retrospective survey suggest that phase 1 had more questions asked, more causal relationships defined, and included linguistic features of success and failure. Results from Phase 2 indicated that community-sourced data and problems may increase motivation for learning data science. [For the full proceedings, see ED623995.]

AB  - Advertising technology is advancing quickly incorporating digital techniques that may be beyond the experience of the individual faculty member. Collaborative teaching, where faculty members from different disciplines co-teach a course, may be a solution. This report assesses the learning outcomes of an advertising technology course taught by faculty from one university's advertising, computer science and human-computer interaction programs. The course was run twice, with a third one in progress. Students were predominantly advertising majors, with a minority of computer science and design majors. Two semesters of pre- and post-tests were analyzed, finding increases in student comfort with preparing and presenting technologically advanced solutions to advertising challenges.

AB  - This article aims to examine the difficulties, misgivings, and criticism that exist in academia and the field of education, regarding creating history curricula relevant and significant to twenty-first century society and individuals; how compulsory history curricula can be suited to the methodology and didactics of training students as history teachers, and suggest several solutions to the issues discussed. The structure of knowledge approach in the discipline of history is problematic, and creates a complex challenge regarding preparing history students as teachers of the future. This is because this discipline represents, to a great extent, the wider fields of the humanities and social sciences which are very difficult to integrate into the school educational process. Historical research and the education system have different goals. The historian strives to clarify "historical questions", meaning issues from the past with the perspective of their having certain relevance to the future. In contrast, the education system seeks to shape the student's worldview and provide him with significant tools for coping with the challenges of the twenty-first century, as part of the "toolbox" that the education system believes will serve as a basis for the student's preparation to be a useful individual in society and for himself. In light of the weight of history in teaching values, based on reliable facts gained from historical research, the main role that should be given to teaching the subject is to teach critical thinking. The ability to understand history in its framework of reference, meaning, understanding change and the environment, needs to be developed. Likewise, it is necessary to arouse and develop the judicious use of facts and drawing conclusions. Learning history can, and must, take place both experientially and logically. Presenting the "historical story" alongside the "cognitive-critical" approach must be the primary "pedagogy" when instilling students with teaching skills. Achieving history curriculum goals is greatly dependent on the teaching and evaluation methods, and how well teachers succeed in bringing their students to be active and involved in the learning process. Therefore, a variety of teaching strategies must be employed, in the spirit of the constructionist approach. Training teaching students requires a variety of pedagogic methods and methodological approaches, and teaching literacy for strategies for interdisciplinary teaching methods, integrative learning, and use of digital technologies.

AB  - In the fall of 2008, Stacy McCormack's students were caught up in the presidential election, and she began to wonder how she might harness this passion for politics in her high school physics classroom. At about the same time, a friend recommended the book "Physics for Future Presidents" (Muller 2008), which led her to develop a year long project that integrated energy, literacy, and public policy. The book and the project based on it are described in this article and address misconceptions about energy so students can make informed and scientifically accurate decisions related to the topic.

AB  - Finite Mathematics has become an enormously rich and productive area of contemporary mathematical biology. Fortunately, educators have developed educational modules based upon many of the models that have used Finite Mathematics in mathematical biology research. A sufficient variety of computer modules that employ graph theory (phylogenetic trees, food webs, networks), cellular automata (pattern formation, diffusion limited aggregation), fractals (both measurement and generation of self-similar structures), finite difference equations and deterministic chaos (logistic growth, predator-prey, SIR epidemiology), combinatorics and probability (genetics and evolution), information theory (biodiversity, sequence logos), and Boolean logic (operons) are available to adopt, adapt, and implement. An emphasis has been placed on modules that are freely available, that have been educationally vetted, and that run on a variety of operating systems. Most modules are easy to use, graphically visual, and amenable to modification. In this paper, two different approaches are stressed: (1) "glass box models" that¬†allow students to see equations associated with each cell in a spreadsheet and to modify/extend those models with minimal effort; and (2) agent-based models that emphasize "bottom-up" modeling and that instantiate the power of massively parallel simulation and address the misconceptions of a "centralized mind-set."

AB  - At present, there are alarming reports raising serious concerns about water availability in many countries including Morocco. In this context of water scarcity and increasing water demand, education may play a crucial role in transforming values and habits that promote a sustainable management of the resource. Therefore water education topics should be incorporated in school curricula. The first objective of the present study was to explore the status of water education in Moroccan curricula designed for Primary and Lower Secondary School levels. The second objective consisted in assessing students' knowledge, attitudes and behaviour regarding water-related issues. The study results showed that water-related topics are incorporated in the curricula with multi and interdisciplinary approaches and the most involved are Sciences and Geography; however there is a lack of field and extracurricular activities. While students' attitudes towards water were positive, their daily water use habits did not match attitudes. To make curricula more effective in changing students' attitudes and behaviour regarding water use and conservation, water-topics should be taught in accessible ways using values-driven education and innovative methods, field trips and school life activities.

AB  - Teacher training on environmental education (EE) is a key element of promoting the restoration of ecological systems and insuring inclusive and equitable human development. Science and biology teachers play a significant role in favoring EE at Brazilian schools. This study investigates the presence of EE in the curriculum and aims to interpret the meanings of EE expressed in the discourse of students who are training to be biology teachers at a Brazilian public university, considering recent, related education legislation. The theoretical and methodological framework of French Discourse Analysis was adopted to identify social, political, and cultural influences expressed in the students' discourse. The discourse data comprised responses from voluntary undergraduate students to a semi-structured questionnaire. Most of the study participants claimed to have had contact with EE in their tertiary education and revealed multiple perceptions regarding this theme. The majority of the discourses indicated that EE meanings are restricted to conservation or preservation, and some indicated confusion regarding the purposes of both EE and ecology disciplines. There was little data indicating an association between EE and socioeconomic issues, which would be expected in terms of the more encompassing and interdisciplinary approaches recommended by legislation. The curricular matrix of this undergraduate course showed a predominance of hours devoted to courses that discuss the environment from the biological perspective in contrast to a small number of courses that discuss and promote EE from other perspectives. In addition, undergraduate students claimed that they had little contact with recent EE legislation. This scenario, reinforced by the naturalistic foundation discourse of EE in Brazil, probably affects the constitution of the discursive memories of these students, their discourses, and their future pedagogical practice. Recommendations are made in order to foster the development of citizenship at schools and to prevent the silencing of issues such as the conflicts and risks associated with environmental problems.

AB  - The maker movement has strong connections to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) as well as art and crafts, but the goals of making are not in perfect alignment with any of these disciplines. Within the problem-based paradigm, however, there is room to incorporate making as situated STEM learning, even in formal, standards-based educational settings. We report on a framework for making in STEM education and describe a rubric for assessing the presence of the essential elements of making within STEM instruction. We present examples of the application of the rubric in a STEM teacher education course.

AB  - A Virtual World, the "Sustainability Hub" island, was developed and widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic, to support schools with distance-learning lessons, and the new mandatory Civic Education curriculum in Italy. Using a gamification approach, students learned about Agenda 2030 and sustainability focusing especially on themes related to geosciences, e.g., global warming, overexploitation of georesources and soil, recycling of critical elements, circular economy, and environmental footprint indicators. After a preliminary test involving 58 teachers, who evaluated the activity, 650 students from four schools in different geographic areas were involved. The students were divided into two groups, one directly accessing the virtual world as avatars (group W), the other participating in a sharing-screen mode (group S). Pre- and post-activity tests and a satisfaction survey were administered to assess learning outcomes and engagement. Questionnaire data analysis revealed good content acquisition for all students, high levels of students' engagement and positive feedback. The evaluation of post- and pre-activity mean score tests highlights significant differences between the two groups, with knowledge gain for the W group being double compared to the S group (22.9 vs. 11.6). This result evidences the positive effect of virtual world activities on learning. Sustainability Hub allowed interactions between students, supporting their social needs in a time of crisis, but it can also represent a valid support to conventional teaching. The engaging environment involved students to discover the many interdisciplinary connections between geoscience and sustainability, making them aware of the central role of geoscientists in the Agenda 2030 goals.

AB  - This paper outlines the findings from a research project on students' conceptions of learning in a series of international online collaborative seminars that involved partner institutions from Europe and the US. The lead institution was an international, graduate university in Europe. The study was conducted with the aim of exploring the qualitatively different ways in which graduate students conceive of learning in an international, interdisciplinary and multimodal setting. Of the 82 participants in the seminars, 42 students in social sciences and humanities volunteered to be interviewed. The transcripts were analysed using a phenomenographic approach. A hierarchical system of qualitatively different conceptualisations was created; according to which students conceptualised internationalised learning as (1) a process to integrate information, skills and knowledge, (2) international encounters designed to harness diversity of views and (3) an opportunity for interdisciplinary learning. The varying forms of fragmented and cohesive conceptions are also discussed.

AB  - Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, is a promising tool to produce assistive technology. For instance, individuals with deafblindness (concurrent vision and hearing loss) could benefit from tactile AM-based products as touch may be their main gateway to access information. This study thus aimed to synthesize evidence on the current and potential practices involving AM in the context of deafblindness rehabilitation and to inform healthcare professionals and family caregivers on how AM can improve functioning and quality of life. A comprehensive literature search of ten databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Global Health, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, Web of Science, Engineering Village, and Scopus) was performed to identify sources focusing on the use of AM toward rehabilitation goals of individuals with deafblindness. Nine of 1,397 studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings reveal that AM can counter barriers to full accessibility by enabling professionals to produce customized adapted material and communication devices, thus assisting individuals with deafblindness in communication, mobility, and learning. However, this review highlights a need for more AM research, resources, and training: interdisciplinary collaborations with AM specialists thus appear essential in improving rehabilitation services with AM.

AB  - In many countries around the world, there has been an increasing emphasis on improving science education. Recent reform efforts in the USA call for teachers to integrate scientific and engineering practices into science teaching; for example, science teachers are asked to provide learning experiences for students that apply crosscutting concepts (e.g., patterns, scale) and increase understanding of disciplinary core ideas (e.g., physical science, earth science). Engineering practices and engineering design are essential elements of this new vision of science teaching and learning. This paper presents a research study that evaluates the effects of an engineering design-based science curriculum on student learning and attitudes. Three middle school life science teachers and 275 seventh grade students participated in the study. Content assessments and attitude surveys were administered before and after the implementation of the curriculum unit. Statewide mathematics test proficiency scores were included in the data analysis as well. Results provide evidence of the positive effects of implementing the engineering design-based science unit on student attitudes and learning.

Inorganic/physical chemistry courses for undergraduate students treat such methods, but quite often only from the theoretical point of view. In the calculation exercise herein described, students are guided step by step through the computational study of the photophysics and photochemistry of polypyridyl Ru(II) d[superscript 6]-metal complexes. In particular, by means of DFT and TD-DFT calculations, they are asked to examine and interpret a set of experimental data describing the absorption, emission, and photochemical behavior of three structurally related ruthenium complexes, namely, [Ru(bpy)[subscript 3]][superscript 2+] (1), [Ru(tpy)[subscript 2]][superscript 2+] (2), and [Ru(bpy)[subscript 2](py)[subscript 2]][superscript 2+] (3). These complexes are particularly suitable for an educational purpose since they exhibit distinct optical and photochemical properties despite being structurally akin to each other. In the computational chemistry laboratory, the instructor progressively guides students through the preparation of DFT and TD-DFT inputs and the use of software for the analysis of output files, including visualization of optimized geometries, absorption spectra, orbitals, and spin density surfaces. The exercise covers training of students in several key concepts concerning the photophysics and photochemistry of transition metal complexes. These include Franck-Condon transitions and the role of [superscript 3]MLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) and [superscript 3]MC (metal-centered or ligand-field) states in luminescence and ligand photodissociation processes. Notably, the mixed character of this exercise allows its integration with theoretical and experimental activities and the design of truly multidisciplinary courses.

AB  - The use of quality texts in elementary classrooms plays a major role in children's literacy development. Quality children's literature helps learners develop into skilled readers and writers with increased gains in vocabulary knowledge and comprehension. This paper demonstrates how pre-service teachers gained an understanding of the educational value of evaluating texts for quality. Using a mentor teacher assigned science topic, the pre-service teachers reviewed and evaluated texts and electronic based resources on specific science topics. The data highlights pre-service teachers' reflections on how quality texts can be a powerful tool in supporting literacy success in their future teaching. It also highlights a range of quality texts used in conjunction with notable science topics frequently taught during the fall and spring quarters in public schools.

AB  - Collaborations and partnerships across disciplines are becoming increasingly recognized as valuable endeavors toward solving emerging global challenges in our rapidly changing world. Thus, it is crucial to create STEM educational strategies that infuse diverse and interconnected perspectives among scientists, policymakers, and the general public. Systems thinking represents one such pedagogical approach, in which a holistic framework empowers both teachers and students to recognize how fundamental concepts taught in the classroom can be used as resourceful tools to better address complex, multicomponent modern challenges. For chemical educators, topics on "technology" (the "T" in STEM education) represent a particularly meaningful avenue to introduce and study the effectiveness of systems thinking, but there have been few examples reported to date. Here, we show that a molecular engineering course introduced at the University of Chicago 5 years ago ("Introduction to Emerging Technologies") provides a model course to this end, where explicitly designing in elements of systems thinking to the course could further strengthen students' understanding of the already well suited, holistic course topics. Integrating systems thinking would illuminate how tissue engineering, nanomedicine, batteries, quantum information, and meat alternatives are developed from multiple, interrelated fields as well as from basic science to a practical reality. For each technology, we outline the direct connections between the current course topics and future opportunities to incorporate systems thinking strategies, challenging students to identify the interdependence of components in a successful technology. Finally, to offer further insight for instructors interested in utilizing systems thinking, we broaden our discussion to reflect on the challenges of redesigning any STEM course to utilize systems thinking, and we present corresponding teaching strategies to overcome them.

AB  - There is growing attention to the potential for developing professional learning experiences for content area teachers to infuse computational thinking (CT), which refers to the set of problem-solving practices related to the computer science discipline, into their classrooms. Although research has begun to document professional learning models and supports for CT infusion, an understudied area for both research and practice is how in-service teachers come to lead CT infusion efforts through determining curriculum, supporting their colleagues, and designing school and district-wide programs, once the professional development (PD) and related learning experiences are over. In this paper, we document findings from the final year of a five-year PD project, in which a subset of middle and high school content area teachers and teacher teams (n=12) proposed, designed, and carried out their own CT infusion projects. Using a practitioner inquiry framework, we analyze teachers' choices in project types (curriculum development, teacher PD, and activities designed to connect in-school and informal learning), motivating factors for applying for the grant, their inquiry processes, and their perceptions of project impact. We discuss suggestions for supporting teacher-led CT infusion, including taking incremental approaches that develop teacher knowledge over time, building both discipline-specific and interdisciplinary teacher communities, and engaging multiple stakeholders to build the culture necessary for CT infusion. We conclude with general implications for creating structures to sustain and extend researcher-practitioner partnerships.

AB  - In this first of a two-part series, the authors report that STEM is still mostly science and mathematics, taught separately with little or no attention to technology and engineering. Where connections do get made to technology and engineering, too often they happen through several disconnected projects that lack coherence in content standards and student performance objectives. This paper highlights a process that science, math, engineering, and technology teachers may utilize to collaborate and design integrated STEM courses. The article proposes a conceptual framework that could provide a premise upon which educators interested in delivery of STEM content may reflect to integrate STEM disciplines in the classroom. At the heart of this framework is problem-based learning, pragmatism, and four theoretical constructs: systems thinking, situated learning theory, constructivism, and goal orientation theory, that blend together to accentuate Lee Shulman's (1986) Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK). For the purposes of this paper, designing a safe swing set will be utilized to illustrate how science, math, engineering, and technology teachers may forge a collaborative teaching effort to integrate STEM concepts into teaching practices.

AB  - Drawing is a long-standing tool in the natural sciences, but training in this skill set has lapsed. We describe the impacts of field sketching instruction on the teaching practices of faculty and the experiences of students in two sections of a freshman-level course on natural history. We examine self-reported data from participating faculty and students. We focus on their perspectives of drawing and natural history practices before and after drawing training and a field journal requirement. Faculty reported positive shifts in their views of the value and feasibility of incorporating drawing in their courses. We observed positive shifts in students' attitudes about drawing and appreciation of nature, as indicated by students' field journal entries and survey responses. Given the sample size (n¬†=¬†26 students, n¬†=¬†2 faculty), our ability to draw inference is constrained. Thus, we present these results to provide context for the overall process of efforts to integrate drawing more fully into natural science courses. For university instructors interested in incorporating drawing into their natural science courses, we also provide advice rooted in the literature and best practices of art-science integration. Our results suggest that on-going, artist-facilitated training for faculty and students can enhance the experience of using drawing in natural history courses and reconnect natural scientists at all career levels to drawing as a valuable, professional¬†tool.

AB  - Context: Qualitative methodologies are relatively new in health sciences education research, especially in the area of problem-based learning (PBL). A key advantage of qualitative approaches is the ability to gain in-depth, textured insights into educational phenomena. Key methodological issues arise, however, in terms of the strategies of inquiry, data collection methods, and analytical approaches. This review aims to identify and appraise the current applications of qualitative studies in PBL and indicate possible new methodological directions. Methods: Two computerized databases, Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) and PubMed, were screened for solely qualitative studies of PBL in health sciences education between 2000 and 2015. Selected articles were grouped for systematic description, critical analysis, and evaluation, with a key focus on identifying methodological trends. Results: The number of recent qualitative research studies of PBL in health sciences education is small but growing, with 61 solely qualitative articles identified in the review period. Four main research issues in PBL were identified for qualitative investigation: (1) participants' experiences or perceptions; (2) facilitation; (3) assessment; and (4) educational technologies. Participants' experiences or perceptions of PBL have drawn the most research attention to date. Methodological approaches included: self-reported studies using interview data (n = 29); studies analyzing video recordings of PBL tutorials (n = 9); introspective studies analyzing written reflections (n = 6); and studies using multiple qualitative methods (n = 17). Of the 61 identified studies, the majority are perception studies, with only a limited number focused on PBL processes or interactional analyses. Conclusions: This review presented and analyzed current practices in qualitative studies of PBL in health sciences education and indicated new directions. Research designs are expanding beyond an initial focus on post-hoc perception studies to explore innovative, in situ qualitative inquiries and methodologies.

AB  - Climate change is one of the most significant science issues facing humanity; yet, teaching students about climate change is challenging: not only is it multidisciplinary, but also it is contentious and debated in political, social and media forums. Students need to be equipped with an understanding of climate change science to be able to participate in this discourse. The purpose of this study was to examine Western Australian high school students' understanding of climate change and the greenhouse effect, in order to identify their alternative conceptions about climate change science and provide a baseline for more effective teaching. A questionnaire designed to elicit students' understanding and alternative conceptions was completed by 438 Year 10 students (14-15 years old). A further 20 students were interviewed. Results showed that students know different features of both climate change and the greenhouse effect, however not necessarily all of them and the relationships between. Five categories of alternative conceptions were identified. The categories were (1) the greenhouse effect and the ozone layer; (2) types of greenhouse gases; (3) types of radiation; (4) weather and climate and (5) air pollution. These findings provide science educators a basis upon which to develop strategies and curriculum resources to improve their students' understanding and decision-making skills about the socioscientific issue, climate change.

AB  - Creativity, giftedness, and leadership are complex, important phenomena, especially in the threatening turbulence of 21st-century conditions; consequently, there is an increasing need to understand how to strengthen them. We can learn much about these phenomena from within the borders of specialized disciplines; however, they are too complex and multifaceted to fit within the walls of disciplinary silos. Interdisciplinary explorations can reveal theories and research findings that expand our knowledge bases about creativity, giftedness, and leadership. This analysis includes the rationale for engaging in interdisciplinary investigations for these purposes. It includes examples of the ways in which interdisciplinary thinking invigorates creativity and cognitive diversity; illuminates the benefits of visual--spatial gifts that strengthen the development of important talents in gifted students who can go on to become creative leaders; and shows how human rights can be strengthened by constraining economic and political corruption. It also describes the benefits of using interdisciplinary navigation through different levels of analysis, each of which includes a number of academic disciplines.

AB  - Anorexia nervosa is a complex behavioral disorder with the highest risk of death of any psychological disorder. Between 15% and 20% of those suffering from anorexia die from complications that are attributed either directly or indirectly to self-starvation. Heritability for anorexia is around 0.5, meaning about 50% of the risk for anorexia is attributable to genetics and the other 50% is attributable to environmental factors. Sufferers may be as young as 5 years old and as old as 80. Some with anorexia recover completely and some struggle with it for a lifetime. Average recovery time is between 3 and 7 years. This directed case study uses a progressive disclosure model to expose students to the multiple facets of anorexia. The case follows Megi, a teenage girl who has recovered from anorexia. The case has been taught in advanced general psychology and genetics classes. It could be readily adapted for general biology, abnormal psychology, counseling, or nutrition. It is helpful for students to have prior knowledge about the theme of nature-nurture as well as familiarity with the basic concepts of scientific thinking including hypothesis formulation and the determination of cause and effect.

AB  - This study provides insights into speech-language pathology graduate student learning experiences during a community-based clinical rotation that targets skill development within an interdisciplinary theater program. Theater-based programming has shown some utility toward promoting pragmatic language skill development for children and teens outside of traditional clinical practice. In addition, the interdisciplinary nature of the program provides opportunities for student clinicians to engage in interprofessional collaboration with arts professionals. The purpose of this study was to explore SLP graduate students' experiences within a collaborative inclusion theater program. Semi-structured interviews collected from three graduate student clinicians were transcribed and analyzed according to Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) methods to yield insights from student participant perspectives of this assigned clinical rotation. Analysis of interview data suggests participants found opportunities to problem-solve collaborative roles and balances while forming concrete ideas related to how to a therapeutic effect. The most salient concepts present across student accounts of experience included openness to the ongoing nature of the learning process, appreciation for the collaborative teaming involved in program activities, and the establishment of a set of ideas and tools to use for clinical utility. This study provides helpful information for clinical educators considering the benefit of embedding potential interprofessional collaborations with performing arts professionals in clinical education.

AB  - Student attrition is a persistent challenge in the life sciences, particularly among underrepresented minorities, first-generation students, and women. Experiential learning through short-term study abroad opportunities diversifies curricula by immersing students in nontraditional academic environments. However, most experiential learning and study abroad opportunities are primarily available to upper-division undergraduates. Here, we present a qualitative analysis of an experiential learning opportunity offered exclusively to first-year U.S. undergraduate students from underrepresented demographics. We performed ethnographic observations of a 10-day field component in the Gal√°pagos Islands and analyzed self-reported survey results and field journals. Students consistently reported strong cognitive gains in their understanding of basic evolutionary concepts. Most students also benefited socially, although we observed higher variation in selfreported social gains. Our findings suggest that immersive field courses increase scientific literacy and promote social cohesion among students. We speculate that experiential learning opportunities may improve retention of underrepresented minorities in the life sciences, and we encourage future studies to further examine the short-term and long-term impacts of study abroad on student cognition and retention.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of students' science learning in Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) at one elementary school in Taiwan. This study investigated student perceptions of both the content and language achievement of science learning in CLIL. Data collection techniques included graphic organizers, individual interviews, students' self-assessment, and students' tests. Findings showed that CLIL helped enrich student vocabulary size, foster student science knowledge, and lead them to expect to learn other subjects in English. They also enjoyed the CLIL approach, but expressed limited knowledge about the school flower.

These challenges are inherent to the interdisciplinary and problem-oriented character of environmental sciences curricula. In this article, we review the merits of conceptual models in facing these challenges. These models are valuable because they can be used to (a) improve the coherence and focus of an environmental sciences curriculum, (b) analyze environmental issues and integrate knowledge, (c) examine and guide the process of environmental research and problem solving, and (d) examine and guide the integration of knowledge in the environmental-research and problem-solving processes. We advocate the use of various conceptual models in environmental sciences education. By applying and reflecting on these models, students start to recognize the complexity of human-environment systems, to appreciate the various approaches to framing environmental problems, and to comprehend the role of science in dealing with these problems.

AB  - Under the background of collaborative innovation, interdisciplinary research organizations due to its structural advantages should actively target frontier science and the great needs of national development, key research and strategic issues of solving the country's need, prospective issues in the frontier of science and technology and major welfare issues related to people's livelihood. And it requires reasonable localization of interdisciplinary research organizations in universities. Facing the difficulties participated in collaborative innovation, they should establish a perfect operation mechanism, play the role of collaborative innovation platform, and actively transform to collaborative innovation center scientifically and effectively.

AB  - Reform efforts in different parts of the world call for the adoption of integrated approaches to STEM education. However, little is known about how teachers work, as members of learning communities, to design STEM teaching material such as lesson plans. To address this gap in the literature, we examined the design of STEM lesson plans by in-service secondary teachers (n = 26) from all S-T-E-M disciplinary backgrounds who participated as members of a learning community in the context of a 7-month professional development program comprised of 13 small-group sessions. STEM lesson plans were analysed based on the key characteristics of a conceptual framework of integrated STEM, and the teachers' identified interdisciplinary elements were analysed through the boundary objects framework. The qualitative content analysis produced four main findings: (a) divergencies take place at the disciplinary level when teachers design STEM lesson plans; (b) teachers coming from different disciplines have different positioning regarding specific integrated STEM key characteristics; (c) the type and sequence of instructional activities served as a boundary-design practice; (d) the nature of the boundary objects that teachers identify in order to teach integrated STEM differs according to the discipline. The findings of the study shed light on teachers' understanding and needs at the disciplinary level and call for specially designed STEM professional development programmes that provide explicit opportunities for disciplinary boundary crossings.

AB  - Environmental stewardship education, as a locally oriented concept, benefits from being recast to account for the emergent, multidimensional, and interdisciplinary nature of today's most pressing socio-ecological issues. In an effort to infuse environmental stewardship education with global citizenship, instructional materials on community-based conservation in Peru were delivered to high school students in New York, USA. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of instructional materials on student learning outcomes related to the practice of global citizenship in environmental stewardship education. The CLIA model for powerful learning environments was used to convey the competencies, learning conditions, interventions, and assessments that structured the delivery of the instructional materials. To evaluate learning outcomes, written student responses were analyzed, using the qualitative coding methodology. Additionally, transformative learning was assessed using the Learning Activities Survey. Results suggest a trajectory past knowledge comprehension and toward transformative, empowered action, progressing from a cognitive understanding to affective and ultimately behavioral shifts. Based on these findings, this study conceptualized and operationalized the concept 21st-century stewardship -- a term coined here as an updated stewardship model that is infused with global citizenship's multi-scalar perspectives, global compacts, and layered identities to achieve its maximum impact in our interconnected world.

AB  - The promise of educational neuroscience lies in its potential to uncover mechanistic insights into the science of learning. However, to realize that promise, the field must overcome a fundamental difference between the constituent disciplines: neuroscience is primarily concerned with understanding how the brain works; whereas education attempts to change the brain regardless of its workings. Learning is one domain where these orientations align: it is a deep feature of nervous systems and a target outcome of education. This article proposes coupling training studies with neuroimaging to assess the impact of real-world learning on brain activity patterns, and simultaneously ask fundamental questions about the causal role of specific patterns of brain activity in academic skill acquisition. Finally, planning and implementing these studies requires multiple forms of expertise and collaborating across disciplines, which will contribute to a more cohesive educational neuroscience research community.

AB  - This research deals with a possible use of history of mathematics in mathematics education. In particular, history can be a fundamental element for the introduction of the concept of integral through a problem-centred and intuitive approach. Therefore, what follows is dedicated to the teaching of mathematics in the last years of secondary schools, where infinitesimal calculus is addressed. The thesis here proposed is that the resort to Archimedes' use of exhaustion method and to Newton's initial lemmas expounded in his Principia Mathematica are useful means to reach a genetic comprehension of the concept of integral. Hence, two demonstrations by Archimedes and two lemmas by Newton are used to prove such thesis. A further idea here proposed is that history of mathematics can be of help for an interdisciplinary education. [For the full proceedings, see ED620289.]

AB  - In schools, design projects can be implemented at a variety of ways and with varying degrees of resources from teachers and schools. However, little work has been done on the differences between student learning outcomes and the type of design projects. This study compares two design projects implemented in 7th grade classrooms (n=677) at two different schools to explain affordances of each approach based on differences in project authenticity, scale, and depth of context in supporting student learning outcomes. The main data sources were an engineering science test and a design reasoning elicitation problem, administered at each school before and after the design project. To understand the relationship between students' science learning gains and school implementation, we conducted a sign test to compare between-group differences and a Mann Whitney Test to compare within-group differences. Then, we performed a content analysis to examine students' design reasoning and a two-way contingency table analysis to understand if a student's school implementation was related to the changes in design trade-off reasoning. Students at both schools exhibited statistically significant but small gains on their engineering science test scores. While students at the school with a more interdisciplinary, more authentic design project had higher scores on the engineering science test, students at the school with a smaller scale implementation discussed more trade-off factors in their design reasoning elicitation problem. These findings suggest that differences in project implementation appear to be associated with different learning outcomes, and there are potential benefits to both authenticity and simplicity in design projects.

AB  - Rational numbers (i.e., fractions, percentages, decimals, and whole-number frequencies) are notoriously difficult mathematical constructs. Yet correctly interpreting rational numbers is imperative for understanding health statistics, such as gauging the likelihood of side effects from a medication. Several pernicious biases affect health decision-making involving rational numbers. In our novel developmental framework, the natural-number bias-a tendency to misapply knowledge about natural numbers to all numbers-is the mechanism underlying other biases that shape health decision-making. Natural-number bias occurs when people automatically process natural-number magnitudes and disregard ratio magnitudes. Math-cognition researchers have identified individual differences and environmental factors underlying natural-number bias and devised ways to teach people how to avoid these biases. Although effective interventions from other areas of research can help adults evaluate numerical health information, they circumvent the core issue: people's penchant to automatically process natural-number magnitudes and disregard ratio magnitudes. We describe the origins of natural-number bias and how researchers may harness the bias to improve rational-number understanding and ameliorate innumeracy in real-world contexts, including health. We recommend modifications to formal math education to help children learn the connections among natural and rational numbers. We also call on researchers to consider individual differences people bring to health decision-making contexts and how measures from math cognition might identify those who would benefit most from support when interpreting health statistics. Investigating innumeracy with an interdisciplinary lens could advance understanding of innumeracy in theoretically meaningful and practical ways.

AB  - A magnetic stirrer is an indispensable instrument in any laboratory setting. Commercially available stirrers are costly and have a defined life-span. The construction of a low-cost magnetic stirrer based on pulse width modulation is described. The design reported uses mainly recycled parts which results in a robust and efficient device at a very reasonable cost of ~US$17.50, which will be particularly attractive in developing countries. The project requires a multidisciplinary approach and can be utilized as a teaching exercise.

AB  - Extreme variations in the earth's climate have radically changed the ecosystems, economics, cultural practices, language, and lifeways of the Chamorro and Carolinian peoples who live in the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands in the Western North Pacific. It is essential that the upcoming generation gain science understandings that incorporate indigenous knowledge and applied problem solving, in order to help address the adverse climate effects. This paper examines the deliberations of a Local Professional Learning Community--a multidisciplinary group of cultural practitioners, elders, youth, scientists and educators--formed to identify, articulate, and share a set of design principles to guide the integration of indigenous knowledge and climate education practices in the CNMI, and focus future research in this urgent climate domain.

AB  - The review of literature highlighted that gifted students may gain a lot from authentic instruction in that this methodology may serve well to their needs for inquiry, meaning-making and higher level thinking. Therefore, this qualitative study realized in a phenomenological design aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the EFL teachers' ways of integrating authentic pedagogy into their teaching situations with gifted students. Thus, part of the aim of this study is to investigate how foreign language teaching and gifted education could be linked to one another and in this way it also aims to propose an interdisciplinary focus of research. The participants were six EFL teachers that were sampled from those teaching gifted language learners at Science and Arts Centers (BILSEMs) in one geographical region of Turkey and asked to share their experiences about the implementation of authentic instruction in their gifted classrooms. The results showed that the EFL teachers mostly followed the firmly established standards of the authentic instruction in the literature and they believed that authentic instructional practices enhance gifted learners' learning and intellectual capacities. However, there were some problems or barriers such as class size and time constraints against the better implementation of authentic instruction in their gifted EFL classrooms as reported by these teachers.

AB  - In order to thrive in today's uncertain environment, there is a need to master 21st century skills as well as knowledge of key subjects. Project-based learning (PBL) has been recommended as an important instructional strategy to prepare students for their future work and life. As teachers play an important role in classroom instructional practice, understanding their perspectives on PBL is essential in order to provide them with support for its successful implementation. We investigated how Finnish pre- and in-service class teachers and mathematics and science teachers (N = 257) view PBL in terms of (1) its objectives, (2) its characteristics, (3) the suitable application and situation regarding its implementation, and (4) support for and barriers to its implementation. We collected data from two questionnaire surveys, project plans, and reports and then analysed them quantitatively. We found that a majority of the teachers considered the development of students' knowledge and understanding of mathematics and science, and 21st century skills as important objectives of PBL in mathematics and science education. The development of teamwork skills and the connection between theory and practice were regarded as key PBL characteristics. Moreover, PBL was perceived as suitable for both revising and learning new content. Nevertheless, the relative inadequacy of resources and support for PBL implementation was reported. Of particular necessity were ready-made project instructions, ideas, tips, and examples; advice from experienced teachers; training and guidance on basic PBL issues; and more time allocation. We discuss implications for teachers' professional development towards PBL.

AB  - The Center for Cybersecurity Education and Research at Old Dominion University has expanded its use of high impact practices in the university's undergraduate cybersecurity degree program. Strategies developed to promote student learning included learning communities, undergraduate research, a robust internship program, service learning, and electronic portfolios. This paper reviews the literature on these practices, highlights the way that they were implemented in our cybersecurity program, and discusses some of the challenges encountered with each practice. Although the prior literature on high impact practices rarely touches on cybersecurity coursework, the robust evidence of the success of those practices provides a sound rationale for applying them across the curricula. Challenges confronted included developing partnerships, introducing students to new learning strategies, and gaining buy in from faculty. Despite these challenges, the authors' experiences with the efforts also support using high impact practices in cybersecurity programs. Recommendations for other cybersecurity programs seeking to expand the use of high impact practices include integrating experiential learning throughout the curricula, developing campus-wide partnerships, embracing the interdisciplinary nature of cybersecurity, demonstrating the purpose of the practices, providing faculty development, emphasizing writing, and embracing failure.

AB  - The author created and has been teaching a first-year seminar (FYS) called "Food for Thought: Rhetoric of the Edible" for the past three years. Sustainability and ethics in the production and consumption of food have been tangential topics that have arisen in the course. While her academic background is composition and rhetoric, food has become a research interest in recent years as she has learned alongside her students in this course. The interdisciplinary aspects of the course have changed significantly each time she has taught the course. Here, she focuses on connections with political science, sociology, and chemistry faculty. The aforementioned Food Politics serves as a framework for the political science connections as teachers discuss how politics influence food sustainability. In her partnership with a sociology course, she and the teachers examine how social and cultural customs affect sustainability, specifically how adherence (or lack of adherence) to social codes impacts the ethics of sustainability. In addition to her teaching partnership with political science and sociology, she has also integrated course content with an introductory chemistry class, examining how genetically modifying the chemical composition of food affects sustainability as well as the benefits and drawbacks of chemical-free farms.

AB  - This paper presents findings from an on-going international study of Early Childhood (EC) teachers' and children's use of Internet of Toys (IoToys) to understand possibilities for developing children's cognitive capacities (e.g., creativity, inquiry, engineering design thinking). The study employed a Design Based Research (DBR) method, where teachers intentionally plan and deliver technologically constructed Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) experiences for preschoolers. Using Australia as a case study, data collection involved participant observation of three teachers' and 17 children's technology constructed play experiences with robotic toys, littleBits electronic magnetic blocks, alongside pre and post semi-structured interviews with teachers and children's photo voice sessions were video recorded. Analysing the findings using embodied cognition theory showed that the teachers, although novice in their own technological pedagogical knowledge engaged children's play with the robotic toys, and co-learn with the children. Integration of STEM-focused playful experiences supported children's scientific inquiry, design thinking and creativity as well as vocabulary targeted at interdisciplinary STEM concepts. With the ever increasing focus on developing children's 21st century skills, this study recommends engineering habits of mind, creativity and inquiry dispositions should now be taken into account in teaching and learning situations with young children and to develop STEM engagement.

AB  - It is no secret that particular populations of Americans, specifically minorities, women, and students from high-poverty schools and districts, are underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) jobs (Presidents' Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, 2010). In the 21st century, technology drives innovation and invention, and STEM is critical for American economic competitiveness, national security, and quality of life for all citizens (Dasgupta & Stout, 2014). The American workforce needs every capable STEM worker to keep America in a global leadership position. Research indicates that the underrepresentation of particular demographic groups in STEM careers contributes to the shortage of STEM workforce candidates and limits the extent to which members of the underrepresented groups can participate in lucrative, fast-growing careers (Malcom-Piqueux & Malcom, 2013). Even if students do not intend to pursue a STEM career, they still need to be STEM literate to participate in the 21st century economy and workforce. American jobs require multidisciplinary problem-solving approaches that include technology in industries such as manufacturing, defense, health care, finance, government, weather forecasting, and even digital arts and music (Machi, 2009; Baron, 2015). Students will need role models to show them how to use technology to learn, how to use technology to meet a need, and how to use technology responsibly.

AB  - This article describes how it is due to the fact that computer science is present in many activities of daily life, students need to develop skills to solve problems to improve the lives of people in general. This article investigates correlations between teachers' motivational orientations, beliefs and practices with respect to the application of real-world problems in undergraduate courses. A questionnaire was applied to twenty-eight teachers of an undergraduate computer science course. Data from the questionnaire was analyzed using statistical methods. The results show that the majority of the teachers, especially those who interact with companies, believe that the insertion of real-world problems in the classroom is important. However, some teachers are not willing to adopt this practice. This is linked to reasons such as the need for more flexible curricula and a better teaching qualification with respect to collaborative problem solving.

AB  - Artist educators work in a great diversity of locations from informal community spaces to formal learning spaces in schools and museums. Art educators are exploring modes of transdisciplinary curriculum connecting art to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEAM) to meet the diverse challenges of making and learning. One of the roadblocks to maker forms of education is access to digital fabrication technologies such as 3D printers. To bring digital fabrication to a wider range of arts learning contexts, I designed a mini mobile makerspace that focused on 3D printing that I am calling a DigiFab Kit. As an extension of the concept of the FabLab Classroom model, I share my design decisions and experience of 3D printing in a mobile framework. My development of DigiFab Kits is an exploration of curated object collections that deploy as mobile makerspaces with adaptable curricular concepts appropriate to technology that can be used anywhere there is electricity.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is threefold: first, to explain the link between traditional same-age school structure and the impact this has on a school's capacity for individual and organisational learning; second, to explain why attempts to develop schools as learning organisations (LOs) invariably reify existing structures and practice, and finally, to provide an example of how and why schools that have adopted a multi-age form of organisation, a vertical tutoring (VT) system, have stumbled upon an embryonic form of LO. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper draws on a critical review of the LO literature and its defining characteristics. The paper adopts a multi-disciplinary approach combining autopoiesis and complexity science to explore differences in learning capacity between traditional same-age schools (year or grade-based structure) and schools that have transitioned to multi-age organisation (vertical tutoring system). Findings: The traditional form of same-age organisational "grammar" used in secondary schools is highly resistant to change, and any attempts at reform that fail to focus on organisation only reify existing systemic behaviour. VT schools change their form of organisation enabling them to create the capacity needed to absorb the unheard voices of participant actors (staff, students, and parents) and promote individual and organisational learning (constituent features of the LO). Originality/value: This conceptual paper argues that for secondary schools to develop any semblance of an LO, they must abandon the restrictions on learning caused by their same-age form of organisation. The VT system provides the kind of organisational template needed.

AB  - The learning outcome of a physics laboratory course for medical students was examined in an interdisciplinary field study and discussed for the electrical physiology ("Propagation of Excitation and Nerve Cells"). At the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich (LMU) at a time about 300 medicine students were assessed in two successive years. Students from the control group worked with standard experiments, while students from the treatment group performed newly developed "addressee-specific" experiments, designed to guide students to transfer physics knowledge to physiological problems. The assessment took place within the laboratory course on physiology, after the students had finished their laboratory classes in physics, and consisted of the construction of a concept map with additional multiple choice questions. The results showed that standard physics experiments are not adequate for teaching students to transfer physical principles to physiology. Introducing new addressee-specific experiments enriched the physics laboratory course by improving student attitudes toward physics and demonstrating better ability of students to relate concepts of physics and medicine, and overall to improve their understanding of the physics taught in the course.

AB  - The advance of educational technologies and digital devices have made computer-assisted language learning (CALL) an active interdisciplinary field with increasing research potential and topic diversity. Questions like "what topics and technologies attract the interest of the CALL community?," "how have these topics and technologies evolved?," and "what is the future of CALL?" are key to understanding where the CALL field has been and where it is going. To help answer these questions, the present review combined structural topic modeling, the Mann-Kendall trend test, and hierarchical clustering with bibliometrics to investigate the research status, trends, and prominent issues in CALL from 1,295 articles over the past 25 years ending in 2020. Major findings revealed that Social Sciences Citation Indexed journals such as Computer Assisted Language Learning, Language Learning & Technology, and ReCALL contributed most to the field. Topics that drew the most interest included mobile-assisted language learning, project-based learning, and blended learning. Topics drawing increasing research interest include mobile-assisted language learning, seamless learning, wiki-based learning, and virtual world and virtual reality. Additionally, the development of mobile devices, games, and virtual worlds continuously promote research attention. Finally, the review showed that scholars and educators are integrating different technologies, such as the mixed use of mobile technology and glosses/annotations for vocabulary learning, and their application into various contexts; one such context being the integration of digital multimodal composing into blended project-based learning.

AB  - Addressing honors education and undergraduate research at the community college level is a question that is becoming more prevalent in the teaching landscape. Undergraduate research is encouraged as literature supports the role it plays in developing engaged students who are interested in the field of political science and academia in general. Applying this concept to the community college level requires shifting in understanding regarding the types of students that are mentored and the expectations assigned to the research. Upper-level students have the advantage of more years in school and a connection to the discipline by majoring in the field; expanding on this approach at the community college level requires a shift by the professor or mentor to meet academic standards. This reflective essay recounts the implementation of mandatory original methodology research in a general education state government course within a community college honors program. Experience working with students at this level in political science has revealed a need to be flexible and challenging regarding curriculum and level of methods training if community college undergraduate research in the discipline is to be successful.

AB  - In this chapter, the authors discuss the potential, value, and barriers to supporting PCK in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines through collaborations across learning settings, with special attention to the role of informal science learning institutions in preservice teacher preparation. Particular focus is provided on the National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded Math and Science Teacher Education Residency (MASTER) program for teacher preparation. MASTER is a collaborative among the New York Hall of Science, Hunter College School of Education, and the New York City Department of Education through New Visions for Public Schools.

AB  - Graphics presented alongside expository science texts can have a number of positive effects for instruction, including facilitating engagement, arousing interest, and improving understanding. However, because students harbor expectations about which contexts are likely to support better understanding, the mere presence of graphics also has the potential to lead to inaccurate judgments of understanding when those graphics do not actually lead to presumed levels of performance. Previous work has demonstrated that including graphics alongside text can alter the judgment process. The present work explores different categories of instructional graphics found in biology textbooks and tests how different graphic types, classified by their form and function, can affect expectations of understanding prior to actual reading. Experiment 1 found that realistic, depictive graphics predominated in a middle school text, whereas more abstract and explanatory graphics predominated in a college text. Experiment 2 demonstrated that different categories of graphics led to differences in expectations of how helpful graphics would be for understanding.

AB  - Electrically conducting polymers are one of the promising alternative materials for technological applications in many interdisciplinary areas, including chemistry, material sciences, and engineering. This experiment was designed for providing undergraduate students with a quick and practical approach for preparation of a polyaniline-conducting polymer, demonstrating its application as a conductive coating for fabrication of smart, flexible, conductive textiles. Polyaniline was prepared by chemical oxidative polymerization (COP) of aniline monomer using ammonium persulfate as redox initiator. The polymerization was characterized by color change during the slow induction period, followed by sudden heat release during the polymerization stage due to the autoacceleration nature of this exothermic reaction. This polymerization system was used to demonstrate the heterogeneous precipitation polymerization technique. As a demonstration for the practical application of polyaniline in the area of smart conductive textiles, different nonconductive textile samples were coated with polyaniline by in situ COP and used as electronic textiles for operation of capacitive touch-screen displays.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine mobile technology as being a key apparatus and interface for collaborative innovation, which allows organisations to develop their information ecology. Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative research was performed by in-depth interviews, observations and field notes. The eight main interviews are supported by an interdisciplinary narrative literature review of knowledge management and associated fields. Findings: This study validates the following propositions: mobile technology can offer users timely information, mobile technology can foster collaboration beyond physical and organisational boundaries, in general, mobile technology enables a wider amount of interactions between people. Thereby, this paper draws some implications about the knowledge management of creative (and non-creative) workers. Research limitations/implications: The collected data sheds light on how organisations and individuals positioned themselves about mobile technology co-creative practices before the COVID era. Therefore, it shall be pertinent to further investigate these findings through a quantitative approach to better ascertain path models and to strengthen the new results with another qualitative perspective, in the post-COVID era. Practical implications: The study highlights how mobile devices are facilitating collaborative innovation practices by improving management decisions, enabling new business and/or operating models, developing a flow of ideas inner/outer an organisation and fostering the ability to make innovation. Social implications: Mobile technology transforms the way to work (knowledge creation and/or conversion) and it changes the relations between collaborators in a working environment (beyond physical boundaries). This study deciphers how a creative and/or decision-making person can change their work schedule and/or routines based on the use of mobile devices. Originality/value: The added value of this transdisciplinary study is that it improves research on collaborative innovation and collective knowledge by revealing three pertinent characteristics of mobile technology: enabling quick decision; connecting with a glocal network and fostering collective creativity. It also creates a bridge between the fields of education and business.

AB  - Purpose: Academic innovation strives to benefit from an ample talent pool, and entrepreneurship and research competitions constitute an integral part of the effort. This prompts discussions about how to optimize the impact of interdisciplinary learning, especially for less-traditional participants. The main purpose of this article is to describe how synergies between research and business plan competitions can facilitate inclusive engagement and enhanced development of transferable skills. Design/methodology/approach: A case illustration addresses the following questions: (1) what skills can be enhanced through a single project toward parallel participation in research and business plan competitions? (2) How can synergies between research and business plan competitions support more inclusive student development? The case illustration outlines the process and outcomes of an initiative with three first-gen business students, two female and two international. Findings: The case illustration describes how synergies and alignments of deadliness between research and business plan competitions enhanced the learning process by facilitating more opportunities to showcase learning and receive feedback. In addition, the parallel preparation facilitated student inclusion by providing purposeful authentic practice in a project envisioned by the students. As a result of the 2019 learning experience, students and their employers continue to value in 2021 the effective development of transferable skills. Originality/value: Previous studies examine independently entrepreneurship initiatives, science technology engineering arts and mathematics (STEAM) initiatives, transferable skills and pedagogy that support inclusive education. This manuscript describes the option of synergies between research and entrepreneurship competitions to support more inclusive student development. In addition, it provides recommendations for impact when scaling-up synergies.

AB  - In an attempt to understand the natural world's phenomena, young children form their perceptions of different aspects of the macrocosm, which they contrast with new scientific concepts. This process calls for an early intervention that will provide the stimuli and the tools for the development of new concepts, ideas, and cognitive structures. The purpose of the present article is to present an instructional intervention for young children about the science of celestial bodies, with some reference to the pedagogical content knowledge of astronomy. A concept-based, multidisciplinary approach to developing curriculum activities is adopted and the content of activities places particular emphasis on: (1) Spatial learning and spatial thinking, which are considered as central and fundamental to astronomy education, and (2) the alternation between the Earth-based and space-based perspectives of the shape, position, and movement of celestial bodies.

AB  - International curricular redevelopment and quality improvement efforts include integration within and across disciplines as a focal point. Definitions and applications of the term 'integration' vary routinely in health professions education literature, weakening opportunities to enhance our educational practice through collaborative, interprofessional knowledge-sharing. This systematic review examined recent health professions education literature for reported definitions, theories or frameworks, and educational activities around integrated learning, education, curricula, or teaching. A total of 35 articles representing learners from 12 different health professions, between 2017 and 2021, were analyzed through a literature search of seven databases: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, JSTOR, the Cochrane Library, LGBTQ + Life, and ERIC. Full-text retrieval and data extraction of the included studies were conducted. Of the 35 articles reviewed, 13 included explicit definitions of integration (an additional six alluded to a definition), 19 referred to an educational theory or framework used to guide integration design efforts, and 27 mentioned teaching methods by which integration was implemented. Misunderstanding what is meant by integrated, how others have planned for it, or how others have sought to bring it about practically, all threaten attempts to improve the cultivation of health professionals as integrated thinkers and holistic care providers.

AB  - This mixed methods study investigates student learning outcomes from undergraduate STEM and non-STEM courses, employing farm-situated place-based experiential learning (PBEL) modules at a private liberal arts university in the Midwest. Given that these courses occurred during both COVID-19 and U.S. police brutality protests, this study critically interrogates the influence of this "dual pandemic" on student meaning-making. The study examines how student scores on environmental science literacy, civic-mindedness, sense of place, and scientific reasoning measures changed throughout the PBEL courses. With the exception of scientific reasoning, change in each measure was statistically significant (p<0.001). A stepwise linear regression determined whether any measures predicted civic-mindedness. Environmental science literacy and university place attachment were found to be predictive of civic-mindedness. Focus group data revealed how PBEL modules affected student learning outcomes and how the dual pandemic affected student civic-mindedness and place attachment.

AB  - A fun activity is presented using singing wine glasses for introductory physics students. Students tune a white wine glass and a red wine glass to as many semitones as possible by filling the glasses with the appropriate amounts of water. A smart phone app is used to measure the frequencies of equal-temperament tones. Then plots of frequency against water volume percent are made using a spreadsheet. Students can also play combinations of pitches with several glasses. A video (Ruiz 2018 "Video: Singing glasses" http://mjtruiz.com/ped/wineglasses/) is provided which includes an excerpt of a beautiful piece written for singing glasses and choir: "Stars" by Latvian composer Eriks E≈°envalds.

AB  - The scientific production of digital literacy at the university level published in the Scopus database is analyzed, with a special emphasis on studies on tourism due to the relevance of information and communication technology (ICT) in said professional sector. For this, a bibliometric study of a pertinent sample is undertaken using a mixed methodology and based on a series of variables related to formal and content aspects. The last variable, reserved for the academic field under study, directly addresses the main objective as regards tourism. The results show a great global and multidisciplinary interest in digital literacy (DL), mainly from students. There is also a parallel between the integration of ICT into society and the growing evolution of case studies, as well as little interest in their development in specific areas such as tourism studies. Despite good results in general terms, the lack of specialization poses challenges that require greater involvement of training institutions in the sense of providing future professionals with the necessary tools to face them successfully, especially in sectors such as tourism where ICTs are a key piece.

AB  - A three-course sequence for first-year students that integrates beginning concepts in biology and chemistry has been designed. The first two courses that emphasize chemistry and its capacity to inform biological applications are described here. The content of the first course moves from small to large particles with an emphasis on membrane macrostructures and protein structure. Critical to this progression is an understanding of strong and weak bonding interactions within and between macrostructure subunits. The Boltzmann distribution and Boltzmann entropy are used in the second course to rationalize enthalpy and entropy changes in biochemical reactions and consequences of the second law of thermodynamics. Biochemical processes in the second course include protein folding, hydration, ligand binding to proteins, ATP hydrolysis, protein redox reactions, and enzyme kinetics. Attitude assessment indicated students were overwhelmingly satisfied with the course sequence. Students had a broader view of interdisciplinary science after finishing the sequence compared to their counterparts in the traditional chemistry or biology sequence. For schools that do not have a three-term schedule, integrated biological examples are provided to help strengthen ties between chemistry and biology disciplines. (Contains 2 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - As scientific teams in academia have become increasingly large, interdisciplinary, and diverse, more attention has been paid to honorary authorship (i.e., giving authorship to those not making a significant contribution). Our study examined whether honorary authorship occurs because of the desire to include all or many team members. Interviews with project principal investigators (n = 6) and early-career project members (n = 6) from 6 interdisciplinary environmental science research teams revealed that principal investigators frequently employed inclusion-motivated honorary authorship but that this practice had some negative impacts on early-career team members with less power and status, thereby undermining true inclusion of those from underrepresented groups. We believe our findings are of import not only for environmental scientists, but also for scholars who are interested in issues of authorship decision-making regardless of disciplinary affiliation.

AB  - This paper dialogues with Lucy Avraamidou's theoretical contribution Science Identity as a Landscape of Becoming: Rethinking Recognition and Emotionality through an Intersectionality Lens. Avraamidou discusses the centrality of recognition for science identities, and presents an argument for taking up intersectionality as an analytical lens for recognition. In this response, I review the contributions that Avraamidou's article makes in advancing science identities research, and I then discuss ways of operationalizing intersectionality theory analytically. To illustrate ways that intersectionality can be mobilized to understand how recognition functions in science learning settings, I present examples from science identity researchers who have drawn on various theoretical frameworks to make this possible. I conclude with a discussion of the importance of considering space and time in recognition research, and how this can lead to more meaningful and intersectional research.

AB  - The 2018 STEM Summer Camp was held on the campuses of a middle school in the Southeast. Students from Title I schools across the district were invited to take part in the month-long STEM program, focused on advancing content competency through Mathematics, Science, Language Arts, and STEM (Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics) Inquiry. Program teachers and administrators included pre-service educators who had been teaching 1 year or less, and mentor teachers and administrators who had experience in working with Title I populations. This paper explores the process of organizing a STEM Summer Program engaging students from Title I schools with the goal of bridging the gap between grades to combat summer attrition.

AB  - For many years, lesson study has been woven into the professional lives of Japanese teachers. Recently, it has become more widespread in the U.S. Core elements of Japanese Lesson Study include collaborative lesson design, empirical trials of lessons, collective analysis of empirical trials, and subsequent lesson re-design. We describe how these core elements were implemented in a teacher education project that brought together prospective and practicing secondary-level science and mathematics teachers in interdisciplinary groups facilitated by university faculty members. The four groups described in this report designed and analyzed lessons about attending to scale factor in the context of microscopic images, constructing a geologic timeline, examining states of matter, and building a scale model of the solar system. The Japanese Lesson Study process helped these groups reflect on the nature of the content being taught, pedagogical concerns, and content-specific pedagogy. We found that discursive moves such as connecting separate strands of conversation and identifying mistakes helped facilitate group reflection. A growing body of research suggests that Japanese Lesson Study can be implemented in a wide array of contexts; we encourage others to include it among clinical experiences for prospective teachers because of its potential to give more undergraduates access to the most skilled mentor teachers and to counteract feelings of professional isolation that cause many to leave teaching. We offer our own experiences facilitating lesson study and dealing with challenges along the way to help others start to implement the model in their own professional settings.

AB  - This article presents Culturally Responsive Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (CRPBIS), the first framework to operationalize cultural responsiveness in the context of positive behavioral interventions and supports in the United States (Bal 2011). To develop the CRPBIS framework, the author first conducted a systematic review of literature. Then, the author developed the CRPBIS framework based on the literature review and interdisciplinary literature from cultural psychology, organization studies, learning sciences, critical geography, cultural studies, as well as education research. Finally, to test and refine the framework in practice, a multisite, mixed-methods formative intervention study was conducted in the state of Wisconsin between 2012 and 2015 (Bal et al. 2014, 2016; Bal 2016, 2017; Bal, Afacan, and Cakir 2017; Bal, Afacan, and Clardy 2017).

AB  - STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), one of the mostly emphasized concepts in the world, is a paradigm that creates interdisciplinary learning and provides achievement of the outcomes of science, mathematics, engineering and technology while doing this. This research was carried out to investigate the STEM fields' placement of the top thousand students placed in science and mathematics fields in universities, the Student Selection and Placement Center (√ñSYM) university placement data as a basis. This is a quantitative research and descriptive analysis techniques have been used. In the study, which has examined university placement of 17,135 students, it was determined that as the students' interest in STEM fields decreased between the years 2000-2014, the interest in faculties of medicine increased, that there is a major difference between male and female students in favor of the males, that the students were placed mostly in engineering departments among STEM fields and that placement in education faculties and fundamental sciences was rather low.

AB  - Cemeteries have traditionally been cast as scary and creepy places in children's literature, as well as in popular television shows and movies. Spooky media images, coupled with exaggerated stories from their friends, might leave young learners wary of cemeteries and with feelings of fear and anxiety. Cemeteries are, however, unique community resources that deserve consideration as a teaching tool. A visit to a local cemetery typically does not strain classroom budgets, as it requires minimal travel and can generally be accomplished for free. A trip to a local cemetery offers ample opportunities for teachers to make interdisciplinary connections in their elementary classrooms; cemeteries are "part science, part art, part history." Cemeteries provide students a chance to see, firsthand, how architecture, stonecutting, mortality rates, and even names have changed over time within the local community. A cemetery field trip also can be an introduction to the social studies topics of economics, religion, geography, immigration history, and public health. Integrating mathematics and problem solving into the study of cemetery burial plots helps students gain a deeper understanding of social issues and struggles. Students can practice representing and interpreting data, which is essential in elementary mathematics. In addition, cemeteries provide students with an opportunity to investigate science topics and be actively involved in the process of doing science, essential to the development of scientific literacy. In this article, the authors outline the planning and enactment of field-based activities during a field trip to a cemetery by fourth graders from Blowing Rock, North Carolina. The activities emphasize social studies, science, and math themes to engage and challenge students. (Contains 14 notes.)

AB  - This paper deals with the assessment of the crossdisciplinarity of technology-enhanced learning (TEL). Based on a general discussion of the concept interdisciplinarity and a summary of the discussion in the field, two empirical methods from scientometrics are introduced and applied. Science overlay maps and the Rao-Stirling diversity index are used to analyze the TEL field with a scientometric analysis. The science overlay maps show that a wide variety of disciplines contributes to research in the field. The analysis reveals that the field has been operating on a relatively high level of crossdisciplinarity in the last 10 years compared with six other fields of reference. Only in 2004 a decrease in the level of crossdisciplinarity could be identified.

AB  - This article explores connections between interprofessional education (IPE) models and the design of learning spaces for undergraduate and graduate education in the anatomical sciences and other professional preparation. The authors argue that for IPE models to be successful and sustained they must be embodied in the environment in which interprofessional learning occurs. To elaborate these arguments, two exemplar tertiary education facilities are discussed: the Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney for science education and research, and Victoria University's Interprofessional Clinic in Wyndham for undergraduate IPE in health care. Backed by well-conceived curriculum and pedagogical models, the architectures of these facilities embody the educational visions, methods, and practices they were designed to support. Subsequently, the article discusses the spatial implications of curriculum and pedagogical change in the teaching of the anatomical sciences and explores how architecture might further the development of IPE models in the field. In conclusion, it is argued that learning spaces should be designed and developed (socially) with the expressed intention of supporting collaborative IPE models in health education settings, including those in the anatomical sciences.

AB  - This article sets out to look critically at the use of systematic reviews in the cross-disciplinary field of early childhood and international development. Systematic reviews--a specialist methodology involving the secondary analysis of existing knowledge on a particular topic--is prevalently used to address complex questions in social and health-related policy and is an established tradition in the life and health sciences. In education and the social sciences, there is burgeoning interest in systematic methodological approaches, although its usage remains comparatively lagging compared to the medical field. Drawing on an interdisciplinary systematic review of empirical research on early childhood development and peacebuilding in the Asia Pacific region, this article reflects on the use of the methodology and its potential to inform new conceptual and methodological developments. The article argues that our knowledge of children and the early years can be significantly advanced by furthering debates on systematic reviews particularly in cross-disciplinary fields and its application, as well as relevance for how evidence is evaluated and applied. This is especially pertinent in a sector driven by increasing calls for more reliable and timely information to influence practice and policy decision-making.

AB  - Teamwork and collaboration are twenty-first century skills valued by STEM employers for addressing the most urgent problems in society. To prepare undergraduate STEM students, they must graduate valuing teamwork and collaboration. The Integrated Concentration in STEM (iCons) program aims to meet this goal by utilizing interdisciplinary team-based learning to address complex real-world problems. In doing so, the program provides students with a learning experience that demonstrates the authentic value of teamwork and shows how collaboration can be useful for solving problems. The purpose of this study was to examine whether students who participated in iCons developed more positive values related to teamwork and collaboration than similar students who did not participate in the program. Framed by Expectancy Value Theory (EVT)--specifically the concept of utility value, which is how practically useful students find teams in helping them fulfill their objectives or to solve problems--we investigated the iCons program with a mixed methods design that analyzed survey and interview data from students. Overall, iCons had a positive effect on students' perceptions of the utility value of teamwork and collaboration. Qualitative results helped to explain these findings in more depth, including students' positive perceptions of the interdisciplinary design of the program. Findings suggest that more resources should be put into creating and expanding opportunities in STEM that utilize a combination of pedagogical strategies focused on team-based learning and an interdisciplinary design. Further research is needed to understand these effects in more detail.

AB  - This study investigates and compares the learning trajectories of nine Taiwanese university graduates from a Power Mechanical Engineering (PME) program and nine from a cross-disciplinary Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) program. Participants had received their degrees 4-7¬†years prior to the study. The findings suggest the relative advantages and disadvantages of different models of educational design. Even though PME graduates complained about the abstract nature of what they had learned during the first part of their undergraduate study, most had successfully entered labor markets related to the PME industry, having obtained appropriate knowledge/skills for application in industry from the latter part of the program. While some prioritized their identity as a PME professional, others admitted that they liked the extrinsic reward of a comfortable living best. In contrast, even though most of the HSS graduates admired the generic curriculum of the program, with its transferability from one context to another and its close connection to the real world, and some deeply identified with the core value of being an agent of societal change once they had entered the labor market, many also admitted that it was difficult to find a suitable industry to enter unless they first acquired a Master's degree with higher specificity.

AB  - The Division of Graduate Medical Sciences at the Boston University School of Medicine houses numerous dynamic graduate programs. Doctoral students began their studies with laboratory rotations and classroom training in a variety of fundamental disciplines. Importantly, with 15 unique pathways of admission to these doctoral programs, there were also 15 unique curricula. Departments and programs offered courses independently, and students participated in curricula that were overlapping combinations of these courses. This system created curricula that were not coordinated and that had redundant course content as well as content gaps. A partnership of key stakeholders began a curriculum reform process to completely restructure doctoral education at the Boston University School of Medicine. The key pedagogical goals, objectives, and elements designed into the new curriculum through this reform process created a curriculum designed to foster the interdisciplinary thinking that students are ultimately asked to utilize in their research endeavors. We implemented comprehensive student and peer evaluation of the new Foundations in Biomedical Sciences integrated curriculum to assess the new curriculum. Furthermore, we detail how this process served as a gateway toward creating a more fully integrated graduate experience, under the umbrella of the Program in Biomedical Sciences.

AB  - A new undergraduate program in chemical biology was launched in 2008 to provide a unique learning experience for those students interested in this interdisciplinary science. An innovative undergraduate chemical biology laboratory course at the third-year level was developed as a key component of the curriculum. The laboratory course introduces students to some of the fundamental aspects of chemical biology through a series of integrated, research-based laboratory experiments, which illustrate how different areas of the discipline are interconnected. The 12-week stand-alone laboratory course consists of a weekly 1-h lecture and a 4-h laboratory period. During the course, students synthesize a novel anthraquinone natural product-like compound, purify a protein, and perform both an in vitro and an in vivo biological assay to investigate protein-ligand interactions with these materials. Two iterations of the course have been completed with class sizes of 21 (2010) and 11 (2011) students. Because of the modular nature of the course (i.e., organic, biological, and analytical sections), it is widely applicable to a range of upper-level chemistry, biology, molecular biology, and biochemistry undergraduate courses.

AB  - The study discussed in this article sought to identify cross-program professional development needs of county-based Extension professionals (field educators). The study instrument was completed by 105 county-based Extension professionals. Interdisciplinary topics, such as program evaluation and volunteer management, were identified as subjects of needed professional development for the Extension professionals whose sole program area was Economic and Community Development. Extension professionals in both the Agriculture and Natural Resources and the Health and Human Sciences program areas tended not to identify topics from each other's program areas as subjects of needed professional development.

AB  - Teachers' knowledge of STEM education, their understanding, and pedagogical application of that knowledge is intrinsically linked to the subsequent effectiveness of STEM delivery within their own practice; where a teacher's knowledge and understanding is deficient, the potential for pupil learning is ineffective and limited. Set within the context of secondary age phase education in England and Wales (11-16¬†years old), this paper explores how teachers working within the field of design and technology education acquire new knowledge in STEM; how understanding is developed and subsequently embedded within their practice to support the creation of a diverse STEM-literate society. The purpose being to determine mechanisms by which knowledge acquisition occurs, to reconnoitre potential implications for education and learning at work, including consideration of the role which new technologies play in the development of STEM knowledge within and across contributory STEM subject disciplines. Underpinned by an interpretivist ontology, work presented here builds upon the premise that design and technology is an interdisciplinary educational construct and not viewed as being of equal status to other STEM disciplines including maths and science. Drawing upon the philosophical field of symbolic interactionism and constructivist grounded theory, work embraces an abductive methodology where participants are encouraged to relate design and technology within the context of STEM education. Emergent findings are discussed in relation to their potential to support teachers' educational development for the advancement of STEM literacy, and help secure design and technology's place as a subject of value within a twenty-first Century curriculum.

AB  - This study investigates early childhood teachers' views about science teaching practices in an early childhood settings. It was conducted in a preschool located in Ankara, Turkey. The data of the study were collected through multiple sources of information such as interviews with early childhood teachers and observations of their practices in the classroom. The findings of this study indicated that early childhood teachers believed in the importance of science activities in their practices and they claimed that they provided child-centred activities for children to enrich their science experiences. Moreover, the findings showed that they used different learning experiences that were naturalistic, informal, and structured. The findings also revealed that an integrated curriculum improved children's developmental progress. More specifically, participant teachers used art as an assessment tool in science activities because they considered that they were able to evaluate children's understanding on the basis of their art work such as their drawings.

AB  - New educational standards implementation prioritizes the projective beginning of training in school education. Therefore, consideration of educational activity only as the process of obtaining ready knowledge should be abandoned. Thus the relevance of the studied problem is substantiated by the need to develop methodical works connected with the introduction of inter-subject projects into mathematics teachers' pedagogical activity as mathematics has a wide application in various sciences, though, at lessons, it is left behind due to time limits and insufficient mathematical apparatus school students possess. All that said specifies the goal of the paper: to define opportunities of project-based activity application in integration of mathematical and natural-science disciplines and development of methodical recommendations on its broad application in the course of training in the subject. The key research method of this problem is modeling the system of possible project-based activity directions aimed to work purposefully to increase results in subject studied as well as to develop meta-subject abilities. The paper proves the necessity to apply project-based technology in the form of inter-subject projects on mathematics; the basic models of school disciplines integration in the context of project-based learning opportunities realization are revealed; project themes of integrated disciplines that differ in time periods, volume and quantity are elaborated; features of their use in the course of studying mathematics are identified. Practical application of this system compensates the lack of tools of meta-subject technologies in pedagogical activity as it demands the ability to work in team, communicative skills, tolerance, self-organization, abilities to set goals independently, to achieve them and to analyze obtained results.

AB  - In the last decade, the term STEM has been increasingly picked up internationally and come to represent a solution to a range of issues. Within education, STEM is being translated as a curriculum organiser that has the possibility of engaging and retaining students and is interdisciplinary and skills focussed. This paper takes the STEM curriculum as its focus and investigates the influences that have resulted in the current interpretation of STEM as well as the epistemological questions, tensions and issues that this curriculum raises. The paper does this through a consideration of previous and current curriculum movements and debates and in doing so raises questions about the underlying assumptions, form and focus that STEM curriculum take before considering some possible future directions.

AB  - On Monday, August 21, 2017 there will be a Total Solar Eclipse. This will be the first time the Moon's umbra has touched the continental United States since 1979 and the first totality to span the country coast-to-coast since 1918. From within parts of Oregon and through 14 states to South Carolina, the Moon will completely hide the Sun for a few brief moments, turning daytime to an eerie kind of near-twilight, where the Sun's ghostly corona, bright stars and planets, and other phenomena associated with total eclipses become fleetingly visible. Every part of the country will see at least a partial eclipse. This eclipse offers a chance for virtually every elementary teacher in the United States to participate in a rare and special teaching opportunity. It also allows educators to enhance their science instruction while increasing the level of science literacy in their classrooms by employing a cross-content approach. This article examines how to derive the greatest level of literacy from the eclipse via interdisciplinary lessons.

AB  - An interdisciplinary curriculum unit that used Web GIS mapping to investigate malaria disease patterns and spread in relation to the environment for a high school Advanced Placement Environmental Science course was developed. A feasibility study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of the unit to promote geospatial thinking and reasoning skills and content understandings. Results revealed increased content understandings and significant effect sizes for all three geospatial thinking and reasoning subscales--inferences, relationships, and reasoning. The findings provide support that Web GIS, with appropriate curriculum design can improve both learning outcomes and geospatial thinking and reasoning skills.

AB  - Entrepreneurship brings several benefits, such as fostering innovation and productivity, competitiveness, and socioeconomic development. The search for professionals with different skills to overcome the current and foreseen challenges is relevant in the agri-food sector. Problem-based learning (PBL) is described as an instructional approach, which promotes interdisciplinarity and critical thinking, with the potential to meet current challenges. This article describes how PBL, aligned with an innovation program and contest, has been integrated into a master's degree in food engineering to promote academic entrepreneurship. The alignment of the PBL with the program and contest allowed the development of innovative products with a view to solving problems faced by the agri-food sector. The PBL strategy allowed students to mobilize knowledge from several curricular units of food studies for the development of different deliverables to participate in the innovation program and contest. This participation allowed students, supported by business mentors, to demonstrate their products to stakeholders. This way, it was possible to promote innovation in the agri-food sector, stimulating the entrepreneurial spirit among higher education students, and understand its potential for replication and mobilization of skills acquired in different food study courses.

AB  - A common recommendation in critiques of datafication in education is for greater conversation between the two sides of the (critical) divide -- what might be characterised as sceptical social scientists and (supposedly) more technically-minded and enthusiastic data scientists. This article takes the form of a dialogue between two academics representing these different perspectives -- Dragan Gasevic (a data scientist who is one of the founders of the 'learning analytics' field) and Neil Selwyn (a social scientist and long-time critic of educational technology). Over the course of a six-month email exchange, we explore various arguments for and against the datafication of higher education. Thus, we are able to add a computational dimension to well-worn social criticisms of data representativeness, reductionism and injustice, as well as exploring social tensions inherent in technical claims to data-based precision, clarity and predictability. Crucially, these exchanges allow us to explore ways in which our two viewpoints converge, and therefore highlight opportunities for productive inter-disciplinary exchange and collaboration.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research networks are increasing, with professionals encouraged to undertake research across disciplines to increase innovation, creativity and knowledge. More recently, this interdisciplinary focus is being mirrored by the establishment of interdisciplinary doctoral research networks. But do these networks work? And if so, how and why? We employ social capital theory to (a) understand the lived experiences of students in interdisciplinary doctoral programmes and (b) build programme design theory to support the development of social capital within such programmes. We present the results of 28 semi-structured interviews conducted with doctoral students from three European Union funded interdisciplinary research training networks to understand how they perceive the enhancers, inhibitors and manifestations of social capital within their networks. Key themes revolve around 'extracting value from the interdisciplinary process', 'motivating students throughout the interdisciplinary programme journey', and 'relating to others both within and external to the programme'. We propose a framework for interdisciplinary programme design.

AB  - Overlooking the Lake of Zurich, Switzerland, the team of "Sustainability Communication" at the Institute of Natural Resource Sciences, Zurich University of Applied Sciences, is exploring new possibilities of comprehensive and sustainable communication and teaching methods. Using narrative environments as working tools to promote sustainability, we have created an outdoor experience and learning environment for students and visitors to discover how grasses have changed the world and how this relates to sustainable food production today. This paper presents a learning experience in "Gr√§serland" (World of Grasses) and gives insights into how the combination of art and science communication can emotionally involve visitors, which can result in behavioral changes. Creating complex, narrative spaces to engage with our audience has created new ways of knowledge production, science communication and has gotten people to care. An effectiveness analysis has proven to be fruitful in tracking visitor's insights and long-term learning outcomes, while enhancing their learning experience.

AB  - In this research-based experiment, students are introduced to the interdisciplinary field of archaeological chemistry by extracting and analyzing lipid residues absorbed in pottery. Reproduction archaeological pottery sherds are prepared by soaking ceramic fragments in individual or combinations of vegetable oils. Students crush and extract the absorbed residues, transesterify the recovered lipids to fatty acid methyl esters, and analyze the product by GC or GC/MS. Recovered residues are characterized by analysis of the major fatty acid peaks, as identified using reference standards or mass spectral databases. An archaeological context that links the sherds to the Minoan civilization is provided to students and must be considered to correctly identify the absorbed residue(s). The laboratory has been used in a topical archaeological instrumentation course that has attracted second to fourth year students majoring in chemistry, biochemistry, and anthropology, and museum studies minors. Pedagogically, the laboratory introduces students to techniques currently used in the field of archaeological chemistry while reinforcing fundamental concepts in sample isolation and preparation, derivatization, gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and multicomponent sample analysis.

AB  - The First Year Seminar in Science (SCIE113) was developed during 2009/2010 academic year through an exemplary collaboration between faculty, administrators and educational support staff in the Faculty of Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC). SCIE113 reflects the vision and values of the Faculty of Science and UBC by offering an enriched educational experience to its first year students. The small class format provides students an intimate connection with faculty, an opportunity for significant engagement early in their academic careers, and helps with transitioning to the university environment. The overall goal of SCIE113 is to introduce skills that cross disciplinary boundaries and that every scientist and student in science must master: how to constructively build an evidence-based argument and how to communicate effectively. The overarching course goals are to define and discuss the elements of a scientific approach, to think like a scientist, and to communicate science through writing. SCIE113 fosters the development of authentic scientific scholars through the construction, integration, and use of argumentation skills and through an exploration of science as a way of knowing using a collaborative class environment. SCIE113 engages students in interactive and collaborative activities and promotes learning of scientific argumentation and writing skills. In-class and out-of-class activities allow students to frequently discuss, debate, and defend their views of science. Specific learning activities such as case studies, targeted readings, and examinations of media and scientific articles allow students to evaluate the validity of scientific claims and to construct a scientific argument. Meanwhile, activities such as reflections, in-class writing, peer review, and discussions on the fundamentals of writing help students to improve their writing skills which are assessed by three short essays and a term project. The guided peer review process, which fosters collaboration, enables students to provide expert-like feedback to their peers. Faculty and TA feedback completes the review process. SCIE113 is an exemplary model of collaboration and is guided by best practices in instructional design. SCIE113 is a model of collaborative course design and instruction with a large, multidisciplinary teaching team. The design of SCIE113 is guided by best practices and continues to evolve in response to emerging research. The teaching team consists of faculty and teaching assistants from 14 different departments, representing four Faculties, with a wide range of expertise and experience in fostering student learning. The teaching team meets bi-weekly to cultivate reflective practice and to support faculty in their professional development for teaching this writing intensive course. SCIE113 is informed by the scholarship of teaching and learning. SCIE113 is informed by comprehensive research that is incorporated into course design and implementation and utilizes validated assessment tools. Frequent feedback from students and faculty, and measures of perceived and actual learning gains, ensure successful course implementation and promote student learning.

AB  - In recent years, citizen science projects have emerged as a means to involve students in scientific inquiry, particularly in the fields of ecology and environmental science. A citizen scientist is "a volunteer who collects and/or processes data as part of a scientific inquiry" (Silverton 2009, p. 467). Participation in citizen science fosters an appreciation for the diversity of scientific fields (i.e., conservation biology, ornithology). The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports citizen science projects as a means to recruit future generations into the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines by directly involving students in scientific research. Teachers have expanded citizen science projects to include not only gathering and analyzing data but also civic participation and action (Zaikowski and Lichtman 2007; Ryken et al. 2008). This effectively merges hard sciences with social sciences. In this article, the authors present the multidisciplinary Project Citizen approach to teaching and learning science and engaging students in action-oriented citizen science. Project Citizen, a curricular program administered by a national network of coordinators in every state, promotes competent and responsible civic participation by giving students a vehicle to influence and monitor public policy (Center for Civic Education 2009). High school teachers can adapt Project Citizen as an approach for teaching a variety of subject areas. English teachers can use Project Citizen to emphasize speech and writing skills; social studies teachers can emphasize civic ideas and practices; and mathematics and science teachers can focus on analytical thinking and scientific inquiry.

AB  - The integration of innovative interdisciplinary approaches to the ?-12 Curriculum aims to deepen students' knowledge and help them develop transversal skills. Applying an interdisciplinary lens, with a focus on pandemics, can help shape attitudes by means of inculcating the values of responsible global citizenship, and a high sense of personal and social responsibility. In the midst of the current lock-down due to Covid-19, a teaching approach to pandemics is presented, as an interdisciplinary connection between history and mathematics, based on the methodology of modeling in mathematics and the humanities. The main research questions posed: a) can modeling, as analyzed in the scientific literature, be used to interpret pandemics, e.g. in the case of the 'plague of Athens' (430 B.C.), as analyzed in the primary sources? b) Can the mathematical tools of statistical analysis be used to understand prevention measures through the centuries? Taking a longue dur√©e perspective on history, students were asked to work on additional cases of pandemics across time and space, mobilizing both their mathematical and historical knowledge: process numerical data from primary sources, study maps, combine and compare elements of the past and the present using mathematical epidemiological models and real numerical data to study and predict the spread of infectious diseases. This paper presents the assessment of the effectiveness of this approach, conducted by means of closed and open questionnaires, administered in two phases (pre- and post-teaching) to a sample of 40 students aged 16-17 years. The results highlight statistics as a key tool for understanding real-world situations, and record the strengthening of students' knowledge in history, the raising of their critical thinking skills, as well as their enhanced ability to tackle real-world problems and understand responsible decision-making processes. Finally, the paper suggests that such good practices can prepare students for the complexity of globalized knowledge. [For the full proceedings, see ED626375.]

AB  - CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) has been one of the major innovations that has been implemented in Spain in the last decades and many questions have arisen in relation to its effectiveness. The aim of this article is to report primary teachers' perceptions of the most relevant aspects of CLIL teaching of Science and Social Science in Primary Education in the Region of Murcia. Their perceptions of this integrated approach are crucial to meet their needs, coordinate their efforts and develop good practice. Results from this research emphasize an extensive application of CLIL methodological guidelines and the use of a wide range of tools when evaluating learners' competences. Additionally, they have expressed their satisfaction with language assistants when motivating pupils and fostering their oral skills and intercultural awareness. However, CLIL teachers believe Public Administration should provide more resources, further training and enhanced coordination to improve the quality of education under this paradigm.

AB  - Background: Personalized learning (PL), conceptualized as an education innovation that tailors learning to meet diverse student needs, has drawn increased attention from different fields of study, such as education, learning sciences, and computer science. Regardless, there is a lack of a comprehensive understanding of PL instructional designs supported by technology. Objectives: This systematic literature review aimed to provide an empirical integration of PL designs and implementation across disciplines through the lens of the universal design for learning (UDL) framework. As an instructional framework that guides the design to embrace learner variability, UDL holds the potential to provide foundational considerations for instructional design components of PL. Methods: We used four databases including ERIC, OmniFile Full Text Select, Academic Search Complete, and Web of Science to search empirical studies investigating technology-supported PL in PK-12 school-based settings. In total, 61 studies published between 2006 and 2020 were included in the review. We analysed PL design and implementation features and aligned these features to the UDL framework. Results and Conclusions: Our results indicated that current empirical PL design features were widely mapped onto the UDL framework. Most current PL studies investigated segmented aspects such as student attributes (e.g., interest, motivation, self-regulation) and instructional practices (e.g., facilitating goal setting) that could contribute to PL design. Rarely did studies investigate how PL was operationalized in a system integrating various design components that consider learner characteristics, instructional support, and contextual implementation factors. Implications: The analysis of alignment between PL designs within the UDL framework can serve as a starting point for stakeholders to take a more holistic approach to designing PL experiences for all learners.

AB  - Interprofessional education (IPE)--students of different professions learning together, from and about each other--is increasingly common in health professional degrees. Despite its explicit aims of transforming identities, practices and relationships within/across health professions, IPE remains under-theorised sociologically, with most IPE scholarship focussed on evaluating specific interventions. In particular, the significance of a shared knowledge base for shaping professional power and subjectivity in IPE has been overlooked. In this paper we begin to develop a framework for theorising IPE in allied health, by drawing parallels with a cognate area in which there has already been fruitful conceptual development: interdisciplinarity. Specifically, we offer a worked example of how the two areas may be brought into dialogue, by deploying Barry, Born and Weszkalnys' (2008) conceptualisation of interdisciplinarity as a lens for understanding IPE. Following Barry et al. (2008) we delineate a number of "modes" and "logics" of knowledge-production that emerge both in IPE literature and in our own empirical study of IPE. Our empirical data are drawn from 32 semi-structured interviews with 19 allied health students participating in an IPE curriculum at one Australian university. Findings point to the emergence of interprofessional practitioner identities among students that have the potential to undermine traditional epistemological boundaries and transcend role-based distinctions in future health profession(al)s. We argue that Barry et al.'s "logic of ontology" sheds light on previously unidentified processes of transformation within IPE, and offers a theoretical framework that can explain the importance of a shared pan-professional knowledge base for the reflexive individual construction of new interprofessional ontological subjects.

AB  - Course-integrated Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) involve large numbers of students in real research. We describe a late-year microbiology CURE in which students use yeast to address a research question around beer brewing or synthesizing biofuel; the interdisciplinary student-designed project incorporates genetics, bioinformatics, biochemistry, analytical chemistry, and microbiology. Students perceived significant learning gains around multiple technical and "becoming a scientist" aspects of the project. The project is demanding for both the students and the academic implementers. We examine the rich landscape of support and interaction that this CURE both encourages and requires while also considering how we can support the exercise better and more sustainably. The findings from this study provide a picture of a CURE implementation that has begun to reach the limits of both the students' and the academics' capacities to complete it.

AB  - One challenge of teaching chemical analysis is the proliferation of sophisticated, but often impenetrable, instrumentation in the modern laboratory. Complex instruments, and the software that runs them, distance students from the physical and chemical processes that generate the analytical signal. A solution to this challenge is the introduction of a student-driven instrument-building project. Visible absorbance spectroscopy is well-suited to such a project due to its relative simplicity and the ubiquity of absorbance measurements. This Article reviews simple instructor- and student-built instruments for spectroscopy, providing an overview of common designs, components, and applications. This comprehensive summary includes options that are suitable for in-person or remote learning with K-12 students and undergraduates in general chemistry, analytical chemistry, instrumental analysis, and electronics courses.

AB  - The development of the liaison model in academic libraries has had important implications for the relationship between librarians and teaching faculty members. Modes of outreach to departments are conditioned by a variety of factors, and can have a profound effect on the library's image on campus. This case study describes and analyzes programming implemented at an academic library to position the library as a forum for interdisciplinary exchange on campus and as a platform for faculty research. This programming, conceived primarily as a series of speaker events, was created with an emphasis on research in the humanities and lettered social sciences in an effort to raise the profile of these disciplines at the library on a campus with an extensive focus on STEM fields. By partnering with these departments in order to create speaker-centric, discussion-focused programming, the library built relationships and fulfilled its responsibility to promote academic engagement.

AB  - Most middle and high school students struggle with reading and writing in science. This may be because science teachers are reluctant to teach literacy in science class. New standards now require a shift in the way science teachers develop students' literacy in science. This survey study examined the extent to which science teachers report implementing science literacy practices from the Common Core Literacy in Science and Technical Subjects and the Next Generation Science Standards with their students. A survey detailing these practices was emailed to all secondary science teachers (N¬†=¬†2519) in one northeastern state and 14% of them (n¬†=¬†343) responded. Practices that aligned more closely with disciplinary literacy skills and strategies were implemented more often when compared to the practices aligned with intermediate literacy skills and strategies. Since the development and intermediate skills are important to support students' literacy progression from foundational to disciplinary, secondary science teachers may not be providing enough support for their students to be competently literate in science, in a fundamental literacy sense. This, in turn, impacts students' ability to use fundamental literacy skills toward knowledge-building in science, achieving a derived sense of science literacy.

AB  - This article attempts to realize the dominant approach in developing the academic curriculum of language degree and French literature in Iran. It concentrates on analyzing the content of the curriculum approved by the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology in Iran and the University of Tehran. It was concluded that the first curriculum opts an approach of broad areas by considering the isolated components of language learning. It encompasses the literature of each century. Yet, Tehran University has sought to review the curriculum of Bachelor degree in 2011. With regard to the course of the general French, curriculum decisions are influenced by the corporation, specifically by French companies (under the influence of the action-oriented perspectives in language teaching). In these courses, the approach is based on the general areas. The courses in French literature are based on learning objects and are part of a multidisciplinary approach.

AB  - In this paper, we trace selected strands of the German path to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). We start by addressing pre-ESD research, and move to the concept of "Gestaltungskompetenz," the core concept of German ESD. The concept had to be realigned as to become more compatible with international research on learning outcomes (competencies). Compared to its beginnings, the meaning of "Gestaltungskompetenz" has much advanced, e.g., influenced by German competence research in science education, to which the G√∂ttingen Model for socioscientific reasoning and decision making contributes. The paper presents a new competence dimension on "Evaluating and reflecting solutions quantitatively-economically" for this model. The contribution highlights the integrative and interdisciplinary scope of the educational challenges posed by Sustainable Development.

AB  - Education for sustainable development (ESD) provides crucial opportunities for young people to be involved in complex sustainability issues. This study contributes to existing knowledge about primary school teachers' approaches to ESD across a range of subjects. Norwegian schools can join the Sustainable Backpack programme (SBP), which supports teachers to develop projects that promote a holistic understanding of sustainable development across school subjects. The presentstudy set out to examines teachers' interdisciplinary approach to ESD and the SBP teachers' perceptions of how their curriculum units promote environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainable development. The study is a multi-case study, with curriculum units designed for students aged 10-13 years from 14 Norwegian schools. Content analysis suggest that the units used several subjects to ESD, but the teachers could have challenged the students' reflection to a greater extent in terms of argumentation and critical thinking. The units succeeded to some extent in pursuing a holistic approach.

AB  - This paper reports on an innovative Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programme which addressed transition issues and issues with conducting outdoor work and attitudes towards science through 'Shared Learning' days between elementary and middle school transition classes. Teachers supported each other to overcome issues with conducting outdoor work and contributed their expertise from their educational stage. The project utilised a blended CPD approach of workshops, coteaching and in-class support and was based upon a wealth earlier successful CPD programmes to result in a sound theoretical framework. The outcomes were measured using a thorough mixed-methods approach. This paper will report on the achieved outcomes with effective outdoor learning as the vehicle to overcome identified issues and key challenges for policy development.

AB  - We present a novel assessment tool for measuring biology students' values and experiences across their undergraduate degree program. Our Survey of Teaching Beliefs and Practices for Undergraduates (STEP-U) assesses the extent to which students value skills needed for the workplace (e.g., ability to work in groups) and their experiences with teaching practices purported to promote such skills (e.g., group work). The survey was validated through factor analyses in a large sample of biology seniors (n = 1389) and through response process analyses (five interviewees). The STEP-U skills items were characterized by two underlying factors: retention (e.g., memorization) and transfer (e.g., knowledge application). Multiple linear regression models were used to examine relationships between classroom experiences, values, and student characteristics (e.g., gender, cumulative grade point average [GPA], and research experience). Student demographic and experiential factors predicted the extent to which students valued particular skills. Students with lower GPAs valued retention skills more than those with higher GPAs. Students with research experience placed greater value on scientific writing and interdisciplinary understanding. Greater experience with specific teaching practices was associated with valuing the corresponding skills more highly. The STEP-U can provide feedback vital for designing curricula that better prepare students for their intended postgraduate careers.

AB  - Collaboration plays a major role in interdisciplinary activities among Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics (STEM) disciplines or fields. It also affects the relationships among cluster members on the management team. Although effective collaboration does not guarantee success among STEM disciplines, its absence usually assures problems. More specifically, collaboration has the obvious roles of identifying talents coming together for a common purpose of combining knowledge and sharing responsibility, creativity, and experience of others. Facilitating collaboration across Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields in program development is critical to providing a strong educational foundation to all learners in STEM education. This synergistic effort among educators and other professionals across the STEM fields will enable effective knowledge sharing in program development. This paper addresses leadership and knowledge sharing among collaborators in STEM program development through facilitating collaboration across STEM field.

AB  - This study aims to present the views of teacher candidates about the use of Land Art in geographical education, which is an aesthetic application of spatial knowledge. The main reasons for the birth of this research relate to the lack of studies conducted on the use of Land Art practices in the educational environment, together with the idea that its use will contribute to geographical education. In the 2018-2019 academic year, during Spring semester, 23 teacher candidates participated in the study. This working group took the second-grade mountain-geography elective course for a Social Studies teaching program at a Faculty of Education in a Turkish university. This research, in which teacher candidates worked in five separate groups to create a land art product, was conducted in the field at Nigde Aladaglar National Park-Emli Valley. At the end of the fieldwork, opinions of the teacher candidates about the land art activity were obtained through inviting their responses to an open-ended questionnaire. Descriptive analysis of the survey data reveals five separate categories including: 'the status of participant knowledge about land art'; 'land art, and formats able to make us of land art in the teaching of Geography in Social Studies'; 'association of art with other disciplines'; 'contribution of Land Art to the teaching of Geography in Social Studies'; and 'Land Art that participants choose as an activity in their professional lives outside of school'. At the end of the field applications, each group filled out the Land Art Product Evaluation Form as the second data collection tool of the research. In the study, it was found that teacher candidates associated Land Art activities with nine courses: Geography; Art and aesthetics; History; Science; Anthropology; Social Studies; Sociology; Archaeology; and Philosophy. At the end of the study, it was observed that all teacher candidates would prefer Land Art activities in their professional lives for various reasons. such as providing permanent learning, providing a fun learning environment, and making the student an active and willing learner.

AB  - Given the current emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education and its key attributes, middle school is an optimal time to implement STEM-based curricula. However, the interdisciplinary and open-ended nature of STEM projects often makes implementation difficult. In this article, we describe a professional development project aimed at preparing middle grades teachers to implement STEM Design Challenges with their students. We discuss the resources that supported project teachers in navigating identified implementation challenges and provide an example of a sixth-grade team's efforts to engage all learners in STEM experiences. Recommendations and examples in this article can support other middle school teams working to enact STEM education.

AB  - Knacktive is a one-term course that incorporates a highly select group of undergraduate students and replicates the intense teamwork atmosphere of a technology-oriented, professional marketing communication agency. As an interdisciplinary learning opportunity, Knacktive melds students from five disciplines--including art and graphic design, interactive digital media and computer science, public relations, journalism and media studies, and marketing and business management--into an interactive, team-based course facilitated by five faculty members representing the disciplines. Although other college-level student agencies exist, many are staffed by students from only one discipline. Utilizing active research methodology, faculty reflections resulted in course changes that significantly improved course functionality. Student achievements included client implementation of many of the student team-developed concepts and promotional materials. Student reflections collectively viewed the agency-like process as a "brutal" but rewarding experience. The students also noted that the experience helped develop more professional attitudes about meetings, deadlines, interpersonal communications, collegiality, teamwork, and problem solving skills.

AB  - Despite gains over the last decade, the geoscience student population in the United States today continues to lag other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines in terms of diversity. Minority-serving institutions (MSIs) can play an important role in efforts to broaden underrepresented student engagement with Earth Science content, especially in collaborations with other institutions and organizations that allow MSIs to share their expertise. Knowing which MSIs have Earth-related degree programs can help facilitate such collaboration. This commentary describes an effort to find and raise the visibility of these programs. In 2013, the abundance of geoscience departments at MSIs was roughly half that seen in U.S. higher-education institutions. Yet we found that nearly a third of MSIs offered one or more Earth-related degree programs. In addition, more than half of the academic units offering Earth-related degrees were interdisciplinary rather than traditional geoscience departments. It is clear that students are learning about the Earth in a wider variety of places than geology programs. These programs could provide models for supporting diverse students in the geosciences, as well as sites for potential collaborations aimed at further increasing the diversity of the geoscience workforce.

AB  - Many arts-focused colleges and universities in the United States offer their undergraduate students coursework in science. To better understand the delivery of science education at this type of institution, this article surveys the science programs of forty-one arts-oriented schools. The findings suggest that most science programs are located in general education departments alongside other liberal arts disciplines, and at most of the schools students are required to complete at least one science course. The findings also suggest that the context of science education at arts-focused colleges may encourage innovation in pedagogy and curriculum development. This article highlights courses and assignments from Emerson College and other schools in which scientific topics are aligned with arts fields or framed to emphasize the societal relevance of science and its place in our daily lives.

AB  - This paper attempted to outline the interdisciplinary and broad path of well-being until it became a goal in the Learning Compass. The work paid special attention to positive psychology because they agreed that its insights need to be translated into positive pedagogy for the well-being of learners. So, it offers a collection and comparison of the main well-being concepts from different disciplines connected to the learning environment's psychological pedagogical, social, and economic aspects, using the systematic literature review as methodology. The paper also focuses on examples of studies of the concept of well-being, narrowing step by step to the psychological, especially the social and the subjective well-being concepts. It is proven that student well-being is closely linked to the well-being of teachers, and therefore supporting the /subjective/psychological, and professional/well-being of teachers is essential for the quality learning-teaching process and for achieving the 2030 target summarized in the Learning Compass.

AB  - STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics) education is gaining popularity in schools across the United States and in parts of Europe, Asia, and Australia. Despite its popularity little empirical data exists to guide effective instructional practices, and even less is known about the challenges associated with instruction. Drawing on results of a qualitative longitudinal study, this article presents findings regarding instructional challenges faced by 33 math and science teachers when implementing STEAM units in their classrooms during intensive yearlong professional development. Challenges included pacing/time, student understanding of content and process, issues relating to planning, and concerns about school district policies. Two other challenges that were less frequent, but still notable, included technology integration and issues related to assessment. The article concludes with implications for educational researchers and educators to consider when planning effective STEAM instruction.

AB  - Over the past decades, Public Administration (PA) education programmes in Europe shifted their focus from a predominantly law-oriented approach to a more multidisciplinary, social science and managerial one. This paper deals with the tenacity of traditional, law-oriented PA education programmes that can be found in a limited, but not insignificant, range of countries throughout Europe. The paper has two aims. Firstly, it attempts to test hypotheses which seek to explain this tenacity. Secondly, it wishes to examine the extent to which this tenacity is related to new forms and paradigms of government emerging in certain Central and Eastern European countries, sometimes referred to as "illiberal democracy". The method is a two-case comparative study of Germany and Hungary. [The page range (205-224) displayed on the publisher's website is incorrect. The correct page range is 206-224.]

AB  - The authors sought to better approximate the practice of "real" science in our classrooms by having students study a newly built storm-water remediation wetland on campus. The wetland was meant to gather and clean storm water running off of student parking lots--thus students had ownership in the problem and potential solution. Participating faculty members in the biology, chemistry, geography, and geology departments created learning modules to introduce students to industry-standard techniques, scientific research skills, and the structure and functioning of wetlands. Most modules had opportunities for student-driven inquiry; for instance, students identified what aspects of the wetland were most important and poorly known and designed projects to fill those data gaps. Students, faculty, and a keynote speaker convened yearly at a Wetland Forum to exchange data and experiences. The project was assessed with pre/post-testing of student perceptions and learning outcomes. (Contains 2 figures and 5 tables.)

AB  - This study was a case study in which the results based on a specific case were analyzed and holistically described (Yildirim & Simsek, 2008). 15 middle school mathematics teachers took part in the present study. The participants were voluntary, and they were selected randomly. As data collection instrument, the researchers developed a semi-structured interview form including 5 open-ended questions. The gathered data were analyzed and reported through content analysis method. The results of the study showed that there was a consensus among teachers about interdisciplinary approach and integrating technology in mathematics instruction. Besides, it was revealed that the teachers were not knowledgeable about and trained on how to use technology and how to integrate science in mathematics instruction. The teachers agreed that regarding the integration of science and technology, mathematics curriculum was suitable and sufficient for the time required and for the topics involved. Based on the results of the study, it can be suggested that teachers be trained through pre-service and in-service integration programmes for the integration of science and technology in mathematics instruction.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of how lecturers respond to students with disabilities, the initial question being: do lecturers aid or hinder students? Findings pertain to a broader research project being developed by a multidisciplinary team employing a non-usual research methodology in higher education (HE) research and students with disabilities: biographical-narrative methodology. The general aim is to analyse--by listening to the students themselves--barriers and support identified as affecting access, academic performance and overall perception of the HE experience. The present paper analyses lecturer-centered data to focus specifically on one of the objectives of our research project: the role that lecturers play in the inclusive education of students with disabilities. Unlike other international research, this article explores the barriers and support differentiating between five fields of knowledge: health sciences, experimental sciences, social sciences (law and education), engineering and technology and humanities. Findings are organized in four topic areas: lecturer attitudes, practices in the classroom, curricular adaptations and faculty training. Key findings are discussed in the conclusions section, together with a discussion of contributions made by earlier studies.

AB  - This paper explores the role and history of systems theory and thinking in the fields of instructional/educational technology and design. The foundations of ID/ET as fields are rich in behavioral, systematic, and positivist notions of process, but we assert that it is weaker in the reflective, thoughtful, deep and meaningful orientations. Woven into the history of the role of systems in ID/ET are connections to constructivism, learning sciences, qualitative research, holistic ontological and epistemic philosophy as foundations to the impact of systems theories on our field. Understanding systems theory histories without the broader contexts of the other similarly focused and highly influential movements in educational change keeps the perceptions within the field as unidimensional. A more complete and textured analysis of the history of systems theory and thinking is offered through the interdisciplinary lens of intersective, but heretofore rarely integrated, perspectives on related disciplines and their force upon the implementation of systems thinking and theories in our field. The ultimate assertion here is to push the envelope of the history of our field toward interpretive or anti-positivist boundaries.Our purpose in this paper, however, goes beyond just history. While historical perspective is useful and important in and of itself, we are interested in a different kind of generativity. Specifically, we wish to begin to explore the edges of where we might go next. Ideally, the proper integration of systems theory within ID/ET can gradually move us toward anti-positivist approaches which we believe will then lead us out of the philosophical desert toward a form of ID/ET for human flourishing and profound living. With the foundations and backdrops of the history of systems theories including those mentioned above, we believe that the intellectual history can then feed a synthetic activity and a potential new direction. We believe that the recent work in profound learning can offer a new direction where we can see beyond our current milieu. We assert that Educational Technology, Instructional Design, Learning Sciences are all in a bit of a philosophical desert at present. A potential endpoint in profound learning and living can help to inform and expand the broader sense of systems thinking. This paper adds significantly to the theoretical discussions of systems theory and thinking.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a fundamental skill and an analytical ability that children in the twenty-first century should develop. Students should begin to work with algorithmic problem-solving and computational methods in K-12. Drawing on a conceptual framework (IGGIA) that combines CT and problem-solving, this study designed and implemented an interdisciplinary Scratch course in a primary school, examined the impact of the new problem-solving instructional approach (the adapted IGGIA) on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy, and¬†explored the gender differences in these two aspects. A pretest-posttest nonequivalent group design was conducted among 63 fifth-grade students in two computer science classes over 14¬†weeks. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected through the administration of CT scales, Scratch artifacts analysis and focus group interviews. The results revealed that the adapted IGGIA: (1) significantly improved the CT skills of primary school students; (2) had a significant positive impact on pupils' CT self-efficacy, especially on their critical thinking, algorithmic thinking and problem-solving; and (3) significantly enhanced girls' CT skills and self-efficacy. These findings indicated that problem-solving instructional approaches could promote both cognitive and noncognitive aspects of students' deeper computational learning.

AB  - First-Year Seminars (FYS) offer a unique mode of introducing college students to new topics, research practices, and approaches to learning that they may not have been exposed to in high school. In this article, we outline the successes and challenges of team teaching a combined cultural anthropology and biochemistry course on the topic of blood, an aspect of our everyday lives that is both vital and hidden. Using our own experiences in and out of the classroom along with direct student feedback, we discuss the importance and relevance of using interdisciplinary, team-taught FYS to engage, excite, and educate students about the inherent value of thinking and working across disciplinary boundaries.

AB  - A common theme throughout physical education pedagogical literature is that interdisciplinary lessons can provide effective ways to help evidence that physical education can play a role in student learning in other disciplines (Fingon, 2011; Graham, Holt-Hale, & Parker, 2010; Lynott, 2008; Mohnsen, 2011). Educational scholars have also suggested that interdisciplinary connections may make "learning easier... more realistic and potentially more useful [to the student]" (Shell et al., 2010, p. 184). Interdisciplinary learning is a teaching construct that enables two or more teachers to work collaboratively to connect "content from at least two subject areas in an attempt to promote learning in both subjects" (Graham et al., 2010, p. 654). Therefore, an interdisciplinary lesson would be a lesson in which content from at least two subjects is integrated in two or more teachers' classrooms resulting in learning in both subject areas. This may be effectively accomplished through collaborative efforts between the physical education teacher and teachers in other curricular areas. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - This research aimed to investigate the requirements of the application of the STEM approach in teaching science and mathematics and the teachers' attitudes towards it. The study used descriptive approach. The study sample consisted of (159) male and female teachers chosen by the random stratified sample method from the study community represented by all science, mathematics and computer teachers in Ajloun Governorate in the academic year 2019/2020. The scale of requirements for applying the STEM approach and teachers' attitudes towards it was developed; the validity and reliability of the study instrument were verified by appropriate statistical methods. Statistical processing was done using arithmetic means, and the analysis of multiple variance analysis. The results showed that the teachers 'assessments of the requirements of the STEM approach are all high and above the hypothetical average (75%). "Changing the teaching methods" dimension came in the first place with an arithmetic mean (30, 29), followed by the dimension of "changing the learning goals" with an arithmetic mean (30.15). The third place was for "changing the vision and skills of teachers" dimension with an arithmetic mean (30.13), and the last place was for the domain of "changing the classroom environment" with an arithmetic mean (22.37). It showed that teachers' attitudes toward STEM teaching are positive and high. And there were no statistically significant differences at the level (0.05) in the male and female teachers' assessments of the requirements of STEM application and their attitudes towards it. On the other hand, there are statistically significant differences in their estimates according to the phase variable and in favor of the elementary stage. There were statistically significant differences according to the variable of specialization and for the benefit of science and mathematics teachers compared to Computer ones. And in light of the results, the study presented a set of recommendations.

AB  - The "General-to-Vocational Student Roughly Equivalent" policy is an integral part of the top-level design of China's vocational education. The paper analyzed the value of the policy from a multidisciplinary perspective and reviewed its development path. According to the statistical analysis of the "General-to-Vocational Student Ratio (GVR)" data from 2009 to 2018, it can be seen that the policy has been implemented well. Still, the GVR has a trend of further expansion. Therefore, to ensure the effective implementation of this policy, relevant policy recommendations are put forward from stakeholders such as the government, secondary vocational schools, and parents of students.

AB  - One SENCER ideal is to connect science education and civic engagement by student learning through complex, unresolved public issues. Using this approach, we established a collaborative interdisciplinary project involving faculty and undergraduate students at NYC College of Technology. Over several semesters, students conducted literature search and discovered the complex factors contributing to the occurrence and transmission of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Using microbiology data from 15 hospitals in Brooklyn, NY, they applied statistical analyses, studied the antibiotic resistance, and developed a campaign to bring more awareness of this problem. The results of the project highlight the importance of immediate action in combating HAIs and support the need for a public health campaign. Undergraduate students were provided with the opportunity to conduct research, perform scientific and mathematical analyses, and present their results. They gained better understanding of the complex interactions among microbiology, epidemiology, and mathematics that is needed to develop preventative measures and combat HAIs.

AB  - This research examined over 200 elementary students' pre and post-test changes in computational thinking from a 10-week coding program delivered as part of the regular school day. Participants benefited from early access to computer science (CS) lessons with increases in understanding and applying coding concepts. Interviews from participants included examples of how CS is connected to everyday life and interdisciplinary study at school. Thus, the study highlights the importance of leveraging CS access in elementary classrooms to promote young students' learning and motivation around science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields and CS topics as well as essential soft-skills of collaboration, persistence, abstraction, and creativity to succeed in today's digital world.

AB  - The case study presented in this paper examines the work of one high school chemistry teacher who has integrated guided inquiry into a yearlong, traditional curricular framework in ways that take into account the constraints and realities of her classroom. The study's findings suggest (1) the extent and frequency to which teachers can realistically integrate guided inquiry into existing science curricula, (2) the manner in which teachers can make effective transitions into and out of a guided inquiry, and (3) the way in which teachers can set an overarching goal to bring a driving purpose to all of the guided inquiries that the students experience. Based on the insights gained from the current case study, an argument is made that researchers should examine the practice of other teachers (especially in the common subjects of biology, chemistry, and physics) who have integrated guided inquiry into the fabric of their curricula. By doing so, a library of case studies can be built that will provide science teachers with new ideas on how inquiry can be holistically and productively integrated into yearlong traditional curricular frameworks.

AB  - While the importance of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education to address complex world problems, such as global warming, disease, and an increasingly interdependent world economy has led to many educational reform efforts in recent years, other content areas, such as social studies, have unnecessarily become marginalized. As STEM is not a standalone subject area, it serves as a tool to facilitate the learning of a variety of topics and is best served when integrated into all content areas, establishing a collaborative, rather than competitive, culture of content throughout the academic environment. To date, though, this integrated culture has not been realized.

AB  - Water transport in tall trees is an everyday phenomenon, seldom noticed and not completely understood even by scientists. As a topic of current research in plant physiology it has several advantages for presentation within school physics lectures: it is interdisciplinary and clearly shows the connection between physics and biology; the construction of an artificial tree is an ideal laboratory project, which enables detailed studies of several phenomena related to water transport in an artificial tree model; it also clearly shows the failures of widespread ideas about the origins of the upward water flow. We present the construction of the laboratory tree, suggest measurements that illustrate water transport and present a few additional experiments which clearly show why water transport in trees higher than 10 m is still an ongoing debate amongst plant physiologists.

AB  - We present our case study of an interdisciplinary team project for students taking either a psychology or computer science (CS) course. The project required psychology and CS students to combine their knowledge and skills to create an online cognitive task. Each interdisciplinary project team included two psychology students who conducted library research and drafted a design protocol for the cognitive task and a CS student who created the online version. The teams produced nine applets to test cognitive abilities such as memory and imagery. Our pre-post Interdisciplinary Team Project Survey indicated students gained significant experience working with each other by the end of the semester. Psychology students reported increases in areas such as summarizing data and delivering an oral presentation. CS students reported gains in computer programming. Leadership ratings moved upward for CS students, and psychology students reported greater experience conducting team projects by the end of the semester. CS students experienced some challenges with the interdisciplinary project regarding time management. We offer lessons learned and identify strategies for improving interdisciplinary team projects. An interdisciplinary team project prepares students for the type of work they will find in graduate school or workplace.

AB  - Research in the United States show that professional learning (PL) can improve classroom instruction. However, teachers, especially educators in the content areas, receive insufficient training specific to meeting the language and academic needs of English learners (ELs). The purpose of the current randomized controlled trial (RCT) study was to introduce a high-quality PL program for supporting middle school teachers in teaching science to ELs through classroom observations, so as to evaluate whether in-service science teachers' instructional delivery can be shaped by intensive, structured, and ongoing PL. Results indicated that after receiving PL, treatment teachers allocated a significantly higher portion of their instructional time in teaching content language, developing students' expressive language skills, small group and pair activities, implementing strategies evidenced to effective with ELs, and providing more opportunities for students to participate in hands-on activities that were content-related and grade-appropriate. Practical implications for PL were discussed for an international audience.

AB  - Recognizing the increasingly integrative nature of the molecular life sciences, the "American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology" (ASBMB) recommends that Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BMB) programs develop curricula based on concepts, content, topics, and expected student outcomes, rather than courses. To that end, ASBMB conducted a series of regional workshops to build a BMB "Concept Inventory" containing validated assessment tools, based on foundational and discipline-specific knowledge and essential skills, for the community to use. A culminating activity, which integrates the educational experience, is often part of undergraduate molecular life science programs. These "capstone" experiences are commonly defined as an attempt to measure student ability to synthesize and integrate acquired knowledge. However, the format, implementation, and approach to outcome assessment of these experiences are quite varied across the nation. Here we report the results of a nation-wide survey on BMB capstone experiences and discuss this in the context of published reports about capstones and the findings of the workshops driving the development of the BMB "Concept Inventory". Both the survey results and the published reports reveal that, although capstone practices do vary, certain formats for the experience are used more frequently and similarities in learning objectives were identified. The use of rubrics to measure student learning is also regularly reported, but details about these assessment instruments are sparse in the literature and were not a focus of our survey. Finally, we outline commonalities in the current practice of capstones and suggest the next steps needed to elucidate best practices.

AB  - This study examined the efficacy of a curriculum-based intervention for high school science students. Specifically, the intervention was two years of research-based, multidisciplinary curriculum materials for science supported by comprehensive professional development for teachers that focused on those materials. A modest positive effect was detected when comparing outcomes from this intervention to those of business-as-usual materials and professional development. However, this effect was typical for interventions at this grade span that are tested using a state achievement test. Tests of mediation suggest a large treatment effect on teachers and in turn a strong effect of teacher practice on student achievement--reinforcing the hypothesized key role of teacher practice. Tests of moderation indicate no significant treatment by demographic interactions. [At time of submission to ERIC this article was in press with the "American Educational Research Journal."]

AB  - Management information systems (MIS) programs were developed to prepare graduates to create innovative solutions to problems where business and technology intersect. As such, the curricula must change rapidly to stay current with industry standards, an accelerating moving target. This research presents the findings of a systematic literature review to identify and present trends in the scholarly literature on MIS education. The purpose of this approach was to understand how academia ensures students are prepared for industry and keeps pace with changing industry needs. Key findings from the literature are presented, as well as a compilation of areas for future research. Overwhelmingly, a lack of international perspective was identified as the vast majority of articles collected data in the US. Further, the direction of future research and exploration revolved around five themes of innovative pedagogical approaches, industry partnerships, subtopics of MIS education, new methods and metrics for measuring success in MIS education, and cross-disciplinary opportunities in fields such as mathematics, traditional business disciplines, and the hard sciences.

AB  - Bioinformatics is a relatively new interdisciplinary field that integrates computer science, mathematics, biology, and information technology to manage, analyze, and understand biological, biochemical and biophysical information. We present our experience in teaching an interdisciplinary course, Introduction to Bioinformatics, which was developed and taught by an interdisciplinary team of computer science and biology faculty. To integrate the "Ethics, Computing, and Genomics" component into the course curriculum, collaboration with an English faculty member was established. The course was designed as an upper-level elective for computer information systems and computer science majors and was open as a science elective for all science majors and for chemical engineering majors. We discuss the course curriculum, and a way to integrate the Python programming language in the UNIX environment will be presented. The integration of bioinformatics algorithms into the course curriculum will be emphasized.

AB  - One of the difficulties in teaching global sustainability in the introductory political science classes is the different emphases placed on this concept and the absence of the consensus on where the overall balance between environmental protection, economic development, and social justice should reside. Like many fuzzy concepts with which students struggle, teaching sustainability lends itself to pedagogical examination within the scholarship of threshold concepts. This article investigates students' understanding of sustainability in the seven semesters when the concept of sustainability was introduced via role-playing simulation and compares it with the similar data from a more recent semester when simulation was supplemented with traditional lecture and classroom exercises. Ultimately, our research question is twofold: (1) How do students define a multifaceted concept like global sustainability and (2) what is the better way to teach it--active learning only or active learning in combination with traditional instruction?

AB  - This article introduces the new translation by Stanley Mitchell of a very well-known Vygotskyan text, which has become the locus classicus for Vygotsky's concept of the "zone of proximal development" (ZPD). It outlines the history of Vygotsky's text and compares Mitchell's new translation with the version found in Chapter 6 of "Mind in Society" (a collection of Vygotsky's articles edited by Cole, John-Steiner, Scribner, and Souberman in 1978). It indicates the main points of difference between the two translations and considers their significance for our reading of this key text. Chief among these points of difference is the emphasis given to pedagogy in Mitchell's translation; it is clear from this version that the role of pedagogy in the mental development of children is a major focus for Vygotsky throughout the paper. Mitchell's translation is nearly 2000 words longer than the 1978 translation and includes several passages which were cut from the original text; in particular, a section relating to "pedology," an interdisciplinary movement sometimes called "child science." This article discusses some of these cuts and finally considers Vygotsky's vision of the potential of the ZPD concept for the study of teaching and learning, and its value in the sciences of pedagogy and pedology.

AB  - This paper presents findings of an institutional case study investigating how students and lecturers experienced a new opt-out, fully integrated lecture-recording system which enabled audio and presentation screen capture. The study's focus is on how "traditional" students (generally characterised as young, enrolled full-time and attending classes on campus) engaged with lecture-recording and how lecturers' experiences with, and attitudes towards, lecture-recording differed depending on their discipline. Students were generally positive about the affordances of the lecture-recording system, whilst lecturers remained undecided on its value. Discipline-based differences in lecturer engagement with the system were noted between lecturers teaching engineering and sciences subjects and those teaching business and social sciences, the latter being more positive towards the system. The paper raises questions about the efficacy of a one-size-fits-all lecture-recording system given differences in disciplinary activities, lecturer styles and approaches to teaching.

AB  - Many researchers have pointed out that teachers' interpersonal behaviour relates to students' positive attitudes towards schooling. However, only few studies have examined whether students' perceptions of their teachers' interpersonal behaviour relates to students' subject-related attitudes across different school subjects. In this study, it was investigated to what extent the interpersonal behaviours of secondary school teachers are perceived differently by the students as a function of the school subject being taught and whether such perceptions coincide with students' attitudes towards the subject matter, after controlling for students' achievement. To address these research questions, 2,305 adolescent students (47.1% males; M[subscript age]¬†=¬†17.85; SD¬†=¬†1.09) from grades 9 to 11 and their teachers (N¬†=¬†42; 38.1% males; mean years of teaching¬†=¬†14.2; SD¬†=¬†1.25) from one urban high school in Turkey were surveyed. The students completed the Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction and attitude questions. Multilevel data analysis showed that Control related to positive attitudes among students in classes grouped under the science, and literature and language domains, but not in classes grouped under the arts and sports domain. Perceived Affiliation, on the other hand, was positively associated with all the four subject domains (science, social sciences, literature and language, and arts and sports). These results show the importance of taking a multidisciplinary perspective in in-service training programmes for secondary school science teachers as they emphasise the differential roles that control as an interpersonal behavioural style may play on students' attitudes in certain subject matters.

AB  - During the last years, there has been a growing multidisciplinary interest in alternative educational approaches, such as serious games, aiming at enhancing thinking skills and media literacy. Likewise, the objective of this study is to present the design and the development of an educational web application for learning the necessary steps towards the detection of bogus content, according to the fact-checking procedures. The game presents news articles, which have to be characterized as fake or real by the players. During the effort to reach the correct decision, the players can use tools and practices for identifying relevant information regarding the clues, which frame a news story (title, date, creator, source, containing images). After presenting the progress of interface design and development, this paper reports the results of a randomized online field study (n = 111), which provides some preliminary evidence. Specifically, it is validated that the game can raise awareness, teach about authentication tools, and highlight the importance of patterns that include evidence regarding the authenticity of articles. Additionally, thorough discussion was conducted within a media class (n = 35) to receive useful feedback/evaluation about the offered utilities and their usability. The findings suggest that educational games may be a promising vehicle to inoculate the public against misinformation.

AB  - Box-and-whisker plots or simply boxplots are powerful graphical representations that give an overview of a data set. In this work five different examples illustrate the applications of boxplots in food chemistry. The examples involve relative sweetness of sugars and sugar alcohols with respect to sucrose, the potassium content of fruits and vegetables, amino acid content of egg white and yolk, chemical composition of freshwater and saltwater fish, and change in fatty acid composition of soybean oil through traditional cultivation or genetic engineering techniques. Readers are guided to identify through boxplots key features present in some foods associated with inorganic elements and molecules. It is certainly an interdisciplinary way of studying concepts of statistics, nutrition, and chemistry.

AB  - Arts integration into Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) subject areas is currently an important area of investigation. This study developed a grounded theory of how artmaking of a mobile related to fossil life of the Devonian period engendered geoscience inquiry. Data were collected from elementary students entering fourth to sixth grade (7 male, 9 female) attending a week-long summer camp at a Midwestern university. Students engaged in a daily hour-long class creating fossil mobiles and learning geoscience content through illustrated slide shows, form and function sets of materials related to Devonian fossils, fossil books, and a fossil hunter- fossil find matching game. The art fossil mobile was constructed of painted dowel rods suspended from a beaded string with four craft fossils (traced onto clear plastic and back-painted or stenciled onto canvas) attached to the ends of the rods. The grounded theory research design identified seven major repeating interactions among the triad of art, science, and students: (1) art promoting science inquiry, (2) art aspects positively influencing science learning, (3) science learning increasing interest in fossils, (4) science influencing art, (5) student-centered artwork increasing desire for more art knowledge, (6) student-centered art providing connections to science, and (7) student-centered science increasing interest in fossils. Implications for educators include integrating art activities into science lessons, thereby providing engagement and motivation for students, supporting students' fine motor skills development, and building a community of learners. Geoscience educators should consider the positive cyclical effects of art-science-student interactions identified in this study.

AB  - Polar research plays a vital role in developing our understanding of Earth's climate system. It is intrinsically interdisciplinary, lending itself to integration into existing undergraduate courses. Here we explore introducing undergraduates to polar research through computational guided inquiry (CGI) modules taught in a variety of courses and disciplines. Students apply course disciplinary techniques to analysis of polar data or research, in the context of climate change, by working through educational modules that include spreadsheets (Excel[superscript TM]) or interactive computer programing (Python in a Jupyter Notebook), over a few class or lab periods. The goals of this exploratory curriculum project are to determine instructor perceptions of effectiveness of the educational modules for teaching preexisting disciplinary course objectives, as well as student perceptions of enjoyment and learning. Evaluation consisted of a student questionnaire and interviews with instructors by an external evaluator. Students and instructors overall reported positive experiences with the modules, highlighted the importance of polar data and climate literacy, and noted increases in student understanding of course learning goals and comfort with the computational tools. Professors further reported that students found the modules motivating, fun and engaging. Taken together, this suggests that the modules are an effective means of bringing polar research into undergraduate classrooms while satisfying instructor goals for course learning objectives. Lessons learned include the importance of providing material such as videos to help transition to the topics of polar research and climate change and of supporting widely varying computational fluency.

AB  - A common problem in education is getting students to cooperate effectively in groups during learning. Because interdisciplinary research has established that cooperation is sensitive to specific contextual factors such as reciprocity, friendship and benefit, similar factors could be shaping student interactions in contemporary classroom environments. The present article reports an initial investigation of this idea by examining how student perceptions of their classroom environment relate to their willingness to expend energy and resources on classmates (through helping). This was accomplished through the structural equation modeling of survey data collected from 845 undergraduate life sciences students from 41 laboratory classrooms at a research-intensive university. Characteristics of the classroom social environment previously associated with benefits in other contexts also predicted (reciprocity √ü¬†=¬†0.576; friendship √ü¬†=¬†0.156) the educational benefit that students perceive as coming from their classmates. This perceived benefit in turn was highly associated (√ü¬†=¬†0.605) with student willingness to expend resources on classmates (i.e. their prosocial disposition). Also both reciprocity (√ü¬†=¬†0.298) and perceived benefit (√ü¬†=¬†0.403) concurrently predict a student's support for enforcing cooperation in the classroom. Potential insights into the contribution of classroom social environment to student dispositions towards cooperation are discussed.

AB  - Recruiting students to science and mathematics fields continues to be a nationwide issue, resulting in a dearth of individuals to fill these present and future careers. Novel interventions, especially within the K-12 space, call for a move from content acquisition to the formation of individuals' identity that particularly fosters science and math interest and persistence. Identity research has evidenced results, yet greater communication is needed between the research and practitioner communities to realize the potential of cultivating collective science and mathematics identities in the classroom. In this paper, we bridge these spaces by describing the potential student affordances beyond individual identity formation to that of collective (classroom-level) identity formation considerations by K-12 teachers' within mathematics and science. Specifically, we explore how traditional K-12 classroom structures may reinforce stereotypes and hinder collective mathematics and science identity formation, whereas reform-oriented classroom structures that employ legitimate peripheral participation within a community of practice enable them. Last, we recommend pedagogical interventions to practitioners that promote collective student opportunities to co-construct skills specific to mathematics and science communities as a strategy to foster collective mathematics and science identities. Collective identity formation can provide K-12 classroom teachers pedagogical strategies for additional opportunities or enhanced experiences for students to co-construct and reinforce individual identities in math and science.

AB  - This study examined the role of a future-oriented scenario with secondary school students using diorama construction which included climate-change knowledge and envisioning alternative futures. To explore the potential role of futures-thinking modelling, students from one class participated in a 12-week cross-curricular inquiry with their teachers. Jensen's (2002) dimensions of action-oriented knowledge are used to examine the climate-change knowledge developed by the students. Four common images of the future (Dator, 2014) are incorporated as models to forecast alternative futures. The findings suggest the value of future-oriented dioramas for developing climate-change understanding and futures thinking.

AB  - In its 2018 report "The Integration of the Humanities and Arts with Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in Higher Education: Branches from the Same Tree", a committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine pointed to an emerging body of evidence suggesting that integration of the arts, humanities, and STEMM fields - science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine -- is associated with positive learning outcomes that may help students enter the workforce, live enriched lives, and become active and informed members of a modern democracy. On April 12, 2019, the National Academies held a national convening in Washington, DC, to review, extend, and disseminate the committee's findings. At the convening, which was part of a series of events held across the United States, committee members, students, faculty members, and others discussed the future of higher education, the benefits of integration, and examples of integration that have proven to have positive effects. In addition, the convening featured dramatic readings that illustrated some of the issues involved with integrating the arts, humanities, and STEMM fields. This publication highlights the presentations of the event. [Steve Olson served as Rapporteur.]

AB  - The Mayo Innovation Scholars Program introduces undergraduates to technology transfer in biomedical sciences by having teams of students from multiple disciplines (e.g., biology, chemistry, economics, and business) analyze inventions in development at the Mayo Clinic. Over 6 months, teams consult with inventors, intellectual property experts, and faculty mentors as
they research and explore project viability, potential applications, market forces, ethical dilemmas, and financial considerations. Team members read relevant patent applications as well as journal articles from within the basic
sciences, clinical sciences, and business. In some instances, they perform original research, such as surveys of health care providers or potential consumers. The program culminates in formal presentations that include teams' recommendations about what should be done with the invention (e.g., shelve it or pursue a licensing agreement, or pursue some other option) to an audience of intellectual property experts, physicians, faculty, and student
peers. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Although argumentation is a critical historical component of scientific literacy, the recent coronavirus pandemic and associated issues have highlighted the importance of argumentation in science practice. Argumentation that aligns with functional scientific literacy requires gathering evidence and reasoning to support or refute claims related to socioscientific issues (SSI)--those informed by science but also affected by society. In this article, we present a 5E module that models argumentation instruction while scaffolding preservice elementary teachers' argumentation practice in the context of SSI. To do so, we introduced the claim-evidence-reasoning argumentation framework. In this approach, students responded to potential solutions to SSI related to the coronavirus (claim), supported their responses with data (evidence), and justified how the evidence they provided supported their responses (reasoning). Specifically, preservice elementary teachers completed diverse argumentation tasks--starting with more traditional scientific argumentation and building toward recognizing and addressing nonscientific, cross-curricular issues--to develop effective argumentation practice concerning contemporary SSI.

AB  - Without proper linguistic competence in English language, academic writing is one of the most challenging tasks, especially, in various genre specific disciplines by L2 novice writers. This paper examines the role of diction and expression through error analysis in English language of L2 novice writers' academic writing in interdisciplinary texts of IT & Computer sciences and Business & Management sciences. Though the importance of vocabulary in L2 academic discourse is widely recognized, there has been little research focusing on diction and expression at higher education level. A corpus of 40 introductions of the published research articles, downloaded from the journals (e.g., 20 from IT & Computer sciences and 20 Business & Management sciences) authored by L2 novice writers, was analyzed to determine lexico-grammatical errors from the texts by applying Markin4 method of Error Analysis. "Rewrites" in italics letters is an attempt to demonstrate English language flexibility, infinite vastness and richness in diction and expression, comparing it with the excerpts taken from the corpus.

AB  - Modern preschool education is seen as an essential foundation for nurturing children's digital literacy. Early childhood education environments have witnessed increased emphasis on integrating programming activities in combination with digital tablets. However, little is known about how preschool teachers implement programming as part of pedagogical strategies during practice. In Sweden, although there is a mandate to develop children's understanding of the digital world, programming is not formally mentioned in the revised preschool curriculum. This study systematically investigates how Swedish preschool teachers implement programming activities in their teaching practice. Data was collected through a national online survey (n = 199). Findings revealed a range of apps and resources used in combination with tablets, where activity integration takes place as unplugged programming, digital programming, or as a combination of the former. Teachers markedly attributed intended learning goals around programming to tenets of computational thinking and "twenty-first century skills". Moreover, programming was often actively linked to learning in other domains such as science, technology, mathematics, and language, approaches that show traditional Swedish preschool teaching practices being recontextualized in terms of programming. Based on the reported findings that provide insight into the implementation of programming in preschools, a logical future research avenue lies in exploring the documented programming activities from the perspective of the children.

AB  - Science and mathematics share a common purpose: to explore, understand and explain the pure beauty of our universe and how it works. Using mathematics in science enquiry can enhance children's understanding of science and also provide opportunities for children to apply their mathematical knowledge to "real" contexts. The authors highlight practical examples to offer a rationale for the application of mathematics in science and explore their intrinsic relationship.

AB  - This experiment of innovative university education shows the interdisciplinary work carried out in the studies of the Bachelor of Science in Education at the University of Andorra. The study was developed within two subjects: Communication Technology (TAC) and Cultural Heritage Education in Andorra. The main objective of this experiment is to foster the use of technological resources and digital materials, with the aim of drawing cultural heritage closer to the classroom. Based on a previous study of documentation and an analysis of online educational materials, the students have to design an e-book, which is understood to be digital material in the curricular field of cultural heritage. This digital material is a didactic proposal that focuses on the construction of knowledge by primary school students. During the elaboration of the materials the instructors introduce follow-up activities. The results of the experiment show that, from an interdisciplinary approach, and a problem-solving, learning-centered methodology, specific and transferable abilities in initial teacher training can be studied and evaluated.

AB  - The integration of mathematics and science teaching and learning facilitates student learning, engagement, motivation, problem-solving, criticality and real-life application. However, the actual implementation of an integrative approach to the teaching and learning of both subjects at classroom level, with in-service teachers working collaboratively, at second-level education, is under-researched due to the complexities of school-based research. This study reports on a year-long case study on the implementation of an integrated unit of learning on distance, speed and time, within three second-level schools in Ireland. This study employed a qualitative approach and examined the key aspects of practice that impact on the integration of mathematics and science teaching and learning. We argue that teacher perspective, teacher knowledge of the "other subject" and of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), and teacher collaboration and support all impact on the implementation of an integrative approach to mathematics and science education.

AB  - This paper investigates students' performance in content-subjects in the framework of CLIL programmes in Spain. So far, CLIL research has focused primarily on language attainment in the L2 and the L1, but students' achievements as regards content-subjects have been largely ignored. Competence in Science in the L1 is analysed by comparing pupils enrolled in mainstream schools with students in the so-called 'bilingual streams' offering CLIL-based approaches. The main objective is to assess if students learning Science through the L2 (English) outperform their counterparts studying in the L1 (Spanish) as regards content acquisition. The paper analyses a sample of 709 6th grade Primary Education students enrolled in public schools in the Principality of Asturias (Spain). A test to assess students' knowledge in Science and a context questionnaire (measuring participants' socio-economic status) were designed. The main finding is that students learning contents in their L1 perform slightly better than those studying Science through the L2. Furthermore, participants with lower socio-economic status obtain lower scores than those coming from more privileged backgrounds.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to focus on the role of students' cultural background in explaining their academic performance. Design/methodology/approach: The paper aims at achieving the research objective with the use of questionnaires and structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings: This paper shows that students' code of conduct, which is grounded in their cultural background, affects their level of engagement in learning process. The paper supports, on one hand, the idea of extensive use of formative assessment techniques as a way of improving students' engagement; it argues, on the other hand, that their effectiveness could be limited because of the bad impact of the students' norms. Originality/value: The paper aims at achieving the objective of the research using an interdisciplinary approach borrowing from the field of economics while discussing a research gap that covers a region that require more attention in the field of education.

AB  - As a fine art collection founded by a scientist with a passion for art and a vested interest in education, the Barnes Foundation is in an exciting and unique position to explore and develop educational programming around science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM). The education staff determined that using science and math in the context of our art collection may be a promising vehicle for teaching problem solving and creative, critical thinking. However, after reflecting on several iterations of our "Art of Looking" program, as well as the findings of an external evaluation, we recognized a few issues around student understanding of these curricular connections. We determined that for our institution, the art and visual analysis should be the core of every aspect of the program and that scientific and mathematical thinking should be used as tools in service of this goal. In response, our program design challenge was to address this curricular connection issue by collectively learning our way toward an improved program design. The outcome of our collaborative efforts was a shift in the focus of the program--from an integration of math and science "content," to a foregrounding of math and science "practices."

AB  - This study investigated preservice teachers from two teacher education programs, elementary generalists and bilingual generalists (who will teach all subjects in both English and Spanish), about their instructional design abilities via examination of their ability to integrate interdisciplinary-themed activities into mathematics lessons. The findings illustrate the value provided by differentiating teacher preparation for preservice bilingual teachers--especially for challenging STEM-related (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects such as mathematics--based on their distinctive pedagogical, cognitive, and linguistic requirements.

AB  - This book contains a compilation of papers presented at the International Psychological Applications Conference and Trends (InPACT) 2022, organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (W.I.A.R.S.), held in Funchal, Madeira Island, Portugal, from 23 to 25 of April 2022. Modern psychology offers a large range of scientific fields where it can be applied. The goal of understanding individuals and groups (mental functions and behavioral standpoints), from this academic and practical scientific discipline, aims ultimately to benefit society. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the several areas within the Psychology field, new developments in studies and proposals for future scientific projects. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between psychologists, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in psychological issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement the view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons there are several nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounters and development. InPACT 2022 received 364 submissions, from more than 35 different countries all over the world, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take the form of Oral Presentations, Posters and Virtual Presentations. 121 submissions (overall, 33% acceptance rate) were accepted for presentation at the conference. The Conference addresses different categories inside Applied Psychology area and papers fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. This book contains the results of the different researches conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to study and develop research in areas related to Psychology and its applications. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters that are hereby sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. [This document contains the proceedings of the International Psychological Applications Conference and Trends (InPACT) 2022, held in Funchal, Madeira Island, Portugal, from April 23-25, 2022.

AB  - One of the questions being asked in schools is the extent to which Geography can be considered a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subject. While such a question might be driven by those strategic opportunists seeking to elevate the status of the subject within the school's curriculum, or as a means of leveraging an increase in funding, it is a question worth serious attention. This paper argues that Geography has the potential to play an important role in advancing the objectives of STEM in the Australian educational context. In doing so, Geography's place within the humanities is in no way diminished. The humanities remain central to our understanding of the social world in which we live. It also provides important insights into the context within which science gains its significance and from which it draws its authority. Geography, given that it straddles both the physical and human sciences, can advance both the humanities and STEM.

AB  - The lack of time available to adequately teach everything expected throughout the days and weeks in a school year is a major concern for many elementary teachers. The heavy focus on reading, writing, and mathematics leaves little time for science and social studies instruction. However, science is an integral part of preparation for college and career readiness in the 21st century (NRC 2012). The heart of the "Common Core State Standards" ("CCSS") and "Next Generation Science Standards" (NGSS) refers to the need to integrate ELA standards into science instruction and vice versa (Common Core State Standards Initiative 2016; NGSS Lead States 2013). Teachers have an opportunity to battle the time issue through the integration of English/language arts (ELA) within science instruction. It is "killing two birds with one stone," as the saying goes. Integrating science and ELA allows an elementary teacher to focus time and energy on teaching important science concepts and instructing students in nonfiction text, informational writing, listening, and speaking skills at the same time. Interactive science notebooks help accomplish this feat. This article illustrates how the author used interactive science notebooks within a second-grade unit on Earth's systems. Over the course of this unit, students learned about weather and plate tectonics and their impact on the environment. Some of the specific lessons of focus were the layers of the Earth.

AB  - We outline an instructional strategy for supporting students' science literacy skills using a structured decision-making tool in an interdisciplinary undergraduate course. Instructional tools support basing complex socioscientific issues decisions on a reasoned analysis of tradeoffs among multiple conflicting values rather than heuristics, such as social norms. We explored the factors related to students' decision-making about mountain lion management by examining if students' value orientations, identity, or knowledge predicted their management decisions before, during, and after engaging in structured decision-making where they performed a tradeoffs analysis. We found that student decision-making may align more closely to students' value orientations and identity at the beginning of the course, suggesting that by the end of the course, students were less likely to make decisions centered in social norms and simplified single-value heuristics. A structured decision-making tool can be an effective way to support students' examination of value tradeoffs when solving complex socioscientific issues.

AB  - For many years there has been a growing concern, particularly among researchers in biology education, about the extent to which research findings from one discipline (most usually physics education) can be applied directly to other disciplines (particularly biology education). This paper explores the issue through the use of one particular theoretical construct--Learning Demand--to inform the design of a plant nutrition teaching sequence. Reflections on this experience suggest that the basic construct could be applied to good effect but contextual differences between disciplines make it more difficult to agree common ground in relation to the finer detail. Implications for the development of a common framework for science education are considered. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - Students' critical thinking is often researched using quantitative tests designed to measure critical thinking. In contrast, this study qualitatively analyses group and whole-class dialogues in an interdisciplinary SSI project by focusing on students' critical thinking practices. As such, the study provides an in-depth example of an immersion approach to teaching critical thinking in an SSI classroom. The SSI project, called the Climate project, lasted 18 lessons and involved an 8th-grade mixed-ability class in a suburb on the west coast of Norway. The data consist of field notes, full-class video recordings and audio recordings of student talk in groups. Based on an interactive ethnographic perspective, patterns in the data were identified using open coding informed by conceptualizations of critical thinking followed by identification and holistic analysis of episodes characteristic of the critical thinking practices in the classroom. The study offers insight into the characteristics of young students' critical thinking in dialogic settings. The students' interpretations, analyses, evaluations, and inferences are based on a mix of knowledge and guesswork. The analysis reveals that the two teachers involved challenged students to, for example, interpret and evaluate information, make inferences, and to suggest alternative views. Explicit teaching of critical thinking was limited. The study demonstrates that it is possible, by employing appropriate teaching strategies, to support students across all levels of abilities in actively participating in critical thinking. Additionally, it shows how specific student centered teaching strategies and students' responses to these strategies contribute to a classroom culture permeated with critical thinking practices.

AB  - Integrative model of special translation training considers the understanding of a foreign text as the key stage of the given activity, which is to large extent stipulated by characteristics of both the source text sender and the translation text recipient. Interdisciplinary approach permitted to involve maximum number of determining factors to consider the given characteristics. Such a possibility is given by information-reference search and analysis of utterance from discursive positions, i.e. considering the specificity of science and technique institute, professional communication, variety of text genres, stipulated by communicative function and aims of communication, characteristics of sender and recipient utterance, socio-cultural factors that influence a special discourse creation, general regularities of its creation, stylistic characteristics, the basic methods of their realization etc. Inclusion of the given characteristics into the content of translation training permits to teach students to go beyond the frameworks of the text being analyzed and to involve maximum number of factors that stipulate the understanding and interpreting of the source text aimed at its further translation.

AB  - Broader diversity in the research workforce affords the inclusion of research agendas, methods, and perspectives that might otherwise be overlooked to address key social and scientific problems. However, promoting diversity in science is not a trivial matter. It entails mitigating some of the long-term social and institutional inequalities that have prevented the participation of underrepresented groups, such as Latinos, in scientific research. For instance, the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) reports that Hispanic serving institutions receive (on average) only 69 cents for every federal dollar of funding that all other higher education institutions receive. This article describes how an interdisciplinary research institute at an under-resourced Hispanic serving institution managed to build a culture of undergraduate research by promoting the research of local faculty and supporting their mentoring role in the face of economic and administrative challenges. In spite of dramatic budget cuts that fluctuated between 1.4% and 13.3% (2005-2013) and loss of 23% of its senior faculty due to retirement (2006-2014), during a 10-year period, the Institute of Interdisciplinary Research (IIR) at the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey was able to increase the number of faculty conducting research from 7 to 54 and the number of students engaged in research from 8 to 481. During the period, UPR-C faculty from the Sciences, Arts, and Business Administration engaged in the applied, regional and interdisciplinary research mission of the IIR, published 81 peerreviewed articles, offered 238 research presentations, and submitted 81 grants (57 to external funding agencies and 24 to UPR-C divisions). Grant approval for external funding was 45.6%. Students' most important research products included oral and written presentations in epidemiology, psychology, anthropology, ecology, chemistry, microbiology, pedagogy, business administration, and humanities. Overall, during the period, 84% of students who applied to graduate programs were admitted. This article identifies the key approaches and outcomes of a strategic planning process that allowed the IIR to become a successful campuswide research resource for interdisciplinary research at an undergraduate, Hispanic serving institution facing fiscal and administrative challenges.

AB  - The US Forest Service has a long history of youth conservation education. We investigated U.S. Forest Service citizen science programs that involve secondary school students in field collection of monitoring data to understand (1) how the programs integrated science and environmental education and (2) whether these programs advance ecological literacy and environmental stewardship. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the program leads, teachers, and students. Program leads and students said programs produced reliable data and met monitoring and other U.S. Forest Service stewardship objectives. Although these programs varied in design and objectives, our findings suggest these programs were incorporating both science and environmental education, and there is some indication they are creating ecological literacy among participants. Students exhibited environmental stewardship to some degree as a result of all programs, but the extent of this is tied to programs' objectives and design.

AB  - Innovative teaching concepts such as problem-based learning (PBL) can make a difference in an academic setting, particularly when dealing with diversity, and support the successful completion of students' studies. Introducing new approaches to teaching requires the professionalization of the teaching staff and the development of new tools. As a view from the field, this contribution describes the steps taken at TH K√∂ln--University of Applied Sciences to introduce PBL and discusses empirical and practical aspects of a university-wide implementation. It offers lessons learned from the practical application of PBL theories in a real-life setting.

AB  - The present article describes some activities performed with high-school students in the "Solar Physics" course developed in a Brazilian science centre. The topics of chemical composition, temperature and stellar evolution were taught in a room totally dedicated to study of the Sun, a solar room, designed with simple and inexpensive equipment. The course strongly emphasized practical, observational and enquiry-based activities, such as estimating the solar surface temperature, observation of the visible solar spectrum, identification of solar absorption lines, and understanding how they are produced and what kind of information can be extracted from the observed spectral lines. Some of the course goals were to foster the comprehension of the key role played by spectroscopy in astrophysics, to contextualize contents with practical activities, and to allow interdisciplinary approaches including modern physics and chemistry in physics teaching.

AB  - STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) lessons have leaned heavily on the visual arts in interdisciplinary preservice learning. For preservice teachers, the application of STEAM pedagogies encourages complexity of thought connecting with their past and new experiences as well as greater self-awareness and risk-taking. Preservice teachers and elementary school students are introduced into the communicative and dynamic power of the arts through creative interdisciplinary teamwork in STEAM lessons. To enhance the impact of arts integration, dance/movement has the potential to add a kinetic connection to the study of the changing phases of the moon. Neuroscientists have begun to focus on physical movement as a means to demystify how the brain coordinates with the body to perform complex precise movements that express emotion and convey meaning (Hanna 2015). Choreographing movement most closely mirrors the actual progressive changes of the appearance of the moon in the night sky. This article describes a K-6 preservice course in which the content and activities included dance/movement and the making of visual art as props to teach about the eight phases of the moon over the course of a month combined with the nightly journey of the moon across the sky.

AB  - Arguments over conceptions of giftedness and provisions for the gifted bear similarities to arguments over key constructs in other disciplines. We can clarify and strengthen the conceptual foundations for gifted education by going beyond psychology and education to explore theory and research in other disciplines such as cultural anthropology, ethical philosophy, history, sociology, economics, and the philosophy of science. Based on long-term experiences with interdisciplinary inquiry, including collaborative, interdisciplinary projects involving leading thinkers from multiple fields, this focus article provides suggestions about ways in which scholars can shed new light on high ability. The suggestions include frameworks for individual and collaborative interdisciplinary exploration and discussion of the benefits and pitfalls of such work. The analysis provides the basis for reactions from leading thinkers in the fields of gifted education and creative studies. Respondents will react to the recommendations for further interdisciplinary work, especially in the field of gifted education, looking for strengths, flaws, and refinements.

AB  - Today's scientist is faced with complex problems that require interdisciplinary solutions. Consequently, tertiary science educators have had to develop and deliver interdisciplinary science courses to equip students with the skills required to solve the evolving real-world challenges of today and tomorrow. There are few reported studies of the lessons learned from designing and delivering first year compulsory interdisciplinary science subjects at regional universities. Even fewer studies assess the impact that teaching interventions within interdisciplinary courses have on students' attitudes towards mathematics and technology, and mathematics anxiety. This paper discusses the feedback received from the first student cohort of a new compulsory, first year interdisciplinary science subject at a regional Australian university which resulted in curricular revisions. These revisions included a greater emphasis on the subject relevance and increased student support in tutorials. Assessment practices were also dramatically modified. The change in student attitudes and anxiety levels "a priori" and "a posteriori" to the interventions was measured quantitatively and qualitatively. Post-intervention, female and non-mathematics major students had grown in mathematical confidence and were less anxious. It is important that positive and negative research findings are reported, so science educators can learn from one another, and can better prepare their students for the challenges they will face in bringing interdisciplinary solutions to contemporary real-world problems.

AB  - This study explores the integration of the arts into the teaching of science nonfiction texts during literacy instruction. Sixty-one elementary students (15 second graders, 25 third graders, and 21 fifth graders) attending schools of differing socio-economic levels participated in this study. The study examined the effects of arts-integration on student content knowledge, engagement level, and attitudes toward learning regarding science nonfiction texts. Throughout the eight-week study, students experienced both the traditional no-arts control condition and the experimental arts-integration condition in two-week segments for different science topics. Both conditions employed literacy strategies to teach comprehension of science nonfiction texts. The resulting pretests, posttests, and distal posttests, attitude surveys, and teacher observations indicated that students learned and retained content knowledge taught through both ways of teaching. The fifth-grade students evidenced greater learning during the experimental condition with very large effect sizes. Students' overall attitudes and engagement were better when the arts were incorporated into daily instruction. The excitement for learning and academic abilities of the participants throughout the study supports the idea that different ways of creative teaching positively impact the way students learn in the classroom.

AB  - International large-scale assessments and comparisons (ILSAs) in education have become significant policy phenomena. How a country fares in these assessments has come to signify not only how a nation's education system is performing, but also its future prospects in a global economic "race". These assessments provoke passionate arguments at specialist conferences and in scholarly journals and they are just as passionately debated in the media. Within academe, ILSAs are researched by sociologists and psychometricians, policy experts and statisticians. This multidisciplinary, multi-voice discussion has not always served to highlight the complexity of the issues involved. Instead, discussions across various groups of actors have often led to a polarisation of views and a hardening of stances. Large-scale comparisons have deeply divided academic opinion with regard to their validity, usefulness and use. The divergence in ontological commitments, methodologies and paradigms of research makes discussions among one set of scholars almost incomprehensible to another. New theories, concepts and vocabularies are urgently required to engage productively with this important phenomenon. Borrowing concepts from Science and Technology Studies (STS) and the history and sociology of numbers, I argue that understanding such comparative exercises as socio-technical assemblages would move the critique of large-scale comparisons in education in more productive directions.

AB  - The European Union Sport Unit has identified the societal and educational role of sport as a central topic in its new research agenda. It is argued that European Union (EU) citizens should be supported to learn continuously across the life course. In the sport/physical activity (PA) context, the role of teachers, coaches and exercise instructors (among others) is pivotal to the delivery of this aspiration. Yet, in this paper, we argue that entrenched barriers between teaching, coaching and exercise instruction and the lack of a well-developed, integrative underpinning knowledge base centred on pedagogy are serious impediments. We suggest that the development of a new integrative subdiscipline in the Academy may help pedagogy, and pedagogy academics, to make a stronger contribution to addressing these barriers and gaps. "Sport & Exercise Pedagogy" (SEP) is proposed as an education-based, boundary-crossing, multi/interdisciplinary area of study located in the field known variously as "Sport & Exercise Sciences", "Kinesiology" and "Human Movement Sciences". SEP places individuals and their life course learning at its core. A new cross-border policy initiative from the island of Ireland illustrates the potential for SEP to contribute to PA/public health agendas.

AB  - This paper seeks to explore how rural Latinx students' STEM identity development can be fostered by utilizing their cultural capital. By both a community cultural wealth and science identity model, this paper reviews previous literature to conceptualize how and why rural Latinx youth are continuously underrepresented within STEM education and future career pathways. When forming STEM identities and aspirations for the future, Latinx students draw from six forms of capital- "aspirational," "linguistic," "familial," "social," "navigational," and "resistant." Throughout this paper, we discuss each of these six forms of capital wealth and the value rural Latinx students can bring into STEM educational spaces. Supporting rural Latinx students' STEM identity development is a vital key to the disruption of systemic inequalities that perpetuate societal and institutional spaces. Conclusions drawn from the literature showcase how cultural wealth sustains the development of Latinx students' STEM identities. Future considerations need to focus on the STEM disparities that still exist for this population of students, specifically those in rural communities.

AB  - Knowledge around geospatial technologies and learning remains sparse, inconsistent, and overly anecdotal. Studies are needed that are better structured; more systematic and replicable; attentive to progress and findings in the cognate fields of science, technology, engineering, and math education; and coordinated for multidisciplinary approaches. A proposed agenda is designed to frame the next generation of research in this field, organized around four foci: (1) connections between GST and geospatial thinking; (2) learning GST; (3) curriculum and student learning through GST; and (4) educators' professional development with GST. Recommendations for advancing this agenda are included.

AB  - In this article we describe and evaluate processes utilized to develop an online learning module on mathematical modelling for pre-service teachers. The module development process involved a range of professionals working within the STEM disciplines including mathematics and science educators, mathematicians, scientists, in-service and pre-service secondary mathematics teachers. Development of the module was underpinned by Bybee's five E's enquiry-based approach and Goos et al.'s twenty-first century numeracy model. Module evaluation data is examined in relation to the quality of pre-service teachers' learning experiences and interview data from the study is analysed through the lens of 'boundary crossing'. While the evaluation of the module was generally positive, aspects that required improvement were also identified including more meaningful inclusion of pre-service teachers and other stakeholders in the development process.

AB  - A physical process analogy of the learning process was studied using a hydraulic method. Detailed educational guidance describing applied pedagogical concepts for technical instructors of the civil, mechanical, chemical and materials engineering disciplines was formulated. A unified engineering-friendly formulation of learning processes using a direct analogy of civil, mechanical, chemical and materials engineering physical processes was developed. Generalized expressions were proposed for an approximate description of learning processes in the educational curriculum in the form of hydraulic processes in civil, mechanical, chemical and materials engineering practice. It was shown that it is possible to intensify students' attention to the studied technical material through a step-by-step building of a proposed analogy between hydraulic and learning processes, which is based on the similarity between corresponding mathematical models for both processes. Hard-working students have the prime educational problem of managing the growing overload and holding in their memory a cumbersome quantity of studied material in technical, social and human sciences. The author-proposed educational approach provides a better simultaneous understanding of both hydraulics and didactics by acquiring new inter-disciplinary practical knowledge, which helps learners plan an optimal scientific-based mode for effective study and self-study of educational material. This educational research helps students to remember that it is impossible to learn the studied material at the required level of understanding with a single onetime acquaintance without multiple reviews and repetitions.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the article was to convey experiences with pioneering interdisciplinary sustainability research by involving undergraduate students. Experiences with initiating and conducting multiple research projects spanning engineering and sustainability are described, and recommendations for programs and faculty in other institutions of higher education that plan to implement or support similar endeavors are discussed. Design/methodology/approach: The article and presented conclusions are based on three separate research projects, where specific examples as to how those projects were developed as well as challenges and rewards faced during the project are described. Findings: It is concluded that faculty should not refrain from working with students from different backgrounds and disciplines. Bringing different backgrounds and perspectives to a project enables a big picture view of problems at hand and leads to better solutions that are more in line with the three pillars of sustainability, while at the same time providing valuable hands-on experience to undergraduate students. Originality/value: By its very definition, sustainability is an interdisciplinary field and, thus, requires novel approaches for education and research compared to other settled fields of science. A viable way to increase the role of sustainability in higher education is to foster interdisciplinary research and teaching. The institutions role in promoting such efforts has been discussed together with example strategies that were found to be successful as well as those that were not. The article presents results of potential successes in projects where the traditional disciplinary bounds have been breached, and an interdisciplinary approach has been used to achieve project goals. The article also gives examples on what types of sustainability research can be conducted with undergraduate students.

AB  - This article explores how English-language learners' writing evolved during a first-year seminar in science course aimed at developing students' argumentation skills. We highlight how a science communications course was paired with a weekly academic English course in the context of a highly coordinated and enriched first-year experience program for international students. This collaborative model provided students with multiple opportunities for discussion and feedback about their writing. An analysis of the data, including student grades and reflections, revealed significant improvements in students' writing structure and abilities to construct evidence-based arguments. Students also perceived positive changes in their critical thinking and specific writing skills for science. This research is a promising example of how collaboration between science and language faculty leads to the development and facilitation of targeted activities and assignments that improve English-language learners' science communication skills in their first year of study at a university.

AB  - This work describes a semester-long learning module designed to equip students with the analytical and practical skills necessary to be successful in an interdisciplinary polymer research environment. This learning module combines laboratory experiments involving both synthesis and materials characterization with lectures in polymer theory, and encourages chemists and engineers to learn alongside one another. Specifically, students learn air-free Schlenk technique to facilitate the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of a series of homo- and copolymers made from n-butyl methacrylate (BMA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomers. Students analyze these polymers using techniques that traverse the interdisciplinary spectrum--including Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC), Proton-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA)--and learn about the theory and mathematics behind the measurements. Ultimately, this hands-on experience in polymer material design bridges the structure--property relationships taught by classical and applied polymer theory.

AB  - The family and consumer sciences (FCS) teacher shortage is one need that can be mitigated by exposing high school students to professional trends and future work settings via service-learning. Such exposure can affect student recruitment by influencing high school students' knowledge and attitudes toward FCS careers. This study explored the impact of an interdisciplinary service-learning project on secondary FCS students in regards to career choice. Researchers utilized a university educational methods course to expose undergraduate students to recruitment strategies. Knowledge and attitudes about careers in FCS were surveyed in secondary FCS students before and after participation in the university educational methods class project. It was determined that an interdisciplinary service-learning approach is effective in changing high school students' knowledge and attitudes about content taught in FCS courses as well as providing undergraduate FCS students the opportunity to practice skills learned in the classroom.

AB  - In responding to COVID-19 anatomists have succeeded in adapting their teaching to online delivery. However, long-term reliance on this mode of teaching raises the prospect that transferring the whole of the learning environment to an impersonal digital world will lead to loss of anatomy's humanistic side. In looking to a future increasingly dependent upon digital input to teaching, a number of roadblocks are identified. These are: the peril of abandoning the ethos of anatomy; for the workload of staff and especially for female academic staff; by a lack of adequate resources; to the research nature of departments, including the quality of research; to the position of anatomy in the biomedical sciences; and from pressures to retreat from a dissection-based education. In tracing a future trajectory for anatomy, issues outlined are the inevitability of change, the need for anatomy to market itself to the world, and the opportunities presented for anatomy to view itself increasingly as a contributor to broad scholastic endeavors. Suggestions include exploring the possibilities presented by virtual anatomy museums, the use of online learning to reach those not normally in touch with anatomy teaching, and exploring the integrated courses with humanities disciplines. It is concluded that anatomy will flourish if there is a willingness to expand the traditional horizons and be prepared to integrate all that is best in the person-to-person and digital worlds.

AB  - The study of chromatin constitutes one of the most active research fields in life sciences, being subject to constant revisions that continuously redefine the state of the art in its knowledge. As every other rapidly changing field, chromatin biology requires clear and straightforward educational strategies able to efficiently translate such a vast body of knowledge to the classroom. With this aim, the present work describes a multidisciplinary computer lab designed to introduce undergraduate students to the dynamic nature of chromatin, within the context of the one semester course "Chromatin: Structure, Function and Evolution." This exercise is organized in three parts including (a) molecular evolutionary biology of histone families (using the H1 family as example), (b) histone structure and variation across different animal groups, and (c) effect of histone diversity on nucleosome structure and chromatin dynamics. By using freely available bioinformatic tools that can be run on common computers, the concept of chromatin dynamics is interactively illustrated from a comparative/evolutionary perspective. At the end of this computer lab, students are able to translate the bioinformatic information into a biochemical context in which the relevance of histone primary structure on chromatin dynamics is exposed. During the last 8 years this exercise has proven to be a powerful approach for teaching chromatin structure and dynamics, allowing students a higher degree of independence during the processes of learning and self-assessment.

AB  - The Maker Movement has been received by the field of K--12 education with great enthusiasm as a way of teaching STEM content to children. We call attention to and identify learning opportunities in children's projects created in a playful, informal environment with easily available materials. In keeping with research in the field of maker education and learning sciences, we describe tinkering as a constructionist learning activity in which meaning making is captured through transitional objects (Bamberger, 1995). First, we examine one specific tinkering project and identify transitional objects within the project. Next, we discuss the process of meaning making as captured through the transitional objects and identify the significance of children's emerging views of scientific concepts. Finally, we discuss implications for adopting the concept of transitional objects for capturing children's meaning making and learning in the domains of K--12 science and engineering education.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss the need for new approaches to research regarding coding to support students in developing practices in computational thinking, such as abstraction and decomposition, in multidisciplinary contexts. We explore students' activities with a tool integrating constructionist textual programming activity with game-based learning and specifically game modding. In this context, we designed a programmable 'design-to-play' game developed with the computational environment MaLT2. MaLT2 offers the affordances of textual programming, dynamic manipulation, and 3D navigation for the design of 3D animated models aiming to give children access to, otherwise, complex, computational and mathematical ideas. To develop an understanding of children's learning activity regarding computational practices, we organised an empirical study with middle-school students, who played a game called 'Code-the-Mime'. It is a charades-based game in which the players manipulate, programme, and modify a digital human model to describe a word to their teammates. The preliminary findings indicate that the affordances of MaLT2 in conjunction with the game context enabled students to express and develop key computational practices, including decomposition, pattern recognition, analysis and abstraction, in a meaningful and multidisciplinary context.

AB  - As an educator, it is always interesting to learn and employ new and creative ways of thinking and methods in teaching. However, the application of these new ideas in our classrooms needs more examination for better ways of implementation. Since the postmodernist theory and approaches have been practiced in education in the past few decades, the criticisms stated by educators and scholars have led to an examination of its impact on teaching and learning in different fields. In this paper, I would like to bring forth the educational issues under the influence of post-modernist trends and, eventually, develop the new postmodern approach in higher education. In this way, we offer other perspectives, taking into account interdisciplinary theory and principles, as a feasible alternative and prevailing idea in higher education. An interdisciplinary approach will be discussed as a way to solve the problems related to the negative effects of current postmodern issues in education. Contemporary single-disciplinary theories and approaches in education have evolved toward interdisciplinary thinking that integrates different perspectives and fields. These new multiple approaches can serve as the educational basis for reconstructing value of the humanities. This proposition is considered as an issue when facing the critical situation in postmodern education in our society today. In addition, the interdisciplinary thinking will be employed, based on the multiple-perspectives from literature, philosophy, religion, science, and cultural studies. The integration of these related but distinct disciplines will elucidate programs and hopefully serve to inspire the basis for new postmodern education.

AB  - The present study employed population-level educational records from 4 public school student cohorts (n = 112,916; Grades 7-12) in British Columbia (Canada) to examine relationships between music education (any participation, type of participation, music achievement, and engagement level) and mathematics and science achievement in Grade 10 as well as English achievement in Grades 10 and 12, while controlling for language/cultural background, Grade 7 academic achievement, and neighborhood socioeconomic status. Music participation was related to higher scores on all 4 subjects and these relationships were stronger for instrumental music than vocal music (Cohen's d range: 0.28 to 0.44 [small-medium effect sizes] and 0.05 to 0.13 [null-small effect sizes]). School music achievement positively related to scores on all subjects; such relationships were stronger for achievement in instrumental music compared with vocal music. Higher levels of music engagement (number of courses) was related to higher exam scores on all subjects; this pattern was more pronounced for very high engagement in instrumental music (d range: 0.37 to 0.55; medium effect sizes) compared with vocal music (d range: 0.11 to 0.26; small effect sizes). The effect sizes of these group differences are greater than the effect sizes corresponding to average annual gains of students' academic achievement during high school--in other words, highly engaged instrumental music students were, on average, academically over 1 year ahead of their peers. The findings suggest that multiyear engagement in music, especially instrumental music, may benefit high school academic achievement. Findings and implications are discussed within the broader interdisciplinary literature on music learning.
