AB  - In the United Kingdom, the number of mature students studying in higher education is diminishing. This is also the case within the subject of art and design. This article reports on a project "Mature Students Matter," a study that aims to widen participation in art and design education within a small specialist university. The approach was developed from a Research Development Fellowship, which provided a model for the project. A case study is used as a method of inquiry through which the project is described and evaluated using a form of narrative inquiry. The study found that the principles of Joint Practice Development (JPD) underpinning the design and development of the project enabled practitioners from different parts of the university to work together and to share similar aims, objectives and values in their research. Drawing some tentative conclusions, the project also found that the wider institutional context was important in the success of the project.

AB  - Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy is a useful technique for measuring the infrared spectra of solids and liquids as well as probing adsorption on particle surfaces. Several examples of the use of FTIR-ATR spectroscopy in different undergraduate chemistry laboratory courses are presented here. These examples include measuring the infrared spectra of solid and liquid organic compounds commonly used as unknowns and of inorganic solids synthesized by students. The use of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy in the upper-level physical chemistry laboratories will be discussed in Part II where a new experiment involving the adsorption of ions from solution onto oxide particle surfaces is introduced. In addition to the implementation of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy into the undergraduate curriculum, students involved in undergraduate research can use this technique to get high-quality publishable data on a number of interdisciplinary chemically-relevant interesting research projects. [For Part II, see EJ824966.] (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - Contradictory trends emerge relative to Black women's college success: They have doubled their enrollment rates in thirty years but their graduation rates remain behind those of White and Asian women. This integrative, interdisciplinary review of both student- and institutional-level factors explores the role of individual characteristics and backgrounds, relationships, and institutional support structures relative to Black women's success in college. The findings reveal that African American women's lives may be narrowed down in research that includes them through (a) an emphasis on individual factors in college success instead of institutional (within college campuses) or larger sociostructural issues (race, class, or gender inequities in the larger society), (b) a lack of analysis of within-group difference among Black women, and (c) framing the notion of success as persistence or completion of a student's degree program instead of self-identified or unique notions of success such as collective uplift, well-being, or satisfaction.

AB  - The squeeze on instructional time and other factors increasingly leads educators to consider mathematics and science integration in an effort to be more efficient and effective. Unfortunately, the need for common understandings for what it means to integrate these disciplines, as well as the need for improving disciplinary knowledge, appears to continue to be significant obstacles to an integrated approach to instruction. In this study we report the results of a survey containing six instructional scenarios administered to thirty-three middle grades science and math teachers. Analysis of teacher responses revealed that while teachers applied similar criteria in their reasoning, they did not possess common characterizations for integration. Furthermore, analysis suggested that content knowledge serves as a barrier to recognizing integrated examples. Implications for professional development planners include the need to develop and provide teachers with constructs and parameters for what constitutes mathematics and science integration. Continued emphasis on improving teacher content knowledge in both mathematics and science is also a prerequisite to enabling teachers to integrate content.

AB  - Science educators are well-positioned to incorporate civic engagement into the classroom by the natural suitability of the subject matter. Civic engagement, or civic education, is a fairly new, multidisciplinary concept that is becoming a requisite for institutions of higher education; it enables students to become actively involved in the community and with topics of local concern. Historically, civic engagement has routinely been promoted in political science classes, but the new approach applies to a broader range of disciplines. Its' goal is to actively involve students in the community by participating in various discipline-specific activities. In the science classroom, opportunities for civic engagement are nearly limitless; there are many ways that teachers may engage students in community matters to encourage civic involvement and broaden student exposure to issues of public concern. In this article, the author presents  a small sampling of relevant activities that would involve civic engagement in the science classroom. Thus, the author states that by using civic engagement in the classroom, teachers may not only be able to educate their students, but also the broader community, in matters of scientific concern.

AB  - An easily implemented practical exercise in applied science for biology students is presented that uses fungi to degrade an azo-dye. This is an example of bioremediation, the employment of living organisms to detoxify or contain pollutants. Its interdisciplinary nature widens students' perspectives of biology by exposing them to a chemical engineering process. It also demonstrates the use of biological organisms to degrade a relatively complex chemical, Amaranth. This azo-dye, which is vibrant red across a broad pH range, is safe to employ in the student laboratory. Various species of white rot fungi of the genus "Trametes" are able to degrade Amaranth to differing degrees, permitting comparative studies. This laboratory exercise involves observations that occur over the course of 3 days, but may be shortened or lengthened, as desired. Results involving decreases in color intensity may be obtained by making comparisons to color standards or by using a spectrophotometer. In our example, we suggest using species of white rot fungi, including "Trametes versicolor" and "Trametes pubescens". The complexity of the lab is easily modified to challenge students of diverse backgrounds because the degree of difficulty of the exercise is adjustable to suite biology non-majors or majors in introductory through advanced courses.

AB  - This article reports on an interdisciplinary ecology degree that was redesigned to provide more research activity for undergraduates. A case study approach explored how the teaching team constructed a curriculum that used inquiry activities. The development of an inquiry curriculum was enabled by a University audit focusing on the links between teaching and research, a Programme Review that signalled a need for change, and a Programme Director and group of academics committed to change. In addition, curriculum planning discussions were facilitated by an academic staff developer, who developed a shared vision for an inquiry approach during extended conversations amongst the planning group. Consequently, the new programme progressively develops inquiry skills in four out of five core courses (papers/modules). At stages 1 and 2, structured, guided and open inquiry activities lead to an open inquiry capstone course at stage 3.

AB  - This paper presents the concept and results of the research project "Engineer Your Sound!" (2008-2009). It aimed at exploring whether interdisciplinary, innovative teaching/learning settings in the fields of technology and digital media can be used to give pupils the opportunities to experiment and discover their technical potential, skills, interests and talents and if music technology could offer such an appealing context. The paper explains how technology and why gender need to be addressed when planning to raise young people's interest in technology but questions if interest in technology is mainly influenced by gender. The paper explores through ethnographic research how pupils' technological competencies and interests have developed during the course of a technology-related project. Results of the analysis explain how music technology can serve as a suitable theme with the potential to increase both males' and females' interest in technology.

AB  - This article focuses on two early attempts at bridging neuroscience and education, made by Henry Herbert Donaldson (1857-1938), a neurologist, and Reuben Post Halleck (1859-1936), an educator. Their works, respectively entitled "The Growth of the Brain: A Study of the Nervous System in Relation to Education" (1895) and "The Education of the Central Nervous System: A Study of Foundations, Especially of Sensory and Motor Training" (1896), witness early attempts at opening up paths for the application of neurobiological findings to education. We provide an expose of select points from their monographs; published only 1 year apart, both texts constitute significant testimonies of that "Zeitgeist". They shed light on contemporary discussions about gender, neuroplasticity, critical periods, nature and nurture, and sleep/awake rhythms and provide a much needed perspective on the difficulties of founding the new inter- and transdisciplinary field of neuroeducation.

AB  - Public education in the United States has been in a steady decline by almost any measure for the last 29 years since 1980. Losses in placement on international comparisons in science, math and problem solving test scores, equality of education opportunity, teacher supply graduation rates, and rampant leadership turnover, are but a few of the afflictions affecting public education in the United States. These trends, cycling downward, are searching for a bottom (Buchman, 2006; Goldin & Katz, 2008; Heckman & LaFontaine, 2007; National Conference of State Legislatures, 2008). With the release of the 1983 report, "A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform," by National Commission on Excellence in Education, policy makers, not necessarily educational practitioners, have tried their hand at stabilizing the country's failing educational system. The results: wobbly and uncoordinated attempts at changes that cause inter education sector conflict as various professional and union education organizations oppose what is legislatively proposed. Times have changed. With change comes a new concept for transforming and developing educational leaders--the Eduerati Leadership. This "paper/roundtable discussion" provides a review of extant literature and a new conceptual framework in support of the author's contention that "New Eduerati" leadership will initiate the transformation. Driven by an ego that does not need entitlement, Eduerati are futuristic, looking back at the present. Eduerati are the intellectually excited architects of the educational system who, like the Literati and Technerati, are deeply knowledgeable and committed to improving their field with new ways of thinking.

AB  - In Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) programmes, students are expected to master content knowledge and language simultaneously. The worldwide popularity of this kind of programme has called for professional development, particularly for content subject teachers who have to shoulder some responsibilities of language teaching in CLIL. There have been several frameworks or proposals for professional development of CLIL teachers. Yet, empirical studies investigating the effectiveness of CLIL professional development programmes remain scarce. This gap is particularly important, since the relationship between professional development and teacher change is complicated and there are various factors affecting whether and how teacher would change. This study implemented a 6-month professional development programme for a group of content subject teachers in CLIL in Hong Kong. With data gathered with questionnaires, interviews, lesson observations and post-lesson reflections, this paper reports the trajectory of three case teachers who seemed to experience different degrees of changes in beliefs and language awareness. These differences could be explained by the influence of such factors as school context, learning experience and subject discipline. This study yields important implications for teacher education in CLIL and teacher change.

AB  - Faculty members at a large state university engaged in discussions of 21st century communication, new media, and the demands for new communication skills as they elected to establish a Communication across the Curriculum (CxC) program in 2005. Faculty leaders reviewed communication theory (e.g., from McLuhan to Kress), best practices from other programs around the country, and multidisciplinary arguments for an expanded definition of communication. The authors report strategies they used to build consensus, collaboration, and credibility for a "multimodal" communications curriculum. They describe requirements for communication-intensive courses that are being taught in the 4 "modes" of communication (written, spoken, visual, and technological) that the faculty adopted. A distinctive feature of this CxC program is the extent to which students lead in its development and are recognized as "LSU Distinguished Communicators" as they meet high standards, produce extra work, and build public digital portfolios that showcase their outstanding communication skills. A CxC Faculty Summer Institute showcases the contributions to communication instruction on the part of faculty members who serve as consultants to other LSU faculty members. Communication studios in 4 colleges (Art+Design, Arts & Sciences, Basic Sciences, and Engineering) provide extra-curricular resources for collaboration on communication projects, e.g., enhanced technology, software, mentoring by advanced students for other students, and consultations with faculty. Finally, the authors speculate about future developments that will be needed if the program is to stay "cutting edge."

AB  - Santa Clara University's Robotic Systems Laboratory conducts an aggressive robotic development and operations program in which interdisciplinary teams of undergraduate students build and deploy a wide range of robotic systems, ranging from underwater vehicles to spacecraft. These year-long projects expose students to the breadth of and interdependence among engineering disciplines, the span of processes in a system development lifecycle, and the challenges of managing a development process. Over the past five years, this program has provided more than 150 students with exposure to computer science and engineering topics, including software engineering, algorithm development, human-computer interface design, and artificial intelligence. This program provides exciting and compelling educational opportunities for students, offers real-world applications that naturally motivate the need for specific computing technologies, and serves a broader research and development program that utilizes the functional robotic systems to support externally-funded science and technology demonstration missions. The experience of the authors, as well as formal program assessment data, show that this program provides strong student motivation for learning, offers comprehensive and valuable educational experiences, and enhances student performance. This article reviews the Santa Clara robotics program, highlights the role of computer science and engineering in several projects, and presents the assessment data showing the positive results of this program.

AB  - Paul F-Brandwein was a visionary who looked at education broadly. He left us with an insightful view of the ecology of education in which he identified three ecological systems: school-family-community, postsecondary, and cultural. The first part of this lecture, by Dean B. Bennett, examines Brandwein's ideas related to environmental education and explores the relationship of environmental education with science teaching in the K-12 school-family-community ecosystem. Focusing particularly on the middle-secondary level, evidence suggests that the goals of environmental education, since their emergence in the late 1960s, are today strongly evident in science curricula, instructional resources, educational  assessment, and teacher education. But the author points out that more must be done and provides some fundamental suggestions. The second part of the lecture, by Sheila K. Bennett, examines the role of distance education in the teaching of science in the postsecondary ecosystem and addresses its value as a viable tool in promoting scientific literacy. The lecture focuses on a successful statewide, interdisciplinary laboratory science course delivered by interactive television, the Internet, and computer network. Now in its ninth year, the course reflects Brandwein's thinking about effective classroom teaching and is based on national standards for scientific literacy.

AB  - After 10 years of organizing the Cybertech robotics competition, this paper presents this unique and innovative educational experience of teaching engineering at Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (UPM), Spain. Cybertech is not only a well-known robotic contest in Spain due to the "Robotaurus" bullfighting, but is also a whole academic activity spanning theory, laboratory practical lessons, seminars, tutoring, and a spectacular contest in which robots, developed by the students, compete. It is an open activity, for all students and grades, requiring knowledge of various subjects such as mechanics, microcontrollers, control, and electronics. The experience acquired has shown how this novel educational approach can boost the motivation of students, who in a real applied project effectively learn not only the particular subject matter, but also skills in teamwork, oral presentations, budget management, and so on. This is considered the flagship of innovation in education at UPM. This paper describes the evolution of Cybertech over the past 10 years, summarizes the educational experience, and provides some statistics and results as well as a perspective for future editions of the competition.

AB  - Many of the serious public health problems affecting U.S. citizens and the global community can be addressed by prevention science and practice. Instructive standards or guidance for prevention work have largely been missing from the professional literature. Despite empirical evidence that prevention works, the epidemiological literature continues to reflect significant disparities in the health status of ethnic minorities and the poor. The Major Contribution by Hage and colleagues addresses this gap in the literature by offering standards for conducting meaningful and effective prevention work. This response highlights the imperatives for prevention work and other themes that deserve attention if prevention's potential impact on health is to be realized. The author discusses the necessity for training in prevention, multidisciplinary collaboration, and understanding and changing the social determinants of health. Prevention scientists must disseminate effective prevention strategies, and prevention practitioners must work with prevention scientists to adapt these strategies to respond to the challenges of conducting prevention work across diverse settings.

AB  - Unlike students in other engineering disciplines, undergraduates in biological engineering typically have limited opportunity to develop design competencies, and even fewer chances to implement their designed projects. The international Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition is a student Synthetic Biology competition that, in 2009, included 110 teams from across Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the US. Working at their own schools over the summer, the students use a kit of biological parts from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, as well as new parts of their own design, to build biological systems that operate in living cells. Two years of survey data collected from undergraduates after their iGEM experiences in 2007 and 2008 suggest that both learning and identity as a biological engineer increase as a result of iGEM.

AB  - Socioscientific Inquiry (SSI) represents one approach designed to target interest and knowledge in science. In this context, students consider scientific issues that have social implications and require a range of trade-offs, concepts, and considerations in order to arrive at informed conclusions (Sadler, 2004). However, inquiry tasks in general and SSI projects in particular are not widely adopted in K-12 settings, despite strong beliefs among teachers that these types of activities are valuable (Marshall, Horton, Igo, & Switzer, 2009). We suggest Collaborative Action Research may provide an important platform for enabling teachers to experience success through systematic investigations of their practice supported by peer interaction and collaboration (Capobianco & Feldman, 2006). In our investigation, we sought to understand the learning experiences of teachers within redesigned graduate-level courses aimed at preparing teachers to implement SSI approaches in the classroom. Data were collected from course participants to capture changes in scientific content knowledge, perceptions of SSI instruction, and strengths as well as recommendations of the experience. Results suggest that teachers can gain both content knowledge and pedagogical capacity in SSI methods.

AB  - With funding from NSF, the Prime the Pipeline Project (P[cube]) is responding to the need to strengthen the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) pipeline from high school to college by developing and evaluating the scientific village strategy and the culture it creates. The scientific village, a community of high school students, teachers as learners, undergraduate students as mentors, and university scientists as leaders, collaborate to solve challenging long-term problems/projects that develop villagers' expertise with STEM concepts/skills and give them a taste of the work of STEM professionals. Data were collected from both a group of intervention students and a matched control group to address the research question, "Does participation in P[cube] increase students' interest in and success with the study of mathematics and science in high school?" Data were collected through surveys and interviews to address the question, "Does participation in P[cube] change teachers' instructional practice and expectations for student performance?" Results showed that intervention students completed significantly more and more advanced courses in science and mathematics in high school, and their GPAs were significantly higher than their matched controls. Surveys of students' postsecondary plans and intended college majors confirmed increased interest in STEM or business fields. (Contains 9 tables.)

AB  - After receiving a mini-grant for developing integrated information literacy programs, a Geography/Geology Department faculty member worked with the Science Librarian to embed information literacy in a cross-listed geology and geography course, Geog/Geol 455, Introduction to Remote Sensing. Planning for the revisions to the class started with identification of five key literacy standards for the discipline of remote sensing. Each standard was addressed through a combination of teaching, assignments and measurements. From this planning exercise, two lectures and two laboratory exercises on information literacy were developed. Student response to the information literacy material, as measured through pre- and post-course surveys, was overwhelmingly positive. The project also provided an important opportunity for collaboration between the scientist and librarian. (Contains 2 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - GeoJourney is an interdisciplinary field trip in geology, Native American studies, and environmental studies designed for introductory-level undergraduates. The program travels 23,345 kilometers by van to national parks, industrial sites, museums, and Indian reservations in 24 of the United States. During the day, students carry out hands-on projects, field investigations, and hikes. At night, campfire lectures and discussions, along with reading assignments and written exams, enhance the educational experience. Assessment of student conceptual change in the geosciences shows statistically significant improvement beyond that seen in the traditional geoscience classroom setting.

AB  - An action research study investigated how the multiple tasks found in WebQuests facilitate fifth-grade students' literacy skills and higher order thinking. Findings indicate that WebQuests are most successful when activities are carefully selected and systematically delivered. Implications for teaching include the necessity for adequate planning, organization, supervision, and scaffolding of learning in a Web environment. For students, benefits of WebQuests include enhancement of thoughtful literacy through multiple knowledge representations and making learning meaningful through connections to real-life contexts. The study also highlighted interdisciplinary teaching and learning of social studies, science, and language arts. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - "Cross-disciplinary" has become a buzzword in academia. Here the authors offer a student-based perspective on the benefits of cross-disciplinary discussion, based on their experience in New York University's Graduate Forum. Founded ten years ago by Catharine Stimpson, then dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS), the forum brings together graduate students across the university to present their research to each other. This cross-disciplinary discussion has taught them to build bridges between fields and people. By describing how this experience has enriched their work, the authors hope to inspire other institutions to initiate similar programs. In this paper, the authors show how cross-disciplinary exchange has shaped their research, teaching, and communication with colleagues.

AB  - This paper describes the use of a student conference as a novel experience aimed at motivating students enrolled in various computer architecture courses, such as Microprocessor Systems. The goal was to increase student engagement, to decrease failure rates, and to introduce students to the world of research. This multidisciplinary experience enabled students from several universities and cities to participate in a scientific conference while addressing novel research topics. This experience, and the understanding thus gained of the assorted roles of participants in a scientific conference--authors, reviewers, and local, steering, and scientific committees--served to increase the engagement and collaboration of both students and instructors and helped to decrease the dropout rate.

AB  - Pre-service teachers from Texas and Indiana in the United States and from Queensland, Australia, observed the Moon for a semester and compared and contrasted their findings in asynchronous Internet discussion groups. The 188 pre-service teachers were required to conduct inquiry investigations for their methods coursework which included an initial Moon observation assignment, an Internet Moon discussion, and a final project. The Moon context was chosen for its motivating capability, its inherent interdisciplinary makeup, its inclusion in the National Science Education Standards, and its ability to be viewed worldwide. This study was of a mixed method research design and involved pre-service teachers' journals, summative reflections, Internet discussions, final projects, and the Lunar Phases Concept Inventory (LPCI). Analysis of the qualitative data was conducted through the exploration of patterns and themes that illustrated pre-service teachers' conceptual development, and the LPCI was administered as a pre/post assessment. We found that our project led to increased knowledge concerning the mathematics and science involved with understanding the Moon and its phases. We also found that it was beneficial to have Internet discussions with pre-service teachers from around the world, but it was not without its problems (e.g., coordinating schedules and lack of participation by some participants). We discovered that pre-service teachers' exposure to the new uses of technology for teaching and learning did not necessarily translate to their planning to adopt similar techniques in their own classrooms.

AB  - This paper discusses the role of a writing centre in creating spaces for talk about and change in disciplinary writing pedagogy. It asks how collaborative partnerships between disciplinary academics and Writing Centre practitioners might be established and nurtured sustainably. Drawing on insights from two collaborations with academics in political studies and law, the article asserts that writing centre practitioners play a valuable role in talking about and changing the way academic writing and literacy is taught in the disciplines. This is shown by working consistently with the understanding that critical reading, thinking and writing are literacy acts rather than generic skills and must therefore be learned and practiced in the disciplines. By supporting disciplinary academics in re-examining course outcomes, materials and assessments, and moving away from a "skills approach" to writing, it is shown that building discipline-specific spaces for writing and literacy development is possible through these collaborative partnerships.

AB  - This paper elaborates possibilities and limitations for sex education in schools by mapping the consequence of introducing the topic "sex" within a range of scientific and informal discursive settings. The organising and regulating structures of the school maintain the boundaries between common-sense and scientific discourses. Bernstein made a distinction between vertical discourse and horizontal discourses. Vertical discourses characterise scientific discourses that are coherent, explicit and systematically principled structures. Horizontal discourses characterise common-sense discourses that are local, segmented and context-dependent. The implications for teaching sex education through vertical discourses such as science, English and art as opposed to personal and social education, which is a horizontal discourse, are discussed. Yet, all discourses are unstable, and the notion of a "tipping point" is introduced to demonstrate the potential for sex education when vertical discourses collapse. (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - Purpose: This paper assesses an integrated approach in smallholder dairy training through a partnership between Malawi and Scotland. Design/ methodology/ approach: Acute staff shortages and inadequate expertise hamper progress in Malawi's smallholder dairy production despite its potential to substantially contribute to sustainable household income, food and nutritional security. An integrated training initiative trained farmers, extension workers, development managers, researchers and trainers and graduate students (MSc, MPhil, PhD, and Postdoctoral). To date eight graduate students and one post-doctoral scientist have been associated with this programme. Twenty-two experts have exchanged visits between Scotland and Malawi. A total of 28 lead farmers and 43 extension workers have been trained in forage production, feeding, animal breeding and recording. Practical implications: In an evaluation of the programmes, 76% of farmers indicated that they had accessed animal breeding services, and there was a drop of 69% and 34% in milk lost due to mastitis and adulteration, respectively. Three of the MSc students trained in this programme have been recruited as lecturers at Bunda College. Originality/ value: Through this initiative, a practical diploma course in dairy science has been established in Malawi and a flexible programme for life-long learning is envisaged in the future. Both the integrated approach and the partnership model can be used in other countries across the world to enhance local agricultural education and extension.

AB  - Interest to axiosphere as the sphere of values and its correlation with the ever-progressive noosphere as sphere of knowledge of a person is due to comprehension of the modern period in the evolution of society. The aim of the article is to describe an axiological aspect of the research of identity as an element of human and language universes. The material of research is made by the term identity and the ways of its representation in Russian and French (nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives). For achievement of a goal of research, we use the cognitive, discursive and semantic approaches to the studying of the axiological aspect of the identity. The article deals with the modern linguistic axiological analysis and offers a detailed account of "ethnosemimetry" as one of its possible implementations. The work specifies the principles and contexts of the method employment and features an axiological analysis of the lexeme "identity" in the French and Russian languages. The term "identity" is in the spotlight of the modern anthropocentric vector of research. It is recommended that interdisciplinary development of research of "identity" should include complex methods of analysis of the identity as an element of human and language universes.

AB  - Often the differences students see in science and mathematics classrooms are in perspective, approach, or application. Understanding those differences can help teachers to present a unified picture of mathematics and science to their students. In this article, the science teacher is given a glimpse of the treatment of topics shared by both disciplines as they are represented in mathematics texts, with suggestions for better transfer between disciplines.

AB  - The future of science may depend on how education responds to the growing negativism that students and the public show towards science. What is the value of our current teaching methods, if in helping students achieve higher test scores, they also generate a lifelong disdain of science? Achieving a positive attitude towards science must become a major objective of all future teaching methods if we are to reverse the current trend. We can accomplish this by bridging the divide of the Two Cultures that C. P. Snow warned us about, using an innovative method that integrates science with relevant elements from the humanities and the arts. An art gallery can be used effectively as an extension of a science classroom. When properly analyzed, a theater or dance performance, a painting, a novel, a poem, or a film, can enrich and reinforce a science concept beyond traditional lab exercises. When elements of history of science are integrated appropriately in the curriculum, they humanize what is otherwise perceived as a dry, mechanical and impersonal discipline. The author will describe the many benefits and limitations, as well as unexpected discoveries that he has made in his experience with this method.

AB  - The authors of this reply argue that ongoing criticism of existing theories, the development of alternative theories, and empirical theory tests offer the best chance for advancing American Indian research. The authors therefore note their appreciation for the comments of J. Beals et al. The authors nevertheless disagree with many of the specific claims of Beals et al., noting that in their original article, (a) the characterization of the existing literature on reservation-dwelling American Indian drinking was accurate; (b) no argument made by Beals et al. undermines their theoretical contention that there is a relative lack of contingency between access to basic life reinforcers and sobriety on many reservations; (c) the theory was developed in a responsible manner, specifically by a reservation-tied American Indian, and was reviewed by a reservation leadership team, a cultural consultant, and reviewers for this journal, at least one of whom consulted leaders of other reservations; and (d) the theory was based on previous interdisciplinary theory development. The authors encourage the development and testing of new, alternative theories.

AB  - This article examines Web resources in research articles from 30 scholarly journals in disciplines across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. The purpose of the study is to report the degree to which scholars make use of Web-based resources in the journal literature and to identify Web citation characteristics within different subject areas. The study also explores whether any changes emerged between 2001 and 2007. The examination confirms the finding of previous studies that, even though Web resources are not heavily used in journal articles, the number of such resources is increasing. Publicly accessible database repositories and open source software prevail over other Web resources in research communication. The implications for academic libraries are discussed. The study suggests that new strategies need to be developed to manage Web-based information resources.

AB  - The integration of content areas is not a new concept (Moyer, 2000). Integration is promoted by many teacher educators because of its benefits for learners of all ages and backgrounds (Burns, 2005; Douville, Pugalee, & Wallace, 2003; Pica, 2002). Literacy in general, but reading in particular, is important across the content areas. Mathematics teachers who integrate literature into mathematics recognize that mathematical understanding involves reading and writing. Conversely, mathematical reasoning and problem solving can be found in authentic reading and writing materials (Moyer, 2000). Despite the many benefits of cross-content integration, there exists a great "need for professional development that assists teachers in changing their conceptual perspectives to integration while also building pedagogical knowledge related to integration of science, mathematics, and literacy" (Douville et al., 2003, p. 388). There are numerous opportunities to expound upon and investigate mathematical knowledge and understanding through reading and writing. The challenge is to prepare mathematics teachers to integrate mathematics and literacy in a way that not only promotes students' understandings and appreciation of reading and writing but also deepens mathematical conceptualization.

AB  - Systemic understanding of potential research activities and available technology seeds at university level is an essential condition to promote interdisciplinary and vision-driven collaboration in an attempt to cope with complex sustainability and environmental problems. Nonetheless, any such practices have been hardly conducted at universities due mainly to a lack of appropriate institutional schemes and methodologies to systemically collect, map out, and synthesize individual research activities within a university. In this paper, we present the recent initiative of such systemic and comprehensive understanding of research activities at university level. We carry out a case study, attempting to summarize all the relevant research activities and technology seeds associated with environmental issues and sustainability currently being studied individually at the laboratory level at Osaka University. We collected 138 potential seeds from the university's relevant schools and institutes and sorted them according to Japan's three sustainability visions. The case study demonstrates the university's potential to provide collective knowledge enabling the societal transition to sustainability if these seeds are systematically overviewed and effectively mobilized to mesh with specific social demands and purposes. We highlight the need for a framework and practice that allows synthesizing research activities and promising technologies even at university level to further facilitate providing collective knowledge and discuss challenges and research needs for promoting synthesis practices and interdisciplinary research that are essential to deal with sustainability problems.

AB  - The focus of this descriptive study was to determine the type and frequency of collaborative activities occurring between agriculture teachers and science teachers who taught in schools with agricultural education programs. Additional foci of this study included determining the extent to which science and agriculture teachers value collaborative practices, identifying factors that facilitate collaboration, and identifying barriers inhibiting collaboration. Although results indicate that most science and agriculture teachers hold positive attitudes concerning the potential for collaboration, reported collaborative activities between the groups was limited, with science teachers indicating less collaboration occurring than agriculture teachers. The large majority of science teachers indicated that they have not attended workshops demonstrating agriscience integration, and both groups identified lack of preparation time as the most significant barrier inhibiting collaboration. Moreover, both groups indicated that close proximity of facilities, teacher commitment, teacher attitude toward science and agriculture, frequent professional interaction, and administrator support facilitate collaboration.

AB  - The aim of this self-study was to critically consider the authors' individual thinking and practices as they worked toward a shared understanding of connecting science and literacy during instruction. As teacher educators from different disciplines, this work required them to carefully and recurrently examine their individual understandings of the purposes and processes underlying curriculum integration. It also asked the authors to consider and reconsider integrated instruction through the lens of a colleague whose disciplinary focus is different from their own. Through this process, the authors refined their individual understandings of curriculum integration and negotiated enough of a shared perspective to develop and operationalized definition of what it means to make meaningful connections across disciplines during instruction.

AB  - One of the benefits of working at the middle school level is the opportunity to work with colleagues in a variety of content areas; this not only makes work more interesting, but offers a multidisciplinary approach to learning that ultimately benefits the students. In the Londonderry (New Hampshire) School District, collaboration between classroom teachers and school librarians has been integral to the ongoing success of a district-wide library instructional program. In this article, the authors describe the development of a successful coteaching effort at Londonderry Middle School. They also describe a lesson which used historical stories and provided students with an opportunity to engage in such 21st-century learning skills as cooperation and collaboration, technology integration, and critical and creative thinking.

AB  - This study describes the characteristics of pre-service teachers' discourse on a WebCT Bulletin Board in their investigations of local streams in an integrated mathematics and science course. A qualitative analysis of data revealed that the pre-service teachers conducted collaborative discourse in framing their research questions, conducting research and writing reports. The science teacher educator provided feedback and carefully crafted prompts to help pre-service teachers develop and refine their work. Overall, the online discourse formats enhance out-of-class communication and support collaborative group work. But the discourse on the critical examination of one another's point of views rooted in scientific inquiry appeared to be missing. It is suggested that pre-service teachers should be given more guidance and opportunities in science courses in carrying out scientific discourse that reflects reform-based scientific inquiry.

AB  - It is demonstrated that the popular three-parameter logistic model can lead to markedly inaccurate individual ability level estimates for mixture populations. A theoretically and empirically important setting is initially considered where (a) in one of two subpopulations (latent classes) the two-parameter logistic model holds for each item in a measuring instrument, while (b) this model as well as the three-parameter logistic model for an item with guessing are valid for the instrument in the second class. Fitting the respective hybrid models then to the overall data set, with the three-parameter logistic model assumed for that item, is found to lead to notably inaccurate individual trait score estimates in either class. The implications of the reported results for contemporary empirical educational and behavioral research are finally discussed.

AB  - Performance is a key tool in emergency preparedness and the rehearsal of professional response, simultaneously raising questions about the practice of cultural assumptions in this context. Usually the actors in preparedness exercises are civil servants who perform the work of the nihilistic imagination in often-apocalyptic fictional scenarios, performing the unthinkable without an audience. Their improvised words and actions reveal decisions of life and death made by the few on behalf of the many which are then filtered, through preparedness publications, to the public. This article examines a public preparedness exercise called "Emergency Exercise 2010: Operation Snowman", which took place during the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Festival of Social Science in 2010. It formed part of an ESRC-funded project, "Preparedness Pedagogies, and Race: An Interdisciplinary Approach" (2009-10) which was informed by Critical Race Theory (CRT) and psychoanalytic interpretation. The exercise was held in a local authority nuclear bunker in Sussex. Young drama students were invited to perform in the roles of preparedness professionals to explore the validity of cultural assumptions perceived in preparedness exercises. Through the use of Freud's writing on the "uncanny", this article explores the performance of race in the preparedness exercise, focusing in particular on the "uncanny" role assigned to a black minority ethnic (BME) corpse in this context. Following Zizek's analysis of the relationship between government and cultural industries (2002, 16), this paper critiques such a use of theatre application as a tool for the elite and argues for the application of "othered" performance for public preparedness.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe the experience of the Agriculture Engineering School of Barcelona (ESAB), where undergraduate students were involved in field research experiments on organic waste use in agricultural systems. Design/methodology/approach: The paper outlines how the formation of professionals oriented to work for OWM companies has been successfully promoted. Findings: Agricultural systems can assimilate self-produced organic wastes (OW) and others from different sources. Their management for crop production can generate enormous economic and environmental benefits which can contribute to sustainable development. The implementation of an integrated strategy for OW treatment (OWT) and management (OWM) must be adapted to the characteristics of the specific geographical region and must consider the interrelations among diverse subjects such as: soil science, fertilizer management, plant production, animal husbandry, farm machinery, climate and culture. Practical implications: The education of future specialists in OWM requires a multidisciplinary education which can be effectively achieved if those topics are incorporated into the educational programs of agriculture engineering schools. Originality/value: The paper shows how agricultural systems can assimilate self-produced organic wastes from different sources. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - This case study involved year 9 students carrying out project work in biology via problem-based learning. The purpose of the study was to (a) find out how students approach and work through ill-structured problems, (b) identify some issues and challenges related to the use of such problems, and (c) offer some practical suggestions on the implementation of problem-based project work. Data sources included observation and field notes, students' written documents, audiotapes and videotapes of students at work, and student interviews. The findings showed that several students initially experienced difficulties in identifying a problem themselves but after discussing with family and friends, were able to overcome this initial barrier and subsequently formulated personally meaningful problems for investigation. The ill-structured problems stimulated students to pose questions which charted their courses of action, leading to independent inquiry. Students were led to investigate multidisciplinary elements beyond the boundaries of typical school science, and also learned about different modes of inquiry. The issues and challenges identified included identifying a problem for investigation; asking questions to negotiate the learning pathway; deciding what areas to pursue, given a multitude of possibilities; and figuring out how to extract relevant information from the available mass. Implications of the findings for instructional practice are discussed.

AB  - Although the integration of subjects in the curriculum has been advocated in recent years, there exist limited opportunities for teachers of different subjects to implement integrated curricula in schools collaboratively. In this paper, we consider history as a humanities subject that could be integrated with STEM and explore the diverse history-related learning goals found in teacher-developed STEAM curriculum materials. Using integrated STEAM curricula developed by 13 cross-subject teacher teams in Korea, we analyze the presentation of history-related learning goals in the curricula and report several patterns identified across the curricula. First, the majority of the curricula aimed for the learners to identify themselves in their regional and national histories, but other levels of identification were also aimed for. Second, all the curricula included goals related to historical analysis skills, which were sometimes integrated with scientific inquiry skills. Third, we found several goals related to eliciting students' moral response to history, particularly when the curriculum topic concerned issues at the national level. Fourth, the integration of subjects allowed for exhibiting learners' historical understanding through various activities and in explanatory, persuasive, and imaginative manners. Overall, the analysis pointed to several ways in which the goals of history learning can interact with those of STEM learning, which can be useful for future research and practice in integrated curriculum. We discuss some potential challenges of integrating history with STEM, such as issues that can arise from the use of the "nation" as a context for STEAM learning.

AB  - The concept of nanotechnology was first introduced in 1959 by Richard Feynman at a meeting of the American Physical Society. Nanotechnology opens the door to an exciting new science/technology/engineering field. The possibilities for the uses of this technology should inspire the imagination to think big. Many are already pursuing such feats through medical research in cancer treatment options and environmental efforts to aid in water purification and environmental protection. The range of fields to which nanotechnology may be applied today includes "electronics, communications, automotive, aerospace, materials, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, energy technology, space exploration, the environment, national security, health care, and other life sciences." With emphasis on environmental issues, health care, and business/industry accomplishments, this article provides insight into some of the potential of the field of nanotechnology.

AB  - As universities move towards more vocationally oriented courses, students expect pedagogic practices that make closer ties to potential workplaces. The pedagogical approach of authentic learning is well suited to this purpose as it proposes an apprenticeship-type model and a model that brings simulated work tasks into the classroom. In the social sciences, authentic learning is under-utilised and under-theorised as these subject areas do not fit easily into these models. An alternative model of authentic learning aims to offer students opportunities to "enmind" the requirements of a discipline, be critically reflective about that discipline, and to develop the skills to bring the discipline into their subjective experience. Using this model for authentic learning as a starting point, the authors have examined the applicability of authentic learning to the social sciences, derived relevant design principles and applied these to produce a learning design for a sociology subject that can be tested and critiqued. The purpose of this paper is to present this learning design as a starting point for discussion about a new form of authentic learning. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Understanding the relevance of basic science knowledge in the determination of patient assessment, diagnosis, and treatment is critical to good medical practice. One method often used to direct students in the fundamental process of integrating basic science and clinical information is problem-based learning (PBL). The faculty facilitated small group discussion format traditionally used for PBL is a significant challenge for faculty and facilities with a large class. To provide inductive learning to a large class early in the preclerkship curriculum, a series of online, case-based tutorials was created using the method of inquiry-based learning. The tutorial paradigm is designed to challenge students through a guided inquiry process in which clinical skills and basic science information are seamlessly joined. The psychosocial dimension of patient care is added to the documented case presentation of the tutorials in the form of patient/physician history taking and physical examination videos. These videos augment the written case with additional information providing the student with visual exposure in methods of patient communication and appropriate professional patient/physician interactions that address competencies of patient care, communication, and professionalism. The tutorials were made available via learning management system course sites. The study tracked usage of the tutorials by 270 first-year medical students. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - Students are concerned about what happens to the animals in the aftermath of natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and tsunami. They have remarkable compassion for animals. Students want to know if dolphins, manatees, and sea turtles survive. Furthermore, they want to know what they can do to help. Hence, a variety of teachable moments emerge from these incidents. Student curiosity provides a springboard for discussions ranging from weather, to conservation, to biology. Teachers can use these real-world events that spark students' interest to integrate content and interdisciplinary activities. Additionally, students can learn about ways they can help the environment recover from natural disasters. This article talks about the pollution and biological effects of hurricanes and tsunamis to the animals and provides biology and conservation activities that can help middle school teachers integrate various subjects into their weather lessons using students' concern for animals as a starting point. Additionally, by incorporating the information included about hurricane and tsunami impacts on animals, teachers can effectively address the National Science Education Standards in a meaningful way.

AB  - Recent educational studies have found evidence that measures of fine motor skills are predictive of educational outcomes. However, the precise nature of fine motor skills has received little attention in these studies. With evidence mounting that fine motor skills are an important indicator of school readiness, investigating the nature of this measure and explaining its association with achievement is a key priority for researchers (Cameron et al., 2012). This interdisciplinary study uses theory and measures from neuropsychology to decompose the association between the design copying task and mathematics achievement into fundamental component cognitive processes. The primary aim was to examine the construct validity of design copying as a predictor of mathematics achievement. This study was developed to answer three research questions: (1) Using robust direct measures of cognitive processes, can we replicate the association between design copying and mathematics achievement found in previous studies? (2) How well do the component processes from the visuospatial, sensorimotor, and EF domains together explain this association? (3) Which specific component processes are helpful in explaining the association between design copying and mathematics achievement? To answer the research questions, baseline data from the pilot data of the Minds In Motion Intervention were used. The pilot study took place in several elementary after-school programs located in two demographically different counties in the same Mid-Atlantic state (one in a light farming region and the other in a suburban region). Participants included 145 Kindergarten, first, and second grade students enrolled in school-based after-school programs. The children ranged in age from 5 years 3 months to 8 years 3 months. A multiple mediation model to simultaneously evaluate the contribution of each of the proposed component cognitive processes to the association between design copying and mathematics achievement (Preacher & Hayes, 2008) was adopted. To answer the first research question, the authors determined whether the expected association between design copying and mathematics achievement was observed in the study sample, while controlling for children's age, race, and gender. To answer the second research question, the authors determined the extent to which measures of visuospatial processing, sensorimotor processing, and EF, taken together, mediated this association. To answer the final research question, the authors explored whether specific measures from each of the three domains mediated the relation between design copying and mathematics, while controlling for the other component processes as well as age, race, and gender. Families were recruited into the study in November and December of 2009 and completed a 13- item family questionnaire. This questionnaire included demographic information such as gender, race, and the child's age, which were used as covariates in the analysis. Three findings are evident from this study. First, the results establish a strong direct association between design copying and mathematics achievement (r = .71), a relation suggested by previous research associating fine motor skills with academic achievement. Second, the association between design copying and mathematics achievement is partially mediated by multiple cognitive component processes. Third, because the model only partially explains the association between design copying and mathematics, other underlying cognitive processes that were not examined in this study need to be explored as additional constructs important for explaining this association. The most parsimonious interpretation of results taken as a whole, is that the association between children's performance on the design copying task and their mathematics achievement can be attributed to a common dependence on visuospatial skills, EF, and possibly other cognitive component processes yet to be identified. Such studies are important for moving education science beyond identifying which skills are predictive of school readiness to understanding why these skills are important. A table and a figure are appended.

AB  - Global Public Health is a course that allows students to learn about the complexity of communicable and noncommunicable diseases, determinants of health, and delivery of health services. The Global Public Health course partnered with the Center for International Students to co-host International Education Week in November 2017. Specifically, the course held a "global successes" poster presentation event highlighting various initiatives including disease reduction, cash transfer programs, health system comparisons, and emergency preparedness. The project encouraged a dissection of the biological aspects while also focusing on the socioeconomic contexts, geo-political partners, and advocacy efforts to determine the factors that played into successful health initiatives. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected to assess project outcomes. The reach of the event was with the campus and local communities. Students reported that the project allowed them to develop an appreciation for the vastness of global health, while also identifying the importance of sustainability.

AB  - The need for the integration of generic skills training into structured PhD programmes is widely accepted. However, effective integration of such training requires flexible delivery mechanisms which facilitate self-paced and independent learning. A video recording was made of an eminent speaker delivering a 1-h live presentation to a group of 15 first-year science and engineering PhD research students. The topic of the presentation was inter-disciplinary professional communication skills. Following the presentation, the video recording was post-processed into seven alternative podcast formats. These podcast formats included a typed transcription, a full audio recording, a full video recording, presentation slides with embedded speech etc. The choice of podcast formats was based on ease-of-production by a typical computer-literate academic and ease-of-use by a typical computer-literate student. At a subsequent session, the seven podcast formats were shown to the 15 students and a survey to assess their reactions to the various formats was carried out. The survey results (quantitative and qualitative) were analysed to provide useful insight into the student preferences in relation to podcast formats. The students expressed a clear preference for summary key-point slides with explanatory voice-over by the original speaker. (Contains 2 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - The Molecular Genetics and Protein Structure and Function workshop is one of a series of workshops offered by the National Science Foundation-funded Center for Workshops in the Chemical Sciences. The workshop provides a hands-on introduction to current topics and techniques in molecular genetics and protein structure/function as applied to undergraduate education. This article describes a unique method for planning such a workshop, namely a participant-oriented approach including research-based lectures and experiments. This approach gives faculty from undergraduate institutions a rich perspective and practical experience in this interdisciplinary field of science, integrating aspects of both molecular biology and biochemistry. An outlook on current cutting edge techniques and the direction of future research in this field may enable the faculty participants to better prepare undergraduate students for careers in the workforce or graduate or professional programs.

AB  - In 2005, the School of Property, Construction and Project Management at RMIT University, Melbourne, introduced a new curriculum format for all first year students. All students enrolling in one of the four undergraduate degrees offered by the school commenced a common first year programme. This new curriculum was adopted to provide students with a broader depth of knowledge and experience across all study areas and to provide greater skill enhancement for graduates. The common first year university experience allows students to build a multidisciplinary degree based upon their interests and skills. But the common first year has created a number of challenges for the lecturing staff: extremely large classes, space and resourcing issues, assessment and administration problems; greater strains upon technology; and increase in the impersonal nature of the learning environment. This paper examines how one of these large first year classes (construction science) was conducted to address some of the learning issues arising from a common first year. It describes how students were encouraged over the semester to electronically build and create a classroom resource of e-reference material on construction science topics, which was the basis for classroom discussion, interaction and assessment. The result was an electronic reference folder on CD that provided students with both a starting point for assignments, class interaction and assessment, and the development of vital information technology literacy skills.

AB  - A three-part experiment that leads to the synthesis of palladium(II) complex starting from a C[subscript 3]-symmetric triaminoguanidinium-based ligand is presented. In the first part, the preparation of tris-benzylidenetriaminoguanidinium chloride ([H[subscript 6]Br[subscript 3]L]Cl) by an acidic catalyzed 3-fold imine formation reaction of 5-bromo-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde and triaminoguanidinium chloride is described. Starting from the second part, the reaction procedures are performed under inert gas atmosphere. The conversion of PdCl[subscript 2] with acetonitrile to give [Pd(MeCN)[subscript 4]]Cl[subscript 2] as a precursor is performed at 80 °C. The third part of the experiment is a three-step procedure that begins with deprotonation of [H[subscript 6]Br[subscript 3]L]Cl, followed by transfer of [Pd(MeCN)[subscript 4]]Cl[subscript 2] to the reaction flask, where the chelation of Pd(II)-precursor leads to the in situ species [Pd(MeCN)H[subscript 3]Br[subscript 3]L]. Addition of PPh[subscript 3] as the final reaction step yields [Pd(PPh[subscript 3])H[subscript 3]Br[subscript 3]L]. This sequence of experiments provides an excellent example of ligand and transition metal preparation and its subsequent complexation to form an oxidant-sensitive organometallic species. Undergraduate students get the opportunity to learn Schlenk techniques and to investigate [superscript 1]H NMR spectra of organic and organometallic compounds starting from relatively simple to more advanced spectra. The distinct result of the chemical shift of the [superscript 4]J[subscript P-H]-affected doublet mirrors the preparative success of the student and demonstrates the utility of [superscript 1]H NMR experiments.

AB  - This paper distinguishes among "contextualizing", "conceptualizing", and "problem-centring" as three basic approaches to interdisciplinary curriculum. This typology is based on the type of inquiry that takes place in the classroom. For example, if the guiding epistemology in the interdisciplinary work is that of the humanities, the mode of connecting disciplinary material is likely to be "contextualizing", or embedding the facts and ideas in the cultural, historical, or ideological fabric. If the scientific method guides and sets the standard for integration, "conceptualizing" work typically takes place. Finally, if the spirit and mode of inquiry is that of the applied sciences or creative product-development, the integrative process will take the form of "problem-based" investigation of urgent or tangible issues. Using empirical data from exemplary university, pre-university, and professional programmes in the US, I describe three integrative strategies and comment on their strengths. This basic typology provides alternative approaches to interdisciplinary material based on the purpose of the class inquiry. In the hands of a good instructor, several interdisciplinary strategies could be used together for mutual benefit. (Contains 4 notes.)

AB  - This article describes the Dancing across Disciplines (DAD) project (1998-2002), which the author conceived in the idealism of the potential of dance and music as the great levelers, in the promise of the celebration of difference through rhythm and song, funded by a $225,000, three-year grant from the US Department of Education's Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education. The project was sponsored by and housed at the Intercultural Dance and Music Institute (INDAMI) at Florida International University (FIU)'s Latin American and Caribbean Center in Miami where the author has served as founder and director since 1992. Fundamental premises of the DAD project are that movement is basic to all human experience and that knowledge is interrelated. Learning is most effective when it is interactive, collaborative, interrelated, and problem-based in the real world. A primary goal of the DAD project was to establish a model of interdisciplinary program development that can be replicated within the arts, humanities, social sciences, and related fields in other institutions of higher learning. Twentieth Century education has been constructed on the compartmentalization of knowledge into discrete disciplines. These disciplines have been organized into departments that function within institutions built upon hierarchical structures of power. Learning, for the most part, has been "teacher-centered" and focused on the acquisition of this compartmentalized knowledge. With the rapid development and flow of information technology and increasing globalization, it is incumbent to embrace a new integrative, interdisciplinary, intercultural 21st Century model. In this model, the learner is at the center; faculty teach in teams and function as "model learners"; information and knowledge flows freely across boundaries of departments, centers and institutes, the community, nation, and world.

AB  - In a highly collaborative process we developed an introductory science course sequence to improve science literacy especially among future elementary and middle school education majors. The materials and course features were designed using the results of research on teaching and learning to provide a rigorous, relevant and engaging, standard based science experience. More than ten years of combined planning, development, implementation and assessment of this college science course sequence for nonmajors/future teachers has provided significant insights and success in achieving our goal. This paper describes the history and iterative nature of our ongoing improvements, changes in faculty instructional practice, strategies used to overcome student resistance, significant student learning outcomes, support structures for faculty, and the essential and informative role of assessment in improving the outcomes. Our experience with diverse institutions, students and faculty provides the basis for the lessons we have learned and should be of help to others involved in advancing science education.

AB  - This article revisits the famous "two cultures" debate between F.R. Leavis and C.P. Snow, with a view to examining its relevance to the academic field of physical education. Snow, in his 1959 lecture, lamented the "gulf of mutual incomprehension" that had developed within the education system between the sciences and the humanities. In hostile response, Leavis contended that Snow's lecture did little more than unreasonably promote the sciences over the humanities. Our article looks at how the sciences and humanities have coexisted within the interdisciplinary domain of physical education in the modern university. We advocate the need for a humanistic approach extending across the sciences and the humanities and social sciences. Relatedly, drawing on the ideas of Leavis, we conclude by contemplating the possibility of a common "creative front" within physical education to the mutual benefit of science and the humanities.

AB  - This study explores the inclusion of the visual arts in mathematics instruction as a means of piquing students' interest in a topic that is frequently regarded as difficult. We evaluate numerous research that have been undertaken in this situation by completing an extensive literature study. Our findings show that the inclusion of visual arts in mathematics instruction has been helpful in piquing students' attention, boosting their motivation, and creating possibilities for them to investigate challenging mathematical ideas in a more imaginative way. These results provide a deeper understanding of the importance of visual arts in creating an engaging mathematics learning environment. The study also highlights challenges that need to be addressed and provides insights for further development in the application of visual arts in mathematics education. Thus, the integration of visual arts has significant potential to build interest in mathematics and enrich students' learning experiences.

AB  - This paper builds a case that broadens the purpose of entrepreneurship education beyond the walls of the business school to include diverse fields of study at the tertiary level. Entrepreneurship, as a discipline, transcends traditional business school programmes that constrict its holistic nature. It has long been recognized that entrepreneurs are much more than small business owners/managers or self-employed people. They are more aptly described as agents of change and disruption and, more importantly, entrepreneurs can be found in every sector of society. The emerging science of complexity holds a great deal of promise as a theoretical framework for the entrepreneurial journey. The field of entrepreneurship is holistic and interdisciplinary in nature. Entrepreneurship requires a much broader sweep than what the business school curriculum alone can offer. The "end" of entrepreneurship calls for a whole new field of study to unfold and emerge.

AB  - The role of curriculum in the official educational process is widely recognized by the international scientific community. Beginning in the 19th century, and perhaps even earlier, curriculum research began, not only to be systematized, but to also constitute an autonomous field of study. On the other hand, curriculum evaluation has captured the attention of experts involved in the science of education over the last few years. This article will present the results arising from research with respects to curriculum evaluation in Greece along with a micro-model proposed for the evaluation of the Cross-Thematic Unified Curriculum Framework and the corresponding Individual Subject Curricula that are applied today in compulsory Greek education.

The data presented here highlight the challenge of such programs. I review the purpose, organization, and content of the interdisciplinary curriculum, noting those challenges that arise. Not only do such programs require collaboration among faculty who traditionally has been highly invested in their individual discipline or department, but they also require an active, deliberate process to foster interdisciplinary integration and student learning.

AB  - This paper describes the outcomes of a two-day Higher Education focus group meeting at Blencathra Field Centre, Cumbria, in November 2003. A review of the current status of fieldwork in undergraduate courses was undertaken. The data available indicates that although the number of students enrolling in Biological Science courses has increased, in practice this potential increase in fieldwork provision has not been realised. As well as a decline in the number of students enrolling on university courses with a strong fieldwork tradition, it was found that the courses themselves are shifting away from the inclusion of outdoor learning activities. The reasons given by tutors regarding the benefits and problems of running HE fieldwork courses is discussed and compared to research with teachers in secondary school education. Current action undertaken by HE institutions to sustain and improve fieldwork provision is highlighted: this includes offering more overseas trips and adopting inter-disciplinary and inter-institutional approaches. Finally, the importance of "top down" and "bottom up" forces in determining the amount and quality of biology fieldwork in the future is discussed. Both the wording of the QAA Benchmark statements ("top down") and what happens in the Secondary Schools and Sixth Form Colleges("bottom up") are of the utmost importance in determining the survival of fieldwork in HE biology courses.

AB  - I argue that creating "interfaces" between the humanities and cognitive sciences would be intellectually stimulating for both groups. More specifically for the humanities: they might gain challenging and rewarding avenues of inquiry, attract more funding, and advance their position in the 21st-century universities and among the general public, if they engage in interface projects with cognitive science and other disciplines that seek to improve our understanding of what it means to be human. I discuss a potential research framework of non-linear dynamics for such interfaces, and argue that it alleviates some of the concerns of reductionism and determinism that scholars in the humanities might have in relation to the scientific approach. I also discuss some general examples from the study of human speech of how successful interfaces have been built and might be extended to other areas relevant to the humanities. (Contains 8 notes.)

AB  - The new reorganization of university education has involved relevant changes in teaching and learning methodologies in order to help students to learn more effectively and to develop important skills and competences demanded by the professional world. In this sense the new configuration of the degree in Chemical Engineering required the identification of the main general and transferable skills, the implementation of the new teaching and learning strategies necessary to achieve them and, in addition, an evaluation procedure for determining the importance and the degree of development of a student's skills and competences. In this exercise, two obligatory chemical reactor engineering subjects of the still-in-effect Chemical Engineering degree were chosen as examples of competence-based learning disciplines. For each one, a significant group of transferable and specific skills were selected to be developed. The identification and selection of skills was made according to the recommendations of the European Federation of Chemical Engineering (EFCE) together with the established requirements in the ministerial order for the new Chemical Engineering Degree (Ministerial order CIN/351/2009). In order to check the effectiveness of teaching strategies in helping students to acquire these abilities, specific questionnaires were designed. These tests allowed for the utility of the competences in question to be evaluated in terms of the students' professional work as future chemical engineering graduates and also facilitated the perception of skill development acquired through the methodology implemented in these subjects. The results of the skill evaluation questionnaires revealed the importance that both university collectives (students and professors) give to the development of transferable skills. These skills included the ability to communicate effectively (including in English), to work in multidisciplinary teams and learn on one's own accord, and to be aware of the need for life-long learning. Furthermore, students and teachers agreed that there is a direct correlation between the higher development of specific skills and the chemical engineering learning outcomes. In this sense, an important effort should be devoted to the development of a students' transferable skills by way of modifying the current teaching-learning system (partial substitution of lectures with tutorials and seminars, strategies based on problem-solving, projects and case studies (individual or student team-work), use of internet and electronic tools, etc.).

AB  - There is much that can be learned from a curriculum developed in The Netherlands, a country famous for having been "claimed from the sea." Nothing can be truer than that, but there is more to the story than just the physical aspect of claiming land from the water. The identity of the Dutch, the history of their maritime and seafaring nation, its economy's dependence on world trade, even the existence of democracy and religious freedom--these are all related to the water that surrounds the inhabitants of the River Rhine's delta in northwestern Europe. In 2008, a survey showed that many young people in The Netherlands were not aware of the fact that they live largely below sea level and that this geographical setting entails a number of potential risks. Employment surveys also detected a future shortage of experts in the water sector. To meet these challenges, the government launched a public awareness campaign called "The Netherlands Live with Water," which aimed to raise awareness about: (1) Benefits and risks to a human society of living in a river delta; (2) Consequences of human behavior on the watery environment and for the future; and (3) Job opportunities and professions in the water sector. SLO, the Netherlands Institute for Curriculum Development, designed a curriculum framework for water education to guide teachers as they plan lessons, and to help in the development of programs in which schools and institutes work together to develop in- and out-of-school learning opportunities. (The authors were part of the curriculum development team.) In this article, the authors present examples from "Water Education: Curriculum Framework" that integrate the different subject areas and offer direction and coherence to this large topic. They intend this framework to integrate various disciplines (such as science, literature, and art), but in this article they emphasize its connection with the social studies. The topic of water can be related to just about all of the ten themes defined in National Curriculum Standards for Social Studies.

AB  - In a recent influential report by the National Research Council, the role of the laboratory was introduced as follows: "Science courses and the laboratories associated with them should cultivate the ability of students to think independently. They should provide students with exposure to realistic scientific questions and highlight those aspects that are inherently interdisciplinary. They can also provide opportunities for students to learn to work cooperatively in groups." The role of educators requires that they facilitate the students' journey toward independent learning in accordance with current standards in science pedagogy, but they must also remain alert as to what students actually learn and how they learn it. The incorporation of digital data-acquisition systems into the human physiology curriculum has provided wonderful opportunities for student-centered investigative activities in the laboratory. In the experience of this author, these systems have successfully transformed the physiology laboratory. Students are now more willing than ever to work cooperatively in designing and carrying out their experiments. In accordance with modern science pedagogy guidelines, they collect, analyze, and present their own data while being careful to interpret their findings using established physiological principles. However, it has become apparent that students seldom gain an understanding of the "process" by which data are collected. In addition, more often than not, students could not interpret the values on their screen in real time. In other words, they accepted the data generated by these devices at face value without ever questioning the accuracy or application of these values. This realization, unexpected and unpleasant as it may have been, should not have been surprising as, up to that point, there was no place in the curriculum to discuss issues of instrument reliability and validity. This article describes a brief exercise which is administered during the fifth week of the author's semester-long, sophomore-level Human Physiology course. By that time, students have become familiar with the data-acquisition systems and have even performed experiments of their own design using the EMG module (which includes a basic calibration).

AB  - Research experience has been proven to be effective in enhancing the overall educational experience for undergraduate students. In this article, two engineering research projects with undergraduate students involvement are discussed. The projects provided the undergraduate student researchers with motivation for independent research work and learning experiences in the areas of sensor characterization, analog and digital filter design, electronic circuit design, printed circuit board layout, and feedback control design. The students also helped a faculty member to conduct research work and develop curricular materials. The seamless combination of learning, research, curriculum development, and outreach based on the research projects illustrates the importance of research with the involvement of undergraduate students.

AB  - Background/Context: Soon after the United States Department of Education began making changes to the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) system, education librarians concluded that there was a need for a fresh approach to addressing education information needs. Considering the importance of information systems in education, they agreed that a new subdiscipline of education should be promoted called education informatics. This subdiscipline would incorporate new technologies and learning strategies to enhance the capture, organization, and utilization of education information. Some of the information challenges facing the discipline of education are: gaps in existing information resources; lack of a centralized body of education information experts to influence the development of new education resources; scarce resources for the development of concepts, models, theories, and techniques related to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) for learning and teaching; minimal understanding of how people access and use education information and digital information resources, services, systems, environments, and media for learning; and lack of support for international and cross-cultural collaborations in education informatics. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: The creation of a subdiscipline within the field of education that examines issues that fall at the intersection of education information and information technology is critical. Once there is a broader recognition of the existence of this subdiscipline, it is likely that research funding will increase, specialized expertise will be expanded, and new programs and systems related to education information will be developed. Research Design: The research design for this article is an analytic essay. Conclusions/Recommendations: The process of becoming an established discipline of education informatics could be advanced through an invited symposium. Grounding it in schools of education would establish an academic identity. Such an interdisciplinary field needs attention from funding agencies and research leadership; acceptance by faculty and students; and systemic implementation in universities. The establishment of a "center" for education informatics would address problems that require many resources, incubate new programs, facilitate cross-disciplinary collaboration, and attract outside funding. There is a need for a journal of education informatics that has a broader scope than educational technology. A research agenda could include the development and evaluation of concepts, models, theories, and techniques related to the use of ICT for learning; ways in which people use digital information resources, services, systems, environments, and communications media for learning; whether information literacy educators give adequate attention to teaching all aspects of information literacy; and how international and cross-cultural collaborations in education informatics can be supported.

AB  - Purpose: This article explores linkages and disjunctions between citizenship education and character education in England. Approach: The article undertakes a theoretical discussion of what both forms of education are and involve, and a historical overview of their development over the past twenty years, utilising a wide range of primary and secondary sources. Findings: Citizenship education programmes tend to place much greater emphasis than character education on the development of the necessary knowledge and skills that enable participation in political and democratic activities. The focus of character education is on personal ethics rather than public ethics, and the particular understanding of character education advanced by British politicians has been narrow and instrumental, linking the development of character with individual "success", especially in the jobs market. Research implications: Comparative research is now needed to examine the strengths and weaknesses of these two forms of education as they are delivered in other countries, and to explore the similarities and differences between the experiences of different countries. Practical implications: Policy-makers concerned to ensure that young people have the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes they need to engage in civic and political activity should focus on programmes of citizenship education rather than character education.

AB  - To argue for the importance of an integrative approach to learning in introductory STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and other courses, we present a case study of a project incorporating cross-curricular skills in a college algebra course. We analyze student work on the project and responses to surveys, and find the assignment affects positively students' mastery of specific quantitative skills, perceptions of learning, civic awareness, and sense of relevance of mathematical study. We use the analysis to suggest guidelines for designing other activities aiming to teach the whole student in introductory courses. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - This phenomenological inquiry looked at 28 preservice teachers as they participated in a field-based curricula restructuring initiative that connected the disciplines of creative arts, science, and reading. The preservice teachers offered weekly interdisciplinary lessons to kindergarten and first grade students. A survey, teaching cases, and a group exit interview informed the study. Throughout most of the semester, the preservice teachers struggled with procedural and pedagogical content knowledge, concerns directly related to effective teaching. By the end of the semester, they felt comfortable teaching interdisciplinary lessons. Results suggest that preservice teacher curricular restructuring efforts are complex and that teacher educators need to consider the perspectives preservice teachers bring to the change process.

AB  - Slideware applications (e.g., PowerPoint) have become more prevalent in instruction across disciplines. This is especially true at post secondary institutions where many instructors are using slideware as a sole instructional tool. This study evaluated the relative effectiveness of scientific visualization in two PowerPoint delivery strategies on science learning for preservice teachers. Twenty-five preservice teachers enrolled in an undergraduate introduction to science education class were stratified into two PowerPoint delivery strategies. The strategies were: PowerPoint with instructor voiceover narration and PowerPoint without voiceover. Post-test Mann-Whitney U suggested no differences (p greater than 0.05) in science learning across the two strategies. Further, eye tracking analysis suggests voiceover guides the PowerPoint user to graphics and text, but voiceover does not significantly affect learning. Results suggest immediacy with technology doesn't necessarily produce meaningful learning. Good teaching still is the key component of meaningful learning.

AB  - Advocates of the arts agree that the K-12 curriculum should include dedicated time for arts instruction. Some have argued further that knowledge and skills acquired through the arts transfer to nonarts domains. Others claim that evidence of this kind of transfer is limited and instead argue that the arts cultivate valuable dispositions that help students succeed both in and outside of school. Another potential benefit of the arts has received little attention, however. Arts integration--the use of the arts as a teaching methodology throughout the curriculum--may improve long-term retention of content. A variety of long-term memory effects well known in cognitive psychology are reviewed, and it is argued that arts integration naturally takes advantage of these effects while promoting student motivation. This review of findings and applications provides an example of how existing research from neuroscience and cognitive science can inform the work of practicing educators.

AB  - The Future Voices in Public Services column is a forum for students in graduate library and information science programs to discuss key issues they see in academic library public services, to envision what they feel librarians in public service have to offer to academia, to tell us of their visions for the profession, or to tell us of research that is going on in library schools. We hope to provide fresh perspectives from those entering our field, in both the United States and other countries. Interested faculty of graduate library and information science programs, who would like their students' ideas represented in these pages, are invited to contact Nancy H. Dewald at nxd7@psu.edu. Samantha Sinanan is an MLIS candidate in the School of Library, Archival and Information Studies at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada. Here she proposes that librarians should seek to understand the Net Generation searcher's perspective in order to teach information literacy most effectively. Accredited by the American Library Association with the Canadian Library Association, SLAIS is an internationally recognized graduate school at The University of British Columbia, in beautiful Vancouver. At SLAIS we are in the business of preparing professionals to exercise leadership in planning, implementing, and promoting the preservation, organization, and effective use of society's recorded information and ideas. We offer the master's degree in Library and Information Studies (MLIS) and the master's degree in Archival Studies (MAS). In addition, we sponsor a multidisciplinary Master of Arts in Children's Literature (MACL) with five other departments. Opportunities are also available for post-master's study, including a Ph.D. program in library, archival & information studies. For more information, visit www.slais.ubc.ca.

AB  - This exercise provides students hands-on experience with the topics of glycosidation, hemiacetal and acetal formation, proton nuclear magnetic resonance ([superscript 1]H NMR) spectroscopy, and kinetic and thermodynamic product formation. In this laboratory experiment, the methyl acetal of ribose is synthesized, and the kinetic and thermodynamic products of the reaction are identified using a 300 MHz NMR spectrometer with a variable temperature probe. The results of this reaction under two different sets of conditions reveal that alpha forms of ribosides are less stable than beta forms and that the kinetic products are furanosides, whereas the thermodynamic products are pyranosides. It can be performed as a single 3-h laboratory session or as a series of several sessions if students collect their own NMR spectra and use longer reaction times.

AB  - What do paleontologists, dinosaur tracks, and the nature of science have in common? They're combined here in an inquiry activity where students use methods of observation and inference to devise evidence-based explanations for the data they collect about dinosaur tracks, much like the methods used by paleontologists. Students then debate the plausibility of their fellow student-scientists' explanations of what dinosaurs were doing over 65 million years ago. As a result, students discover how scientific explanations are created and that these explanations are open to change based on continued testing, data gathering, and analysis.

AB  - Finnish early childhood education can be defined as practical educational activity, as a discipline, or as a field of science. This study focuses on the academic connections of early childhood education and concentrates on the identification of actors according to Bourdieu's field theory. The roots of academic early childhood education go back only a short way, to the 1970s. The study is of current interest as early childhood education established its position in the field of education as late as the middle of the 1990s when a number of chairs were founded. The material of our study consisted of documents in connection with the appointments of professors, in particular the expert statements. Our study method was material-based content analysis. The mainstream of early childhood education can be defined, in the same way as sciences of education, as a multidisciplinary field of science where the most favoured substance of educational psychology approaches and is integrated into the social capital; early childhood education is always linked to the family, lifespan and society in a complex way.

AB  - In this paper we report on the sustained research and development work at the AMSTEL Institute of the University of Amsterdam to improve mathematics and science education at primary and secondary school level, which has lead amongst other things to the development of the integrated computer working environment Coach 6. This environment consists of integrated tools for data collection (through measurement with sensors or collection of data on video clips and digital images), for control of processes and devices, for processing and analyzing data, for construction, simulation, animation, and validation of computer models, and for authoring of activities by teachers and students. It is meant to facilitate the students' construction of in-depth and integrated understanding of mathematics and science concepts and processes through inquiry. This is realized by offering students the opportunity to work directly with high-quality, real-time data by means of tools that resemble technologies used by "real" scientists. We review the R&D work at AMSTEL in the Dutch perspective on introducing learning technologies in school mathematics and science. We also present an illustrated review of the principled design and implementation of Coach 6. (Contains 6 figures.)

AB  - Background: Extending Merton's (1936) work on the consequences of purposive social action, the model, theory and taxonomy outlined here incorporates and formalizes both anticipated and unanticipated research findings in a unified theoretical framework. The model of anticipated research findings was developed initially by Carifio (1975, 1977) and was followed by the addition of the unanticipated findings component by Perla (2006). This is the first formal model, theory and synthesis of anticipated and unanticipated research findings developed to date. The wide-ranging consequences and implications of the model are discussed. Purpose: To the extent that educational researchers, philosophers and scholars reduce unanticipated findings solely to chance, whimsy, or inspiration they declare these occurrences impossible to effectively predict, model or understand. This article provides a way to conceptualize and formally model anticipated and unanticipated research findings. Many concrete examples from the history of science and research and evaluation methodology are provided to illustrate the model as well as various details of an application of the model in developing instructional materials. Setting: Nature of science instructional materials development effort. Intervention: Not applicable. Research Design: Theory and model development using quantitative and qualitative methods including literature review and original model evaluations. Data Collection and Analysis: Content analysis and modified Q-sorts of research related documents, journals, logs, literature and emails as well as various theory construction and modification techniques. Findings: This article demonstrates that a formal model and theory of anticipated and unanticipated research findings can be developed and that such models should inform a broad range of research and evaluation efforts that are conducted daily worldwide. Nine key research and evaluation principles were derived to supplement the formal model and its operations that should be helpful to novice as well as experienced researchers regardless of the research methodology or strategies they are employing.

AB  - The teaching of sustainability to engineers will follow similar paths to that of environmental engineering. There is a strong feeling that environmental engineering is a discipline unto itself, requiring knowledge of chemistry, physics, biology, hydrology, toxicology, modelling and law. However, environmental engineering can also be encompassed within other disciplines; for example, solar and wind power are often taught in electrical or mechanical engineering; pollution control is taught in chemical engineering; and recycling technologies are taught in both chemical and mechanical engineering. The understanding of sustainability engineering, however, requires a greater maturity than that of most engineering disciplines. Although the basics of this concept can be understood by anyone, the ability to understand the complex systems which exist within the environment and society as well as the constraints on those systems is only beginning to emerge at the fourth year or graduate level. Moreover, the elements necessary to achieve sustainability are derived from all aspects of engineering and, like environmental engineering, all engineering disciplines have strong roles to play in achieving sustainability. However, there is also a fundamental discourse that can be taught as a discipline in sustainability engineering. Discusses aspects of such a programme and outlines the requirements for educating engineers in sustainability.

AB  - The Professional Science Master's (PSM) degree is a creative addition to US graduate education, expressly to support innovation and workforce development in a globally competitive economy. Initiated in the 1990s with funding from two US private foundations, there is still a question as to whether universities will sustain it beyond the start-up phase. The degree is designed to prepare graduates for professional employment in which a combination of technical and management functions come together. PSM programmes combine solid advanced science/mathematics, a working knowledge of business principles, experience working in interdisciplinary groups and high-level communication and technical skills, capped by internships in business, government and industry.

AB  - Engineering education, like many fields, has started to explore the benefits of concept maps as an assessment technique for knowledge integration. Because they allow students to graphically link topics and represent complex interconnections among diverse concepts, we argue that concept maps are particularly appropriate for assessing interdisciplinary knowledge integration. The results from a year-long study of a design course in green engineering demonstrate the viability of this approach. However, this research also highlights important issues in faculty scoring of interdisciplinary concept maps that may not be present when maps are used in traditional single-discipline settings. The interdisciplinary setting revealed differences in (1) evaluation criteria, (2) expertise, and (3) investment. We conclude with suggestions for selecting and training scorers to address these issues.

AB  - Overcoming students' misconceptions may be a challenge when teaching about phenomena such as climate change. Students tend to cite short-term weather effects as evidence to support or refute long-term climate transformations, which displays a fundamental misunderstanding about weather and climate distinctions. Confusion about weather and climate may also reflect student misunderstanding about deep time, a concept that spans several scientific content areas. This study examines the relationships between students' understanding of deep time and their understandings of the distinctions between weather and climate, as well as how these understandings influence students' perceptions about the plausibility of human-induced global climate change. Undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory science class on global climate change completed measures of their (a) understanding of distinctions between weather and climate, (b) knowledge of deep time, and (c) plausibility perceptions of human-induced climate change, both at the beginning and end of the course. The study includes comparison groups of similar students enrolled in introductory physical geography classes. Results revealed that greater knowledge of deep time and increased plausibility perceptions of human-induced climate change provide significant explanation of variance in students' understanding of weather and climate distinctions. Furthermore, students achieve significantly increased understanding of weather and climate, even with brief instruction.

AB  - Environmental education in Poland has a long history, but has advanced especially in recent years. The need to implement it within systems of formal and non-formal education is noted in many government documents. The educational reform introduced in 1999 changed the goals and methods of teaching environmental education in the school system. At present it is taught at every grade level. According to regulations it is to be incorporated within all subjects, mainly in the sciences and also as an interdisciplinary environmental education track. This paper describes how environmental issues are taught and what results are achieved in Polish schools.
