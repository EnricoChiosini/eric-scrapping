AB  - The risk of neutralizing the political dimension in environmental education through the depoliticization of its thematic objects, its intended learning, and its educational purposes, is a curricular phenomenon identified by recent research in the field. The aim of this article is to develop a conceptual and analytical framework to identify clarification of the political dimension. The framework on the political dimension as part of environmental education provides political learning entry that help to avoid the vanishing of this dimension. Nevertheless, this is not without themes and cannot be decoupled from its educational aims. Therefore, establishing a conceptual and analytical framework considering environmental themes, political learning and educational purposes together can effectively support the curricular construction of environmental education's political dimension. Thus, we define six environmental issue meta-themes by politicization and depoliticization trends that cross them; draw on environmental and political education research to identify political learning components in an environmental education context; and discuss linking political learning to possible educational purposes. We believe that within the dialectic of politicization/depoliticization that crosses the thematic subjects, learning and purposes of environmental education's political dimension, the path leading to the democratic subjectification of learners guarantees its non-neutralization.

AB  - Inherent in most school curricula is some sort of curriculum hierarchy--that is, an assumption that some school subjects are more valuable than others. This paper examines the epistemological assumptions that underpin one such curriculum hierarchy, which I refer to as "the traditional curriculum hierarchy". It is a pervasive and problematic idea which maintains that supposedly abstract school subjects, like mathematics and physics, are more valuable than subjects associated with concrete experience, practicality and the body, such as physical education and vocational subjects. Drawing on Dewey, an alternative, non-hierarchical theory of curriculum will be proposed. Contrary to common misinterpretations of his ideas, it is argued that Dewey did not prioritise student interests over disciplinary content. Dewey proposed a curriculum grounded in authentic social problems that required students to draw simultaneously on knowledge and methods from multiple disciplines in an interconnected manner in order to work through such problems. Current policies and initiatives, especially the Australian national curriculum and the English Baccalaureate, are discussed.

AB  - This article details reflections of an interdisciplinary team of educators working with groups of health sciences students in preparing them for working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The first-year common core unit discussed here is one attempt to equip future health practitioners with skills and knowledges to work adequately in this complex area. Processes of engagement, central to critical reflection and learning that is iterative and cyclical, are emphasised here using the authors'/educators' experiences of teaching in the unit. Within this first-year unit, the content delivered--its underlying processes and principles, and assessment design using reflective journalling--coalesces into what is a valued unit of study in preparing students for practising in this field. While the content of the unit is political, provocative and powerful, which presents challenges for students and teaching staff alike, we maintain here that processes of critical reflection and action learning are central to its success and significantly contribute to enhancing students' learning and to changing students' perspectives.

AB  - Every year, high school students hunch over microscopes and peer at a plethora of tiny creatures. Swimming single-celled protists and whirling multicellular rotifers often steal the show, preventing students from noticing the static algae. However, these frequently overlooked, ordinary algae are inspiring research all over the world as scientists contemplate the idea of using algae as a renewable alternative to fossil fuels. By shifting the focus of their timeless microscope activities, teachers can introduce students to this idea. This article provides an overview of several algae activities that teachers can incorporate into their microscope activities to engage high school students in authentic inquiry--whether in a general or advanced biology, environmental-science, pre-engineering or biotechnology elective or in a summer enrichment course. From microscope to photobioreactor, algae is an effective tool to relate common biology concepts to real-world chalenges like renewable energy. The area is not only ripe for inquiry, but students can make observations, pose questions, and gather and analyze data.

AB  - Critical thinking (CT) skills are essential to academic and professional success. Instruments to assess CT often rely on multiple-choice formats with inherent problems. This research presents two instruments for assessing CT, an essay and open-ended group-discussion format, which were implemented in an undergraduate business course at a large public university. The topics were intentionally chosen to be digitally-related (internet access and social media) since they raise complex issues, are applicable in many disciplines, and students are avid users, thereby making these instruments relevant, multidisciplinary, engaging, and multifaceted. These instruments may be adapted to enable educators to effectively assess undergraduate students' ability to think critically. Qualitative analysis of the verbatim data with NVivo helps demonstrate the instruments' efficacy in assessing CT, with (1) high-quality responses receiving high grades, and (2) overarching themes identified by content analysis, that coalesce into the three dimensions of social justice theory (distributive, procedural, and interactional), thus illustrating students' consideration of complex fairness norms and societal needs. Excerpts of student responses are provided as illustrations of the indicators/evidence of critical thinking. Educators can use these instruments to first assess students' CT skills, and then devise targeted interventions to improve the quality of students' thought processes.

AB  - As part of "The Blue Marble" project, the Universities of Leicester and
Nottingham, UK, have developed day-long, interdisciplinary, hands-on
workshops for primary schools to introduce space technology and the role
of the research scientist. The workshop activities introduce 5-11 year olds
to the role of the UK space industry, show the importance of satellite
technology for observing and monitoring the Earth and highlight a range of
environmental issues. There are links to "how science works," environmental
and geoscience topics, as well as a range of science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects. These interactive workshops provide an opportunity for learners to meet "real" scientists--one of the take-home
messages from the day is that anyone can become involved in science,
whatever their ability or subject of interest. The methodology introduces the
role of the scientist using space technology themes, but could easily be
adapted for use with any inspirational topic. The workshops--attended by
349 learners aged 6-11--were fully and independently evaluated, with very
positive changes to learners' views of science and scientists. This paper
provides an overview of the activities, the methodology, the evaluation
process and results, noting the potential for adaptation to Key Stage 3. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to describe experience gained with a required six-credit year-long course, the Capstone Interdisciplinary Team Project, a key component of the Master of Science (MS) in Sustainability degree at the City College of New York. A common feature of sustainability problems is their interdisciplinary nature. Solutions to sustainability problems often require professionals with different training and backgrounds to work as a team. A sustainability curriculum should provide students with the skills needed to competently participate in an interdisciplinary team. Design/Methodology/Approach: Instructors drawn from different departments and divisions of the college developed a pool of sustainability-focused Capstone projects and acted as mentors to teams of students with diverse undergraduate backgrounds. Students attended workshops designed to provide training in teamwork, research and report preparation. An independent evaluator designed an evaluation protocol to assess the course's impact both while it was implemented and after the course was concluded. Findings: Early experience with the program strongly indicates that the Capstone project requirement is an effective learning tool. However, identifying qualified mentors, developing suitable projects, assembling teams and administering the Capstone course are demanding tasks. Although students often experience difficulties in the early stages of their work, they ultimately express satisfaction and appreciation for the skills learned in the course. Practical implications: The inclusion of a capstone team project in a graduate sustainability curriculum is strongly recommended. Adopting such a course requires significant effort and sustained faculty engagement. Originality/value: Although there is considerable experience with undergraduate engineering Capstone course requirements, little is known about interdivisional capstone requirements at the level of master's degree in Sustainability. This paper details new and relevant experience helpful to the implementation of such a requirement.

AB  - More than ever before, leaders within the field of education are looking to research on basic processes to inform and improve educational practices. Success requires building a reciprocal relationship between the field of education and research on learning and development, similar to what exists between biology and medicine. Key to this effort is the development of an explicit conversation between researchers, practitioners, and policy makers, where the generation of basic processes research deals directly with the problems of practice. The goal of this special section of "Mind, Brain, and Education" is to provide a platform on which practical insight can be gained from new empirical research on hormones and behavior in development. The special section will extend across several issues to examine the hormones important for maintaining the body's critical regulatory processes, including energy balance, sleep/wake cycles, and growth. We have solicited manuscripts describing original research and we have asked an expert in each subfield to comment on the educational relevance of the findings and to vision the future and potential of basic processes research in this area to inform education.

AB  - The teaching of entrepreneurship is currently a fundamental pillar in the construction of social responsibility with strong impact on the future economic development of society. The use of serious games in the entrepreneurship field is a way of encouraging students' motivation to become entrepreneurs and develop their skills in the field. In this paper, we describe the experience of using a serious game in the entrepreneurship field in the context of the classroom. For that, we adopt a quantitative research technique based on a survey research to measure the different characteristics experienced by higher education students when using serious games in the classroom to learn entrepreneurship. The students have multidisciplinary competences, coming from courses with strong emphasis in the area of management and technology. The use of the serious game allowed students to develop skills mainly in terms of innovation, leadership, strategic thinking, problem solving, business launch and risk management. On the other side, there were no significant benefits in terms of accounting skills, compliance with regulations, interpersonal, communication, and self-control and discipline.

AB  - There is currently significant interest in 3D fabrication in middle school classrooms. At its best 3D printing can be utilized in authentic design projects that integrate math, science, and technology, which facilitate deep learning by students. In essence, students are able to tinker in a virtual world using 3D design software and then tinker in the real world using printed parts. We describe a professional development activity we designed to enable middle school teachers who had taken part in a three-year Math Science Partnership program to authentically integrate 3D printing into design-based lessons. We include some examples of successful design-based lesson plans.

AB  - In response to the need to prepare students to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century, new models of graduate education are being developed across the country. One model is provided by the National Science Foundation's Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12 Education (GK-12) program, which broadens graduate students' training beyond their traditional research programs. We explored the impact of an ecologically focused GK-12 program at The University of Montana and the broader impacts of a set of other environmental-science-oriented GK-12 programs in the United States. These types of programs are urgently needed to ensure that future leaders of the scientific enterprise are well equipped with the tools to conduct science as skilled collaborators, to address the key interdisciplinary questions that arise from complex environmental challenges facing society, and to better communicate their science with diverse audiences well beyond their scientific peers.

AB  - With the support of the East Tennessee State University (ETSU) administration and a grant from Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the departments of Biological Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics, and Curriculum and Instruction have developed a biology-math integrated curriculum. An interdisciplinary faculty team, charged with teaching the 18 curriculum modules, designed this three-semester curriculum, known as SYMBIOSIS. This curriculum was piloted to two student cohorts during the developmental stage. The positive feedback and assessment results of this project have given us the foundation to implement the SYMBIOSIS curriculum as a replacement for the standard biology majors curriculum at the introductory level. This article addresses the history and development of the curriculum, previous assessment results and current assessment protocol, and the future of ETSU's approach to implementing the SYMBIOSIS curriculum.

AB  - Zero-order systems provide an interesting opportunity for students to think about the underlying mechanism behind the physical phenomena being modeled. The work reported here is part of a larger study that seeks to characterize how students integrate chemistry and mathematics in the context of chemical kinetics. Thirty-six general chemistry students, five physical chemistry students, and three chemical engineering students were asked to think aloud as they responded to an interview prompt about the half-life of a catalyst-driven zero-order reaction. Our findings revealed that students often described zero-order in mathematical terms (i.e., the zero-order rate law, integrated rate law, and graphical representation), but lacked a clear understanding of the particulate nature of zero-order systems. Results also indicated students have productive discipline-specific conceptions of catalysts but less productive ideas regarding half-life, expressing a limited view that seemed restricted to first-order decay reactions. Analysis of student problem solving further revealed patterns among this type of half-life reasoning. Our work suggests the need for instruction that varies context to promote a more holistic understanding of chemical kinetics concepts.

AB  - The competence-based education recently launched in Spanish universities presents a set of abilities and skills that are difficult to teach to students in higher and more technologically-oriented grades. In this paper, a teaching intervention that is based on design methodologies is proposed, to upgrade the competitive capacities of computer engineering students. In particular, this intervention targets those aspects relating to working in multidisciplinary teams and to defining requirements based on the user's empathy and knowledge. The main idea inspiring this technique is that the underlying challenge is a communication problem. As Brooks (1995) states in his book "The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering," even a project having all of the prerequisites for success (a clear mission, manpower, materials, time and adequate technology) could fail as a Tower of Babel. The proposed technique through mixed methods has been evaluated with students enrolled in different courses, confirming the repeatability and validity of this method from quantitative measurement, from observation of the results, and from ascertaining the value perceived by students and their attitudes.

AB  - The integration of agricultural and science curricular content that capitalizes on natural and inherent connections represents a challenge for secondary agricultural educators. The purpose of this case study was to create information about the employment of Cooperative Learning Groups (CLG) to enhance the science integrating learning objectives utilized in secondary agriculture programs. The objectives of the study were to determine if CLGs were an effective means for increasing: a) the number of science integrating learning objectives utilized in agriculture courses; and b) the number of science integrating learning objectives that require higher levels of cognitive processing in agriculture courses. Overall, the findings revealed that the CLG process lead to an increase in the total number of science integrating learning objectives and an increase in the number of science integrating learning objectives that require higher levels of cognition. Matched-sample t tests revealed that the increases in the number of science integrating learning objectives and objectives that require higher levels of cognition were statistically significant. It is recommended that researchers investigate methods for improving the specification, revision, and implementation of science integrating learning objectives used to guide student learning experiences in secondary agricultural programs of study.

AB  - The Hybrid Text Comprehension cloze (HyTeC-cloze) (Kleijn et al. Lang Test 36:553--572, 2019) is a procedure developed for the Dutch language that has been proved to be a valid and reliable measure of text comprehension beyond the sentence level. Given its advantages, including its relatively rapid construction and scoring and performance compared to standardized tests, we adapted the HyTeC-cloze procedure to create a version for the Spanish language. Therefore, this study aims at validating our adaptation. We extracted 18 texts from different school textbooks (Science, Language and History) and grades (6th, 7th, and 8th) and turned them into cloze tests, which were administered to 316 sixth to eighth graders from Chilean primary schools through an online platform. We also used a Chilean standardized reading comprehension test to evaluate the validity of our test. The correlations ranged from a low of 0.20 (for 7th grade) to a high of 0.58 (for 8th grade). Taken collectively, our data show a moderate positive correlation between both tests, which provide further evidence of cloze tests as a valid measure of reading comprehension beyond the sentence level.

AB  - Sustainability challenges are complex and call for the effective development of knowledge, skills, and abilities in current and new leaders. New offerings in higher education provide sustainability training to complement studies in geography, engineering, science, and other disciplines, in many cases including innovative experiential learning components -- including the use of reflection. Although reflection in education is not a new concept, how to assess reflection has remained challenging. Recent research on the Reflective Learning Framework (RLF) aims to address many of the challenges associated with guiding, assessing, and evaluating student learning through reflections. The objective of this research was to investigate the perceptions of students who use the RLF about their experience using reflection in a sustainability course. Semi-structured interviews with students provide a valuable perspective on the use of reflection. Particularly, findings from this research indicate that students see reflection as a tool to develop and use cognitive and metacognitive skills, and also as a tool to support knowledge retention and transfer. Accordingly, student perspectives on reflection show that this practice contributes to the acquisition of higher-order thinking skills required to address the complex challenges of sustainability.

AB  - Background: Creating coherence between school subjects mathematics and science and making these school subjects meaningful are still topical challenges. This study investigates how students make meaningful connections between mathematics, statistics, science and applications when they engage in a specially developed unit that is based on professional practices in which mathematical, statistical and scientific knowledge are used. The central question is to what extent professional practices can serve as meaningful contexts for senior high school students (aged 16 to 17) to help them make connections between mathematics, statistics, science and professional practices. In order to answer this question, we focused on two sub-questions: (1) 'How meaningful do students find an instructional unit that is based on professional practices in which statistics plays a role?' and (2) 'To what extent are students able to show awareness of the connections between mathematics, statistics, science within the instructional unit and professional practices?' Results: Questionnaires on the opinions of 415 students (388 before and 27 after completing two chapters of the unit) on the educational strategy and student work are used to answer the central question. The analysis of responses to questionnaires shows that students consider an educational strategy based on authentic professional practices meaningful. These results are also confirmed by the findings in the analysis of the second sub-question. Conclusions: The results indicate that an educational strategy based on professional practices can help students make connections between mathematics, statistics, science and professional practices.

AB  - The articles in this Special Topic issue present a range of assessment models and challenges for improving the identification and early intervention of students in need of additional supports. Although each article targets a unique aspect of student learning (learning behaviors, math skills, reading comprehension, behavioral functioning, and ratings of engaged and disruptive behavior), collectively they highlight the importance of assessment practices in effective problem solving. In our commentary, we use prevention science as a framework for considering the contributions of the articles in this special topic with a particular focus on the role of assessment. A recent report from the National Research Council and Institute of Medicine (2009) attributed much of the progress in advancing knowledge about prevention of emotional and behavior problems over the past 2 decades to the relatively young field of prevention science. As an interdisciplinary field, prevention science provides a step-by-step model for solving public health problems, including educational underachievement. Specifically, prevention science is a systematic method for identifying, monitoring, and altering meaningful targets that have been demonstrated to be associated with critical youth outcomes. Accurate and efficient assessment tools are essential at each step of the prevention science research cycle.

AB  - We report on research that explores students' literacy practices in six Norwegian primary school science classrooms during integrated science-literacy instruction. The study combines observational video data and interview data to examine students' encounters with and use of text, along with their views and experiences related to science and science text. Drawing on New Literacy Studies perspectives--seeing literacy as a situated social practice--our analysis reveals how multiple literacies emerged in the context of integrated science-literacy instruction, where elements of students' informal literacies became valued resources in the dialogic process of inquiry. More specifically, the students engaged in literacy practices that transcended the contexts of science and school science to incorporate texts and literacy practices from the students' everyday lives as well as practices that were confined to a school-only context. On the basis of their talk about text in the classroom and data from focus group interviews, we also identify some of the challenges that these students faced in their encounters with science texts in this setting.

AB  - This paper draws on an initiative where we experienced being new, radical, and, from some viewpoints, dangerously progressive at Unitec--a Polytechnic/Institute of Technology in Aotearoa, New Zealand. The initiative was driven by a need to improve student experiences of interdisciplinary learning and teaching, and to develop a common semester for students transitioning to a bachelor degree programme, as well as a new suite of interdisciplinary qualifications at postgraduate level. This discussion paper is situated within a self-study paradigm befitting educational contexts, by drawing on the reflective narratives of three participants who held a range of different roles--and, hence, perspectives within the change process. Interpretations and implications are discussed using the lens of the "Inclusive Framework," to illustrate personal, professional, and political elements. Our overall aim is to add to current understandings of change within the higher education sector. However, this is a study of our own experiences and we are not making claims that we are in the possession of "truth", but, rather, we seek to identify aspects that may have relevance in other contexts. We conclude that navigating the next phase of transformative change in our context will involve seeking resolutions to key emerging questions. This includes exploring notions of multiple innovators, creating agile development environments in education and exploring the concept of time as multifaceted.

AB  - Biomimicry, the process of using nature to guide innovative thinking and development, can be useful in helping students grasp scientific concepts. Teachers interested in incorporating biomimicry into lesson plans might find that experiential learning at informal science institutions (ISIs) with natural models and artifacts is a valuable tool to accompany classroom learning. Visiting these ISIs, students have the opportunity to observe nature in real time and be immersed in inspiration. As students explore these natural models in habitats and exhibits, educators might ask students to consider the interesting features they observe and to creatively consider innovative designs that these features could inspire. For example, an elephant's trunk might inspire a robotic arm. These direct experiences at ISIs might draw upon students' innate biophilia to learn more about living organisms and lead to increased creativity and design output. I developed this guide based on my experiences as an informal biomimicry educator and my 2017 keynote address presented at the Annual Docent Conference at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo.

AB  - This article reports on an exploratory study that examined the transition to independence in Stage 2 of the doctoral student experience in two applied social science fields. We rely on an interdisciplinary framework that integrates developmental networks and sociocultural perspectives of learning to better understand the connection between the challenges in Stage 2 of the doctoral education process and students' learning-based behavioral responses to such challenges during this critical transition. Results indicate the presence of three types of process challenges in Stage 2: structural, interpersonal, and individual. Results also point to a range of behavioral responses to such challenges and their relative effectiveness in advancing doctoral student learning towards becoming independent scholars. We conclude with directions for future research and practice. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - We examined The University of Vermont's new sustainability requirement for undergraduates through the lens of just sustainability. We found that sustainability courses are proposed in diverse disciplines. Regardless of discipline, most proposed courses address all three pillars of sustainability (social, ecological, and economic). Discussions of environmental justice are less widespread; only 17% of proposed courses in science, technology, and math departments addressed environmental justice. Our results provide examples for others interested in integrating sustainability across diverse disciplines and in emphasizing environmental justice. We also call attention to the fact that institutions of higher education may need explicit reminders or requirements to adequately include considerations of environmental justice in sustainability studies.

AB  - Nanoscale phenomena are under increasingly intense investigation both in academia and industry. The unique physical and chemical properties stemming from their high surface area and confined space lead to properties that are distinct from atomic and bulk materials. Students need experience in nanoscience to enter this growing field of nanoscience research. This laboratory experiment introduces the optical properties of noble metal nanoparticles and probes the effect that the metal composition has on these properties. An aqueous synthesis is performed, which allows for the control of the alloy composition of Au/Ag nanoparticles, while minimizing costs and hazardous waste. The composition of the synthesized particles is verified by mass analysis. Extinction spectra are recorded experimentally and determined "in silico." The experimental and theoretical spectra are compared, and students are asked to identify causes for discrepancies on the basis of mass and particle size analysis. Students actively engage in identifying how the dielectric function of a nanoparticle affects the optical properties. By performing these experiments, students gain practical knowledge of the synthesis and characterization of metal nanoparticles, as well as an initial introduction to elements of theoretical chemistry. This experiment has been found to be easily reproducible; it utilizes primarily nonhazardous, nontoxic, green materials, and it can be performed with minimal added costs to normal budgets for lab courses.

AB  - Recent studies emphasize the importance of learning science while considering multiple perspectives on environment, society, economy, and technology, which allows learners to relate what they do in the classroom to the world beyond. In this study, 68 12-year-old primary students from 1 Malaysian school were followed while they engaged in a science curriculum centered around 8 environment-related socio-scientific issues during a unit on the interaction among living things. The analysis shows that the informal reasoning skills of the students improved significantly. Progressive implementation of SSI activities encouraged students to use evidence-based decision-making, improving reasoning modes, and advancing reasoning levels.

AB  - American higher education has been in almost perpetual crisis for several generations, with students experiencing fragmentation and loss of coherence across the curriculum. Most liberal arts colleges in the 19th century had a required senior course in "moral philosophy" to integrate the curriculum and prepare students for future leadership, but over a century ago the new science and social science disciplines ended these courses. Students now are trained in disciplinary silos, with little opportunity to integrate their studies after freshmen year general education courses. This paper proposes to reintegrate a student's undergraduate experience by having a required interdisciplinary senior capstone course, modeled on the old moral philosophy course but without its elitist and authoritarian methods. This new course would incorporate university values and the disciplines within it, in small interdisciplinary seminars designed around contemporary problems, which would provide students an opportunity to develop a moral framework for future service.

AB  - This study describes the development of a climate change SSIBL-STEAM program that was aligned to the Grade 6 elementary school national curriculum using the ADDIE model for design. The efficacy of the climate change SSIBL-STEAM program was investigated by measuring the impact of the program on cultivating elementary students' personalities (sociality, morality, emotion) and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics) competencies (convergence, creativity, challenge, caring). Twenty-five Grade 6 students and three public elementary school teachers participated in this study. Data were collected using two instruments designed to examine character and STEAM competencies before and after the program. Additionally, field notes and student learning outcomes were collected and qualitatively and quantitively analyzed. The results indicated that students improved significantly in their character and STEAM competencies, especially morality, emotion, and convergence factors. This study was expected to be an example of the combined approach with SSIBL and STEAM.

AB  - Significant numbers, moles, and stoichiometry were the chemistry learning objectives introduced through full arts integration in a small, East Texas high school as a part of a study designed by the authors for their advanced degrees. This article describes how a chemistry teacher and art teacher collaborated in a semester-long journey into full arts integration in order to provide innovative instruction and lead the way for teachers in all subject areas to do the same. The project allowed the two teachers to explore leadership in curriculum and instruction design through arts integration by exploring the ways in which arts integration influenced the chemistry classroom. Students perceived the arts integrated activities as having a positive effect on academic success and student engagement. The academic success and increased student engagement experienced in this project served as a catalyst for further integrated projects and greater interest in arts integration within the school district. Not only did the study increase interest in the advantages of a strong arts program, it also demonstrated the educational advantages of full arts integration. The study demonstrated that arts integration meets the needs of students by providing engaging, concrete, and hands-on activities.

AB  - Students engaged in systems engineering education typically lack experience and understanding of the multidisciplinary complexity of systems engineering projects. Consequently, students struggle to understand the value, rationale, and usefulness of established systems engineering methods, often perceiving them as banal or trivial. The paper presents a learning activity based on a three-stage reverse engineering role-play developed to increase students' awareness of the importance of correctly using systems engineering methods. The activity was developed and integrated in the Systems Engineering course given at Blekinge Institute of Technology. Its effectiveness was analyzed through semistructured self-reflection reports along with two editions of the course. The results showed the development of students' understanding of how to use systems engineering methods. In particular, the students realized the need to deliver detailed and easy-to-read models to the decision makers. This result was in line with the achievement of some of the intended learning outcomes of the course.

AB  - Due to the major advances in technology and the sciences, advances in the medical treatment options for children with chronic conditions are being made at an astonishing rate. In the health care field, "children with chronic conditions" is a generic phrase that typically refers to children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional conditions that last longer than 3 months. These conditions indicate a need for specialized health care, therapies, or medical equipment/supplies, which often causes chronic disruptions in the child's activities when compared with those of children who are typically developing. Conditions that fit this criterion include: diabetes, asthma, behavioral and cognitive disorders, epilepsy, and conditions that require complex health care procedures. While these children may require specialized technological health care procedures and/or health support during the school day, they do not necessarily require special education services (Sirvis, 1989). In many cases, attending school can be a daunting and frightening experience for children with chronic health care conditions, their parents, and school personnel. Communication between the health care team and school personnel is important in the school entry or reentry of the child with a chronic condition (Ishibashi, 2001). Individual Health Plans (IHPs) are a clear and efficient tool that may be utilized to facilitate communication among the myriad of individuals participating on the child's multidisciplinary team.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to expand the competence-led structuring and understanding of sustainability education by analysing the practices of professional individuals who have completed university education geared to the development of sustainability change-makers. Design/methodology/approach: The research scope was initially on examining professional practices following the boundary work theory. Social practice theory was used as a methodological approach in conducting and analysing thematic interviews with 19 sustainability-focused master's programme alumni. The interviews were analysed against the theoretical framework while also noting findings that fell outside of this framework. Findings: A framework for understanding materials, competences and meanings of practices connected to the professional field of sustainability was introduced. The framework suggests that in the practices of sustainability-educated professionals, meanings emerge as a top priority and are conveyed using position-based materials and various complexes of competency. Research limitations/implications: The authors suggest that boundary theory informs well the emergence of the professional field of sustainability, and the utilisation of a practice theory furthers the understanding of sustainability professionalism and its education. Practical implications: The authors' suggest that practice theory could thus provide deeper insights on how sustainability science alumni use their education after graduation, how they practice their profession and in return offer applicable reflections to sustainability education. Originality/value: Research using practice theory in reflection on sustainability education and the professional practice of sustainability has not been widely conducted and in the authors' opinion brings value to the education and practice of sustainability and to the research of sustainability education.

AB  - Interactivity and inquiry-based learning science are effective ways of helping students overcome their perception of chemistry as an alien and abstract topic and instead approach the subject as a creative way of understanding ideas and applying mastered concepts to new contexts. Data acquisition systems are an extremely useful form of educational technology that can be used alone or in conjunction with other technologies to bring about active learning and enable students to move beyond memorization to the verification strategies and knowledge base they need to successfully master chemistry concepts. This article describes the use of data acquisition systems and analysis software in combination with other technologies such as electronic response systems and online video. The technologies were used for laboratory activities, online learning, and lecture hall demonstrations and allowed for cross-disciplinary experiments. They also brought an element of interactivity to each instructional setting that proved to be an excellent avenue for engaging student interest and ensuring comprehension of chemistry topics.

AB  - Holistic STEAM programs can benefit children by allowing them to develop an intersecting identity in STEAM disciplines, explore real-world issues more broadly, think critically and innovatively, solve problems using integrated approaches, and have confidence across multiple fields of study. Much of the current research situates identity development in single subjects such as science, math, or engineering. However, a broader conceptualization of identity in STEAM can influence the creation or progression of STEAM curriculum, environments, and programs to support the unique, organic construction of a child's identity development across multiple disciplines. Suggestions for creating optimal conditions for holistic STEAM identity development include using an interactionist approach, developing meaningfully integrated and relevant real-world explorations, utilizing inquiry, interest, and play, and using a flexible curriculum that allows for divergence and creativity.

AB  - Training future leaders to understand life cycle assessment data is critical for effective research, business, and sociopolitical decision-making. However, the technical nature of these life cycle reports often makes them challenging for students and other nonexperts to comprehend. Therefore, we outline here the key takeaways from recent economic and life cycle assessments for three major commodity chemicals--ethylene, ethylene oxide, and terephthalic acid--that are precursors for plastics, synthetic fibers, and many other consumer products. The five lessons and 10 discussion prompts (provided in the Supporting Information) serve as useful teaching tools for introductory chemistry and chemical engineering courses.

AB  - How is the future of the Web, as one of the most influential inventions of the twentieth century? Today, there are great conceptual gaps between the Web 2.0 (Social Web), Web 3.0 (Semantic Web), and Web 4.0 (Pragmatic Web) generations. Every generation of Web is merely an independent conceptual branch of Web and the future Web needs to benefit from the combination of concepts from each generation. This paper has three distinct contributions to make for paving the way for the future Web. First, we tried to extract all main concepts of today's Web, and propose them as the principles for the future Web, which we name the Socio-Pragmatic Web (SPWeb). Then, we use the Activity Theory (AT) as a transdisciplinary theory for human social behavior to provide a conceptual model for SPWeb. Our conceptual model offers generic Knowledge-Embodied Agents (KEA) in three different abstraction levels as the building blocks of SPWeb. As different KEA types, Web Service-KEA, Artificial Intelligent-KEA, and Cognitive-KEA have different levels of capabilities. For each KEA type, we propose different elements and technologies of today's Web as the candidates for their development to prove the feasibility of these KEAs. Finally, we will show that the Concept Realization and Weaving Functions of the KEA models altogether can generate a powerful future web, as it satisfies SPWeb's principles.

AB  - The defining task for undergraduate departments is the design of a major, including the number and content of courses as well as other requirements. Department members must weigh the desire to produce graduates superbly prepared for further study against the charge that the major requires too large a share of an undergraduate's course options. This dilemma is particularly striking for the sciences at undergraduate institutions where faculty are committed to the breadth of the liberal arts but also pride themselves on the number of students going on to graduate school or employment in scientific fields. Biochemistry and molecular biology (BMB) are often among the most demanding majors in terms of course requirements. In addition to the linear nature of all science programs, which hinders the flexibility of a major, BMB are interdisciplinary fields that integrate material from courses in different departments. Tension between contributing departments often leads to an increase in the number of required courses. Since 1992, the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) has supported a recommended curriculum for the bachelor's degree in BMB. In the years since it was developed, this curriculum has been modified to emphasize skills rather than coursework. In addition to defining core content in chemistry, biology, and allied fields, the society has published a list of skills to be achieved. Although expressed in language specific to the sciences, these skills mirror the learning outcomes recommended by the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) in its 2007 report, "College Learning for the New Global Century." Mapping the two sets of skills onto one another indicates where the ASBMB guidelines are strongest and where they might be supplemented. Through a survey of department chairs and instructors, the researchers sought to learn how widely the ASBMB-recommended curriculum and skills are understood by departments, at what levels the skills are introduced, what methods of pedagogy are employed, and how often open-ended research problems are presented to students. Broader-ranging questions about the role of BMB in liberal education were explored through interviews and open sessions at the 2007 ASBMB national meeting. This article reports the findings of the survey. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Biomedical engineering (BME) is a multidisciplinary, constantly advancing field; as such, undergraduate programs in BME must continually adapt. Elective courses provide opportunities for students to select topic areas relevant to their interests or future careers. Specifically, laboratory courses allow experiential learning in specialized topics in a hands-on manner that is suitable and accessible to undergraduate students. In recent years, neural engineering has emerged as a research sub-specialty within BME, and students preparing to pursue careers in this field will require a broad range of fundamental and experiential training. We sought to demonstrate this possibility by implementing a neural tissue engineering module into an existing upper-level undergraduate biofabrication elective. Organoids, which are self-assembling aggregate cell culture models that mimic a tissue or organ in both function and structure, have been made more accessible by genetic tools and commercially available resources. These experimental tools can be incorporated into basic laboratory experiments to model neurological systems that are otherwise difficult to study. In this paper, we describe the execution of this new module in which teams followed an adapted protocol for producing human neural organoids and then designed and manufactured a 3D-printed 'solution' to a common problem in the fields of neural engineering and organoid research. Additionally, we include student feedback as well as advantages, disadvantages, and opportunities for improvement of this laboratory module in future implementations. Skills gained in this project-based setting could be beneficial in subsequent capstone design courses as well as translated into future courses or graduate research studies.

AB  - Many first-year university courses are large and content-driven, which can contribute to low student engagement and difficulty involving students in the dynamic, cross-disciplinary nature of inquiry. Learning communities can address these goals, but their implementation often poses logistical challenges, especially in large courses. Here, we apply learning communities using a linked-course model to enhance student engagement and inquiry across three large, first-year biology courses. These three courses (Discovering Biodiversity, Molecular and Cell Biology, and Biological Concepts of Health) offer different contexts for biological inquiry, introduce key biological concepts, and are connected through jointly mapped learning outcomes, shared online skill workshops, and integrative learning communities composed of students from each course. Diverse modes of student learning are used across the three courses, and contemporary problems are explored within classes and small group seminars, which promote the development of skills necessary for inquiry. This course structure requires the coordinated scheduling of seminars and interdisciplinary projects but allows flexibility in the use of lecture periods and online content while offering increased resource efficiency. Collectively, these courses provide opportunities for integration, skill development, and problem solving. In contrast to many other forms of learning communities, this particular model promotes both a disciplinary foundation and cross-disciplinary applications for large numbers of students.

AB  - Engaging students with material associated with public budgeting processes can be a challenge. Our experience in an interdisciplinary seminar on education politics and policy suggests that a budget simulation exercise is an effective tool to achieve multiple objectives, including increased student engagement and strengthening student-learning outcomes, while offering a vehicle with which to explore significant policy issues. The effort described here draws on literature from both political science and education. It offers an approach that is adaptable and that can be used to encourage significant engagement from students with variable levels of prior experience and preparation.

AB  - Metaphors invite. They contribute to our ability to makes sense of experience as they beacon us to make new (and sometimes playful) connections. In this text, I have created a postmodern metaphor, one willing to joyfully transgress disciplinary boundaries. Melding interviews, iconic images, snippets of academic text, poetry, and the power of metaphor, this festschrift "text" is at once visual, verbal, academic, accessible, and full of motion. Like the scholar whose work it honors (Ken Tobin), it gently pushes us into new questions about the lines we can draw between science and art.

AB  - We describe the design and implementation of Project WISE, a multi-institutional partnership that assembles interdisciplinary teams of undergraduate and high school students charged with developing STEM-focused community youth-programs. Our goal is twofold: (i.) to promote young women's interest in STEM-oriented careers through an early, positive exposure to informal science education, and (ii.) to trial-test a model of how high schools, universities, and informal learning centers can collaborate to build strong, successful youth-program partnerships that serve the local community. Our project is innovative in its youth-development strategies, the targeting plan for diverse audiences, and the focus on women's contributions to aviation and space flight. The project also gives student participants rare but powerful opportunities to contribute directly to the quality of life in their community and to work in multi-disciplinary, multi-generational teams.

AB  - Research experience provides critical training for new biomedical research scientists. Students from underrepresented populations studying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are increasingly recruited into research pathways to diversify STEM fields. However, support structures outside of research settings designed to help these students navigate biomedical research pathways are not always available; nor are program support components outside the context of laboratory technical skills training and formal mentorship well understood. This study leveraged a multi-institutional research training program, Enhancing Cross-Disciplinary Infrastructure and Training at Oregon (EXITO), to explore how nine institutions designed a new curricular structure (Enrichment) to meet a common goal of enhancing undergraduate research training and student success. EXITO undergraduates participated in a comprehensive, 3-year research training program with the Enrichment component offered across nine sites: three universities and six community colleges, highly diverse in size, demographics, and location. Sites' approaches to supporting students in the training program were studied over a 30-month period. All sites independently created their own nonformal curricular structures, implemented interprofessionally via facilitated peer groups. Site data describing design and implementation were thematically coded to identify essential programmatic components across sites, with student feedback used to triangulate findings. Enrichment offered students time to critically reflect on their interests, experiences, and identities in research; network with peers and professionals; and support negotiation of hidden and implicit curricula. Students reported the low-pressure setting and student-centered curriculum balanced the high demands associated with academics and research. Core curricular themes described Enrichment as fostering a sense of community among students, exposing students to career paths and skills, and supporting development of students' professional identities. The non-formal, interprofessional curricula enabled students to model diverse biomedical identities and pathways for each other while informing institutional structures to improve diverse undergraduate students' success in academia and research.

AB  - With the ever increasing pace of change in the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industry, universities need to be more aware of the skill set that employers are seeking in graduates. These skills often include risk taking, creative thinking and entrepreneurship; skills that are not naturally associated with chemistry-related curriculums. This research focusses on the authors' experiences of applying for strategic grants which underpin the dissemination of such skills, and explores how these were used as the basis for creating specific learning content for final year students. Students' experiences after completing assignments were gathered through an online survey and subsequent analysis identified areas for improvement in chemistry curriculums.

AB  - There is a strong need in the United States to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Drawing from sociocultural theory, we present approaches to establishing collaborations between computer engineering and mathematics/bilingual education faculty to address this need. We describe our work through the Advancing Out-of-School Learning in Mathematics and Engineering project by illustrating how an integrated curriculum that is based on mathematics with applications in image and video processing can be designed and how it can be implemented with middle school students from underrepresented groups.

AB  - This article provides an example of a social studies lesson from Turkish educational context in order to facilitate comparison with examples of social studies lessons from other parts of the world. This lesson was recorded in a 7th grade class at a middle school in one of the metropolitan neighborhoods in Istanbul. According to the current curriculum in Turkey, social studies education is an interdisciplinary field (TTKB, 2009b; 2009c). The subjects of social studies include history, geography, economics, sociology, anthropology, psychology, philosophy, political science, law, and civics (TTKB, 2009b; 2009c). Social studies courses are taught under two different titles in elementary and middle schools from the first through seventh grades in Turkey. In early grades (grades 1-3), the course is called Life Studies (see TTKB, 2009a) and, from grades four through seven, it is called Social Studies. nation. At the high school level (Grades 9-12), social studies subjects are taught as discipline based courses such as history, geography, sociology, psychology, and philosophy. Educational research studies in Turkey are dominated by surveys and questionnaires. Thus, generally school administrators and teachers limit educational research only to these kinds of surveys which they call "anket". "Anket" is originally a French word "enquête" and has been integrated into Turkish to mean "public poll" or "questionnaire". Therefore, this type of educational research which required a video recording of a class session was unconventional for the school administrators and teachers and they were not eager to participate in this research. The lesson was video recorded and transcribed verbatim. Then, the transcripts in Turkish were translated into English. Explanations were given in brackets when necessary. Transcription and translation process were not easy. Some issues came up especially with the translation as some words lose their meaning when translated to English. Two sessions covering the same topic were recorded. Nevertheless, for reasons of space, only the first session was prepared for this issue, with a summary of the second lesson provided.

AB  - We piloted a semester-long, interdisciplinary, introductory science course using recently developed optogenetic technique as a main context. In neuroscience application, this technique introduces the gene of light-sensitive membrane protein into a targeted class of neurons, whose activity then can be modulated with a laser of specific wavelength. Such genetically modified and optically controllable neurons can be used to study the details of neural circuitries. This thoroughly interdisciplinary experimental technique provides an engaging modern context for studying and connecting various fundamental concepts and topics, such as genetics, biochemistry, laser, and nerve signaling. Students have learned how challenging scientific questions can be answered through the cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques from multiple disciplines, improving their scientific literacy broadly.

AB  - By analysing an academic exhibition on the Amazon region made by Year 5 children from an Oxford-based primary school, this qualitative study explores the ways that children perceive a representation of a natural environment geographically distant from their home context. The phenomenographic analysis of written and visual documentary sources focuses on incorporated biophysical and socio-cultural elements. Three hierarchically inclusive ways of perceiving the Amazon were identified: (1) Nature as species of wild fauna and their habitat; (2) Nature as political economy; and (3) Nature as an imaginative world. Correspondingly, findings highlighted: (1) children's affiliation to other living organisms; (2) children's stereotypical constructs in relation to developing countries; and (3) nature as a concept that is actively constructed by children, including the conjuring of imagined 'natural' worlds. The findings have implications for interdisciplinary approaches to Environmental Education in primary contexts.

AB  - Hasok Chang ("Sci Educ" 20:317-341, 2011) shows how the recovery of past experimental knowledge, the physical replication of historical experiments, and the extension of recovered knowledge can increase scientific understanding. These activities can also play an important role in both science and history and philosophy of science education. In this paper I describe the implementation of an integrated learning project that I initiated, organized, and structured to complement a course in history and philosophy of the life sciences (HPLS). The project focuses on the study and use of descriptions, observations, experiments, and recording techniques used by early microscopists to classify various species of water flea. The first published illustrations and descriptions of the water flea were included in the Dutch naturalist Jan Swammerdam's, "Historia Insectorum Generalis" (1669) ("Algemeene verhandeling van de bloedeloose dierkens." t'Utrrecht, Meinardus van Dreunen, ordinaris Drucker van d'Academie). After studying these, we first used the descriptions, techniques, and nomenclature recovered to observe, record, and classify the specimens collected from our university ponds. We then used updated recording techniques and image-based keys to observe and identify the specimens. The implementation of these newer techniques was guided in part by the observations and records that resulted from our use of the recovered historical methods of investigation. The series of HPLS labs constructed as part of this interdisciplinary project provided a space for students to consider and wrestle with the many philosophical issues that arise in the process of identifying an unknown organism and offered unique learning opportunities that engaged students' curiosity and critical thinking skills.

AB  - Ubiquitous Computing, Mobile Computing and the Internet of Things (collectively referred to as UMI herein) involve recent advances in technology areas such as low-cost and miniaturized processing and sensing technologies, high-bandwidth wireless networking and so on. UMI technologies can also support the recent attempts to reform computing education. Yet, to accomplish this potential, relevant UMI learning scenarios are needed. Creating such scenarios can be challenging, since this particular field of computing education is still in its infancy. This paper discusses learning design knowledge which can orientate the future design of UMI learning scenarios. Content analysis was applied on ten quality UMI-oriented learning scenarios. The scenarios were freely accessible in online platforms, and they were designed for middle school education and for the UMI domain. Two different methodological approaches were employed: the first one involved mapping the scenarios to existing predefined learning design elements (i.e. design concepts, design principles, and design patterns). The learning design elements were previously defined in an online database and they involved ubiquitous tools. The second method involved mapping the scenarios to the parameters of a UMI learning ecology. The performed analysis revealed design concepts, principles, patterns and key characteristics underpinning the selected UMI scenarios: they cater for students' active learning and engage them in interdisciplinary projects in which students are learning across contexts in groups and solve meaningful problems that exploit the functionalities of the UMI technologies. Several recommendations concerning the creation of quality UMI learning scenarios are suggested, such as: striking a balance between conceptual understanding and 21st century lifelong learning skills, highlighting how students' collaboration is expected to happen in a UMI scenario, providing many opportunities for instructional scaffolding and explicitly mentioning spatiotemporal aspects of the UMI scenarios. These findings could be of interest to computing education researchers, tutors, and curriculum designers who wish to design UMI oriented educational scenarios.

AB  - IBHA, the International Big History Association, was organized in 2010 and "promotes the unified, interdisciplinary study and teaching of history of the Cosmos, Earth, Life, and Humanity." This is the vision that Montessori embraced long before the discoveries of modern science fleshed out the story of the evolving universe. "Big History" is a university curriculum that gives a comprehensive overview of everything from the birth of the universe to modern societies and visions of the future. In essence, it is a college-level version of Montessori's Cosmic Education. The IBHA held its first conference in August 2012 at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, MI. A panel of Montessorians gave presentations at the conference to inform the assembled group of their own elementary school version of Big History.

AB  - Design-based learning (DBL) is an educational approach grounded in the processes of inquiry and reasoning towards generating innovative artifacts, systems and solutions. The approach is well characterized in the context of learning natural sciences in secondary education. Less is known, however, of its characteristics in the context of higher engineering education. The purpose of this review study is to identify key characteristics of DBL in higher engineering education. From the tenets of engineering design practices and higher engineering education contexts we identified four relevant dimensions for organizing these characteristics: the project characteristics, the role of the teacher, the assessment methods, and the social context. Drawing on these four dimensions, we systematically reviewed the state-of-the-art empirical literature on DBL or DBL-like educational projects in higher engineering education. Based on this review we conclude that DBL projects consist of open-ended, hands-on, authentic and multidisciplinary design tasks resembling the community of engineering professionals. Teachers facilitate both the process of gaining domain-specific knowledge and the thinking activities relevant to propose innovative solutions. Teachers scaffold students in the development from novice to expert engineers. Assessment is characterized by formative and summative of both individual and team products and processes and by the use of a variety of assessment instruments. Finally, the social context of DBL projects includes peer-to-peer collaboration in which students work in teams. The implications of these findings for further research on DBL in higher engineering education are discussed.

AB  - A modified essay is an open-ended question about clinical presentations, with the goal to test application of basic science principles to novel scenarios. Due to high reliability and validity, multiple-choice question (MCQ) examinations are more commonly used. We have employed a combination of MCQ and modified essay examinations in medical school. The correlation between MCQ and modified essay grades is positive but small, suggesting they may be testing different cognitive levels/skills. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of a non-graded mock modified essay on student's performance and satisfaction, and outline our best practices. We have found that it is important to involve faculty from multiple disciplines to construct robust cases, and to review examinations and rubrics. The mock modified essay resulted in higher performance and student satisfaction, and fewer students' comments related to subjectivity, frustration and anxiety. Yet, there was not an improvement in confidence. Moreover, there was no correlation between grades in the mock and graded modified essays, suggesting that the mock modified essay may not be useful to predict academic performance. Yet, the incorporation of a mock modified essay was useful to clarify expectations and provide guidance, potentially reducing the anxiety induced by an unfamiliar assessment.

AB  - Women are underrepresented and denied equal opportunities in the scientific community as a result of a rigid research culture and a lack of genuine academic support. Higher Education should go beyond the superficial treatment of women's empowerment. This article reflects on the heightened gender-based inequality during pandemic and calls for the academic community to take social action and contribute to women empowerment. It also advocates re-creating and revolutionizing the educational system to promote women's rights and welfare in pedagogical instruction, as well as involving more men as one of the potential solutions to strengthen women's empowerment. Higher Education should create and encourage more research opportunities and amplify policy spaces for women amid the fight against COVID-19. Academia should therefore adopt a feminist lens as an integral part of its structure to enact social change, because women empowerment is beyond mediocrity.

AB  - It has become increasingly apparent that no single method for teaching anatomy is able to provide supremacy over another. In an effort to consolidate and enhance learning, a modernized anatomy curriculum was devised by attempting to take advantage of and maximize the benefits from different teaching methods. Both the more traditional approaches to anatomy teaching, as well as modern, innovative educational programs were embraced in a multimodal system implemented over a decade. In this effort, traditional teaching with lectures and dissection was supplemented with models, imaging, computer-assisted learning, problem-based learning through clinical cases, surface anatomy, clinical correlation lectures, peer teaching and team-based learning. Here, we review current thinking in medical education and present our transition from a passive, didactic, highly detailed anatomy course of the past, to a more interactive, as well as functionally and clinically relevant anatomy curriculum over the course of a decade.

AB  - Digital competence and programming are actively highlighted areas in education worldwide. They are becoming part of curricula all over the world, including the Swedish elementary school curriculum, Children are expected to develop "computational thinking" through programming activities, mainly in mathematics--which are supposed to be based on both proven experience and scientific grounds. Both are lacking in the lower grades of elementary school. This article gives unique insight into pupils' learning during the first programming lessons based on a group of Swedish pupils' experiences when entering school. The goal of the article is to inform education policy and practice. The large interdisciplinary, longitudinal research project studies approximately 1500 students aged 6-16 and their teachers over three years, using video documentation, questionnaires, and focus group interviews. This article reports on empirical data collected during the first year in one class with 30 pupils aged 6-7 years. The social semiotic, multimodal theoretical framework "Design for Learning" is used to investigate potential "signs of learning" in pupils' multimodal "representations" when they, for example, use block programming in the primary and "secondary transformation unit." We show that young pupils have positive attitudes to programming and high self-efficacy, and that pupils' signs of learning in programming are multimodal and often visible in social interactions.

AB  - To remain competitive in an increasingly interdisciplinary world, graduate education must produce professionals who can understand both their scientific disciplines and the business environment in which they work. With the addition of applied learning components outside of the traditional scientific laboratory and training in business skills, Professional Science Master's programs (PSMs) help higher education adapt to this changing environment. The current study illustrates some models of PSMs and contains information on how institutions interested in using PSMs as a way to enhance applied learning at the graduate level can get started.

AB  - This study explores how different kinds of arguments are situated in academic contexts and provides an analysis of undergraduate writing assignments. Assignments were collected from the schools of business, education, engineering, fine arts, and interdisciplinary studies as well as the humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences in the College of Arts and Science. A total of 265 undergraduate writing assignments from 71 courses were analyzed. Assignments were reliably categorized into these major categories of argumentative writing: explicitly thesis-driven assignments, text analysis, empirical arguments, decision-based arguments, proposals, short answer arguments, and compound arguments. A majority of writing assignments (59%) required argumentation. All engineering writing assignments required argumentation, as did 90% in fine arts, 80% of interdisciplinary assignments, 72% of social science assignments, 60% of education assignments, 53% in natural science, 47% in the humanities, and 46% in business. Argumentation is valued across the curriculum, yet different academic contexts require different forms of argumentation. (Contains 2 tables and 1 note.)

AB  - The relevance of the study is conditioned by the modernization of engineering education aimed at specialists' training to solve engineering and economic problems effectively. The goal of the paper is to develop the technology of the innovative content's formation for engineering education. The leading method to the study of this problem is a method of quantization that allows compressing of the information to be studied and to create training modules and taxa. The study involved 430 teachers, 410 students who expressed their requirements for the content of engineering education, participated in the development and evaluation of training modules and taxa. Main results of the research consist in identifying of the stages for selection and structuring of the content for engineering education, requirements for the content (compliance with the invariant structure of professional activities; the system integrity of knowledge, abilities, skills, competences; taking into account of innovative educational, scientific and industrial developments) and defining of the rules for structuring (the compliance with professional functions; the identification of invariant and variant components; development of training modules; taxonomic representation of interdisciplinary relations; system integrity of structure-forming components). The significance of the findings is that the identified stages of selection and structuring of the content for engineering education provide extensive use of technology (controllability) of its formation; content requirements--selection of knowledge, abilities, skills, competences at the level of specific academic disciplines and their systematization; the proposed rules for structuring--integration of educational and vocational activities of students and research and teaching activities of teachers. The developed technology contributes to the relevance and accessibility of the content for engineering education, reliability of future engineers' vocational training, which is manifested in their readiness for multi-functional engineering and technical activities.

AB  - With the new European framework, as EAP lecturers in an engineering college, we are reappraising our teaching and the position of our courses. From the perspective of engineering education in the 21st century, we believe that EAP teaching can focus not only on language and communication needs, but also on developing critical thinking about science and technology in its social context. Considering these premises, we present the rationale for the development of an online learning environment ("Quantum LEAP, Learning English for Academic Purposes") which integrates EAP with interdisciplinary content, in order to encourage reflection on social, historical, economic and ethical issues related to science and technology. Through a pilot study of learners' initial reactions, we present their perceptions of this tool for critical thinking on STS contents and for promoting lifelong learning. The implications for EAP course design are then discussed in the context of 21st century engineering education. In sum, this paper questions the position that for the integration of language and content, the EAP teacher can only teach language and that content has to be taught by specialist teachers. Rather, we argue that EAP teachers can address both academic communication and interdisciplinary content in order to engage students in critical thinking. (Contains 6 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Many children get little to no regular physical education during the school day. National recommendations call for schools to offer physical activity as part of planned academic lessons that teach math, language arts, science, and other subjects through movement. The purpose of this study was to analyze the student and teacher perceptions of the Active Science curriculum to determine the feasibility of incorporating a classroom-based physical activity program into middle school science lessons. Forty-seven fifth and sixth grade female students and two science teachers were the subjects in the study. The instruments used to evaluate the student and teacher perceptions of the curriculum included (a) individual interviews with two science teachers; (b) written perception questionnaires completed by the students; and a (c) focus group interview with a sample of 8 students. Findings revealed that the students enjoyed incorporating physical activity into class, learned science content and skills, and utilized technology within the curriculum. Teachers felt that it was feasible to incorporate physical activity into the lessons and they identified that the curriculum improved students science knowledge and inquiry skills, exposed them to the use of technology and integrated fun and interactive physical activities into class.

AB  - Actual continuity of the problems stated in this article caused by the fact that modern education is directed at the formation of a mobile person of the teacher, who is able to transform the educational reality and himself in accordance with the requirements of a developing society, and to provide not only high-quality mastering studying the necessary content, but also the development of their personal qualities. The purpose of the article is to develop content-technological aspects of professional mobility of teachers in supplemental education system. The leading methods of research were: interdisciplinary analysis and data synthesis of the philosophical, sociological, natural-scientific, psychological and educational literature; analysis of foreign and domestic psychological and pedagogical experience for the formation of a mobile person in the educational systems; conversation, written survey, interviewing teachers and heads of educational institutions, the method of expert evaluations and self-evaluations; a method of self-managed adults, summarizing these results and ascertaining the formative experiment. The article reveals the essential characteristics (integrity, complementarity, coherence) and structure (personal activity, willingness to perform social roles, adaptability and creativity), formed the conceptual and categorical apparatus of personal mobility, specifications for the detection of the level of its development are proposed, psychological nature of personal mobility the teacher as a value-semantic constructs are disclosed in content and technological aspects of mobility in the system of supplementary education. The results can be used for the organization and implementation of supplementary educational qualification of teacher's development programs.

AB  - This paper attempts to add to the multifaceted discussion concerning neoliberalism and globalization out of two Cultural Studies of Science Education journal issues along with the recent Journal of Research in Science Teaching devoted to these topics. However, confronting the phenomena of globalization and neoliberalism will demand greater engagement with relevant sociopolitical thought in fields typically outside the purview of science education. Drawing from thinkers Michel Foucault, Jean Baudrillard, Judith Butler, and Louis Althusser this paper attempts to extend some key ideas coming from Ken Tobin, Larry Bencze, and Lyn Carter and advocates science educators taking up notions of ideology, discourse, and subjectivity to engage globalization and neoliberalism. Subjectivity (and its constitution in science education) is considered alongside two relevant textbook examples and also in terms of its importance in formulating political and culturally relevant questions in science education.

AB  - In this research, it is aimed to analyze the problem solving skills of university students in terms of different variables and to analyze the differences among the levels of perceived problem solving skill of the students of Physical Education and Sports College and other branch students. The sample consists of the university students from the School of Physical Education and Sports (128) and from the Department of Tourism and Hotel Management (104) from the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences Department (162), summing up 394 students (n[subscript female]=193, n[subscript male]=201) in total, based on the simple random sampling method. "Personal Information Form" and "Problem Solving Inventory (PSI)" were used as data collection tools. The T-test and One-Way ANOVA were used for normal distribution and LSD Test was used for determining the differences across groups. When the data were analyzed in terms of the variables of the study, it was found that a significant difference between the gender variable and problem solving skill in favour of males although there was no statistically significant difference between the problem solving skills and the place of birth of the students and the number of family members. It was found a significant difference between the students from School of Physical Education Sports and Department, students from Tourism and Hotel Management Department and students from the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences Department in favour of the students from The Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences Department. Based on the findings of the research; Problem-solving skills of the students of the Physical Education and Sports College were found to be lower than the other departments

AB  - This work describes the educational experiences gained teaching the Senior Design I & II courses, a senior level, two-semester sequence in the Electrical Engineering (EE) program at Georgia Southern University (GSU). In particular, the authors present their experiences in using robotics as the main area to develop the capstone senior design, with focus in interdisciplinary interactions and teamwork for the design and implementation of autonomous mobile robots. The other main purpose of the capstone design course sequence is for the students to experience working in an engineering application project researching and analyzing the sustainability, ethical and social impact issues related to their projects. The students work for two semesters as a team to design, test and build a mobile robot project for a particular application. Some of these projects have been fabricated to participate in different robotic competitions, including the IEEE sponsored hardware competition, the lawn mower competition, and the robot waiter competition.

AB  - One recommendation for encouraging young women and other underrepresented students in their mathematical studies is to find instructional methods, such as problem-based learning (PBL), that allow them to feel included in the learning process. Using a more relationally centered pedagogy along with more inclusive instructional methods may be a way to foster an interest in studying mathematics in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. However, many mathematics teachers are at a loss in not only how to instruct with PBL methods but also how to create the environment that encourages optimal learning.

AB  - Scientists' involvement in education has increased in recent years due to mechanisms such as the National Science Foundation's "broader impacts" expectations for research projects. The best investment of their effort lies in sharing their expertise on the nature and processes of science; film is one medium by which this can be done efficiently. In this article, we illustrate this approach through the development of Upward and Outward: Scientific Inquiry on the Tibetan Plateau, a 20 min educational documentary film for school science classrooms and teacher professional development. The film portrays the intellectual and human processes of science as seen through the work of an international team of scientists on an interdisciplinary geoscience research project. Evidence gathered from pre/post classroom assessment responses by 350 students in grades 6-14 indicates that students absorb a variety of messages about the intellectual and social processes of science. These ideas contrast with their prior knowledge, counter common stereotypes of science and scientists, and broaden students' notions of the scientific method. The film aligns with national and state standards on scientific inquiry and the nature of science.

AB  - In spite of numerous calls for action, e.g., Executive Office of the President (2010), there have been few efforts nationally to promote engineering education in the elementary grades. Of these, hardly any have targeted underrepresented populations (National Academy of Engineering, 2009, p. 74). The collaboration described in this paper is a significant exception, which could provide important lessons for those seeking to broaden the reach and scope of K-5 engineering education. We will argue for an interdisciplinary approach, which integrates engineering, math, science, literacy and art, and that engages a school and a university as equal partners. Neither of these components has been prominent in the literature on K-12 engineering education.

AB  - Much has been written about developing outdoor classrooms or how to generate effective and integrated learning using the outdoors. However, with the release of the "Next Generation Science Standards," teachers need to consider how they are going to design their science curriculum to include opportunities for students to learn about core disciplinary concepts, science and engineering practices, and the big ideas of science referred to as crosscutting concepts (NGSS Lead States 2013). For a seamless integration of all three dimensions, teachers will need to reimagine their approach to teaching science. The study described in this article has elementary students exploring their own backyards to experience the kind of fieldwork scientists might do in order to add value to their learning about the living world around them.

AB  - This article reviews significant contributions made by Joe L. Kincheloe to critical research in science education, especially through a multimethodological, multitheoretical, and multidisciplinary informed lens that incorporates social, cultural, political, economic, and cognitive dynamics--the bricolage. Kincheloe's ideas provide for a compelling understanding of, and insights into, the forces that shape the intricacies of teaching and learning science and science education. They have implications in improving science education policies, in developing actions that challenge and cultivate the intellect while operating in ways that are more understanding of difference and are socially just.

AB  - How can museums and other informal learning institutions cultivate greater civic engagement among the visiting public around important social issues? This case study of the National Network of Ocean and Climate Change Interpreters' (NNOCCI) professional learning community illustrates how insights from the social sciences can be productively integrated into existing museum interpretation practice. NNOCCI partnered with social scientists at the FrameWorks Institute to strengthen interpreters' capacity to improve museum climate literacy efforts through Strategic Frame Analysis™, an approach to communications research and practice that identifies how the public's deeply held worldviews impact civic participation. Key insights from FrameWorks' original research on the topics of climate change and oceans formed the content of training curriculum. Based on feedback from pilot participants, an interactive pedagogy suited to the museum education context was developed and expanded to reach 150 informal science education institutions through 2015.

AB  - As part of a multidisciplinary course that is cross-listed between five departments, we developed an undergraduate student laboratory experiment for culturing, isolating, and purifying the biopolymer, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), PHB. This biopolyester accumulates in the cytoplasm of bacterial cells under specific growth conditions, and it has attracted much recent interest since its biodegradability makes it environmentally friendly and its biocompatibility makes it an attractive choice for medical and therapeutic applications. This laboratory experiment would be a valuable addition to any traditional chemistry or polymer science curriculum, since it exposes the student to the field of biotechnology and teaches biological methodologies that are different from traditional methods of polymer synthesis. The experiment is designed so that the students perform the PHB cultivation and extraction processes in three stages that are easily accommodated within the scheduling confines of a typical undergraduate laboratory course. Moreover, the bacterially produced PHB can then be used by students in subsequent exercises for comparison with polymers produced using chemical synthesis. In addition to chemistry and polymer science curricula, this laboratory experiment would also be suitable for a variety of biology, biochemistry, or biotechnology curricula. (Contains 4 notes.)

AB  - This article addresses the interrelated questions of why it is important to teach students about the nature of interdisciplinarity and how this material might be best communicated to students. It is important to define for students what is meant by disciplines and interdisciplinarity. Having distinguished interdisciplinarity from the disciplinary approach, the advantages and disadvantages of each can be discussed. It is useful to discuss the history of both disciplines and interdisciplinarity. It is also useful to discuss the complex relationship between interdisciplinarity and other intellectual currents: postmodernism, unity of science, complexity analysis, feminism, and others. Critically, students should be guided as to how interdisciplinary research might be best performed. Some potential objections to teaching interdisciplinary research practice are addressed.

AB  - I analyse module outlines within a particular school of social sciences located in a faculty of education, and uncover the evolving systems of teaching social sciences in a teacher education curriculum. The data are analysed through two theoretical lenses: firstly, through the lense of models of teacher education and professional development, and secondly, through the lense of multicultural and multi-disciplinary studies. The analysis reveals that a new language around social sciences is still in the early stages of development, drawing its main referencing from the official policy of the National Curriculum Statement. Unable to develop an independent new language, the social sciences in teacher education tend to capitulate to external dominant forces. There is little evidence of engaging with a critical discourse around the potential of teacher education, resulting in a perpetuation of an applied science notion of professional growth. The juxtaposing of existing disciplinary boundaries constitutes the character of the delivery of the social sciences. I point to a "pedagogy of hope" which focuses on the future rather than on the present status of marginalisation of the social sciences in a teacher education curriculum. The paper offers a way to develop a "Creole", a language and a discourse around the social sciences in general, for teacher education in particular.

AB  - Demonstration shows are a popular form of chemical education outreach used to increase interest, engagement, and appreciation of chemistry. Although practitioners often include instructional elements, evaluation has been limited to children's attitudes toward science rather than their understanding of the underlying concepts presented. In 2006, we developed an interdisciplinary demonstration show that used elements from theater to engage children's minds, emotions, imaginations, and bodies in the act of learning. The result was "The Amazing Chemical Circus", a show that laid the groundwork for a new model of science education outreach that we call Fusion Science Theater. Assessments of learning following presentations of "The Amazing Chemical Circus" indicate significant gains in children's conceptual knowledge as well as their attitudes toward science. In this article, we draw parallels between scientific investigation and theatrical practices that reveal common underlying principles at work. We also report on the show's development, form, content, evaluation, and impact. Finally, we outline the Fusion Science Theater model, and briefly discuss the implications for chemical educators and students who wish to enhance their own outreach efforts.

AB  - At the heart of the vision for the Diploma in Science is a multidisciplinary approach to learning by tackling scientific challenges and questions in applied work-related contexts. This, together with the innovative delivery model offered by a consortia approach, will bridge a significant gap in the provision of science and mathematics education. The Diploma in Science is for learners who prefer to learn about scientific principles and concepts and to develop scientific skills by exploring the use of science in practical ways. These learners come from across the full ability range. The ability to apply scientific skills, concepts and principles, mathematical and statistical techniques, numeracy, problem-solving, team and presentational skills, financial and business awareness, IT and database skills, will all feature as learning outcomes of the Diploma in Science. These are learning outcomes that are being increasingly demanded by higher education and employers.

AB  - "To confess the truth, Mrs. B., I am not disposed to form a very favorable idea of chemistry, nor do I expect to derive much entertainment from it." That 200-year-old statement by Caroline to Mrs. Bryan, her teacher, appeared on the first page of Jane Marcet's pioneering secondary school textbook, "Conversations on Chemistry". It was published 17 years after Antoine Lavoisier's "Elements of Chemistry" and 2 years prior to John Dalton's "A New System of Chemical Philosophy". Caroline's classic comment foreshadows what many students have expressed since chemistry appeared as an early 19th-century school subject. Post-"Sputnik" efforts to capture students' interest and engagement, or, in Robert Mager's words, "approach tendencies", can be regarded as contemporary responses to Caroline's views. This is a summary of several collaborative initiatives and experiences since "Sputnik's" launch intended to stimulate student involvement in their learning. Among these are the Chemical Education Material (CHEM) Study project, the Chemical Bond Approach (CBA) project, Interdisciplinary Approaches to Chemistry (IAC), "Chemistry in the Community" (ChemCom), "SourceBook", and the National Science Education Standards.

AB  - The problem of PhD attrition, especially at the dissertation-writing stage, is not solely related to mentoring, departments, or disciplines; it is a problem that affects the entire institution. As such, solutions require collaborative efforts for student success. Building on Yeatman's master--apprentice model, which assumes mastering disciplinary writing in singular advisor--student contexts, and Burnett's collaborative cohort model, which introduced doctoral dissertation supervision in a collaborative-learning environment with several faculty mentors in a single discipline, the Dissertation House model (DHM) introduces a model of doctoral dissertation supervision that involves multiple mentors across several disciplines. On the basis of more than 200 students' reflections, we find that challenges in completing the dissertation extend beyond departmental and disciplinary boundaries. The DHM's multidisciplinary approach preserves the traditional master--apprentice relationship between faculty and students within academic departments while providing an additional support mechanism through interdisciplinary collaborative cohorts. Using Thoits's coping assistance theory and data from DH students over a 10-year period, the DHM incorporates Hoadley's concept of knowledge communities to establish a successful dissertation-writing intervention for graduate students across doctoral programs. Using propensity score analysis, we provide in this study an empirical assessment of the benefits and efficacy of the DHM.

AB  - For thousands of years, people have used music to transfer information and narrate stories. The musical structure, consisting of words set to melodies in rhythmic patterns, made the content easier to remember. Researchers have investigated the long- and short-term effects of song on memory and found that music aided in the recall of information. The author works with a chorus teacher to create an interdisciplinary unit using music to supplement the science curriculum. This particular subject involved creating lyrics and music to help students learn cellular components vocabulary. Trying to use music in the science classroom could be outside the comfort zone of many teachers; however, it could also add a new dimension to a classroom and excite students about learning.

AB  - We challenged an Aquatic Biology class to find a way to access, observe, and record aquatic habitats and organisms without causing disruption. Using off the shelf components the class was guided in the design and assembly of a remote controlled, video broadcasting, data collecting, floating vehicle based on a molded goose decoy. GOOSE-CAM or Guided Object Observatory for Scientific Experiments-Camera Afloat Module is now used to observe, count, and record aquatic invertebrates, fish, and plants. Recent additions have expanded GOOSE-CAM to record temperature, light (turbidity), and depth. The project fulfilled the dual educational goals of (1) integrating student biological knowledge with engineering, physics, and chemistry and (2) providing a context in which students develop problem-solving skills. The project required active participation, research, teamwork, and application learning in a realistic context to be able to support the collection of ecological data. With a bit of imagination, the concept could be adapted to other courses and environments. (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.)

AB  - Integration of anatomy and clinical teaching is a theoretical ideal, yet there is a worldwide paucity of such amalgamation. These teaching models provide support for medical trainees, an important element in Germany where orthopedic intern numbers have declined and anecdotal evidence suggests disinterest in orthopedics. The aim of the study was to develop an integrated anatomy-surgical course for undergraduate medical training, assess the model developed, and explore how medical students perceive orthopedics as a career. The course was to deliver medical anatomy and clinical orthopedic training, focusing on interdisciplinary teaching and learning, vertical integration of clinical knowledge and skills, and professional interaction. Survey evaluation of the course and students' perceptions of orthopedic careers was performed, including Likert-type responses rating variables of interest. A phased-concept program of five courses, each optional and under one-week in duration, was developed parallel to the undergraduate medical program. Delivered by anatomists and surgeons, courses included biomechanics, advanced dissection, surgical approaches, casts and implants, and sports medicine. Course data indicate positive support for course format, stimulation of interest, and high clinical relevance. Students are generally interested in surgery, and identify hierarchy, lawsuits, bureaucracy and physical stress as barriers to orthopedic careers. This novel phased-concept successfully delivers combined anatomy and surgery training in a vertically-integrated format while addressing students' clinical and professional skills. The format facilitates an appreciation of potential career options in orthopedics, while fostering professional skills during medical training. Barriers to careers in orthopedics can now be addressed in future courses.

AB  - Design and design thinking are increasingly being taught across several disciplines--ranging from arts, architecture, and technology and engineering to business schools--where expertise plays a central role. A substantial corpus of literature on research in regard to design expert and design expertise has accumulated in the last decades. However, in spite of its importance for design and design education, the topic has remained largely unframed. A major goal of this study was to carry out an assessment of literature through leading interdisciplinary design journals in order to identify main topics and categorize them into thematic patterns concerned with expertise in design. A structured assessment approach based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) was used over 861 abstracts. The emerging thematic patterns associated with design expertise allowed a categorization at different levels of detail, which included 80, 50, 20, and 12 factors analyses, respectively. The major contribution of the study was to offer a structured assessment of key design literature that enabled to gain a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the thematic patterns in the discussion on design expertise. Implications of the identified key factors for design education are discussed.

AB  - The acquisition of both transversal and specific competences cannot be achieved using conventional methodologies. New methodologies must be applied that promote the necessary competences for proper professional development. Interdisciplinary projects can be a suitable tool for competence-based learning. A priori, this might be complicated, as subjects are traditionally studied at the university level in isolated compartments, with a fragmented structure. Taking advantage of the creation of new degree programs in Mechanical Engineering and Electronic Engineering and Industrial Automaton, in the 2010-11 academic year we decided to add an interdisciplinary project (IP) to our teaching methodology. The importance of this project lies in the fact that it requires the participation of all the courses in all the academic years in the degree program. The present article explains the methodology used in the interdisciplinary project and how it was implemented in the first year of the Mechanical Engineering and Electronic Engineering and Industrial Automaton degree programs. Furthermore, an evaluation is conducted of all four years of the interdisciplinary project, revealing the main problems with its execution and how they have been addressed.

AB  - This article addresses the unique role performed by social foundations programs in colleges of education and in addressing broader issues facing education today, which fundamentally include the development of interpretive, normative, and critical perspectives in academia. All three perspectives serve to create a scholarly framework within which students and academicians interpret and normatively reflect upon existing educational, political, historical, religious, economic, and social institutions critically. In other words, although many departments in colleges of education tend to fulfill the functional, professional, and institutional requirements essential in preparing future teachers to enter public and private schools, social foundations programs utilize interdisciplinary expertise, primarily from the social sciences and humanities, to explicate extrainstitutional critiques, interpretations, and normative analyses of existing social structures, including schools. Although social foundations programs perform a variety of academic functions, it is this unique reflexive and normatively critical capacity--what critical theorists refer to as ideology critique--that augments social foundations programs and informs present and future scholars in the field.

AB  - One of the important goals of problem-based learning (PBL) in medical education is to enhance medical students' clinical reasoning--hypothetico-deductive reasoning (HDR) in particular--through small group discussions. However, few studies have focused on explicit strategies for promoting students' HDR during group discussions in PBL. This paper proposes a novel conceptual framework that integrates Toulmin's argumentation model (1958) into Barrows's HDR process (1994). This framework explains the structure of argumentation (a claim, data, and a warrant) contextualized in each phase of HDR during PBL. This paper suggests four instructional strategies--understanding argument structures, questioning, elaborating on structural knowledge, and assessing argumentation--for promoting medical students' argumentation in relation to HDR processes. Further implications of the proposed framework for other disciplines, such as science, legal, and engineering education, are also discussed.

AB  - Integrated STEM education seeks to build deep connections between science, technology, engineering, and math. Contextualized lessons give students greater access to these content areas and can heighten engagement. Great parallels can be drawn between liberal arts philosophies and integrated STEM education. This paper explores how one teacher team developed curriculum and enacted lessons using an integrated STEM approach. This study found that teachers viewed integrated STEM instruction as rewarding. The teachers also mentioned the need for constant communication to fully implement the model. Students perceived this model positively and enjoyed participation. Outcomes of this study have the potential to inform teacher preparation programs by making more transparent how implementation of integrated STEM models can be achieved.

AB  - When students see mathematics as an integrated field of study, they make connections, gain a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts, and see mathematics as a whole rather than disconnected, unrelated ideas. Measurement concepts are the perfect "seed to plant" to show how different mathematical strands integrate within other subject areas. The integrated activity shared here allowed middle school students to engage with measurement concepts and see the application of perimeter and area in a real-world scenario. Additionally, this activity allowed students to engage in spatial reasoning by measuring a physical space and rendering a scaled drawing to plan a school garden. Integrating these types of activities helps students relate physical spaces to mental models, thereby improving their spatial reasoning. The authors integrated the arts and cultivated conceptual understanding of measurement and STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics) subjects by asking the students to create a scale drawing or map of a garden.

AB  - The integration of coding in K-12 mathematics education is occurring throughout jurisdictions around the world. Best practices for applying coding practices in teaching mathematics are gaining research attention, and teacher education programmes are increasingly offering professional development to support this initiative. This paper discusses strategies and lessons learned over a 5-year period of developing and offering mandatory coding education as part of mathematics teacher preparation. We identify some of the requisite knowledge and experiences needed in order to overcome coding anxiety and begin to adopt coding as part of mathematics teaching practice. In particular, we discuss a distinction between learning coding through mathematics and learning mathematics through coding.

AB  - This paper aims at shedding light on what students can "construct" when they learn science and how this construction process may be supported. Constructivism is a pluralist theory of science education. As a consequence, I support, there are several points of view concerning this construction process. Firstly, I stress that constructivism is rooted in two fields, psychology of cognitive development and epistemology, which leads to two ways of describing the construction process: either as a process of enrichment and/or reorganization of the cognitive structures at the mental level, or as a process of building or development of models or theories at the symbolic level. Secondly, I argue that the usual distinction between "personal constructivism" (PC) and "social constructivism" (SC) originates in a difference of model of reference: the one of PC is Piaget's description of "spontaneous" concepts, assumed to be constructed by students on their own when interacting with their material environment, the one of SC is Vygotsky's description of scientific concepts, assumed to be introduced by the teacher by means of verbal communication. Thirdly, I support the idea that, within SC, there are in fact two trends: one, in line with Piaget's work, demonstrates how cooperation among students affects the development of each individual's cognitive structures; the other, in line with Vygotsky's work, claims that students can understand and master new models only if they are introduced to the scientific culture by their teacher. Fourthly, I draw attention to the process of "problem construction" identified by some French authors. Finally, I advocate for an integrated approach in science education, taking into account all the facets of science learning and teaching mentioned above and emphasizing their differences as well as their interrelations. Some suggestions intended to improve the efficiency of science teaching are made.

AB  - Bridge programs, in which underprepared students gain the academic and technical skills necessary for college level courses and entry-level employment, are a promising initiative for expanding access to, and success in, community college education. For career pathways related to science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM), bridge programs are critical for enlarging the pool of students who are exposed to, and can aspire to, STEM preparation. This study, conducted with support from the National Science Foundation Advanced Technological Education program, followed four community colleges for a year to understand local factors that facilitated or impeded implementation of a bridge program in which basic skills were contextualized in biotechnology. The findings are that implementation of a contextualized curriculum requires substantial faculty learning. Implementation of these bridge programs was facilitated by instructional leadership by both administration and faculty. Administration assisted in creating the conditions that supported learning by coordinating faculty schedules and funding faculty time for initial and ongoing program development. Faculty benefitted by the support of experienced team members who could guide interdisciplinary learning. Implementation was facilitated when team members met frequently and when faculty worked collaboratively to implement the curriculum. Recommendations include planning for faculty development, both for faculty collaboration and contextualizing curriculum.

AB  - Developmental science has recognized the import of ecological theory and research in furthering understanding of development in context. However, despite the fact that ecological and intersectional theory share points of commonality, few researchers to date have attempted to integrate these perspectives. This manuscript addresses this gap and highlights three ways that an intersectional lens can advance settings-level research. With a focus on neighborhoods as settings of development, we (1) describe how intersectionality may manifest itself within neighborhoods, (2) discuss how intersectionality can inform our understanding of how individuals experience neighborhoods, and (3) detail strategies for conceptualizing and measuring intersectionality in neighborhood research. As such, the goal of this manuscript is to push thinking on the ways that intersectionality may inform and advance settings-level research in developmental science.

AB  - This article addressed the need for authentic interdisciplinary instruction. Authentic interdisciplinary instruction is defined as a learning activity that simultaneously improves student performance related to grade-level standards in two or more disciplines (e.g., science and physical education). The process described for creating authentic interdisciplinary lessons included: (1) get a list of grade level standards from all disciplines; (2) compare the list of standards to the physical education standards at the same grade level; (3) look for related standards (commonalities) from two or more disciplines; and (4) create interdisciplinary lessons that address these standards. Interdisciplinary instruction can help teachers provide students with an enjoyable, rich, and motivational learning environment (Leppo & Davis, 2005).

AB  - There was a doughnut thief loose and the students were determined to put their science skills to use to track down the culprit. They would use forensic science to eliminate suspects and identify the thief who stole the doughnuts. School staff take on the role of the likely suspects. It was their goal to develop an interdisciplinary unit that engaged students as critical thinkers, communicators, and investigators. It was successful in this regard. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - Traditionally, nursing students learn medical subjects and nursing separately, which makes it difficult to develop an integrated understanding. This study aimed to explore nursing students' experiences of participating in a case seminar integrating medical and nursing sciences and if, and how, it contributed to their learning. A case seminar divided into a "laboratory session" and a "follow-up session" was developed. The case seminar was evaluated by group interviews and an open-ended questionnaire. Forty-four third-year nursing students agreed to participate. Themes of motivation, authenticity, professional development, collaboration and integration were identified. The case seminars help nursing students to integrate medical science with nursing science, which supports them in their professional development and role as registered nurses.

AB  - Twenty-first century and global skills are generally described as competencies for communication and problem solving. Additionally, these skills involve developing the ability to view content-specific issues through a multicultural perspective. Preparing K-12 students for STEM careers in an ever-changing workplace means they must have opportunities to concurrently acquire skills in twenty-first century and global learning. Additionally, the professional biology community has called for advancing middle grades students' knowledge of complex scientific phenomena using novel pedagogies like Project-Based Learning (PBL). Thus, middle grade educators are now tasked to design classroom opportunities for STEM-focused PBL using global interaction to hone global and twenty-first century skills, while developing students' content knowledge. In this article, we provide an account of a classroom-centered project that paired middle school students in Texas with Chinese peers to collaborate on a biology-based PBL activity on the topic of genetics. During the seven-day unit on heredity, the goal was to utilize global collaboration in STEM to achieve learning objectives in the biology curriculum (understanding inheritance and differentiating between dominant and recessive traits), while embedding skills that foster global competency and twenty-first century skills. The context, planning, and outcomes of the global collaboration are discussed, as well as recommendations for future global collaborative STEM initiatives in middle school.

AB  - Severe flooding was prevalent within the authors' region at the beginning of the school year. Many homes and fields were affected by the amount of rain that fell within a short period of time over multiple days. Their students were concerned about the impact this natural phenomena was having on their local community. Natural phenomena can provide wonderful learning opportunities for students to identify solutions to problems using engineering practices (Achieve 2016). Engineering is a pivotal discipline within the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States 2013) because children can apply their knowledge of science concepts to solve real-life problems (NRC 2012). Therefore, the authors utilized this natural phenomena the students were experiencing to set the stage for an integrated science and engineering unit. Students in an afterschool program were given the problem that the local basketball team needed extra energy so they needed the students help with growing plants. However since the area was getting too much water, the plants were dying. What could the students do to help with this problem? The students worked on a solution for one hour a week over a six-week period. After reflecting on the unit, the authors believe it would have been better to implement the lessons in the spring. During the spring, garden plants are available and investigations could occur outdoors for a more authentic learning experience. In addition, they recommend providing more opportunities for students to observe their plants throughout the week so that they can document daily rather than weekly changes. However, regardless of these changes, they found the unit helped the students learn about the needs of plants and allowed them to apply this knowledge when designing a water diversion structure.

AB  - This commentary adopts a broad perspective in considering the contributions of papers from cross- and interdisciplinary fields of mathematics education, psychology, child development and neuroscience. The discussion aims to complement the commentary by Dindyal, focused on background research on geometry and implications for pedagogy and curricula. Spatial reasoning is considered as a common underlying theme salient to most of the papers in this issue. The fundamental role of spatial ability or visual thinking skills in young children is traced through the various theoretical approaches of studies ranging from concepts such as perspective taking, symmetry, and two- and three-dimensional shape, to the role of technological tools in mapping and location. Intervention studies to promote early spatial reasoning also provide insight into effective transformative practices. New questions are raised about the crucial development of spatial reasoning in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education. The commentary suggests the need for a more strategic research agenda that aims to coordinate the key questions and methodologies that investigate what may seem common problems.

AB  - This paper presents and discusses examples of works of art which, if included in science curricula, could prompt an understanding by students of some concepts in optics through a discussion of the context in which they were created. Such discussion would elucidate the meaning of the artworks and, at the same time, challenge students' misconceptions, attracting their attention to the scientific aspects of the art works concerned. This type of learning represents a culturally rich approach to modern science curricula. The simplified contrasting of science and humanities is criticized.

AB  - Background knowledge is a strong predictor of reading comprehension, yet little is known about how different types of background knowledge affect comprehension. The study investigated the impacts of both domain and topic-specific background knowledge on students' ability to comprehend and learn from science texts. High school students (n = 3,650) completed two background knowledge assessments, a pretest, comprehension tasks, and a posttest, in the context of the Global, Integrated, Scenario-based Assessment on ecosystems. Linear mixed-effects models revealed positive effects of background knowledge on comprehension and learning as well as an interactive effect of domain and topic-specific knowledge, such that readers with high domain knowledge but low topic-specific knowledge improved most from pretest to posttest. We discuss the potential implications of these findings for educational assessments and interventions.

AB  - Environmental studies provide an ideal opportunity for gifted children of any age to build critical and creative-thinking skills while also building skills in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) areas. Exploring issues related to sustainability and environmental concerns permits gifted learners to identify problems, develop research questions, gather and analyze data, develop possible solutions, and disseminate this information to others. Green issues are especially appealing to gifted learners as they are sensitive to the world around them and often long to engage in projects that touch on issues facing their communities. Although the relevance to STEM subjects is clear, green investigations can also build skills across the content areas, in diverse subjects such as English/language arts, social studies, music, and art. A variety of resources, including national and Common Core State Standards, exist that can help parents and teachers create investigations for gifted children that permit them to be both gifted and green.

AB  - This self-study addresses two questions: (1) how did self-study aid the teacher educator in interrogating her beliefs about and mediate her projection of teacher-as-facilitator versus teacher-as-expert? and (2) in what ways did prospective elementary teachers in an undergraduate, interdisciplinary science course exert control over their learning as a result of the teacher educator's self-interrogation of practices? In her teaching role with prospective teachers, Nicole explored a major myth about teaching concerning the image of the professor as the primary expert in the classroom. Critical events analysis revealed instances where she exerted power as an expert or assumed the role of facilitator. Instead of clearly marked instances where she took actions to exert her various roles in the classroom, she found that classroom events could not be categorized neatly. There were cases where she acted as an expert and students felt free to make their own decisions about their learning. When she was uncertain or attempted to relinquish control, students often responded by not taking control of their learning.

AB  - Education lacks a strong infrastructure for connecting research with educational practice and policy. The need for this linkage grows as findings in cognitive science and biology become ever more relevant to education. Teachers often lack the background knowledge needed to interpret scientific results, whereas scientists often lack an understanding of pedagogical goals. We need to build an infrastructure that supports sustainable collaboration between researchers and teachers and creates a strong research foundation for education. A primary agent of the lasting collaboration between researchers and practitioners in medicine is the teaching hospital, where researchers and practitioners work together on research that is relevant to practice and the training of young professionals. Education needs analogous institutions--research schools--that join researchers and teachers in living, community-based schools. In these schools, practice shapes research as much as research informs practice. Research schools will provide a fundamental infrastructure for linking transdisciplinary research on learning with educational policy and practice.

AB  - The article considers the role of elective courses in professional development of students of economics. Modern European education is developing on the principles of democratization and humanization, where democratization implies the involvement of all agents/participants of the education process into forming its content and solving numerous related problems. Moreover, in order to be competitive in global labour market, modern specialists must develop such features as mobility, cultural, language and religious empathy, professionalism, commitment to the human virtues, etc. The content of education expressed in the curriculum is now not a rigid unity. Offering elective courses, university curricula can be easily modified to the students' needs and aspirations. The analysis of the curricula of the economic faculties at some leading European universities has showed a great amount of elective courses mainly in general subjects such as Psychology, Pedagogy, Philosophy, History, Politology, Social Science, etc. These courses make up approximately 10 % of the total study load and are meant to realize interdisciplinary links, deepen students' understanding of economic phenomena and develop analytical and strategic thinking. On the one hand, by choosing elective courses students are more agitated in learning, more interested and motivated. On the other hand, universities think harder over the supply of subjects and their content. At the same time, it increases lecturers' motivation to consider new approaches, update information, and on the whole do their best to make their subjects appealing to students. The research has proved that elective courses realize an important role in students' professional and personal development by integrating knowledge of many subjects, through their participation in tailoring the curricula and enriching their professional portfolio.

AB  - In this paper, the authors describe how two institutions are helping their undergraduate biology students build quantitative competencies. Incorporation of quantitative skills and reasoning in biology are framed through a discussion of two cases that both concern introductory biology courses, but differ in the complexity of the mathematics and the type of changes involved. First, at the University of Maryland-College Park, MathBench Biology Modules (via an interactive Web-based instructional service) are providing supplemental materials to illustrate and develop quantitative competencies basic to biology. The second example, at Davidson College, uses a unique text to introduce a wide range of students, including those with no calculus experience, to challenging mathematical concepts in biology. The textbook emphasizes learning through modeling and data analysis, activities that are integral to developing understanding in biology. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Consequential learning is an equity-oriented framework in which students create learning pathways to pursue what matters to themselves and to the communities they care about. In this paper, I seek to identify the moments of consequential learning from a story in which my students and I danced together to express a set of scientific knowledge: change in atomic configuration during photosynthesis while sustaining the total mass as consistent. Taking an autoethnographic approach, I examine the ways in which consequential learning was presented during the project and how I worked as a change agent to support it. Based on findings that show how students and I sought to transform science into a powerful tool to actualize what mattered to them while creating varied patterns of participation, I argue that, as change agents for consequential learning, teachers should take a stance on students as a rightful presence.

AB  - Students can learn subjects more meaningfully through integrated education, as it helps them to link school education with their real lives. There is a strong need to develop an alternative integration method to promote effective implementation of integrated education at a classroom level. The purpose of this study was to develop a model for instructional design for the integration of mathematics and science, and to design and implement instructions using the developed model. The implications of applying the model to lower grade students in Korea were also discussed.

AB  - Transaction, competition and opposition have become imperative in higher education. In this article, I will explore where to go from here building on critical pedagogy and ideas from students-as-partners and undergraduate research. Using the course 'Environments for learning in higher education' as an empirical starting point and approaching students' work through qualitative document analysis, I will explore: (1) what students focus on when given the opportunity to design their own research questions around learning environments; and (2) how they re-imagine and frame future learning environments in the higher education. With this as a backdrop, I will discuss how a critical dialogic teaching praxis can help to think about the university as a place for collaboration between students and academics with the common purpose to co-create knowledge and meaning.

AB  - Conventional school science has often portrayed obesity as a self-inflicted problem. It tends to ignore perspectives at the systems level, such as social, political, marketing and economic factors that shape an obesogenic environment that determines individual eating and lifestyle patterns. Therefore, socioscientific decisions (e.g. fat tax) are likely to be biased against the obese and ultimately fail to overcome this global health challenge. Students should examine obesity from multiple perspectives to make informed decisions about it. Based on the concepts of adherence and prevalence in the conceptual change literature, this paper examines students' learning of multiple perspectives in terms of (i) a change in the number of references to different perspectives in making sense of obesity and (ii) a shift in adherence to and prevalence of different causes of obesity. A total of 114 undergraduate students from a diverse range of major subjects enrolled in a general education course about obesity participated in this study. The course design was guided by an SSI Teaching and Learning model. Pre-/post-course questionnaires, essays, and follow-up interviews were used to chart students' learning during the 12-week course and 6 months afterwards. The students became more able to explain obesity using perspectives from multiple dimensions. They adhered less strongly to personal-level causes of obesity and more accepting of systems-level perspectives. We conclude by arguing that it is not only important for teachers to enhance the number of perspectives considered by students, but also attend to their differences in weights to facilitate students' learning of SSI.

AB  - Acquisition of conceptual knowledge is a central aim in science education. In this study we monitored an interdisciplinary hypermedia assisted learning unit on hibernation and thermodynamics based on cooperative learning. We used concept mapping for the assessment, applying a pre-test/post-test design. In our study, 106 9th graders cooperated by working in pairs (n = 53) for six lessons. As an interdisciplinary learning activity in such complex knowledge domains has to combine many different aspects, we focused on long-term knowledge. Learners working cooperatively in dyads constructed computer-supported concept maps which were analysed by specific software. The data analysis encompassed structural aspects of the knowledge corresponding to a target reference map. After the learning unit, the results showed the acquisition of higher-order domain-specific knowledge structures which indicates successful interdisciplinary learning through the hypermedia learning environment. The benefit of using a computer-assisted concept mapping assessment for research in science education, and in science classrooms is considered.

AB  - The social sciences rely on assumptions of a unified self for their explanatory logics. Recent work in the new multidisciplinary field of social neuroscience challenges precisely this unproblematic character of the subjective self as basic, well-defined entity. If disciplinary self-insulation is deemed unacceptable, the philosophical challenge arises of systematically bringing together neurological, psychological, sociological, and anthropological dimensions of analysis in one framework such as dynamic systems theory; and of finding bridging concepts such as memory, social cognition, and cultural scripts that can facilitate the cross disciplinary study of the reflexive self. Relying on the systemic philosophy of science developed by Mario Bunge, this paper takes some steps in this direction.

AB  - Previous research has highlighted the effectiveness of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) in multiple disciplinary settings, including medicine, teacher education, business, allied health, and the social sciences. Yet interdisciplinary educators have very little information about how to implement PBL in classrooms where multiple disciplines are represented. This paper offers practical strategies for the successful implementation of PBL in an interdisciplinary context in which learners have a limited knowledge base. In this paper we will a) highlight challenges to interdisciplinary teaching, b) demonstrate how PBL and traditional teaching techniques can be used in an interdisciplinary context, and c) discuss strategies to engage students in making scientific discoveries of their own.

AB  - New advances in neurobiology are revealing that brain development and the learning it enables are directly dependent on social-emotional experience. Growing bodies of research reveal the importance of socially triggered epigenetic contributions to brain development and brain network configuration, with implications for social-emotional functioning, cognition, motivation, and learning. Brain development is also impacted by health-related and physical developmental factors, such as sleep, toxin exposure, and puberty, which in turn influence social-emotional functioning and cognition. An appreciation of the dynamic interdependencies of social-emotional experience, health-related factors, brain development and learning underscores the importance of a "whole child" approach to education reform and leads to important insights for research on social-emotional learning. To facilitate these interdisciplinary conversations, here we conceptualize within a developmental framework current evidence on the fundamental and ubiquitous biological constraints and affordances undergirding social-emotional learning-related constructs and learning more broadly. Learning indeed depends on how nature is nurtured.

AB  - Ultimately with the raise of computer technology, blended learning has found its way into teaching. The technology continues to evolve, challenging teachers and lecturers alike. Most studies on blended learning focus on the practical or applied side and use essentially pedagogical concepts. This study demonstrates that the leadership sciences can enrich pedagogy in building a framework for teaching in a blended learning setting. At the core, the study transforms situational leadership theory (Hersey, Blanchard and Johnson, 2008) into a framework for blended learning. The model presented helps in organizing a situationally correct employment of blended learning and crystallizes appropriate teaching methods for specific learning goals.

AB  - Background: Over the past two decades, inclusive STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) high schools have emerged as one strategy for increasing and broadening participation in STEM majors and careers, particularly for currently underrepresented students in those fields. However, limited research has examined whether strategies used in inclusive STEM schools can actually improve students' STEM-related attitudes and academic achievement, and reduce gender and race/ethnicity gaps. Material and Methods: The current exploratory study uses multiple linear regression models to examine associations between students' ratings of inclusive STEM school strategies and student outcomes. Interactions were also used to explore whether such associations differed by students' gender identity and race/ethnicity. Results: Results indicate that when students report positive implementation of specific strategies used by inclusive STEM schools, race/ethnicity and gender gaps in science attitudes and overall academic achievement are reduced or reversed. Conclusions: Findings from this study set the stage for further research, suggesting that while some inclusive STEM high school strategies may have the potential to contribute to STEM outcomes across diverse populations of students, significant gaps remain.

AB  - This document-based historical study looks back at the early years of the social foundations of education program that originated at Teachers College, Columbia University, in the 1930s-1940s, and focuses on the sociopolitical, intellectual, and educational currents that helped bring it about. Drawing on archival materials and published monographs by the field's original practitioners and later observers, this study situates the emergence of social foundations at Teachers College on the heels of the development of social studies in secondary schools. The study suggests that many of the same rationales that undergirded social studies were applied to social foundations, with the belief that future citizens should be endowed with the capacity to solve contemporary social problems based on the wisdom of the ages, the realities of present-day circumstances, and the tools of critical analysis. Consequently, foundations courses such as Teachers College's pathbreaking Ed.200F were broad, synthetic, and interdisciplinary in design, so that students could apply all the critical tools of social science research to the various problems of society at once. In the end, social foundations was essentially a program of social studies for educators: the ed school phase of social education writ large. Appreciating the shared origins and fates of these two educational enterprises can help us understand what may be done to revitalize social education in an age when it increasingly has become marginalized in schools and teacher education programs alike.

AB  - Personal health & wellbeing are rated more highly in those with higher educational qualifications than those without, and good health & wellbeing are likely to impact upon student attendance and hence attainment at university. It is important to understand factors which may affect perceived health and wellbeing from a student perspective in order to develop university-specific campaigns to correct misinformation. In addition, multidisciplinary working is characteristic in the post-graduation world, but is difficult to truly replicate within formal university teaching. This project had two aims. First, through a crossdisciplinary staff-student collaboration, to explore student perceptions of health and wellbeing in Kingston University. Second, to enable students from a range of disciplines to work in active partnership with each other and with academic staff. A quiz was completed by almost 300 undergraduate students. Results from this and focus group discussions demonstrated reasonable knowledge of a range of lifestyle risk factors affecting health, but misinformation about the safety of vaccines and the importance of nutrition, activity and adequate sleep for maximising health, wellbeing and thus, potentially, university attainment. Future work is planned with Kingston University undergraduate students to address identified misconceptions. Student partners highly rated the opportunity for active learning, partnership working with staff and being part of a cross-disciplinary project team.

AB  - This paper argues that the nonkilling political scientist Glenn D. Paige could be seen as an extraordinary peace educator. It will be organized through three words -- reading, writing and talisman. It begins with a brief discussion of the method used in understanding political scientist Glenn D. Paige's life as a teacher. Then, the author's 'reading' and 'writing' experiences, from taking courses with him, and writing a PhD dissertation under him, will be examined. The way in which political science education could perhaps be considered a form of peace education will be discussed. The concluding section on 'talisman' advances Paige's central idea of politics in terms of making decisions, especially to choose alternatives which could mitigate the killing effects and enhance nonkilling possibilities.

AB  - Extension is experiencing a trend toward closer alignment of its programs serving families and youth, notably Family and Consumer Sciences and 4-H Youth Development. Projects are more multidisciplinary and comprehensive than in the past, and, in many states, FCS and 4-HYD are also becoming more administratively integrated. Several reasons for this shift are recent developments in social science intervention theory, Extension budget reductions, and land-grant universities' long-term organizational strategies. We discuss implications for Extension faculty and the need to track and understand the restructuring process. Overall, the emphasis on collaboration and comprehensiveness provide opportunities for more effective Extension programming.

AB  - The interdisciplinary nature of robotics allows mobile robots to be used successfully in a broad range of courses at the postgraduate level and in Ph.D. research. Practical industrial-like mobile robotic demonstrations encourage students and increase their motivation by providing them with learning benefits not achieved with traditional educational robotic platforms. This paper presents VEGO, an industrial-like modular vehicle platform for robotic education with an appropriate infrastructure that has been demonstrated to be very useful at the postgraduate level. Besides learning engineering concepts, in performing industrial-like exercises, students develop valuable skills such as teamwork and the capacity to solve problems similar to those they may encounter in a real industrial environment. The developed infrastructure represents a valuable platform for robotic education that can be used in many different disciplines as a way to demonstrate how to cope with the difficulties and challenges related to the development of industrial infrastructure systems. The platform evaluation proved its ability to inculcate the expected engineering skills. A novel approach is adopted through the use of multidisciplinary and close-to-industrial-reality platforms developed under an incremental approach and using an open and customizable structure.

AB  - A mixed-methods research study was designed to examine teachers' knowledge and confidence for implementing a STEM-based problem-based learning (PBL) unit in their 6-12 grade science and math classrooms. Twenty-one teachers (7 in-service and 13 pre-service) participated in an intensive two-week summer workshop during which they engaged in, and then created, an immersive PBL unit related to sustainable energy. Data were collected through a pre-post content knowledge test and two pre-post surveys--one measuring knowledge and confidence for implementing PBL and one measuring science teaching efficacy. Daily reflections and focus group interviews provided additional data regarding teachers' changing knowledge and confidence related to both content and PBL methods. Results revealed significant gains in content knowledge related to concepts in energy, confidence for implementing PBL, and science teaching efficacy. Implications for the professional development of rural STEM teachers and the importance of engaging teachers in a professional development experience that integrates STEM content and PBL methods also are discussed.

AB  - The impact of humans on aquatic systems is covered in French high schools in the "Premiere" level (ages 16 to 17) by students studying economics and social sciences. We designed experiments to teach critical thinking about water pollution and how citizens can act to minimise it. The experimental session, which lasts three consecutive days, takes place in a non-profit public training centre for experimental science located within a research institute. The classroom is divided into groups of four to seven students, and each group is tutored by a PhD student. High school students are presented with results from publications on fish mutations, develop hypotheses, perform experiments and discuss their results, just as researchers do in their daily work. Students learn to ask and answer the following questions on the biological, chemical, economic and social aspects of water pollution: What are the origins of biological and chemical pollutants in an aquatic ecosystem? How can the population be made aware of aquatic pollution? How can the willingness of the local population to pay for the protection of their regional ecosystem be evaluated? At the end of the experimental session, each group of students prepares a poster presentation and discusses with an external expert. (Contains 6 figures, 3 tables, and 3 notes.)

AB  - Recent research on doctoral education in the U.K. has revealed the increasing number and diversity of academic relationships that shape the lives of research students, and students' own role in activating, mobilising and maintaining these relationships. Higher education policy reforms promoting doctoral "skills training", interdisciplinary communities, thematic centres and supervisory teams, all create new networks for students to negotiate. Often beneficial and supportive, this article explores the "unmentionable" consequences of relationships that gradually go awry. This study began as a project exploring the everyday experiences of doctoral students and early career researchers in the Social Sciences within the U.K. As the research unfolded, we began to encounter accounts of neglect, exploitation and denigration. While such stories have long been part of postgraduate life, their seeming persistence in the face of robust quality assurance and supervisory codes needs further exploration. We offer three portraits of difficult doctoral journeys to explore these "unmentionable" experiences and explore whether they are linked to growing institutional and career pressures on academics to prioritise research "productivity".

AB  - The education of future health care professionals must involve activities where interprofessional collaboration and the functioning of interdisciplinary teams are the goals and not the exceptions. This type of interprofessional education (IPE) will benefit students as they will be better able to communicate with and mobilize the skills of other health care workers, work toward common goals related to patient care, and develop a more cost-effective treatment strategy in the long term. Such an IPE program was initiated in the clinical anatomy course for physician assistant students from the University of Mount Union that was taught, in part, by medical students from the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University. Surveys of both student groups at the end of the course indicated that although this was a useful IPE experience, the value of this program as an IPE experience was not entirely appreciated by the participating students. It turned out that although the goals and importance of these types of IPE activities are clear to the faculty, they must also be made clear to all of the students.

AB  - The National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Grand Challenges provides the theme for this NSFfunded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site. Research topics, with their broad societal impact, allow undergraduate students from multiple engineering disciplines and computer science to work together on exciting and critical problems. The approach to addressing the need for research in critical technical areas includes: providing research training in multi-disciplinary research fields; developing technical and professional skills; networking with fellow REU students and participating faculty advisors; and raising student interest and awareness in both graduate studies and our nation's most critical problems. The Grand Challenges investigated by student participants include: making solar energy economical; providing access to clean water; advancing health informatics; securing cyberspace; restoring and improving urban infrastructure; engineering the tools of scientific discovery; engineering better medicines; and advancing personalized learning. Over a three-year period, 34 students participated in the REU Site and 58.8% were students underrepresented in engineering. The student participants published their work and gave presentations in regional and national conferences. Several graduate students gained leadership experience by assisting in program coordination. Based on surveys, overall, student participants value most the opportunity to contribute to a research group on exciting and relevant problems. Tracking efforts resulted in locating 100% of the student participants. We found 38.2% completed their undergraduate degrees and now have positions in industry; 38.2% are currently in graduate school and 8.8% have completed their graduate degrees; 14.7% are still pursuing engineering or computer science undergraduate degrees.

AB  - The Maker Movement has taken the educational field by storm due to its perceived potential as a driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation (Honey & Kanter, [Honey, M., 2013]; Martinez & Stager, [Martin, L., 2013]). Making is promoted as advancing entrepreneurship, developing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce, and supporting compelling inquiry-based learning experiences for young people. In this paper, we focus on making as an educative inquiry-based practice, and specifically "tinkering" as a branch of making that emphasizes creative, improvisational problem solving. STEM-rich tinkering activities are designed to support interdisciplinary investigations and creativity using a STEM-rich palette of tools, concepts, and phenomena. To date, the majority of research on making has focused on analysis of makerspaces, maker communities, and design and implementation of maker activities. In this paper, we describe a study that documented dimensions of learning in tinkering programs designed for museum visitors. The study, which was jointly negotiated among a team of researchers and practitioners, led to the development of a Tinkering Learning Dimensions Framework and a publicly available video library of tinkering exemplars, both of which are being actively used by tinkering practitioners in their direct service to the public and professional development work for the field.

AB  - This study concerns the design and development of online instruction and specifically targets interaction and communication between online learners. Facilitating appropriate and meaningful interactions in designing instruction is a major goal for anyone developing a course, especially an online class. The data for this study came from the online courses offered at one of the major Rocky Mountain University. The research subjects and courses were taken from the College of Education, College of Business, College of Arts and Sciences and College of Health Sciences. The findings of this study suggest that the interactivity in an online class depends on the discipline it belongs to and hence, future research must focus on explaining the overall interactions within a discipline.

AB  - STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) refers to the cross-disciplinary learning design for engaging students in applying integrated knowledge to complete a project or solve a complex problem. It has been recognized by many scholars for its educational significance. However, STEM tasks are generally complex and challenging to students. Without proper supports, not only will students' participation decrease, but their knowledge level and internal capabilities will also hardly improve. To help students understand teachers' rating standards, increase the opportunity to observe and receive feedback on peers' work, and improve their cognitive level and higher order thinking such as critical thinking, this study proposes a peer assessment-facilitated STEM (PA-STEM) approach. At the same time, a quasi-experiment was conducted in a junior high school in Taiwan to verify the effectiveness of this approach. A total of four classes of 112 students participated in the experiment. The experimental group (two classes with 53 students) learning with the PA-STEM approach, and the control group (two classes with 59 students) used the conventional STEM approach. The experimental results showed that the students in the experimental group had higher learning achievement. Their collaboration tendency, critical thinking awareness, problem-solving tendency, and meta-cognition tendency were all significantly better than those of the students in the control group. Besides, peer assessment scores were highly correlated with teacher assessment scores, indicating that students were able to fully understand teachers' rating standards and provide accurate ratings of their peers' STEM work.

AB  - Reading texts can prompt intense emotions, and these emotions profoundly influence learning from texts. I first discuss the findings from the eight studies reported in this special issue. The studies represent pivotal advances in research on reading. Focusing on learning from science texts, they show that different emotions and different types of text influence reading in different ways. Furthermore, they document how the interplay of emotions, text features, and reading processes impacts knowledge acquisition, conceptual change, and attitude change. I then outline core directions for future research. We need to: (a) expand current theories to adequately explain the multiple links between emotions, cognitive processes, and motivational processes during reading; (b) use causal designs to disentangle the cause-effect relations linking these processes to antecedents and outcomes, including reciprocal causation; (c) complement between-person designs with intra-individual analysis; (d) use dynamic measurement and multichannel indicators to capture emotional processes; and (e) investigate the generalizability of current findings across diverse groups of learners and sociocultural contexts.

AB  - Science is constantly changing. If one hopes to keep pace with advances in science, one cannot simply repeat what one has done in the past, whether deciding how to invest limited research funds, searching to replace a retiring colleague, or teaching introductory psychology. Psychological science in the 21st century is more central and integrated than it was in the 20th century; yet, these changes are not always reflected in introductory psychology. In this essay, I identify several clear trends in psychological science based on where we have been and where we are currently as a science. I also examine the implications of these trends for how we teach psychology and train our students.

AB  - With the increasing emphasis on integrating engineering into K-12 classrooms to help meet the needs of our complex and multidisciplinary society, there is an urgent need to investigate teachers' engineering-focused professional development experiences as they relate to teacher learning, implementation, and student achievement. This study addresses this need by examining the effects of a professional development program focused on engineering integration, and how teachers chose to implement engineering in their classrooms as a result of the professional development. 198 teachers in grades 3-6 from 43 schools in 17 districts participated in a yearlong professional development program designed to help integrate the new state science standards, with a focus on engineering, into their teaching. Posters including lesson plans and student artifacts were used to assess teachers' engineering practices and the implementation in their classrooms. Results indicated that the majority of the teachers who participated in the professional development were able to effectively implement engineering design lessons in their classrooms suggesting that the teachers' success in implementing engineering lessons in their classroom was closely related to the structure of the professional development program.

AB  - This article follows the culmination of the scientific thought of the neurobiologist Christfried Jakob (1866-1956) during the later part of his career, based on publications from 1930 to 1949, when he was between 64 and 83 years of age. Jakob emphasized the necessity of bridging philosophy to the biological sciences, neurobiology in particular. Thus, we consider him as one of the early protagonists in the emergence of neurophilosophy in the 20th century. The topics that occupied his mind were the foundations for a future philosophy of the brain, and the "neurobiogenetic", "neurodynamic", and "neuropsychogenetic" problems in relation to how consciousness emerges. Jakob's views have many elements in common with great thinkers of philosophy and psychology, including Immanuel Kant, William James, Edmund Husserl, Henri Bergson, Jean Piaget and Willard Quine. A common denominator can also be discerned between Jakob's dynamic approach and certain aspects of cybernetics and neurophenomenology. Jakob propounded the interdisciplinarity of sciences as an indispensable tool for ultimately solving the enigma of consciousness. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - This book contains a compilation of papers presented at the International Psychological Applications Conference and Trends (InPACT) 2019, organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (W.I.A.R.S.). Modern psychology offers a large range of scientific fields where it can be applied. The goal of understanding individuals and groups (mental functions and behavioral standpoints), from this academic and practical scientific discipline, aims ultimately to benefit society. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the several areas within the Psychology field, new developments in studies and proposals for future scientific projects. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between psychologists, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in psychological issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement the view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons there are nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. InPACT 2019 received 322 submissions, from more than 35 different countries from all over the world, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. 107 submissions (overall, 33% acceptance rate) were accepted for presentation in the conference. The conference also included: (1) One keynote presentation by Prof. Dr. Glenys Parry (PhD, CPsychol, FBPsS, Emeritus Professor, School of Health & Related Research, University of Sheffield, United Kingdom). (2) Two Special Talks, one by Prof. Dr. Michael Wang (Emeritus Professor of Clinical Psychology, University of Leicester, United Kingdom), and the other by Prof. Dr. Luís Delgado (Applied Psychology Research Center Capabilities and Inclusion (APPsyCI) -- University Institute, Portugal). We would like to express our gratitude to all our invitees. The Conference addresses different categories inside Applied Psychology area and papers fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. The conference program includes six main broad-ranging categories that cover diversified interest areas: (1) Clinical Psychology: Emotions and related psychological processes; Assessment; Psychotherapy and counseling; Addictive behaviors; Eating disorders; Personality disorders; Quality of life and mental health; Communication within relationships; Services of mental health; and Psychopathology. (2) Educational Psychology: Language and cognitive processes; School environment and childhood disorders; Parenting and parenting related processes; Learning and technology; Psychology in schools; Intelligence and creativity; Motivation in classroom; Perspectives on teaching; Assessment and evaluation; and Individual differences in learning. (3) Social Psychology: Cross-cultural dimensions of mental disorders; Employment issues and training; Organizational psychology; Psychology in politics and international issues; Social factors in adolescence and its development; Social anxiety and self-esteem; Immigration and social policy; Self-efficacy and identity development; Parenting and social support; Addiction and stigmatization; and Psychological and social impact of virtual networks. (4) Legal Psychology: Violence and trauma; Mass-media and aggression; Intra-familial violence; Juvenile delinquency; Aggressive behavior in childhood; Internet offending; Working with crime perpetrators; Forensic psychology; Violent risk assessment; and Law enforcement and stress. (5) Cognitive and Experimental Psychology: Perception, memory and attention; Decision making and problem-solving; Concept formation, reasoning and judgment; Language processing; Learning skills and education; Cognitive Neuroscience; Computer analogies and information processing (Artificial Intelligence and computer simulations); Social and cultural factors in the cognitive approach; Experimental methods, research and statistics; and Biopsychology. (6) Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytical Psychotherapy: Psychoanalysis and psychology; The unconscious; The Oedipus complex; Psychoanalysis of children; Pathological mourning; Addictive personalities; Borderline organizations; Narcissistic personalities; Anxiety and phobias; Psychosis; Neuropsychoanalysis. This book contains the results of the different researches conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to study and develop research in areas related to Psychology and its applications. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters that are hereby sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. We would like to thank all the authors and participants, the members of the academic scientific committee, and of course, to the organizing and administration team for making and putting this conference together.

AB  - Engineering is prominently included in the "Next Generation Science Standards" (Achieve Inc. 2013), as it was in "A Framework for K-12 Science Education" (NRC 2012). The National Research Council, authors of the "Framework," write, "Engineering and technology are featured alongside the natural sciences (physical sciences, life sciences, and Earth and space sciences) for two critical reasons: (1) to reflect the importance of understanding the human-built world and (2) to recognize the value of better integrating the teaching and learning of science, engineering, and technology" (p. 2). For nine years, the authors' team has been developing and testing engineering curricula for elementary students. They are engaged in this endeavor because, like the National Research Council, they recognize the importance of technological literacy. In this article, they show how science and engineering practices can be integrated into the elementary classroom by providing snapshots of activities from one of their STEM curriculum units. The unit, focused on aerospace engineering, challenges students to design parachutes for a spacecraft that will land on a planet with an atmosphere thinner than Earth's. The "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS") specifies that children should engage in eight science and engineering practices. Herein, the authors present scenes from an elementary school classroom that show children engaging in all eight engineering and science practices while they work on engineering parachutes. The activities the authors describe have been done successfully with students who are both experienced and not experienced with these practices. They also present examples in which these children, as they are engaged in engineering design, apply their scientific and mathematical knowledge and skills. They do this to illustrate how science, technology, engineering, and mathematics can be integrated, as the "NGSS" advocates.

AB  - A teacher network was formed at an Australian university in order to better promote interdisciplinary student learning on the complex social-environmental problem of climate change. Rather than leaving it to students to piece together disciplinary responses, eight teaching academics collaborated on the task of exposing students to different types of knowledge in a way that was more than the summing of disciplinary parts. With a part-time network facilitator providing cohesion, network members were able to teach into each other's classes, and share material and student activities across a range of units that included business, zoology, marine science, geography and education. Participants reported that the most positive aspects of the project were the collegiality and support for teaching innovation provided by peers. However, participants also reported being time-poor and overworked. Maintaining the collaboration beyond the initial one year project proved difficult because without funding for the network facilitator, participants were unable to dedicate the time required to meet and collaborate on shared activities. In order to strengthen teacher collaboration in a university whose administrative structures are predominantly discipline-based, there is need for recognition of the benefits of interdisciplinary learning to be matched by recognition of the need for financial and other resources to support collaborative teaching initiatives.

AB  - The relevance of the researched problem stems from ecological issues that are a reflection of the contemporary culture crisis covering the whole range of people's interactions with each other, with society and with nature. In many respects, an ecological crisis is an ideological crisis and global environmental problems are impossible to solve without development of ecological culture, without the joint efforts of experts in various fields of science, industry, art and education. This article aims to substantiate the special role of design in solving the challenges of sustainable development, in particular, in the development of consumer culture, as it is an integrated and interdisciplinary activity involved in the social, political, economic and technical processes. The leading methods of investigating this problem are the ones of cultural and historical analysis that allow to comprehensively trace trends in design taking into account adequate cultural context, ideology and system of social values. The article deals with the socio-cultural role and involvement of design in the process of consumption and control of consumers' minds in the context of environmental issues; substantiates the necessity to change the design determinants, values and worldview orientation of design that will affect the consumer culture in accordance with the objectives of sustainable development and will promote the development of society's ecological culture.

AB  - This math activity focuses on experimental design while connecting math with life science. It is important that the science and engineering practices (SEPs) are not taught as a separate "unit" but integrated within the curriculum wherever possible. The focus is on experimental design to teach animal behavior. Students predict and test how parental care improves offspring survivorship. This activity is a "growth and development of organisms" activity that is brief and can be used to supplement (not replace) the more traditional weeks-long observation of hatching insects.

AB  - This article explores the place of complexity science within education and educational research. The discussion begins with the suggestion that educational research has a history of adopting interpretive frames from other domains with little adaptation. Complexity science is argued to compel a different sort of positioning, one that requires accommodation and participation rather than unproblematized assimilation and application. The argument is developed by considering the following simultaneities in education (and) research: knower and knowledge; transphenomenality; transdisciplinarity; interdiscursivity; descriptive and pragmatic insights; representation and presentation; affect and effect; and education and research.

AB  - This article presents a semester-long, interdisciplinary project-based learning (PBL) suitable for secondary and postsecondary students enrolled in a second-semester (i.e., intermediate) meteorology course. This case-study approach builds on the research question "What atmospheric conditions lead to tornadoes, hail, and damaging winds locally?" Students work collaboratively in a series of five activities, using an online database analyzing map and weather data from a subset of severe weather events. Students synthesize the data by identifying the severe qualitative weather variables that appeared most frequently among the cases and modify, if necessary, accepted threshold values for the quantitative variables. Students finalize the project via an oral presentation and technical paper to transform their newly discovered knowledge into improved severe weather forecasting guidance for societal benefit. An analysis of pre- and postsurvey responses from a small student sample reveals increases in both the comfort and experience of the PBL's components, with the oral presentation showing the most significant impact. After the project, students could identify in greater depth those antecedent atmospheric conditions that generate tornadoes, hail, and strong winds.

AB  - A fully realized disability studies (DS) of music is interdisciplinary, qualitative and accessible through common discourse, without jargon, disciplinary codes, or numerology. It embraces DS's social model theory, where "disability" is the social construction of "impairment," analogous to the relationship between "gender" and "sex." The interdisciplinary transcendence of forms and norms of individual fields is a scholarly/political stance consistent with liberatory DS goals. The recent emergence of music DS, with few precedents from traditional musicology/theory, has mandated greater interdisciplinarity, employing the full range of social and somatic scholarship, as well as popular culture references. The most critical issues in music DS are in education, beyond music-specific concerns, and best expressed qualitatively as individual and group narratives. The often covertly quantitative nature of music theory is outed as oppressive to people with disabilities and contrasted with the liberatory power of sharing stories.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this project is to provide an account of the student experience at a higher education institution known for its holistic approach to sustainability education. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative study was conducted at Green Mountain College (GMC), an environmental liberal arts school in Poultney, VT; 55 students participated in focus group interviews. Findings: Students articulate that the most valuable gains that manifest at GMA are a variety of new capacities for science literacy, anthropological appreciation, the triple bottom line, a sense of place, systems, empathic decision-making and reasoning, interdisciplinary collaboration, and practical techniques supporting self-sufficiency. Prompting these emergent outcomes was a philosophy of practice at Green Mountain College, which included place-based techniques, empowerment, personalization, community ecology and charting polarity. Many students described their seeming metamorphosis as uncomfortable, and some felt isolated from the outside paradigm. Research limitations/implications: A key implication of the study's findings is that in a holistic setting, the line between the informal and formal curriculum are significantly blurred and what is implicitly communicated through university practices and values is what most transforms the students' explicit understanding of sustainability. Practical implications: Sustainability education is far more than technique, far more than what a lone instructor can manifest in students. While the persistence of individual faculty members is important, this evidence suggests that the fertile conditions for transformation may be more fruitful when faculty members work together with a collective sense of responsibility and a well-articulated paradigm. Originality/value: The advantage of the present study is that it examines the perceived impact of a focus on sustainability across curricula and school by considering the educational environment as a whole. The experiences of students from many different majors who are involved in a holistic, sustainability-infused curriculum at a university with a history of successful post-graduation job placements in the sustainability field are explored here.

AB  - Cross-curricular programming offers unique opportunities to connect non-majors with science. In this article, the author describes personal experiences related to a novel initiative uniting science, civics, and citizenship that may serve as a model for course and program development at other colleges. In this model, students from multiple majors explored several historical and contemporary disease events. The primary pedagogical goals were to examine how both social and scientific forces shaped those events and how they have shaped society today; and to reflect on how those experiences can inform future scientific and social decisions.

AB  - Transdisciplinarity has been a veritable mantra, especially in the humanities and social sciences, for twenty years or more. Yet academic structures and research application requirements still struggle to come to grips with cross-boundary research and teaching. Making universities more trans-discipline-friendly is a tricky task, however. As Wendy Russell explains, trans-disciplines require disciplines, and disciplinary boundaries, too.

AB  - In this study, adults naïve to organic chemistry drew stereoisomers of molecules and explained their drawings. From these explanations, we identified nine strategies that participants expressed during those explanations. Five of the nine strategies referred to properties of the molecule that were explanatorily "irrelevant" to solving the problem; the remaining four referred to properties that were explanatorily "relevant" to the solution. For each problem, we tallied which of the nine strategies were expressed within the explanation for that problem and determined whether the strategy was expressed in speech only, gesture only, or in both speech and gesture within the explanation. After these explanations, all participants watched the experimenter deliver a 2-minute training module on stereoisomers. Following the training, participants repeated the drawing + explanation task on six new problems. The number of relevant strategies that participants expressed in speech (alone or with gesture) before training did "not" predict their post-training scores. However, the number of relevant strategies participants expressed "in gesture only" before training "did" predict their post-training scores. Conveying relevant information about stereoisomers uniquely in gesture prior to a brief training is thus a good index of who is most likely to learn from the training. We suggest that gesture reveals explanatorily relevant implicit knowledge that reflects (and perhaps even promotes) acquisition of new understanding.

AB  - Undergraduate research experiences have been widely demonstrated as a beneficial and essential component of the college experience. However, many community colleges face barriers and lack of support in implementing such research programs, which means a significant number of community college students miss out on these impactful experiences. Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) represent a feasible way to increase access to research experiences within community colleges. To investigate whether these CURE opportunities resulted in comparable to 4-year university CURE students, a CURE program was developed across various disciplines in a large community college and the impact on community college students was assessed. Analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data showed that students reported improvement in research skills, increases in confidence, and increases in educational aspirations. Peer interactions and instructor relationships in CUREs were identified as key factors associated with increases in research skills. Key factors associated with increases in educational aspirations included confidence in research-based courses, seeking additional research opportunities, and building a meaningful relationship with the instructor, but only if confidence increased as well. Our findings indicate that CUREs positively impact student outcomes in the community college setting and may provide increased access to research experiences.

AB  - Purpose: This paper unfolds the ways in which Croatia, as a young post-communist democracy, has aligned its transition and consolidation with the development of education programs that would support the protection of human rights and the creation of a democratic political culture. Design/methodology/approach: By combining the existing studies with the authors' own analyses of documents and internet sources, as well as interviews with teachers, this paper reveals that by adopting vague and non-binding policies, the Croatian political elite has demonstrated a lack of political will and courage over the past twenty-five years to develop a systematic and quality-based citizenship education. Findings: After long-term negligence, in the most recent five-year period, the need to change the educational path has gained prominence on the policy and political agenda. However, the reform process did not result in bridging, but in the deepening of ideological divides within the Croatian society. With the officially adopted interdisciplinary and cross-curricular approach, the responsibility for carrying out citizenship education was placed in the hands of teachers, with civil society organizations taking a compensating role. Whilst the former lack practical education, as well as guidelines and resources to incorporate citizenship education into the subjects they teach, the latter are incapable of reaching out to a sufficient share of the youth population. The outcome is that the youth continuously displays inadequate levels of citizenship competences.

AB  - Good academic writing is a necessary skill for researchers and takes time and experience to master. With some exceptions (Jones et al., 2011), many students are left to attempt publication after they have completed their course. It is logical that new graduates with unpublished data are targets for predators. Support for the development of writing skills and for legitimate publication of student research should be a priority in all academic institutions. However, the art and science of publishing research are not limited to developing writing skills and being on the lookout for predatory publishers. Students whose later careers will involve reporting research would benefit from early awareness of some of the other hazards and issues they might encounter. Emerging researchers need to recognise and understand such topics as intellectual property and data ownership; roles, rights and responsibilities in interdisciplinary research and collaboration; conflicts of interest; research ethics; maintaining professional credibility as a researcher; publishing industry-funded research; rivalry and competition among researchers; gift, ghost and guest authorship; the meaning of author order; and the potential for exploitation of junior researchers. Armed with the rules of the publication game, and with the skills to promote ethical fair play, new graduates are in a unique position to contribute knowledge in their field through proper publication practices.

AB  - Undergraduates' low participation/response rates on interdisciplinary (campus-wide) and disciplinary (specific department) surveys have been attributed to survey fatigue. To investigate this attribution's merits, the present study conducted a systematic literature search (five electronic databases plus one search engine) and critiqued findings of relevant publications returned by the search. This study found that (a) survey fatigue has not been rigorously defined, (b) the number of relevant peer-reviewed publications is unexpectedly limited, and (c) their findings are contradictory. These results have implications for policies and practices that restrict undergraduate survey administrations to minimize survey fatigue and boost participation/response rates. The present report recommends improving undergraduates' participation/response rates by requiring instruction about surveys combined with assessments of student learning outcomes.

AB  - From the time of ancient Greece until late nineteenth-century Europe, the humanities enjoyed a status of respect and prestige. From the latter half of the 1990s, their status and prestige dropped, mainly due to the low economic value of the humanities for a goal-oriented generation and due to the limited representation of humanities graduates in centers of power and employment. The current study illuminates the efforts of Israel's institutions of higher education to attract students and the need for the humanities in 2020. The article explores the resources involved in the study, thought, psychological comprehension, knowledge base, and aesthetic development characteristic of humanities disciplines. Select examples from the field of the arts illustrate the humanities' unique contribution to a world focused on technology, science, and the pursuit of money and profit. This study focuses on Israel as a case study that illuminates the status of the humanities in institutions of higher education around the world. The state of these studies in Israel was explored through learning products approach and ways of coping with the challenges of the twenty-first century, and highlights the significance of humanities studies in the technological world into which contemporary academic institutions have been drawn. This research discusses the paradigmatic change in higher education from content-centered to learning-centered academic programs and from STEM to STEAM.

AB  - Increased demand, limited resources, knowledge gaps, and seemingly less time to produce results are the challenges facing researchers and others in higher education today. Working together across disciplines is almost a requirement to stay afloat in the competitive arena most principal investigators are finding themselves in. This study sought to synthesize existing research on leadership behaviors of these investigators in the agricultural discipline. The sections specifically addressed include team science, discipline structure, boundary work, challenges of interdisciplinary research, the direction of research, and leadership in interdisciplinary teams. After analyzing 32 articles, researchers determined that research should continue to investigate the role of leadership behaviors in primary investigators to continue to improve effectiveness.

AB  - Much criticism exists concerning a lack of focus on real-world problem-solving in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) infrastructures. Many of these critics say that current educational infrastructures are incapable in preparing future scientists and engineers to solve the complex and multidisciplinary problems this society will face. Engineers must be trained to meet these challenges by incorporating a combination of learning paradigms to solve real-world, multidisciplinary, multifaceted problems. To assist in understanding how to solve these problems, Cost Engineering and Analysis and Project Management knowledge, integrated into an undergraduate Engineering Economy Course will provide students with additional knowledge necessary to produce quality Capstone design projects and obtain useful skills for today's engineering work environment. The content was designed as additional content embedded into the Engineering Economy course to introduce students to Cost Engineering and Analysis and Project Management. The method of introduction was through instruction, case studies, and ultimately application into a final group project that mimics the thought process of the Capstone experience and then, further used as a holistic approach to Capstone design projects. Integrating Cost Engineering and Project Management into an undergraduate Engineering Economy course proves to be a valuable addition to the engineering curriculum. This supplemental knowledge provides matriculating students with the skills necessary to successfully manage Capstone design projects and prepares them for project management activities in the real world.

AB  - This paper deals with the training of undergraduate engineering students and is interdisciplinary in nature. It brings together three distinct aspects of scientific dissemination: the content of an engineering degree; the oral transmission of this content following the effective TED talks model; and the use English as a medium of scientific transmission. The paper highlights the need for trainee Spanish engineers to be able to communicate their work to the public through oral presentations that are brief and entertaining, yet scientifically rigorous. The core of the study consists of an analysis of a particular TED talk that is relevant for a variety of engineering degrees. We conclude that while it is necessary for Spanish engineers to receive specific training at a professional level in oral communication skills, there is a close relationship between the mode of transmission and the subject specific content to be transmitted that needs to be considered carefully. Developing a mastery of English is important, but essential communication skills are the most crucial aspect, regardless of the language of communication.

AB  - Although interdisciplinary efforts in teaching and research are promoted as a possible antidote to increasing disciplinary separatism in colleges and universities, evaluations of interdisciplinary efforts in the classroom, particularly those spanning the traditional science-humanities divide, are not frequently documented. This article describes the development, execution, and assessment of a unique effort in interdisciplinary teaching in which four doctoral candidates from widely varying home disciplines collaborated to create and teach a "truly interdisciplinary" course for first-year students centered on the pervasiveness of humankind's quest for immortality. Assessment of the course indicates several desirable student outcomes, including the development of a more mature world view and appreciation for different epistemologies, which recommend the continuation of this and similar interdisciplinary efforts. While students at times found the enormous number of disciplines potentially related to the central topic overwhelming, at the conclusion of the course, they largely identified the exposure to new perspectives as an exciting and worthwhile academic experience. Similar interdisciplinary efforts in the classroom are encouraged, though ample course development time is recommended to maximize success. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - Because of a shortage of physical exercise, concerns about adolescents have recently been raised in Taiwan. In educational environments where student exercise has been limited by scheduling constraints and the lack of physical exercise has become a vital problem, "learning while exercising" may be part of a possible solution. This study developed the Ecosystems Augmented Reality Learning System (EARLS) and also made a comparison of EARLS, existing keyboard/mouse-based computer assisted instruction (KMCAI) approaches, and traditional face-to-face teaching methods, in terms of learning achievement and learning attitude. In this study, 1211 subjects were surveyed and divided into 5 groups. Students from the first three groups used EARLS but were exposed to different sections of the system. In terms of learning achievement, learning while exercising groups do not learn less well than the KMCAI or traditional groups. However, they earn extra exercise without diminishing the quality of learning achievement. With regard to the attitude subscales "Usefulness of learning Ecosystems" and "Anxiety in learning Ecosystems", the students in the traditional-teaching group had the significantly lowest scores for both while the students involved in EARLS had the highest ratings on "Usefulness of learning Ecosystems" and the students within KMCAI rated the highest anxiety in learning ecosystems.

AB  - Growing interest in integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (iSTEM) education has been promoted as one way to increase innovation capacity, support future employment, and enhance learning outcomes in K-12 education throughout the USA. Existing efforts to construct iSTEM curricula have largely focused on finding points of integration among commonly shared disciplinary practices, but these efforts have not explicitly accounted for the distinct epistemologies of the disciplines. In this study, we critically examined the concept of iSTEM by conducting a thematic analysis of K-12 STEM learning standards documents to identify cross-cutting themes among the practices of the various disciplines. We then analyzed these themes using disciplinary epistemologies in order to highlight some promises and perils of an integrated approach to STEM education. We identified eight cross-cutting themes: communicating, investigating, modeling, using tools, working with data, making sense of problems or phenomena, solving problems, and evaluating ideas or solutions. Through our analysis of practices and epistemologies, we discuss the promises of iSTEM, including fewer learning standards, enhanced epistemic fluency, increased diversity and inclusion in STEM, and opportunities to challenge settled and siloed disciplinary knowledge. We also discuss potential perils, which consist of conflation and/or exclusion of various STEM practices and epistemologies. We urge continued examination of iSTEM with an eye toward the epistemic implications.

AB  - Nanoscale science and engineering (NSE) and nanotechnology are emerging fields that have captured the attention of scientists and engineers, as well as mainstream media. However, the general public is relatively unaware of NSE, and schools (both K-12 and undergraduate institutions) rarely include nanotechnology as part of their curriculum. To help fill this gap in public and student understanding and to engage a broad base of learners, a suite of interdisciplinary activities connecting nanotechnology and stained glass artistry was created. The suite of activities has been successfully adapted for use in a wide range of educational settings (e.g., museums, K-12 classrooms, outreach events) for diverse audiences (e.g., children, high school students, members of the general public) to achieve a range of learning objectives.

AB  - This column provides original articles on innovations in case study teaching, assessment of the method, as well as case studies with teaching notes. In this month's issue the authors describe an interdisciplinary approach to case study teaching that addresses the demand to balance the goals of process and content. The case study, Salem's Secrets (Nava-Whitehead and Gow 2008), is used both as an approach to introduce the scientific method and hypothesis testing and as a way to integrate learning across the curriculum. The case  examines the Salem witch trials that took place in the late 1600s in Salem, Massachusetts. Several hypotheses are presented to explain the symptoms experienced by the accusers, including mass hysteria, outright fakery, and fungal toxicity. Statistical evidence culled  from primary source records of Salem (Woodward 1969) and published in the journal "Science" (Caporael 1976; Spanos and Gottlieb 1976) is presented to students for analysis. In the end, students are expected to synthesize the information presented throughout the case to formulate a defensible conclusion supported by data that they consider  scientifically valid.

AB  - A new, interdisciplinary high school geoarchaeology curriculum unit, titled "Living with Volcanoes," was created and tested in two pilot lessons with 30 high school students total studying geography and classical civilization in northern England. Students were highly engaged during the curriculum unit and showed positive learning gains and favorable shifts in perceptions as measured immediately before and after its implementation. Geoarchaeology combines disciplinary knowledge from geoscience and archaeology to construct novel approaches to past human inhabitation and environmental interaction. The curriculum unit was designed to introduce this field to high school students, following guidelines from interdisciplinary studies, and it was modified iteratively, based on interviews with four high school teachers of relevant classes. It combines short lectures and group work in a 90 min, interactive format to address a variety of questions surrounding the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius and its impact on the town of Pompeii and other nearby areas. Pilot survey and observational data, combined with feedback from students and teachers, were used to modify the curriculum unit. Restructured case study questions now provide better scaffolding for students, and teachers are provided with an answer key to better support facilitation. "Living with Volcanoes" has the potential to be utilized in cross-disciplinary recruitment for both geoscience and archaeology, at the high school and introductory postsecondary level. This broader, interdisciplinary approach to curriculum development may be applied to other fields of geoscience that transcend common disciplinary boundaries.

AB  - Social sustainability embraces literacy development as a means by which children integrate their knowledge in society and become powerful and meaningful. In this context, the development of writing among young children requires the design of new teaching strategies that allow for the multimodal repertoire brought by children into the classroom. Systemic Functional Linguistics offers tools for the analysis of children's multimodal writing, which plays an important role in their literacy development. Our research was carried out in an urban context, the participants being 12 children aged 7 to 8. Data were collected through participant observation, conversations, and the analysis of documents and products generated by the children. From them, we analysed two stories written by two girls, which showed the way in which the children created meaning by combining verbal and visual modes, and how these modes interact (intersemiosis). The performance of a literacy task in which children are able to integrate their knowledge and heritage into the classroom, may constitute an interdisciplinary tool for their participation and engagement in the school, thus leading to a more equal society. In consequence, we propose that the integration of a genre-based pedagogy in the classroom should include greater awareness in teachers of the value of pupils' multimodal assessments.

AB  - The purpose of health education is to positively influence the health behavior of individuals and communities, as well as living and working conditions that affect health. The goal of a Healthy Lifestyles course that is offered to undergraduate students enrolled in a university general education program (e.g., liberal arts education, core curriculum) is to build fundamental skills and to promote voluntary behavior change activities. As defined by Moore (2006), liberal education is "a philosophy of education that empowers individuals, liberates the mind from ignorance and cultivates social responsibility" because it "provides students broad exposure to multiple disciplines and more in-depth study in at least one field or area of concentration" (p. 46). As much as this definition of liberal education is shared among those in liberal arts education programs and the health education profession alike, it was challenging to convince a group of diverse faculty from multiple programs (arts, sciences, social sciences, etc.) at a public university to approve a new general education course centered around health behaviors. During the past 20 years, the faculty at this public university resisted including a Healthy Lifestyles course in the requirements of the general education curriculum. This article discusses the process used to add a required Healthy Lifestyles course to the general education program. The effects of this innovation and its limitations will be discussed, as will the effects of the course on students. The benefits of including a health education course in the general education program will also be addressed. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - Participatory evaluation tools have been shown to be effective for program development in various settings, including in higher education. Taking student perspectives into consideration is key for graduate program development, particularly in interdisciplinary programs. The current study utilizes Group Level Assessment (GLA), a participatory program evaluation tool, to evaluate the Biomedical Informatics (BMI) PhD Program at the University of Cincinnati (UC) and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). The study was conducted two years after the program was established, an appropriate timing to gauge the opinions of current doctoral students as the program grows and develops. The findings show the strengths and identify areas of improvement of the doctoral program, providing an evidence base for administrators and faculty to work collaboratively with students to capitalize on assets and address potential issues.

AB  - This study explored three high school agriculture teachers' perceptions of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) integration through interviews. The approach was constructivist and data were analyzed according to the framework of integrated STEM education presented in a National Academy of Sciences report. Each participant agreed to complete three interviews that first investigated past experiences, then present perceptions, and lastly reflections on meaning. A total of about six hours of interview data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Teacher perceptions were outlined individually and then compared. The teachers shared similar perceptions related to time constraints, the effects of STEM integration, concerns about rapport with students, how agricultural education has changed, and curricular resources. Perceptions aligned well with the framework of integrated STEM education because teachers described increased student interest, motivation, and career-readiness due to agriculture programs, and these perceptions were in some cases supported by non-agriculture teachers. Misconceptions of STEM education included incomplete definitions of engineering education and viewing the use of instructional technology as STEM education. Teacher educators may benefit from increased insight into the perceptions of veteran teachers.

AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate the progress in operational scientific literacy skills through demonstrating cognition associated with undertaking scientific processes. Scientific literacy is taken here to mean utilising science knowledge and skills, particularly with relevance to creative problem solving and making reasoned decisions in real life situations. The instrument was compiled based on a review of relevant international literature, plus competences emphasised in the Estonian science curriculum. Items in the instrument followed the levels of the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO taxonomy) and all tasks in the instrument were contextualized to relate to real life. A stratified sample of students from 44 schools gave a data set with returns from 1128 beginning of 10th grade students and 946 end of 11th grade students. Findings suggested that there was no sufficient shift from one grade to another in operational skills such as giving scientific explanations, problem solving and justified decision making. Although students did gain more knowledge and the expectation was that students would enhance their operational skills for scientific literacy, this was not reflected in their competence to solve problems. This suggested there was a need to re-think science teaching and learning approaches as well as the manner in which science was introduced to students.

AB  - The United States economy is requiring employees to have knowledge and skills in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Researchers have identified agriculture, food, and natural resources (AFNR) education as a context in which STEM concepts can be formally taught and highlighted. Additionally, researchers have identified where, within the 3-circle model of agricultural education, students can develop STEM-related career skills. However, a conceptual model illustrating an integrated approach to STEM-AFNR education does not exist. The purpose of this research study was to identify where STEM technical content and employability skills can be explicitly taught, highlighted, and developed, within the current model of agricultural education. Research findings suggest STEM technical content can be explicitly taught and highlighted in curriculum when grounded in the Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (AFNR) Career Cluster Content Standards. Furthermore, STEM technical content and employability skills are embedded in Supervised Agricultural Experience programs and National FFA Career Development Events. Using the findings as a guide, a conceptual model of STEM-AFNR is suggested along with recommendations for practice and future research.

AB  - The purpose of this action research study was to develop a rubric that identified levels of integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) lessons through agriculture, food, and natural resources (AFNR) lessons that were developed and implemented in afterschool programs by preservice informal educators. The research study expanded on the knowledge base by identifying three levels and six features of integrated STEM through the context of AFNR. Using the rubric, we analyzed 10 mini-units, consisting of 27 lesson plans, of STEM integrated AFNR lesson plans that were developed by preservice informal educators. There were three major findings. First, teaching AFNR content and skills was the main focus of integrated STEM lesson plans. Second, the lesson plans attempted to use real-world problems to connect students' learning to use content knowledge and skills to solve the problem, yet failed to connect other disciplines. Finally, students who had previous teaching experiences in non-formal and informal settings achieved the highest scores, but students who were in formal teacher preparation programs had the lowest scores in terms of developing integrated STEM through AFNR lesson plans.

AB  - Patterns of Change: Forces and Motion is an integrated science lesson that uses the 5E lesson cycle to tie together science with language arts, mathematics, literature, technology, engineering and social studies in an engaging format applicable for young learners. This lesson has been uniquely designed for the purpose of providing elementary teachers with ideas for using hands-on minds-on activities to foster inquiry and discussion, while engaging their students to use technology as a learning tool. This lesson has been used on the elementary level to teach students about the forces that have an effect on motion.

AB  - Fall 2020 presented myriad challenges for teachers trying to plan curricula to meet students' social-emotional and learning needs following an unprecedented spring and summer of isolation and loss due to the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Rivera and Wallace 2020). The result of creative planning and adjusting of curricula for remote instruction led to a new component of thinking about differentiation: Beyond differentiating to students in the classroom, teachers were and continue to differentiate to students in different learning environments. The unit presented in this article is an example of how the authors reimagined their Earth and Space Science class for ninth- and tenth-grade students for remote instruction that included strong data analysis and critical-thinking components. As written, the unit emphasizes building a strong classroom community online, creates opportunities for students to follow their own curiosity, and teaches transferable skills--specifically argumentative writing skills--that will support students' success across subject areas.

AB  - Internationalisation of the curriculum (IoC) as an important element of internationalisation has seen many challenges. The literature shows that successful IoC cases are rare. Drawing on the concepts of powerful knowledge and 'knowing', we argue that a more comprehensive understanding of knowledge engagement in the IoC process is needed. Currently, engaging knowledge appears to be a barrier to IoC, particularly in hard disciplines such as science and engineering. This study investigated how faculty members from different disciplines engaged knowledge in their approaches to IoC through semi-structured interviews with 34 faculty members based in three Hong Kong universities. The findings show that engaging knowledge is indispensable to IoC because it provides theoretical foundations for 'being' and substantiates discussions on global issues using disciplinary lenses. Furthermore, faculty members from all disciplines show productive ways of engaging knowledge, whilst the differences lie in the expected role of 'knower' and the relationship between 'knowing' and 'being'. Specifically, facilitating an intimate relationship between 'knowing' and 'being' through students' own dispositions was featured in soft disciplines, whilst taking perspectives based on scientific principles was identified in hard disciplines.

AB  - Interprofessional education (IPE) and entrustable professional activities (EPAs) represent two topics in health professions education that have attracted significant attention in recent years. IPE (when different health professionals learn with, from and about each other with the aim of optimal care) has an inherent focus on the collective. EPAs (units of professional practice that can be fully entrusted to a trainee, once he or she has demonstrated the necessary competence to execute this activity unsupervised) have a focus on the individual. Attempts to relate the two may cause friction and the question is: can they be reconciled? Are interprofessional EPAs or team-EPAs useful concepts and if so what should they look like? The authors argue that most work in modern healthcare involves interprofessional collaboration. Some EPAs have an inherent strong interprofessional nature, such as emergency teamwork, running multidisciplinary team meetings, and surgery. Other EPAs are less inherently dependent on interprofessional collaboration. The authors conclude that neither interprofessional team-EPAs (for which a team can or should be certified), nor IP-EPAs for individuals, as opposed to other EPAs, are viable concepts. However, the authors do not question that certifying health care professionals and entrusting trainees with most clinical tasks will require to ascertain their competence in interprofessional collaboration. This must be included when assessing learners for most EPAs and making entrustment decisions. This can help to strengthen interprofessional competence in the clinical workplace.

AB  - The Next Generation Science Standards call for the integration of science and engineering. Often, the introduction of engineering activities occurs after instruction in the science content. That is, engineering is used as a way for students to elaborate on science ideas that have already been explored. However, using only this sequence of instruction communicates a limited view of the relationship between science and engineering. In this article, we focus on the process of reverse engineering, and we provide a model 5E lesson in which we flip the typical science-to-engineering sequence and, instead, use principles of engineering design as a springboard from which to develop scientific concepts. Specifically, students use principles of engineering to deconstruct already engineered devices (i.e., different types of coffeemakers) in an effort to propose scientific explanations (i.e., factors affecting solubility) for the design features. These proposed explanations are then tested by isolating individual variables (e.g., solute size, temperature of solution) and testing the results. Students are provided whole coffee beans, grinders, water of different temperatures, timers, and apparatus for brewing samples of coffee and then test the effects of changing the variables by tasting, observing, or quantifying results of the individual samples.

AB  - A random sample of language arts, social studies, and science middle school teachers from the United States were surveyed about their preparation to teach writing, beliefs about responsibilities for teaching writing, use of evidence-based writing practices, assessment of writing, use of technology, and adaptations for struggling writers. The findings from this survey raised concerns about the quality of middle school writing instruction. Many teachers believed their preservice and inservice preparation to teach writing was inadequate. Middle school students spend little time writing or being taught how to write. While most teachers used a variety of evidenced-based writing practices and made adaptations for struggling writers, such methods were applied infrequently. Most teachers did not appear to use assessment data to shape how they taught writing, and computers played a relatively minor role in middle school writing instruction. Even though teachers generally agreed that writing was a collective responsibility, language arts teachers placed a greater emphasis on writing instruction than social studies and science teachers.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze bullying behaviors from an interdisciplinary perspective: legal, psychological and pedagogical. From a legal point of view, the Romanian legislative framework on respect for children's rights has undergone a number of changes in recent years with the accession of Romania to the European Union in 2007. International legislation on respect for children's rights requires countries that have ratified these provisions to ensure that they are respected and to take measures to ensure that they are not prejudiced. Aggressiveness in students is a predictor of antisocial behaviors in adolescence and adulthood. The psychological perspective of bullying refers to the consequences of this type of behavior. Students involved in aggression are at increased risk of developing a range of psychosomatic symptoms, involvement in delinquency, alcohol and drug abuse, absenteeism. The consequences of these behaviors on the victims are associated with anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. Through the pedagogical approach to bullying, we focus on the role of teachers in addressing the issue of aggressive behavior in students. The perceived gravity and teacher's response to bullies and victims of bullying are important indicators to be taken into account in making a successful intervention.

AB  - Thinking, Doing, Talking Science (TDTS) is a programme that aims to make science lessons in primary schools more practical, creative and challenging. Teachers are trained in a repertoire of strategies that aim to encourage pupils to use higher order thinking skills. For example, pupils are posed 'Big Questions,' such as 'How do you know that the earth is a sphere?' that are used to stimulate discussion about scientific topics and the principles of scientific enquiry. Two teachers from each participating school received five days of professional development training delivered by a team from Science Oxford and Oxford Brookes University. The training did not aim to provide participating teachers with a set of 'off-the-shelf' lesson plans to be delivered in schools; rather, it sought to support teachers to be more creative and thoughtful in planning their science lessons. In addition, teachers had dedicated time to work with colleagues to plan and review lessons taught as part of the project. Teachers were also encouraged to link pupils' learning in science, with their learning in numeracy and literacy. This project sought to assess the impact of the programme on the academic outcomes and attitudes towards science of Year 5 pupils. 655 pupils from 21 schools across England completed the project. Participating schools followed the programme for the entirety of the 2013/14 academic year. A further 20 schools formed a randomised comparison group and did not receive training in the approach until the following year. Key conclusions include: (1) Thinking, Doing, Talking Science appeared to have a positive impact on the attainment of pupils in science. Overall, Year 5 pupils in schools using the approach made approximately three additional months' progress; (2) There are some indications that the approach had a particularly positive effect on pupils eligible for free school meals, but further research is needed to explore this; (3) The programme had a particularly positive effect on girls and on pupils with low prior attainment; (4) The approach had a positive impact on pupils' attitudes to science, science lessons, and practical work in particular; and (5) National test data will be used to assess the English and mathematics outcomes of participating pupils and to measure the long-term impact of the approach. In addition, further research could be conducted to investigate whether this result can be replicated in a larger number of schools.

AB  - The current discussion among adolescent literacy researchers describes two positions at either end of a continuum: a generalist content area reading approach and a disciplinary literacy approach. Within the field, there are misunderstandings about the disciplinary literacy approach and claims that adolescents are ill suited to the kinds of thinking advocated by disciplinary literacy scholars. This article explores disciplinary literacy through the lens of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and argues that requirements for discipline-appropriate literacy abilities are already embedded in national standards for English language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies. We explore the practices and cross-cutting concepts described in the NGSS and provide examples of discipline-appropriate thinking associated with selected practices and concepts.

AB  - "Internationalisation" has become the new buzzword for universities around the world, with jointly offered degrees as well as smaller-scale exchanges for students. Despite this rapid expansion of international campuses and programmes, and the increasing acceptance and encouragement of international experiences for [post]graduate students, little comprehensive evaluative work has been done to assess their efficacy on a broad scale and to determine what types and models of international work can be most effective. The lack of reliable and comprehensive data is especially problematic for science and engineering fields, where academic staff anxieties about forming students into competent scientists often collide with enthusiasm for encouraging international collaborations. Questions of exactly what makes a competent, or excellent, scientist, and what may benefit the scientific domain, do not have easy--or agreed-upon--answers. This article assesses the current state of internationalisation and international experiences, focusing in particular on science and engineering fields. It discusses initial results from a workshop, sponsored by the US National Science Foundation and organised by the Center for Innovation and Research in Graduate Education at the University of Washington, to develop an interdisciplinary research agenda aimed at launching and coordinating empirically driven research on international graduate education. It concludes by identifying areas for future research. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Traditional houses are part of the culture of every country. Indonesia is a country that has a variety of traditional houses. The traditional Banyuwangi house is known as the "Using" house. This house can be explored in terms of ethnomathematics and used as part of learning mathematics. This research is focused on knowing and describing mathematics learning that integrates the ethnomathematics of "Using" house, thematic, and connected models. The research was also conducted to determine the effectiveness of the learning that has been carried out. The results showed that the use of the "Using" house in ethnomathematical-thematic-connected-based mathematics learning: (1) could be done using the trivium concept (literacy, matheracy, and technoracy); (2) can be done thematically by integrating four subjects (Indonesian, social sciences, fine arts, and mathematics); (3) can be connected by integrating two mathematical concepts (two-dimensional geometry and arithmetic); (4) through seven phases of learning; and (5) effective because 80% of students can solve problems as expected.

AB  - Those who work in all sectors of higher education--from community and liberal arts colleges to undergraduate programs in public and research universities--often assert that a "liberal education" is precisely the kind of undergraduate education that is needed for both living and working in the challenging 21st-century world. "Liberal education" or "liberal learning," as used in this essay, is consonant with the Association of American Colleges and Universities' (AAC&U's) notion of the "practical liberal arts": well-rounded and integrated learning in the arts, humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and professional studies that can be applied to contemporary problems. In this essay the author argues that innovative and integrated student learning and flexible and interdisciplinary institutional structures and curricula must emerge if educators are to deliver on the promises of a liberal education that can help their graduates address the "black swans" in this age of the unthinkable. "Black swans" is the metaphor used by Nassim Nicholas Taleb for unpredictable events. (Contains 15 resources.)

AB  - This study used robot-based practices to develop an activity that incorporated the 6E model. The sixth-grade students learned interdisciplinary knowledge about how to use Arduino electronic components, microcontrollers, and hands-on tools to make a "Crab Robot." In addition, the students learned how to use Scratch programming language to control the robot and complete the "Crab Robot Crossing the Road" task. The study implemented a quasi-experimental design to examine whether the students who learned the robot-based activity using the 6E model acquired better learning motivation, learning performance, computational thinking ability, and hands-on ability than those who learned the activity through lectures. This study adopted purposive sampling to select 70 sixth-grade students from four classes, which were divided into the experimental group (6E model) and the control group (lectures). The experiment was conducted over a period of 18 weeks (for a total duration of 1,440 minutes). The results from the pretests-posttests showed that both groups of students improved their learning motivation, learning performance, computational thinking ability, and hands-on ability; however, the experimental group's scores were significantly better. More importantly, this study provides a pedagogy manuscript for instructors who want to teach mechatronics programs and programming design education.

AB  - To understand both immediate and longer-term effects of a short duration, interpretive wildlife tourism program, we studied responses from participants in a sea turtle watch program. This program comprised an interpretive presentation followed by an opportunity to view a nesting loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta). We conducted 37 programs in 2013 and 2014, for 843 participants, of whom 70.5% were able to see a nesting turtle. We measured participant attitudes, knowledge, intention to act, and long-term behavior change. Initial participant responses indicated prior interest in nature and environmental topics, and a knowledge base focused on biological sea turtle information. After the interpretive presentation, participants chose to provide conservation-related information as opposed to natural history-related information. Intention to engage in conservation behaviors was high following the turtle watch experience, regardless of whether a turtle was seen. The conservation value of our turtle watch program is expressed through conservation-focused knowledge acquisition by participants and their high post-program intention to engage in behaviors benefiting sea turtles, both of which precede long-term behavior change in an interdisciplinary model of behavior change.

AB  - In demanding innovation areas such as eHealth, the primary emphasis is easily placed on the product and process quality aspects in the design phase. Customer quality may receive adequate attention when the target audience is well-defined. But if the multidimensional evaluative focus does not get enough space until the implementation phase, this means a delay. The study examines how the adoption and diffusion processes of educational eHealth innovations could be enhanced from the viewpoint of design. Explorative, critical analysis of the multidisciplinary literature with a pragmatic approach serves this aim. The prerequisites identified in general adoption models and theories refer to several quality aspects. When designers understand the meaning of versatile quality framing in the early design phase, this may ease the adoption processes of eHealth. Questioning that focuses on the quality of eHealth innovations rather than on adaptation problems is more fruitful from the viewpoint of design. In demanding development areas, the maturation processes of products may be laborious, and therefore, rapid diffusion processes are not always possible and not even useful if these occur at the expense of quality.

AB  - Grand challenges stress the importance of multi-disciplinary research, a multi-actor approach in examining the current state of affairs and exploring possible solutions, multi-level governance and policy coordination across geographical boundaries and policy areas, and a policy environment for enabling change both in science and technology and in society. The special nature of grand challenges poses certain needs in evaluation practice: (a) the need for learning at the operational, policy and, especially, system level; and (b) the importance of a wider set of impacts and behavioural change. The examination of the usefulness of evaluations as learning tools thus becomes relevant as does the way current evaluation practices address broader impacts and issues such as behavioural additionality. The suitability of existing evaluation contexts in meeting the specific issues posed by the "grand challenges" orientation is also worth examining. The paper argues that learning at the policy and system levels is largely unaddressed while concepts such as behavioural additionality are still underexploited.
