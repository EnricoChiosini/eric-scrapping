AB  - This study looked at titles of research papers on educational technology that were published between 1927 and 2023 using computational text analysis. To map research trends, metrics for technology terminology use, network complexity, and knowledge updating rates were used. The findings showed that, despite some fluctuations, titles have become more technologically diverse and interconnected over time, indicating a greater emphasis on technology and interdisciplinarity. Escalating title complexity was visualized using network analysis. Citation patterns revealed that science/engineering and educational technology both update knowledge at comparable rates. This computational analysis shows how the fields of education and technology have been evolving together over time, giving historical context to understand current trends. The study shows how to use data science techniques to map the dynamics of research within a practical domain that connects technology and practice.

AB  - E-learning modules were developed to enhance student engagement, reflection and interdisciplinary learning in Pathology courses undertaken by students from the Biomedical Science, Allied Health, and Complementary Medicine disciplines. The modules focused on generating multi-disciplinary and team-based solutions to diagnosis, prognosis and treatment/management of patients. At pre- and post-intervention, we analysed the students' experience of three themes: E-learning, reflection, and interdisciplinary learning. Flexibility and ability to reinforce understanding of course content were identified as main advantages of e-learning but a lack of direct support was a common concern. Visual aids and interactive assessments were suggested to improve online experiences. While all students had a positive pre-conception of all themes prior to intervention, the delivery of the modules significantly improved students' perception on how e-learning deepened their understanding of course materials via reflection and interdisciplinary learning, with both aspects serving to create a holistic learning experience.

AB  - The aim of this article is to prove the advisability of using the interdisciplinary approach for the formation of learners' situational interest in physics. The general method of using the interdisciplinary approach in physics teaching has been created. The study of new material, the formation of abilities and skills, and the work on projects are the forms of the interdisciplinary links in physics teaching. The scheme for interest formation towards physics in the context of development of situational and individual interest has been analyzed. According to the interdisciplinary approach, the tools for the formation of learners' situational interest in physics have been allocated. These are phenomena of nature, phenomena of everyday life, link between theory and practice. The results showed that interdisciplinary approach in physics teaching increases the level of learners' situational interest. Proposed general method of using the interdisciplinary approach can be used for teaching other sciences.

AB  - Mind, Brain, and Education (MBE) science is by definition transdisciplinary. However, the communication and collaboration between constituent disciplines needed for true transdisciplinarity remains relatively rare. Consequently, many of the potential benefits of MBE science remain unrealized for parties on all sides of the discipline. The present commentary first conducts an analysis of the current strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of transdisciplinary partnerships in MBE. A new, free, and international web platform ("UNIFIED") is then proposed to broker relationships between researchers and teachers within schools. This website would allow users to form collaborations based on a system of tags indexing their research interests as well as practicalities such as their location. Such a website appears well placed to realize many of the opportunities, and mitigate the threats and weaknesses, of transdisciplinary MBE research. The article concludes with an appeal to interested researchers and schools to contribute to the development of the project.

AB  - The mass shift to Open-Book, Open-Web (OBOW) assessments during the pandemic highlighted new opportunities in Higher Education for developing accessible, authentic assessments that can reduce administrative load. Despite a plethora of research emerging on the effectiveness of OBOW assessments within disciplines, few currently evaluate their effectiveness across disciplines where the assessment instrument can vary significantly. This paper aims to evaluate the experience students across STEM subjects had of OBOW exams to contribute to an evidence-base for emerging post-pandemic assessment policies and strategies. In April 2021, following two cycles of OBOW exams, we surveyed STEM students across a range of subjects to determine their preparation strategy, experiences during the exam, perception of development of higher order cognitive skills, test anxiety, and how they thought these assessments might enhance employability. Overall, students from subjects that use assessment instruments requiring analytical, quantitative-based answers (Maths, Physics, Computer Science and Chemistry) adapted their existing study skills less effectively, felt less prepared and experienced higher levels of stress compared to students of subjects using more qualitative discursive based answers (Biosciences and Geography). We conclude with recommendations on how to enhance the use of OBOW exams: these include supporting and developing more effective study skills, ensuring assessments align with intended learning outcomes, addressing the issue of academic integrity, promoting inclusivity, and encouraging authentic assessment. Based on the outcomes of this study, we strongly advise that assessment policies that foster the whole-scale roll-out of OBOW assessment consider the inter-disciplinary impacts on learner development, staff training and workload resources.

AB  - This study designs and implements interdisciplinary STEM instruction by adopting modelling-based physics programming, and explores its effectiveness on learning. A quasi-experimental study was conducted. The experimental group wrote programs to solve physics problems by following the modelling process, while the control group solved general problems without specific guidance. The findings show that the STEM group performed better on both programming and physics achievements, and had higher self-efficacy on modelling. The STEM group benefited from the modelling-based instruction and could formulate the problems to a more effective representation for problem solving (abstraction), and also could transfer the solution to more accurate code (coding), both of which contributed to programming ability. Through the modelling process for physics simulation, physics programming also improved students' understanding of difficult physics concepts.

AB  - On graduation, teacher candidates (TCs) are typically underprepared to teach science, particularly physical science, whereas physics graduates frequently lack training in teaching or effective communication. In response, we created two models for interdisciplinary peer learning where TCs were paired with either graduate or undergraduate physics students. In both models, physics students teach TCs content knowledge relevant to a given area of either classical or quantum physics, which TCs then use to design and implement a short lesson for K-5 students. Overall, both models were successful, with the two sets of students reporting benefits in each case. Affordances for TCs included increased confidence to teach physical science and an appreciation for collaboration with experts. Physics students described increased awareness of the complexities of communicating science to general audiences and stronger community with their classmates. Students from both groups cited insufficient project time as a constraint, whereas physics students found it challenging to align their project and coursework. In moving away from traditional lecture, these interdisciplinary collaborations also benefitted us as instructors, giving us new perspectives on teaching. In light of our findings we propose improvements to these proof-of-concept models to enable their future scale-up and replication in other disciplines.

AB  - The teaching of reproduction, gender and sexuality at tertiary level is often compartmentalised, separating biological components from the political, socio-cultural, psychological and ethical perspectives that influence how knowledge is understood and utilised. In parallel, educators often have specialised knowledge and can struggle to address the broader questions outside their area of expertise. This is particularly true in an era of changing constructs and terminology related to gender and sexual diversity, and strong views as to which terminology is appropriate. Recognising this need, we organised a local symposium drawing together educators (lecturers, teaching-fellows, demonstrators) from across our university campus to discuss the range and nature of courses in medicine, sciences and the social sciences taught at our institution. Here, we outline the rationale, process and the key themes discussed, which included changing models of sex and gender, associated terminology changes and the importance of appropriate framing and incorporation of indigenous (Maori) perspectives. An interdisciplinary approach is essential to integrate theories engaging with the non-binary nature of sex and gender with the largely binary process of reproduction. This cultural shift requires educationalists to counter biased opinions and misinformation with accurate and diverse content to ensure teaching is accurate and up-to-date.

AB  - Short metacognitive prompts--like "minute papers"--are simple enough to be widely adopted by instructors. But do they work? We investigate how they affect college students' performance in quantitative (Physics) and qualitative (Psychology) courses, comparing classes which received metacognitive prompts to those that did not. We find significant improvement in performance in Psychology and borderline significant improvement in Physics. While the interventions did not raise students' confidence, interviews with students revealed that the prompts helped them process course material and study for exams. This is one of few studies to directly compare the effectiveness of metacognitive prompts across disciplines.

AB  - As a high school AP Physics 1 and 2 teacher, Sean Crumley wanted to create a curricular unit that would authentically connect literacy, opportunities for writing, and science standards while engaging a 21st-century student. This article provides an example of how Crumley incorporated writing into one of his AP physics units, and it could serve as a useful model for teachers in any high school science course. Writing and literacy standards can very effectively connect to science content and develop increased student achievement in both areas. Using online remote learning tools to engage students, Crumley developed a unit covering the law of conservation of momentum that also incorporated instruction on the use of argumentative and creative writing as an alternative means to demonstrate mastery of science content. When he implemented this unit in his AP Physics course, he found that students enjoyed the experience--effectively communicating their knowledge of the law of conservation of momentum through a variety of writing styles--and showed similar learning outcomes as in previous years using a more traditional end-of-unit assessment.

AB  - "Cannabis sativa" is a species of plant with a rich, yet controversial history. Although the utility of cannabis has been documented for thousands of years; during the last century, research has led to a more advanced understanding of its mechanism of action and therapeutic potential. Accordingly, there has been an explosion of interest and attention; particularly from researchers, investors, academics, and those in the medical field. The relevance of cannabis spans many educational disciplines; sociology, economics, pharmacology, biology, and especially chemistry. There was a need in the undergraduate science curricula to include and reflect this revolution in cannabis' perception and application by providing a knowledge base to students. Therefore, in an effort to contextualize cannabis' inextricable connection to chemistry, the interdisciplinary undergraduate course "Chemistry of Cannabis" was developed and implemented. The goal was to increase student awareness, enhance the scope of their general education, and present a scientific foundation for potential further study. Due to the 2020 pandemic-related school closures, the second half of the course was presented online. The successful transition from in-person to remote learning illustrates the versatility of the course content and structure. Assessment of student feedback revealed that the course was well received and that students finished the semester with a greater interest and appreciation for both chemistry and cannabis. This article presents the design and delivery for the course "Chemistry of Cannabis."

AB  - Scientific problems of the twenty-first century involve complex research questions that require an interdisciplinary approach. Educational research suggests that overall student achievement is greater in an interdisciplinary science curriculum than in a discipline-specific science curriculum. Regardless, the secondary school science curriculum in Ontario remains discipline-specific. The Ontario Ministry of Education (OME) released an 'Interdisciplinary Studies' curriculum in 2002; however, it appears to be sparsely implemented across Ontario. The objective of this study is to investigate what guidelines are provided by the OME to help Ontario secondary school science teachers (grades 11-12) design and implement interdisciplinary science courses. A document analysis methodology is used to gather data from selected OME curriculum documents. The results of this study found that interdisciplinary science courses are based on multiple models of interdisciplinarity; however, the guidelines provided for developing interdisciplinary curriculum, assessment, and teaching methods do not explicitly indicate which type of interdisciplinary model is applied, nor do the documents explicitly consider the degree of integration of concepts and skills from across disciplines/subject areas. Primarily, the results of this study may inform Ontario Ministry science curriculum writers, teachers and educators interested in interdisciplinary science curriculum elsewhere, about what aspects of the selected curriculum documents provide practical information for developing interdisciplinary science courses and components of the curriculum that may warrant potential revisions or additions during future curriculum drafting.

AB  - Studying biology entails negotiating knowledges, identities, and what paths, more or less well-trodden, to follow. Knowledges, identities, and paths within the very practices of science are fundamentally gendered and it is, therefore, critical to recognize when exploring students' learning and participation in natural sciences. Even though students' numbers in undergraduate Higher Education Biology are female-biased, it does not mean that gendered processes are absent. In this study, we focus on early undergraduate biology students' identity work at a Swedish university, analyzing 55 study motivation texts discursively. Embedded in a Figured Worlds framework, we explore how students imagined and authored themselves in(to) the Figured World of Higher Education Biology along two imagined identity trajectories, the Straight Biology Path and the Backpacking Biology Path. While the first and numerically dominant imagined trajectory entails typical stories of a scientific child striving toward a research career, the latter recognizes broad interests and biology competences to be collected in a backpack for transdisciplinary use. Students imagining the Backpacking Biology Path authored themselves in relation to and explicitly not as having a linear trajectory, which positions the Straight Biology Path as dominant and culturally recognized. Our findings reveal gendered myths about science practices present in Higher Education Biology, yet also contested through alternative imaginaries. We, thereby, show that it is crucial for Higher Biology and Science Education to be aware of how students imagine their trajectories and how they negotiate masculine norms of science to create spaces for diverse and alternative identity trajectories.

AB  - Increasingly pervasive digital technologies in societies are placing complex demands on the development of young people's digital citizenship and digital competence. Social science education and teacher education (TE) play important, but poorly understood, roles in this development. Through reflexive thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews, this paper explores 15 Swedish teacher educators' (TEDs) views of teaching for digital citizenship, particularly social science TE's role. We also consider organisational and personal conditions that may influence TEDs' views of professional digital competence (PDC) for such teaching. Their views are examined through a postdigital lens, with a focus on democratic implications in evolving socio-technical environments. The results indicate that TEDs acknowledge the importance of social science TE in teaching for digital citizenship, but find maintaining responsiveness to societal changes challenging. Challenges are also posed by the multidisciplinary character of social science education, including how personal trajectories shape TEDs' views of their dual-didactic task of teaching to teach for digital citizenship. This paper contributes knowledge of how TEDs, as 'street-level bureaucrats' in social science TE, navigate between written and performed education policy in teaching for digital citizenship, with specific attention to the dynamic character of PDC in social science education.

AB  - Professional societies and institutes have stressed the importance of a dialogue between scientists and the public over the past decades. Especially the life sciences include many highly relevant research topics pertaining not only to scientific progress but also to decision-making in society. Surprisingly, few educational researchers and biological scientists make interdisciplinary efforts to communicate life science topics to society in an adequate manner. In our project, scientists from evolutionary biology, medicine and biology education worked in an interdisciplinary manner to design an educational program to make scientific research on antibiotic resistance and cystic fibrosis accessible to students (ninth, tenth and eleventh graders). In this article, we explain the communication objectives from the science education researcher's and the life scientist's perspectives. We provide a systematic description of the co-design process, a step-by-step procedure and the link to the open-source-materials used in the course. We conclude with a reflection about the implementation in consideration of the two perspectives. In sum, our results highlight that the co-design approach provides an effective method of communicating current biomedical research to school students. Our description of the co-design-process can help future applications of this co-design approach when designing science outreach activities.

AB  - This paper draws attention to basic philosophical perspectives which are of theoretical and methodological interest for science education, general education and curriculum research. It focuses on potential contributions philosophy class can offer if philosophy education opens up for science and for a collaboration of teachers in the context of post-compulsory education. A central educational goal is to connect basic philosophical skills with any curricular intellectual practice. This implies the possibility of crossing disciplinary boundaries. Hence, the present paper questions the disciplinary rigidity of education and aims at bridging the artificial gap between teaching philosophy and teaching science in order to enrich the individual school subjects involved. Towards this end, this article sketches out a conceptual framework for the issue of interdisciplinarity with regard to philosophy and science in upper secondary school. This framework takes into account aspects of the nature of science (NOS), history and philosophy of science (HPS) and the critical thinking approach which have significant implications for teaching. It aims to facilitate a basic understanding of the significant positive impact philosophy could have on improving scientific literacy as well as decision-making in general. I set forth methods of cross-curricular teaching which can promote innovation in education as interdisciplinarity already does in research since there is growing appreciation of collaboration and partnership between philosophy and science.

AB  - Novel biomaterial development is a rapidly growing field that is crucial because biomaterial fouling, due to rapid and irreversible protein adsorption, leads to cellular responses and potentially detrimental consequences such as surface thrombosis, biofilm formation, or inflammation. Therefore, biomaterial technology's fundamentals, like material biocompatibility, are critical in undergraduate education. Exposing undergraduate students to biomaterials and biomedical engineering through interdisciplinary experiments allows them to integrate knowledge from different fields to analyze multidisciplinary results. In this practical laboratory experiment, undergraduate students will characterize surface properties (contact and sliding angle measurements) for the antifouling polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer using a goniometer and a smartphone, as well as quantify protein adsorption on antifouling surfaces via a colorimetric assay kit to develop their understanding of antifouling surface characteristics, UV-vis spectroscopy, and colorimetric assays. The antifouling PDMS polymer is prepared by silicone oil infusion and compared to untreated control PDMS. The polymer hydrophobicity was demonstrated by static water contact angles of ~99° and 102° for control and antifouling PDMS surfaces, respectively. The control PDMS sliding angle (>90°) was significantly reduced to 9° after antifouling preparation. After 24 h incubation of polymer samples in a 200 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution, the surface adsorbed BSA was quantified using a colorimetric assay. The adsorbed protein on the fouling PDMS controls (29.1 ± 7.0 [microgram]/cm[superscript 2]) was reduced by ~79% on the antifouling PDMS surface (6.2 ± 0.9 [microgram]/cm[superscript 2]). Students will gain experience in materials science, biomedical engineering, chemistry, and biology concepts and better understand the influence of material properties on biological responses for biomaterial interfaces.

AB  - University courses are often interconnected; however, the connections between these courses remain unclear to many students. This is particularly important in the field of forensic science since each stage of the investigation, from the crime scene to the courtroom, has significant implications on the outcome of a case and the individuals involved. Cross-course collaboration is a pedagogical approach whereby students from different courses collaborate to achieve a common goal. This pedagogical approach has been demonstrated to be effective in individual disciplines, but not in transdisciplinary fields, such as forensic science. Cross-course collaboration is constructed in a manner that mirrors a real-world investigation, making it an ideal setup for undergraduate forensic science programs. In this study, two distinct courses, forensic chemistry and forensic identification, collaborated on a mock case in order to advance an investigation. Pre- and post-course surveys and students' critical reflective assignments were used to quantitatively and qualitatively gauge students' perception of the collaborative modules. This study examines students' perception of how cross-course collaboration experience contributed to their learning and skill-building. More specifically, the potential benefits of cross-course collaboration were categorized under academic, social, and psychological benefits. The outcome of this exploratory project provided insight on the potential benefits of the cross-course collaborative modules to promote effective learning.

AB  - Mathematics plays a crucial role in physics. This role is brought about predominantly through the building, employment, and assessment of mathematical models, and teachers and educators should capture this relationship in the classroom in an effort to improve students' achievement and attitude in both physics and mathematics. But although there are overwhelming amounts of literature on modeling in science and mathematics education, the interdisciplinary position is seldom addressed explicitly. Furthermore, there has been a striking lack of exposure of the question of how future teachers, who are largely educated in a mono-disciplinary fashion, can best become equipped to introduce genuinely interdisciplinary teaching activities to their future pupils. This paper presents some preliminary reflections upon a graduate course, which aims to prepare future physics and mathematics teachers for interdisciplinary teaching, and which has been designed on the basis of influential theoretical expositions of the concept of interdisciplinarity.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to contribute to the exploration of inter-disciplinary approaches in higher education for sustainability. It is a reflection on a case study linking students in the arts and sustainability science, through which the inter-disciplinary and problem-solving processes for solving a concrete sustainability challenge were explored. Design/methodology/approach: The case study featured a workshop with students from two educational programmes at Aalborg University, namely, Art and Technology and Environmental Management and Sustainability Science, the latter being an engineering programme and the former part of the humanities. Experience evaluation was based on participant observation, written feedback and the workshop facilitators' post-event reflections. Data analysis was based on multi-grounded theory, dialectically combining empirical data (through open coding) with relevant emergence theories. Notions of emergence were chosen because the supposed benefit of inter-disciplinarity is the emergence of novel solutions to complex problems. The study investigates the concrete conditions of emergence in educational inter-disciplinary settings. Findings: The workshop led to a successful experience, bringing an art-based approach together with sustainability science for arriving at solutions that neither of the two would have arrived at separately. Based on participant experiences and realisations, five "emergence concepts" are suggested as supportive learning criteria and conditions, namely, "knowledge expansion", "complementarity", "disciplinary self-reflection", "change of practice" and "play". Originality/value: The findings and emergence concepts can be an inspiration for creating an effective learning environment supporting the emergence of different forms of knowledge and solution concepts for solving sustainability challenges.

In particular, I examine the way in which some of the local specificities of a Canadian journal relate to more global issues of educational research; I consider the relation between mathematics, science and technology as reflected in the published articles; and, I look at how different paradigms of research have been represented over time, particularly in relation to the mathematics education articles.

AB  - Nowadays there is a concern to improve the quality of education by including an interdisciplinary approach of concepts and their integration in the curriculum of scientific disciplines. The development of microbial fuel cells as a potential alternative for production of renewable energies gives undergraduate students the challenge of integrating interdisciplinary concepts in a hot topic of global interest as alternative energies. We present a laboratory experiment that has been part of a third-year undergraduate course in biology where students gained experience in assembling microbial fuel cells and the understanding of how they work. In this process, the students could integrate biological, biochemical, and electric concepts. In addition, the acquisition of manual skills and experimental design decisions are important for the development of future professionals.

AB  - In the context of global educational reform, science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education, as an interdisciplinary educational model, has become increasingly central to foundational pedagogical reforms. However, research on the impact and development of STEM teachers' interdisciplinary teaching abilities is relatively limited. This meta-analysis explored STEM education's impact on elementary and secondary school teachers' interdisciplinary teaching abilities. The review encompassed 21 empirical studies published between 2010 and 2023 and aimed to quantify the effect size of STEM interventions on teachers' interdisciplinary abilities. A moderately positive correlation (r = 0.452) was found between STEM education and teachers' interdisciplinary teaching abilities. The role of potential moderating variables, including demographic traits, gender, academic qualifications, subject specialization, pedagogical tenure, and prior exposure to interdisciplinary learning, was scrutinized. The findings highlighted a substantial improvement in teachers' interdisciplinary teaching abilities through STEM education, emphasizing the critical role of knowledge integration. STEM programs significantly aided educators in bridging and amalgamating diverse disciplinary insights. Variations in the efficacy of STEM education across different educational tiers, subject domains, levels of teaching seniority, and interdisciplinary familiarity were identified, indicating that the benefits of STEM training were contingent upon individual teacher profiles. Notably, gender disparities in the enhancement of interdisciplinary teaching abilities through STEM education were not observed. Despite the methodological diversity of the included studies, which encompassed various research paradigms, sampling strategies, and evaluation instruments, the integration of findings across these diverse methodologies added intricacy to the interpretation of the meta-analytic results. The study's potential limitations, such as the risk of sample selection bias and the use of potentially imprecise assessment tools, were acknowledged as possibly having influenced the meta-analytic outcomes. The findings had two implications. First, they provided a roadmap for the strategic design and execution of STEM initiatives aimed at fostering excellence in interdisciplinary teaching. Second, they highlighted the imperative for tailored approaches to the development of STEM teachers, which recognize the heterogeneous needs and potential based on their unique professional and experiential backgrounds.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity has been touted as a means to recruit more racially and gender-diverse students to computing. In this explanatory sequential mixed-methods study, we investigated demographic characteristics among a sample of undergraduate students pursuing interdisciplinary computing major and minor combinations at 15 institutions in the United States who completed a survey at the end of their introductory course. Descriptive analyses of responses to this survey of introductory computing students revealed that enrollment in interdisciplinary major and minor combinations was limited and did not appear to disproportionately attract women or Black/African American, Latine, Indigenous, and/or Multiracial students. We then conducted a directed content analysis of departmental websites to examine the language and policies that may have precluded or encouraged students to pursue interdisciplinary computing major and minor combinations. Findings revealed that departmental offerings of such programs were limited, and, among those that did offer such programs, communication about their goals and requirements was often lacking. Implications for research and practice, especially as they pertain to efforts to broaden participation in computing, are discussed.

AB  - This study explored the teacher knowledge manifestation of Integrated Science (IS) teachers who have specialised in Chemistry, Biology or Physics during their pre-service teacher education. 60 experienced Integrated Science teachers responded to an 'Integrated Science Teacher Knowledge' questionnaire which embraced different dimensions of teacher knowledge. The results of the study indicate that the IS teachers have a common set of knowledge, skills, and dispositions that are, in their professional opinion, needed and in some instances, would enable them to teach IS. The research participants had considerable knowledge as well as clear views about what it meant for them to be IS teachers. It however should be noted that there was a marked variance in the perception of the three cohorts of teachers towards teaching through Practical Work, importance of pre-service teacher education specialisation towards teaching IS and knowledge of students' culture. This study provides contextual inputs to effective IS teacher education re-alignment informed by the IS teacher practitioners, those with the craft knowledge of the contextual environment of the IS classrooms.

AB  - This paper reflects upon the development of a multidisciplinary lesson plan aimed at developing science skills for Physics and Astronomy, Geographical and Earth Sciences, and Chemistry students at a research intensive Scottish university. The lesson plan was co-developed with a small group of staff and undergraduate students from these disciplinary areas. The authors discuss the rationale and process for developing the course, drawing upon literature relating to students and staff co-creating curricula in higher education. The authors conclude by offering suggestions for the academic development community about ways in which this kind of collaboration can be supported at local and institutional levels.

AB  - Since the advent of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) programs, first in K-12 and now in college curricula, many variants of STEM have arisen to include other disciplines in developing cross-disciplinary literacy among students. This paper briefly defines our own variant STE[A]M branch within the context of cross-disciplinary teaching and learning and then describes an interdisciplinary course, The Science in Science Fiction, in which professors of Biology, English, and Physics provided a range of science fiction texts which undergraduate and graduate students studied and discussed in depth. Students then produced and presented collaborative cross-disciplinary research on topics of their choice from the course work. Finally, students provided input on their experiences with collaborative cross-disciplinary teaching and learning. The overall effect was extremely positive. This article provides a framework for other faculty who would like to model this approach.

AB  - Interdisciplinary environmental and sustainability (IES) programs are different from other fields because they focus on a complex integration of humanities, social, and natural sciences concepts centered on the interactions of coupled human and natural systems. The interdisciplinary nature of IES programs does not lend itself to traditional discipline-specific concept inventory frameworks for critically evaluating preconceptions and learning. We discuss the results of the first phase of a research project to develop a next generation concept inventory for evaluating interdisciplinary concepts important for introductory IES courses. Using the Food-Energy-Water (FEW) Nexus (the intersections/interdependencies of food, energy, and water sectors) as our focus, we conducted a content analysis of eight representative college-level introductory environmental course syllabi and course materials (e.g., textbooks, journal articles, print media) to identify common interdisciplinary FEW Nexus concepts taught in introductory IES courses. Results demonstrate that all IES introductory course materials reference the FEW Nexus. Food, energy, and/or water resources as individual elements of the FEW Nexus are frequently described, but connections between these resource systems are included less often. Biology, energy systems, waste and pollution in the natural environment, agriculture, earth sciences and geology, climate change, behavioral social sciences, and economics concepts are most associated with FEW concepts, hinting at commonalities across IES topics that anchor systems thinking. Despite differences in IES programs, there appears to be some alignment between core concepts being taught at the FEW Nexus in introductory courses.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely adopted in higher education. However, the current research on AI in higher education is limited lacking both breadth and depth. The present study fills the research gap by exploring faculty members' perception on teaching AI and data science related courses facilitated by an open experiential AI platform. Specifically, two focus groups are conducted among computer science and non-computer science faculty members to gauge their perception on the integration of AI in an experiential learning platform to teach data science, as well as their perception on AI powered data science curriculum in higher education. Findings reveal three major themes which are defining data science, assembling interdisciplinary teams, and building platform for connection. The study has both theoretical and practical implications.

AB  - Creating learning environments that integrate arts, sciences, and computing in education can improve learning in these disciplines. In particular, transdisciplinary integrations of these disciplines can lead to expansive alterations or dissolutions of epistemological, ideological, and methodological boundaries. We wish to support teachers in the creation of transdisciplinary learning environments that draw on art, science, and computing. We developed a classroom project genre, Luminous Science, that was designed to bridge disciplinary materialities, epistemologies, and representations through students' construction of computationally-rich representations of physical phenomena. We present a study of a multidisciplinary group of teachers co-designing a Luminous Science unit for their classrooms using sculptural lanterns with programmable media for both investigations and expressions of classroom gardens. We present a framework for examining what disciplinary understandings teachers drew on, how these ideas were utilized, and why they were brought together. We found teachers engaged in richly metarepresentational discussions wherein they applied values, epistemic criteria, and practices from all three constituent fields of study in their design work. We show how teachers developed units that simultaneously overlapped and diverged due to the pressures of navigating disciplinary and school structural challenges. Qualitative analysis of teacher discourse reveals how teachers liberated disciplinary boundaries, actively and critically explored synergies and tensions in disciplinary integration, and traversed goals that focused on both disciplinary improvement and holistic learning. Our study sheds light on how we can both study teachers who are designing for disciplinary integration and support them through professional development opportunities to encourage more transdisciplinary interactions that can expand what it means to do or teach art, science, and computing.

AB  - Mastery of quantitative skills is increasingly critical for student success in life sciences, but few curricula adequately incorporate quantitative skills. Quantitative Biology at Community Colleges (QB@CC) is designed to address this need by building a grassroots consortium of community college faculty to (1) engage in interdisciplinary partnerships that increase participant confidence in life science, mathematics, and statistics domains; (2) generate and publish a collection of quantitative skills--focused open education resources (OER); and (3) disseminate these OER and pedagogical practices widely, in turn expanding the network. Currently in its third year, QB@CC has recruited 70 faculty into the network and created 20 modules. Modules can be accessed by interested biology and mathematics educators in high school, 2-year, and 4-year institutions. Here, we use survey responses, focus group interviews, and document analyses (principles-focused evaluation) to evaluate the progress in accomplishing these goals midway through the QB@CC program. The QB@CC network provides a model for developing and sustaining an interdisciplinary community that benefits participants and generates valuable resources for the broader community. Similar network-building programs may wish to adopt some of the effective aspects of the QB@CC network model to meet their objectives.

AB  - Undergraduate students often lack opportunities to comprehend, present, and produce scientific literature as part of their regular curriculum. In courses that have already been already developed, students either analyzed a few journal articles and/or studied disciplinary content typically with the assistance of a textbook. In this study, I have developed a course that primarily relies on scientific literature to introduce interdisciplinary science in the intersection of biology and physics. Here, students not only learned content knowledge through literature, but also how to thoroughly analyze about 20 journal articles published in top-tier journals in the field. Students demonstrate their understanding of the content matter through weekly assignments, oral presentations, and a written review article.

AB  - This study investigates the efficacy of incorporating neuropedagogical elements into virtual simulators for advanced chemistry education in universities. Utilizing a mixed-method approach, it uses questionnaires completed by 50 organic chemistry students. These questionnaires included both general and Likert scale questions, focusing on students' experiences with the PhET Interactive Simulation. The results highlight the positive impact of neuropedagogy on students' learning attitudes, cognitive abilities, and skill development, particularly in areas like critical thinking, analytical skills, and social competencies. A significant portion of students reported enhanced educational outcomes: 76% observed improved training effectiveness, 88% better understood the subject, and 96% found the virtual simulator-based learning more engaging. Furthermore, the study notes improvements in students' problem-solving abilities (68%), logical reasoning (92%), and comprehension of chemical processes (94%). These findings emphasize the value of integrating neuroscience principles in chemical education, potentially benefiting both tertiary and secondary education sectors. They indicate the necessity for educational adaptation in line with interdisciplinary research in cognitive and neurological sciences. This research not only serves as a valuable resource for chemistry teachers but also sets the stage for future empirical studies exploring neuroscience's role in teacher education. The study underscores the importance of further investigation into how teachers implement neuropedagogical techniques and the effectiveness of such applications, advocating for continuous development in educational methodologies.

AB  - Materials science research has expanded significantly in recent years; a multidisciplinary field, home to an ever-growing number of chemists. However, our general chemistry degree courses have not changed to reflect the rise in interest in this topic. In this paper, we propose a laboratory experiment for the undergraduate chemistry practical course, which may serve as a hands-on introduction to this field. The experiment involves the synthesis and characterization of magnetic materials via commonly employed techniques in materials science. Students begin by producing three metal ferrite spinels using a sol-gel combustion synthesis. They must then characterize the differing magnetic properties across their three samples using a magnetic susceptibility balance. In the second part of the experiment, students must create a ferrofluid via coprecipitation, from which they may observe the phenomenon of "spiking" in response to an external magnet. Additional data such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images corresponding to these materials are also provided, and students are tasked with the interpretation of these data in their writeup report. Upon completion, students should gain a new-found understanding of materials science and its fundamental overlap with chemistry.

AB  - Students often experience difficulty in connecting knowledge from different college courses to solve complex problems such as ocean acidification, a pressing concern within the ongoing climate crisis. Here, we introduce a multidisciplinary activity in which students use their chemistry knowledge of change and stability in chemical systems through Le Chatelier's principle and equilibrium of coupled reactions to explain the biological phenomenon of how changes in CO[subscript 2] concentrations can impact shelled organisms and ecosystems more broadly in the ocean. In this activity, we build on prior literature and emphasize Three-Dimensional Learning (3DL) to support students in developing a deeper understanding of this complex problem. This Ocean Acidification activity asks students to explain (1) the relationship between CO[subscript 2] concentration and ocean pH and (2) how and why changes in ocean pH could weaken shelled organisms. Among 136 students in a second-semester general chemistry course at a large institution, 93% were able to correctly predict the relationship between CO[subscript 2] and pH (chemistry-biology connection). Additionally, 43% of the students were able to then further apply this knowledge correctly to explain an unfamiliar situation in which the decreased pH could lead to less available carbonate ion for the shells (biological phenomenon). This result highlights that while some students were able to correctly explain the biological phenomenon and make meaningful connections, others would require additional in-class scaffolding and student-instructor interaction to be able to integrate their knowledge to explain this unfamiliar complex biological phenomenon. Implications for teaching and future implementations are also discussed.

AB  - Sustainability transitions need professionals with specific skills and attitudes that students often do not develop in their regular chemistry education. To foster sustainability change-maker competencies, we suggest augmenting higher education curricula, e.g., chemical degree programs, with transdisciplinary challenge-based learning combined with design thinking. The Da Vinci Project at Utrecht University (UU) in The Netherlands explores this approach, aiming to cultivate the undergraduates' sustainability change-maker competencies. After five years of experience, we reflected on the students' learning outcomes in this UU honors program. We conclude that transdisciplinary challenge-based education combined with design thinking provides unique opportunities for students to develop valuable skills and attitudes for navigating sustainability transitions, including the transition toward sustainable chemistry. These involve collaboration, communication, creative thinking, integrative problem-solving, stakeholder engagement, openness, empathy, the ability to deal with uncertainty and complexity, self-awareness, critical reflection, courage, and perseverance.

AB  - Data science is inherently collaborative as individuals across fields and sectors use quantitative data to answer relevant questions. As a result, there is a growing body of research regarding how to teach interdisciplinary collaboration skills. However, much of the work evaluating methods of teaching statistics and data science collaboration relies primarily on self-reflection data. Additionally, prior research lacks detailed methods for assessing the quality of collaboration skills. In this case study, we present a method for teaching statistics and data science collaboration, a framework for identifying elements of effective collaboration, and a comparative case study to evaluate the collaboration skills of both a team of students and an experienced collaborator on two components of effective data science collaboration: structuring a collaboration meeting and communicating with a domain expert. Results show that the students could facilitate meetings and communicate comparably well to the experienced collaborator, but that the experienced collaborator was better able to facilitate meetings and communicate to develop strong relationships, an important element for high-quality and long-term collaboration. Further work is needed to generalize these findings to a larger population, but these results begin to inform the field regarding effective ways to teach specific data science collaboration skills.

AB  - In this paper we discuss the types of knowledge used by six middle school students as they engaged with a debugging task designed to integrate ideas from computer science, mathematics and science. Our findings show that the computational thinking practice of debugging is a rich source of opportunities to integrate these different disciplines. The analysis illustrates how the types of knowledge the students did and did not use at each step of the debugging process were related to their ability to succeed at each step. Our work contributes to theory and practice by uncovering implications for studying debugging through two refined frameworks and for designing debugging tasks to support transdisciplinary learning.

AB  - Multilingual skills tend to be an integral part of modern society because a specialist able to speak, read and write in multi-languages is able to meet competition. Given that all the latest discoveries and achievements in the field of natural science have been published in English, in accordance with the theme of our study, Physics teaching in English becomes one of the topical issues. However, experience has proven that a few students realize the importance of language integrated learning (LIL) that was confirmed by statistical data from questionnaire made among students of specialties 5?060400 and 5?011000-Physics, the Faculty of Natural Sciences, the Akhmet Yassawi International Kazakh-Turkish University. Realizing the value of gained knowledge is directly related to the motivation and result of learning process. It is assumed that the solution to this problem lies in the competitive organization of language integrated learning in teaching namely in appropriate choice of teaching methods. This is valuable in the context of modern practice-oriented understanding of learning. These technologies include the ICT and case study method which help to change the students' meaning of how the foreign language important from the point of view of their proficiency that was confirmed by statistical data. Some methodological aspects of the use of ICT and case-study in language integrated teaching as well as mechanisms of interdisciplinary coordination and cooperation between English teachers and Physics teachers that both contributed to the ICT and case-study integration in language integrated teaching as well as it is valuable for further research in this area. The staff of the Chair of Physics at the Akhmet Yassawi International Kazakh-Turkish University creates close ties worldwide and conducts extensive work in this direction. The theoretical and experimental studies that were carried out convincingly prove the need introduce into the educational process an innovative methods in the educational process as a case study and ICT for the formation of creativity of University students.

AB  - Today, the integrative STEM initiative, which is at the center of the current paradigm shift in education, includes attempts to blend science, mathematics and engineering with technology education. Common considerations provide an opportunity to better define the role of technology within the framework of STEM education, but this has not yet been fully realized. Therefore, a lack of definition/role of technology in STEM education is quite noticeable and there exist different perspectives regarding this issue. This theoretical study explains the basic principles regarding the transdisciplinary role of the technology that is defined with certain limits, while discussing different ideas about the integration of science and technology in STEM education in the last 30 years in order to present a different perspective on the role of technology in STEM education.

AB  - Integrated Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education has gained popularity worldwide. With the twenty-first century's different economic, political, and societal needs, nations intend to train citizens as better problem solvers. The current integrated STEM movement has influenced science curriculum documents and science teaching and learning to address those issues. To attain the goals of recent reform, teachers' understanding of the essential characteristics of integrated STEM education and learning implementation of the STEM activities with engineering design challenges are required. The related literature has stated that teachers' voices should be heard to address their needs through professional development (PD). In light of that point, in this needs assessment study, we intended to determine in-service chemistry teachers' expectations from and needs for implementing integrated STEM education. Data were collected from 112 chemistry teachers via open-ended questions. Results showed that most of the teachers stated that they expect to experience integrated STEM activities with their active participation through PDs. Additionally, the participants highlighted their expectations from a PD design to learn what integrated STEM education is and its essential features. Learning how to integrate STEM activities into lessons, developing integrated STEM lesson plans, and interdisciplinary chemistry teaching were other participants' expectations. Examples of participants' needs were learning implementation of integrated STEM education, integrating chemistry with STEM disciplines, finding chemistry-based STEM activities, and learning engineering design process and product. In order to reach PDs' goals set, first of all, teachers' needs for and expectations from the PDs should be determined regarding the STEM approach and then the PDs in which the teachers take a role as active participants should be organized.

AB  - In this paper we describe the STEAM pedagogy developed under the European Union's Horizon 2020 project iMuSciCA (interactive music science collaborative activities). We present the pedagogical model this interdisciplinary pedagogy is based on and we give a concrete example of lesson scenario in which this pedagogy is applied. In particular we show how this interdisciplinary pedagogy can strengthen the understanding of physics concepts and processes by connecting them to corresponding concepts and procedures typical of other disciplines like engineering and music.

AB  - Background: This paper explores K-12 interdisciplinary learning in the humanities (IL-Humanities), an area that, until now, has seen limited research focus compared to its STEM counterparts. We asked: (1) What are the outcomes of IL-Humanities in terms of interdisciplinary competences? (2) How do learners in these environments engage in cross-disciplinary knowledge building and transdisciplinary identity work? Methods: We assessed the efficacy of IL-Humanities across ten Israeli middle schools through a pre-post intervention/comparison design, utilizing the novel Interdisciplinary Competences Assessment (ICA). Qualitative insights into the learning processes within classrooms were derived using discourse analysis methods. Findings: Students' interdisciplinary competences were found to increase following the IL-Humanities interventions. Qualitative analyses offered "thick descriptions" of the process: Students leveraged cross-disciplinary transfer of knowledge to deepen their understanding of complex phenomena and used personal narratives to engage in identity work. Contribution: This study enhances interdisciplinary education research by: (1) providing and operationalizing a model of interdisciplinary competences as an assessment tool; (2) demonstrating the effectiveness of IL-Humanities environments in developing these competences; and (3) advancing our understanding of learners' engagement with cross-disciplinary knowledge building and transdisciplinary identity work.

AB  - Teachers' understanding and teaching of argumentation is gaining more attention in science education research. However, little is known about how science teachers engage in argumentation with teachers of different subject taking an interdisciplinary perspective that may inspire new pedagogical ideas or strategies. In particular, the positioning of argumentation at the juncture of science and religion is rare. This paper reports an empirical study involving science and religious education (RE) teachers who collaborated on teaching argumentation in three secondary schools in England. Their interdisciplinary collaboration was sustained by a series of professional development sessions over 18 months. Analysis of the interview data unfolds how the teachers' collaboration impacted their understanding of argumentation and views of teaching their subject. Through working relationally in exploring and teaching argumentation, the science teachers reflected more notable changes than their RE counterparts. Science teachers came to appreciate student voice in the learning process and the role of argumentation in fostering students' scientific reasoning. The paper is a salient step to researching argumentation in a cross-curricular terrain, particularly in relation to RE. It also sheds light on how collaborating with teachers of another subject bolstered science teachers' professional development and broke subject barriers.

AB  - Molecular case studies (MCSs) are open educational resources that use a storytelling approach to engage students in biomolecular structure-function explorations, at the interface of biology and chemistry. Although MCSs are developed for a particular target audience with specific learning goals, they are suitable for implementation in multiple disciplinary course contexts. Detailed teaching notes included in the case study help instructors plan and prepare for their implementation in diverse contexts. A newly developed MCS was simultaneously implemented in a biochemistry and a molecular parasitology course at two different institutions. Instructors participating in this cross-institutional and multidisciplinary implementation collaboratively identified the need for quick and effective ways to bridge the gap between the MCS authors' vision and the implementing instructor's interpretation of the case-related molecular structure-function discussions. Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive and engaging experience that has been used effectively in teaching molecular sciences. Its accessibility and ease-of-use with smart devices (e.g., phones and tablets) make it an attractive option for expediting and improving both instructor preparation and classroom implementation of MCSs. In this work, we report the incorporation of ready-to-use AR objects as checkpoints in the MCS. Interacting with these AR objects facilitated instructor preparation, reduced students' cognitive load, and provided clear expectations for their learning. Based on our classroom observations, we propose that the incorporation of AR in MCSs can facilitate its successful implementation, improve the classroom experience for educators and students, and make MCSs more broadly accessible in diverse curricular settings.

AB  - Interdisciplinary STEM education is a particular pedagogical methodology in which learners learn the association and connection of the knowledge of science and mathematics through particular technological engineering. To achieve this, specific interdisciplinary STEM-based educational curricula should be developed, and teachers should be qualified appropriately before any implementation process. Therefore, the aims of the research are both to (a) reveal the effect of the STEM workshop on science teachers' awareness of the relationship between science and other disciplines and to (b) examine its transferring contribution to their lesson planning approach. The case study method was used to get the essential data of research with 40 science teachers. The data were gathered via the Questionnaire for Interdisciplinary Association of Science, the lesson plans, and semi-structured interviews. As a result of the research, less variation is found in disciplines associated with science such as mathematics, technology-design, social studies, engineering, visual arts, Turkish languages, and music, etc. compared to data tools that they applied before and after workshop sessions. Besides, the post-applied data tool results revealed that the participants provided more comprehensive explanations regarding the direction of the interdisciplinary association, which suggests a better understanding of the relationship of science with other disciplines in the latter case. In addition, it was determined that most of the teachers designed their lesson plans based on an interdisciplinary approach and used the Engineering Design Process (EDP) as a teaching method to create the learning environment.

AB  - Cultivating innovative talents in the humanities and social sciences is a pivotal element in the development of high-level innovative talents with a direct impact on a nation's superstructure and economy. Nevertheless, this area has often been a weak link in the talent market. In response to this challenge, Chinese universities have initiated the "New Humanities and Social Sciences" reform, emphasizing interdisciplinary education to nurture high-quality talents. However, the impact of interdisciplinary education within this context on the creativity of humanities and social science students, along with the intricate underlying mechanisms, remains a question yet to be fully answered. To address these issues, using survey data from 184 students majoring in humanities and social sciences in Sichuan Province of China, we employed structural equation modeling to explore the impact of interdisciplinary education on the creativity of humanities and social science students, the moderating effect of metacognitive awareness and the mediating role of knowledge integration ability. The research findings unequivocally affirm the significantly positive influence of interdisciplinary education on the creativity of humanities and social science students. Knowledge integration ability mediates the relationship between interdisciplinary education and creativity. Furthermore, metacognitive awareness plays a moderating role in the relationship between knowledge integration ability and creativity.

AB  - The effectiveness of incorporating an audience response system (ARS) in improving the learning environment and student performance was assessed in a didactic biomedical science course at a large US dental school. Instructors and students were surveyed for their experiences of using Top Hat-based ARS in a multi-disciplinary biomedical science course. Average exam scores and grade distribution for challenging sections on immunology and developmental biology were compared before and after incorporating ARS. Pearson's chi-squared test, likelihood ratio test, Student's t-test and Fisher's exact test using beta regression model were used to assess statistical significance (p < 0.05). Student survey results with 78% (82/105) response rate, indicated that incorporating ARS improved student engagement, reinforced lecture material, and prepared them better for exams (p < 0.0001). Sixty seven percent of student respondents recommended continued integration of ARS questions in lectures (p < 0.0001). Although faculty survey data (n = 5, 100% response rate) were not statistically significant, the majority of faculty agreed that real-time feedback through ARS allowed them to appropriately pace lecture delivery and restructure forthcoming material. The average exam scores and grade distribution for challenging sections showed modest improvement after incorporation of ARS (p < 0.05). There was no significant correlation between final course grades and ARS grades for participation or correctness. Incorporating the ARS in a multi-disciplinary biomedical science course is perceived by faculty and students as an effective instructional approach that improves the learning environment, teaching strategies, and student performance.

AB  - The paper discusses how a teaching approach, "interdisciplinary design and invention pedagogy," affected primary school student teachers' learning outcomes through the craft design process in pre-service teacher education. This study applies developmental work research (Engeström in J Educ Work 14(1):133-156, 2001; Engeström in Yhteiskehittely ja vaihdon vyöhykkeet tutkijoiden ja elinkeinoelämän välillä 2013; Galison in Image & logic: a material culture of microphysics. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1997; Gorman in Trading zones, interactional expertise and interdisciplinary collaboration 2005) that aims to develop educators' work involved here. To support a craft-designing process and making innovative artefacts, two disciplines--natural science (physics) and drama--as examples of interdisciplinarity were invited to contribute to the craft process. The craft course on 'smart textiles' was carried out in the spring of 2014 and 2015 at the University of Helsinki in pre-service primary teacher education. The aim of the crafts course was to get student teachers familiar with different dimensions of crafts (textile, design and technology), inquiry-based designing and an interdisciplinary teaching approach to be used in a primary school context. The craft task included working in small groups and designing smart textiles. Student teachers documented their designing and implementation processes through photos and videos using applications such as iMovie or Movie maker. In addition, participants wrote comprehensions of their projects in learning diaries. The data consist of student teachers' learning diaries (N = 17) and prototypes (N = 17), which are analysed by qualitative content analysis. As results, first, the paper presents some innovative artefacts that student teachers created. Second, it describes the learning that emerged in pedagogical thinking of student teachers related to the interdisciplinary designing process, including (1) four interdisciplinary contexts, (2) new pedagogic thinking and (3) change of attitude towards integrative teaching.

AB  - The aim of this study is to understand and explore interdisciplinarity in geography and undergraduate geography courses in geography teaching departments in Turkey. There is a growing literature in science underscoring the importance of interdisciplinary approach and its beneficial outcomes. Increasing body of knowledge on social theory, on philosophical and theoretical movements and paradigms have made easier communication among disciplines which give rise to more perceptible interdisciplinarity specifically in social sciences and humanities. At the second part of the present study we focused on relationships between geography courses, interdisciplinary approach and course selection. Because in the study course selection is seen as the most important point to analyze and understand the extent to which whether interdisciplinarity finds a place in geography teaching. Lastly, it is given some conclusions by making suggestions.

AB  - The paper investigates how teacher trainees in higher education geography and external, non-scientific partners perceive and experience collaborations in an active teaching and learning approach. Such formats are recommended in education for sustainable development (ESD) but are likely to be challenging experiences for all actors involved. The study analysed two transdisciplinary-oriented courses, where future teachers in geography and primary social and science education collaborated with civil society partners. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 students and partners; course evaluations complemented the database. The analysis identified several approaches to collaboration and aspects that either led to intensive collaboration or challenged its transdisciplinary character. Furthermore, the study revealed the interdependencies between the external partners' expectations, their motives and the perceived effects of the collaborations. The partners anticipated a wide range of expectations, some of which went beyond what the students could reasonably deliver. Our analysis also showed that the collaborations enabled students to learn, experience and reflect on an active teaching and learning approach to ESD. We conclude that transdisciplinary-oriented courses can oscillate along the spectrum between "nice try" and "valuable initiative". The paper ends with recommendations for shaping and delivering transdisciplinary-oriented courses effectively.

AB  - Transformational equity-centered science education requires the fields of science education and school leadership to critically consider the limited preparation elementary principals are offered to lead for science education. Thus far, little effort has been made to foster a transdisciplinary curricula beyond traditional organizational theories related to school culture and climate; learning sciences; and supervision. School leadership programs are currently inadequately preparing elementary leaders in rigorous pedagogies involving science education. Although the role of principals is often not discussed concerning science implementation in elementary education, principals play a critical role in science decision-making. In this study, the authors present a case study of one elementary principal who also served as an othermother. Othermothers have been described as those who share mothering responsibilities in Black communities. Through interview transcripts, field notes, and social network data, the authors examine how this othermother cared for her students and community by advocating for science instruction. By strategically navigating the socio-political and policy climate and drawing on her authentic relationships, this othermother was critical in implementing a science agenda for elementary science. Three themes that emerged from the data analysis are, (1) othermothers view science as a potential means to transform lives and fulfill the needs of the local community, (2) science policies (i.e., federal, state, and local) can limit the potential of the vision of science an othermother has for the community, (3) othermothers draw on their community to guide equitable science instruction. Overall, othermothers have visions for what science can do. However, they cannot counter the status quo individually. Collective action among educators in various roles is one means of moving an equity agenda concerning science education forward.

AB  - A phenomenon from the natural world, cricket chirping behavior in relation to ambient temperature, is used as the springboard for engaging the curiosity of gifted students in an interdisciplinary classroom curriculum. Mathematics and science standards and disciplinary practices are prominent in the investigation, while other disciplines deepen the experience. An analysis of the cricket project in terms of the Parallel Curriculum (core, connections, practice, and identity) provides an interesting lens for examining interdisciplinarity (see Tomlinson, C. A., Kaplan, S. N., Renzulli, and J. S., et al. (2009). Parallel curriculum: "A design to develop learner potential and challenge advanced learners." Corwin Press).

AB  - Purpose: This quasi-experimental study evaluated the effects on students' autonomous motivation and satisfaction from a program integrating physics concepts in physical education. Method: A total of 487 students (age 13 [plus or minus] 1) participated in the study. The participants were students participating in physical education classes divided into intervention (n = 183), comparison, and control condition (n = 150 and n = 154, respectively). Before the intervention and three times during its implementation, the students responded on measures of situational motivation with good construct validity. Results: The intervention increased the students' autonomous motivation and satisfaction in physical education and decreased the students' amotivation. Conclusion: An effective integration of physics concepts and physical activities can promote meaningful learning, a holistic education perspective, autonomous motivation, and wellness in physical education.

AB  - There is much anecdotal evidence of the benefits of fieldwork, but a small amount of research has been carried out on the value of fieldwork for student learning. Existing studies have focused on analysing fieldwork in mostly disciplinary and national contexts and the effects of interdisciplinary fieldwork on student learning have not been fully analysed. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing empirical evidence of the impact interdisciplinarity and internationality have on student learning while carrying out fieldwork. The case study consists of three field courses in Portugal in which biology, geography and geology students from Germany and Portugal took part. Based on a group interview with twelve students, their experiences, perceived learning outcomes and overall success of the fieldwork are evaluated. The results support the initial assumptions that interdisciplinary and international fieldwork adds value above and beyond the traditional field experience, and has a positive effect on the learning experience of the students. The students agree they have learned to better define their own study field and the interconnections with other disciplines. They also reported improved communication skills and methodological abilities and now feel better prepared to meet academic challenges and careers beyond campus.

AB  - Interdisciplinary programs of study, especially within psychology, offer many benefits including addressing diverse student interests while encouraging the growth of skills, perspectives, and experiences in collaboration that would otherwise be impossible. A health psychology emphasis was created within the psychology major as an interdisciplinary program combining psychology, nutrition, biology, and health science courses. The effectiveness of this emphasis was evaluated in terms of student numbers and characteristics along with job and graduate school placements. Data were collected from three sources: descriptive information for all enrolled students, self-report data from students currently enrolled, and from student graduates. Emphasis growth was dramatic over 9 trimesters (180 to 438, +143.33%) with great diversity in student demographics and desired career paths. Graduates had high satisfaction (M=8.28, max 10), a majority (68%) were employed in diverse jobs, and 68% of those who applied were accepted into a variety of graduate school programs. The consistent diversity of student interests, vocations and graduate programs supports the interdisciplinary health psychology emphasis as an effective means of providing an interdisciplinary education. The health psychology emphasis provides a framework for other interdisciplinary programs of study in psychology and other fields.

AB  - Health systems face complex challenges -- even more so in resource-constrained contexts such as South Africa. Alignment of local educational systems with national development goals is needed to strengthen health systems. The further disruption of COVID-19 to educational and health systems underscores the necessity to adapt our curricula and practices. Integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), such as e-Learning and mobile health (mHealth) applications integrated with learning management systems, or virtual learning environments, offer a sustainable strategy for the enhancement of Health Science student training, graduate competency development and delivery of quality patient care. Uptake, or not, of e-Learning and mHealth at several South African universities was explored through a survey with staff (n = 65) from across the Health Sciences. Diverse perceptions, experiences and recommendations were found, including the prevalence and dis/advantages of e-Learning and mHealth in the Health Sciences. The perceived usefulness of specific features of each were highlighted. In closing, a multi-modal model of epistemology, axiology and ontology in healthcare technology, digital health and medical education -- including content, skills, technology development and challenges/constraints -- is presented.

AB  - In this article we present research on Slovenian primary school teachers' opinion about the interdisciplinary approach between fine art and science education. With the help of questionnaires, interviews, and analysis of lesson plans, we determined how primary school teachers use this type of interdisciplinary approach, how often and what their views are. We included 138 primary school teachers from every region in Slovenia. It turned out that primary school teachers in Slovenia use an interdisciplinary approach between fine art and science teaching quite often and consider it useful to achieve different aspects of pupils' development. The study revealed that most teachers find it difficult to consider the educational goals of both fields (fine art, science). They often use the connection between the subjects only on an associative level - they only mention the teaching content of one subject quickly and carelessly, without making meaningful connections and without achieving the goals of both subjects. Content taught in this way cannot be considered a cross-curricular approach in the subject sense.

AB  - As data and protocols are increasingly generated, accessed, and manipulated electronically, many labs are shifting to storing data in electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs). ELNs provide clear advantages in readability, shareability, searchability, accessibility, and data security over their paper counterparts. Our interdisciplinary program implemented ELNs across several sections of our gateway molecular biology laboratory course and analyzed the impact on 384 students (13 sections total from Fall 2016 to Spring 2018) using surveys, focus groups, and grade data. We found that students prefer the electronic format, citing the ease of transitioning to lab reports and the longevity of their data. Course grades overall were not affected by the change. Based on our experience, we offer suggestions for smoothing the transition to an ELN system in undergraduate and graduate laboratory courses, including use during remote teaching.

AB  - This paper focuses on system concept use in teaching either chemical core concepts or interdisciplinary chemistry-related topics. The system concept is important in order to develop global competences, and chemistry teaching plays a key role in this context. A questionnaire has been administered to two different samples, Italian teachers and International Baccalaureate (IB) teachers, in order to investigate their opinions about the issues involved. The most significant differences and similarities emerging from the survey have been analyzed mostly by dendrograms and then commented on. With due caution, it is possible to suppose similar attitudes in the two groups of teachers except for some aspects. For example, the analysis of system concept knowledge within pure chemistry highlights some deficiencies: Italian teachers in particular show a low level of epistemological awareness about the systemic character of chemistry, whereas its knowledge would allow not only a chemistry teaching improvement but also a productive use of chemical explanations in other scientific and nonscientific fields, especially in the social sciences; as a consequence, it would facilitate interdisciplinary teaching. Therefore, science teachers need epistemological insight into chemical systemic aspects, that may be provided by high quality textbooks and training initiatives focusing on the systemic character of chemistry and its interdisciplinary connections. In an analysis of chemistry teachers only, Italian teachers support interdisciplinary teaching more strongly than IB teachers, despite the rigidity and the state of crisis of the Italian education system, often attributed to a lack of broad-minded teachers. This evidence indicates a promising resource for the Italian education system. Moreover, a similar kind of questionnaire can be utilized by other education researchers in order to isolate and analyze some teachers' attitudes regardless the very different education systems in which every sample works.

AB  - The history and philosophy of science (HPS) plays a special role in education. An elective HPS course on the philosophy of scientific experimentation for young scientists and graduate students of natural science is presented. The course bears a pragmatic character, and its main aims include the development of critical thinking (CT), familiarization with philosophical problems in the relevant areas of knowledge, and the cultivation of a taste for reflective, critical analysis, both individual and group based, which contributes to a deeper understanding of the features of scientific practice in the context of modern complex group cooperation. Students are offered a classical HPS program that included debates on the relationship between empiricism and rationalism, the role of Kant's transcendental philosophy, modern topics associated with the practical success of rationalism in the emergence of modern natural science, and the theory-ladenness of experimentation. Particular attention during the course is paid to the problems of megascience, the inclusion of which is justified by the specifics of the students' engagement with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Emphasis is placed on the structure and typology of the collective subject in the modern educational process as well as in experimental practice. Lessons on the methodology of expert text analysis (META), which are aimed at the development of critical thinking skills and the creation of an interdisciplinary discussion space, are included in the course and relied on the example of the history and philosophy of high-energy physics to motivate professional reflection. META classes included in the course prepare graduate students for teamwork in big science, proto-megascience, and megascience. The course offers practical recommendations that could be applied to students' own research and could be useful for practitioners.

AB  - Interdisciplinary collaborations between different academic disciplines can create knowledge and solutions to challenges that are beyond the scope of what a single discipline can achieve. However, little is known about how interdisciplinary teams of faculty and graduate students function as a whole and the processes that guide them as they work on collaborative tasks. Using Activity Theory, this qualitative study analyzed team meeting transcripts to examine interdisciplinary team interactions involving Science/Engineering and Science Education graduate students and faculty members as they co-developed laboratory activities for a grant-funded project. Several factors contributed to the team's success: shared goals (Object), environment (Community), and clear Division of Labor. Differences (contradictions) were found in the Tools, Rules, and Division of Labor; the PI and Science/Engineering graduate students tended to focus on the needed lab materials, and the Science Education members focused more on educational standards and teachers' ideas in the lab development (Tools). The PI and Science Education members set and enforced the team meeting agendas and deadlines (Rules). The Science/Engineering grad students focused on practical considerations to ensure the labs could successfully be implemented in a class setting (Rules) and were assigned the most tasks to complete (Division of Labor). The findings provide insight into the nature of interdisciplinary team dynamics between a Science/Engineering and Education grant team. The findings also suggest the importance of shared goals (Object), community development (Rules: Team Building), and the potential of capitalizing on different strengths and knowledge (contradictions) in an interdisciplinary team.

AB  - REDEVELOP is a graduate student training program funded by the NSERC-CREATE grant, starting in 2017. Its goal is to support the training of new professionals and researchers (> 100) who will be the next generation of science and engineering leaders and policymakers in Canada. The program has successfully developed a framework for operating almost completely virtually, well ahead of the world's transition to online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our psychology lab, The Individual and Team Performance (ITP) lab, has dedicated over a decade to researching and designing tools that enhance specific training and skill growth necessary for effective remote teamwork. In partnership with the REDEVELOP program, we support students in navigating the unique interpersonal and collaboration challenges posed by virtual team environments. We will discuss how a complex and multidisciplinary program succeeds in training graduate students to become stronger academics, practitioners, and communicators of knowledge.

AB  - One of the main topics of mathematics education nowadays is teaching applications of mathematics in various fields, which lead in the recent decades to the development of the STEM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), connecting these disciplines using transdisciplinary or interdisciplinary approaches. Applications of mathematics has become important not only from academic point of view, as helping students to understand mathematics, to apply mathematical knowledge in various contexts, and to show the utility of mathematics, but also because mathematics is an integral part of our daily lives. Teachers have an important role in this approach, so it is important to study their attitude towards teaching applications of mathematics and their experience. The research was conducted in 2021 in Israel. The participants are 221 mathematics teachers from post primary schools. The research instrument was a questionnaire developed for this study based on the scientific literature and aimed to find out teachers' opinion about teaching applications of mathematics and their practice in integrating applications in their teaching. The questionnaire contains both closed and open questions. The responses were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. The results of the study show that 42.5% of teachers in Israel are teaching applications of mathematics. Analyzing the answers given by those teachers, who teach applications of mathematics, 47% are teaching applications in physics, 47.5% integrate them in their lessons few times a semester, and 52.1% of them teaching applications through presenting it to the students. In the participants' opinion, the most important benefits of teaching applications of mathematics are arising students' interest for mathematics (44.3%) and motivating students for learning mathematics (34.8%). The most important obstacles of teaching applications of mathematics are time-constrains (30.8%) and lack of teachers' skills to teaching mathematical applications in other disciplines (24.6%).

AB  - This paper demonstrates an experimental integrated lesson of physics and calculus in a topic of fluid force applying on different shapes of dams. This lesson was designed for the first year students in engineering program in an attempt to show them the connection between these two disciplines, as well as to introduce more advanced engineering-physics problems to them. Experimental results present students' learning achievement from pre-test, homework and post-test scores, students' ability in solving problems using an appropriate method, and students' satisfactory on the integrated lesson. The authors hope that our work could provide other lecturers in different fields with an idea to conduct crossover lessons or courses and encourage them to do so. This practice will not only enable students to apply their knowledge to practical applications, but also is a way to create collaborative atmosphere among lecturers, broadening their interdisciplinary knowledge and sharing teaching ideas to one another.

AB  - In general, history is a construction of the past that should use models, methods, and concepts of other social sciences to explain the changes or events throughout human life and civilization. Thus, the assumption that history should be explained from a broader perspective of social sciences and the deep analysis of social theory has transformed the need for an interdisciplinary approach in history education. In the quest for an advanced learning approach to history education, this article proposes integrative learning as an approach that could meet the need for the integration of various perspectives and theories from social science disciplines in learning history. Constructively explained through a systematic literature review of related studies oriented towards history, interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and integrative learning, this article works on the possibility of integration encompassing four steps, namely establishing a purpose, understanding and leveraging disciplinary insights, leveraging integration, and critical stance. Despite the lack of empirical research, integrative learning is a promising concept that could improve the method of fostering high-order thinking skills in history education.

AB  - Despite the number of university students who take courses in multiple science disciplines, little is known about how they connect concepts between disciplines. Energy is a concept that underlies all scientific phenomena and, as such, provides an appropriate context in which to investigate student connections and misconnections across disciplines. In this study, university students concurrently enrolled in introductory chemistry and biology were interviewed to explore their perceptions of the integration of energy both within and across the disciplines, and how they attempted to accommodate and reconcile different disciplinary approaches to energy, to inform future, interdisciplinary course reform. Findings suggest that, while students believed energy to be important to the scientific world and to the disciplines of biology and chemistry, the extent to which it was seen as central to success in their courses varied. Differences were also apparent in students' descriptions of the molecular-level mechanisms by which energy transfer occurs. These findings reveal a disconnect between how energy is understood and used in introductory science course work and uncovers opportunities to make stronger connections across the disciplines. We recommend that instructors engage in interdisciplinary conversations and consider the perspectives and goals of other disciplines when teaching introductory science courses.

AB  - An interdisciplinary course called "The Chemistry of Poisons" was created, featuring organic chemistry, biology, pharmacology, and toxicology content. This exploratory chemistry elective course was created by an instructor with a background in synthetic organic chemistry and a teaching assistant with a background in pharmacy practice. "The Chemistry of Poisons" features an interdisciplinary, student-centered approach to learning that provides a foundation for future academic initiatives to deliver chemical, pharmacological, and humanistic content in a manner that is both enjoyable for students and demonstrably facilitates knowledge and application level learning. Student course feedback and a retrospective survey were used to gauge student-perceived learning achievement. Survey results and feedback were consistent with knowledge and application level learning of course content and preference for interdisciplinary course design. These results warrant further development and study of interdisciplinary strategies for chemical education.

AB  - Integrating scientific disciplines through a transdisciplinary approach is a pivotal component of contemporary learning paradigms, fostering educational experiences that transcend monodisciplinary boundaries and embrace the integration of diverse fields. Addressing this imperative, we collaborated with educators in Indonesia to devise a learning framework that interweaves mathematics, biology, and cultural dimensions by utilizing the context of Tempeh production--a traditional fermented food in Indonesia. This article delineates the intricacies of our pedagogical design, encompassing eight key stages: briefing, contextualization, exploration, action 1 to action 4, and reflection. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive analysis of students' reflective writing, employing thematic analysis across six stages, namely description, feelings, evaluation, analysis, conclusion, and action plan. This initiative seeks to forge connections between scientific disciplines and to furnish students with theoretical knowledge and tangible and pragmatic experiences.

AB  - Big Brother, newspeak, doublethink, vapourised people and thought police became worldwide famous expressions. 1984 novel portrays a nightmare society controlled by information manipulation and by suppression of both history and science. This study aimed to investigate the impact of using the 1984 dystopian novel associated with socio-scientific issues (SSI) in the development of moral values and reasoning skills of high school students. An interdisciplinary didactic program encompassing the Arts, Philosophy and Biology subjects was elaborated to stimulate discussion and debates around SSIs. The didactic intervention was evaluated through a questionnaire and the 1984 film debate. The students were able to explore scientific concepts to discuss social issues and correlated the allegory of the cave topic with alienation and the 1984 novel. The students also recognised that the approached issues are related not only to their life in society but to existential human conditions. We claim that dystopian texts allied to SSI debates can function as creativity triggers to stimulate students developing the inquiry skills and dispositions needed to express themselves, challenging fake news and uncovering new possibilities to apprehend the truth.

AB  - The paper argues that the different dimensions of collaboration - intercultural, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary--contribute to mutual understanding and empathy. Their intersection fosters self-reflection and reveals shortcomings, blind spots, and prejudices about other cultures, disciplines, and social groups. The course aimed to overcome technology-driven design practices that tend to (re)produce stereotypes or social exclusions--often unconsciously. To make students aware of such problems, we introduced them to Feminist Science and Technology Studies, which show how dimensions such as age, class, and gender affect socio-technological participation. Moreover, we introduced user-centered and participatory design methods (contextual interviews, scenario-based design, design forecasting) that the teams had to adapt to pandemic conditions to conduct participatory research and propose design scenarios. The empirical course evaluation by the students indicates that the pedagogical concept, which we conceptualized as an extended version of a 'Third Space', allowed for intercultural, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary learning experiences and improved collective student and team performance, transcending culturally- and disciplinary-specific situatedness. In our analysis, we reflect on the power of the different forms of collaborations and their contribution to teaching future researchers, designers, and engineers how to engage with another's point of view. We consider this ability a prerequisite for acting responsibly in a globalized digital world. Results from the study are contextualized in current debates on internationalization and digitalization in the educational sciences and translated into recommendations for practitioners.

AB  - Education on sustainability is a crucial goal that requires a transformative shift in teacher education to drive meaningful changes oriented to action. A cross-sectional study with an exploratory design investigated preservice science teachers' perceptions regarding teaching sustainable citizenship, specifically focusing on the climate crisis and earthquakes-tsunamis. The study was conducted in two Chilean universities with similar teacher preparation programs. The team designed a podcast series, which was used and evaluated by the 13 participants through action research. Three group discussions explored their perceptions of the resources, as well as the aims and challenges of teaching sustainable citizenship and the podcasts. We used Grounded Theory steps, including triangulation by the researchers to ensure reliability, to qualitatively analyse the data. The results reveal a constraint on teaching in areas where the participants lacked the necessary preparation and background knowledge as students and preservice teachers. The main challenges were related to interdisciplinarity, the social dimension of socio-scientific issues and context-responsive teaching methods. The perceived aims were the development of students' critical thinking, informed positioning, and encouraging active citizen participation. Preservice teachers found the podcast series to be a valuable new epistemic and pedagogical resource that can support their efforts to teach sustainable citizenship and implement pedagogical strategies. The autonomous usage of the device triggered reflection processes, particularly regarding the human rights perspective, which unveiled the socio-political dimensions inherent in science education. It promoted personal re-positioning as active citizens and educators and empowered them to seek out and pursue the changes needed to reshape future classrooms. We discuss these findings in the context of teacher preparation and the use of educational technology in teacher education.

AB  - The practice of learning physics contributes to the development of many transdisciplinary skills learners are able to exercise independent of the physics discipline. However, the standard practices of physics instruction do not explicitly include the monitoring or evaluation of these skills. In a competency-based (CB) learning model, the skills (competencies) are clearly defined and evaluated. We envisioned that a CB approach, where the underlying competencies are highlighted within the instructional process, would be more suitable to teaching physics to learners with diversified disciplinary interests. A model CB course curriculum was developed and practiced at Purdue University to teach introductory college physics to learners who were majoring in the technology disciplines. The experiment took place from the spring semester in 2015 until the spring semester in 2017. The practice provided a means to monitor and evaluate a set of developmental transdisciplinary competencies that underlie the learning of force and motion concepts in classical physics. Additionally, the CB practice contributed to produce substantial physics learning outcomes among learners who were underprepared to learn physics in college.

AB  - Background: This study explored the challenges around enacting change in a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subject at an Australian higher education institution and examined key elements required to ensure change. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to examine the barriers and levers driving change during the collaboration of discipline experts, in both science and education disciplines and professional staff across education and science faculties to change the delivery of an existing subject within a science faculty, from traditional lectures to an active learning approach. Sample: Participants from the education faculty and science faculty formed the participant interview pool of five academics for this study. Design and Methods: Research design of semi-structured interviews of participants was conducted to answer the research questions. Instruments were used to test the research questions, such as factors to facilitate and support change to teaching a science subject and the elements required for successful interdisciplinary collaboration for bringing about change to the teaching of a science subject. Thematic analyses were conducted on the data responses to answer the research questions. Results: The findings revealed that participants found that factors such as time, resources, understanding of and commitment to the proposed change represented potential barriers to change in the subject. The existence of multiple, time-sensitive champions, additional human resources and a collaborative network of participants, however, were identified as some of the key elements that supported enacting changes to a science subject. Conclusions: The findings of the study provide insights into interdisciplinary collaborations enacting changes to the teaching of a science subject. For instance, the need for establishment of a dynamic network of participants engendered with multiple interdisciplinary expertise, as well as the need for a change champion and implementation champion, throughout the curriculum redesign, planning and implementation phases of the change.

AB  - This open access edited volume invites transdisciplinary scholars to re-vision science education in the era of the Anthropocene. The collection assembles the works of educators from many walks of life and areas of practice together to help reorient science education toward the problems and peculiarities associated with the geologic times many call the Anthropocene. It has become evident that science education--the way it is currently institutionalized in various forms of school science, government policy, classroom practice, educational research, and public/private research laboratories--is "ill-equipped" and "ill-conceived" to deal with the expansive and urgent contexts of the Anthropocene. Paying homage to myopic knowledge systems, rigid state education directives, and academic-professional communities intent on reproducing the same practices, knowledges, and relationships that have endangered our shared world and shared presents/presence is misdirected. This volume brings together diverse scholars to reimagine the field in times of precarity.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present an argument for why there is a need to re-envision the underlying culture of undergraduate biology education to ensure the success, retention, and matriculation of Black students. The basis of this argument is the continued noted challenges with retaining Black students in the biological sciences coupled with existing research that implicates science contexts (i.e., the cultural norms, values, and beliefs manifesting through policies and practices) as being the primary source of the challenges experienced by Black students that lead to their attrition. In presenting this argument, we introduce the Re-Envisioning Culture Network, a multigenerational, interdisciplinary network comprised of higher education administrators, faculty, staff, Black undergraduate students majoring in biology, Black cultural artists, community leaders, and STEM professionals to work together to curate and generate resources and tools that will facilitate change. In introducing the REC Network and disseminating its mission and ongoing endeavors, we generate a clarion call for educators, researchers, STEM professionals, students, and the broader community to join us in this endeavor in fostering transformative change.

AB  - In interdisciplinary Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education, empirical evidence is required that points to the educational contribution of mathematics. Specifically, researchers are not clear how mathematics weaves itself through the STEM education meta-discourse. This article contributes to pedagogical practices in educational institutions where STEM has been newly introduced - What are the perceptions and experiences of South African teachers on interdisciplinary STEM education, and how do mathematics and interdisciplinary STEM discourses leverage each other at schools of specialisation (SoS) in South Africa? Participant teachers were drawn from ten SoS in South Africa. SoS are STEM-dense schools in South Africa's Gauteng Province, the country's industrial and commercial hub. Interview data was collected on teachers' experiences and practices to explore the affordances of Mathematics and other STEM disciplines to influencing curriculum advancement. Situated cognition, mathematics as explorations and flow theory informed this qualitative study. In the findings, technology was regarded as raising learner motivation and mathematical achievement. Important to the study is that participants have a high regard for mathematics' role in interdisciplinary STEM education. In the study, teachers had no autonomy to pursue the STEM agenda, as they were bound to adhere to a prescribed curriculum, which hardly refers to implementation of interdisciplinary STEM education. Various recommendations are proffered, such as maintaining the positive perceptions participants have on the role of mathematics in STEM curricula. The research calls for equality and equity of all the STEM disciplines, as one STEM curricula cannot succeed without the other.

AB  - European advocates of Liberal Arts and Sciences education often claim that this educational model is highly effective at teaching students a range of generic, transferable, or 21st-century skills, which are thought to be vital for success in the labour market of the future. However, there is little empirical research into whether and how these programs do so. This paper examines how European Liberal Arts and Sciences students experience how their programs teach them generic skills. It is based on a significant number of interviews with students from a range of programs across Europe. It concludes that a multidisciplinary curriculum with significant freedom of choice, active student-centred pedagogy with open assessment, and an emphasis on academic community are experienced as key features that foster the development of generic skills. This finding both confirms and expands the current theoretical understanding of generic skills acquisition, as well as yielding several suggestions for how other programs might teach these skills better.

AB  - Incorporating literacy instruction in science is a beneficial practice that uses interdisciplinary strategies to address connections between language arts and science. Interdisciplinary curricular approaches in education are common expectations for science teachers and there are increasingly more mandates for embedding literacy into science curricula. This interdisciplinary program requires the teachers to apply a common methodology and language to instruction. While ideas for lessons and strategies for incorporation of literacy in science are plentiful, the field falls short in providing guidance on assessment of proficiencies in the literacy embedded science instruction. Therefore, it is critical that teachers receive support in creating common learning goals and assessments to ensure appropriate alignment of interdisciplinary curricula. The purpose of this project is to explore the problem that elementary teachers have with assessment when implementing interdisciplinary science and literacy instruction. The project has practical implications for teachers at the primary and secondary level where many times it is easier to teach only one subject, and sometimes teachers have not had training in teaching both subjects. Additionally, even if teaching interdisciplinary science and literacy is done, it is difficult to assess both subjects in one assessment tool. Therefore it is necessary to determine how teachers can not only design the assessment tools, but use them to identify student learning in both literacy and science instruction. This manuscript will provide our analysis of interdisciplinary teaching and assessment strategies, and a compilation of effective assessment strategies that will be useful for other teachers involved in incorporating literacy curricula into science instruction.

AB  - Biodiversity education, as part of a broader environmental education is an important topic, not only for politicians, journalists but also teachers. In the educational context, it is now recognized that students have to be taught biodiversity, its conservation and how to use it in a durable. In this paper, we are interested in assessing how biodiversity, as part of environmental education, is understood and presented in compulsory education textbooks in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. We performed a lexicographic analysis on IRaMuTeQ on the programs of natural science and of humanities and social sciences on all levels of education in compulsory education in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Results show that biodiversity is at the heart of the program. Moreover, the program promotes a scientific approach but also emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinarity by including terms from geography, history, etc.: the environment is widely mentioned, and the impact of human behavior is addressed, notably regarding resource and energy consumption. This analysis shows that the program adopts a holistic vision of the concept of the living, integrating scientific as well as environmental aspects.

AB  - Mathematics is an important nature exploration tool used by all natural sciences. So it is usual that mathematical calculations are part of school science education. But how are these calculations perceived by the learners themselves? What are their attitudes to this part of the teaching process? The answer to this question is important for any teacher who seeks to improve her/his teaching experience. The paper deals with the research of learners' attitudes towards using mathematical calculations within physics lessons. Semantic differential for the sample of 230 primary and secondary school pupils was used in order to determine their attitudes towards this aspect and investigate the influence of grade and gender on the attitudes. The analysis of acquired data shows slightly negative learners' attitude to the mathematical calculations and some particular differences between grades and genders.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: This paper explores the potential value of critical thinking in computer science education and discusses strategies for its integration across the curriculum. Background: As technology rapidly evolves and becomes increasingly integrated into society, there is a growing need for computer science graduates who can think critically about the ethical, societal, and technical implications of their work. Methodology: This study employs a conceptual analysis approach, reviewing existing literature on critical thinking in computer science education and synthesising insights from various sources. The analysis focuses on identifying challenges in implementing critical thinking instruction and proposing practical solutions. Contribution: This paper provides an overview of the current discourse on integrating critical thinking into computer science curricula. It explores the distinction between critical thinking and computational thinking, discusses various pedagogical approaches, and offers insights into potential challenges of implementation. Findings: The paper identifies six key challenges in embedding critical thinking into computer science education. It proposes initial steps to address these challenges, including curriculum redesign, innovative assessment methods, and faculty development strategies. Recommendations for Practitioners: Educators should adopt a balanced approach that complements technical education with critical thinking exercises, using diverse teaching methods such as dialogue-based teaching and authentic instruction. Recommendation for Researchers: Future research should focus on empirical studies to assess the effectiveness of the proposed solutions and develop standardised tools for evaluating critical thinking skills in computer science. Impact on Society: By enhancing critical thinking skills in computer science education, we can produce graduates who are better equipped to address complex technological challenges and their societal implications. Future Research: Further investigation is needed into the most effective pedagogical approaches for teaching critical thinking in computer science, with a focus on multidisciplinary perspectives.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to examine whether, and how, an asynchronous online learning community pedagogical approach can address students' challenge of integrating disciplinary ideas into an interdisciplinary understanding. A quasi-experimental research design was conducted in which 51 undergraduate students were allocated into two groups who learned a similar asynchronous online interdisciplinary course. The two groups differed in the learning mode in which the courses were designed and taught: a learning community (LC) mode for the experimental group, versus an individual learning (IL) mode for the control group. We used a designated rubric to compare the quality of students' interdisciplinary understanding, as expressed in a synthesis essay each student wrote. Findings show that students' abilities to synthesize disciplinary ideas were significantly higher in the LC group. Since synthesis of disciplinary ideas is the goal and essence of interdisciplinarity, we view these findings as indicating a higher quality of interdisciplinary understanding among the LC mode students. This work demonstrates and delineates the potential of the LC approach to promote the development of interdisciplinary understanding in higher-education asynchronous online environments.

AB  - Eponymous terms play an important role in STEM education. This research focuses on the current state of Mendeleev eponyms in the context of education and ethnocentrism, addressing their usage in various languages, their educational value, cases of questioned priority and copyright violation in Mendeleev major eponyms--periodic table and periodic system. 106 chemistry textbooks in 4 languages including Soviet-time and current Russian textbooks were perused to identify and trace Mendeleev eponyms over 1924-2016. Advanced Google Search with queries in Belarusian, English, Latvian, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian was conducted to evaluate online presence of eponyms "Mendeleev periodic table" and "Mendeleev periodic system." It was found that while Mendeleev eponyms occur generously on the Internet, periodic table and system with Mendeleev's name attached are seldom used on non-Russian webpages. Most Mendeleev eponyms were made up in the USSR and remain popular and Russia, which can be explained within the framework of ethnocentrism as a ruling tendency. Recognizing Mendeleev's priority, Flinn and Ross's periodic systems can be considered plagiarized; a few factors might favor their emergence, but ethnocentrism is unlikely to be one of them. Mendeleev eponyms remain valuable assets for science education, acting as shortcuts to the history of science and actualizing interdisciplinary connections. [For the full proceedings, see ED629086.]

AB  - With the widespread adoption of the "Next Generation Science Standards" (NGSS Lead States 2013), science teachers now aspire to integrate engineering into science instruction, as the standards suggest, yet many do not know how. The first steps are to define engineering and identify tasks that incorporate engineering, which can be difficult and confusing. This article presents a simple explanation of engineering and offers a framework to help teachers determine whether a task is based on engineering. The authors also offer examples of how to integrate engineering in Earth science, chemistry, biology, and physics.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to describe how a sustainability-focused program in higher education can provide training and key experiences for implementing transdisciplinary approaches. The case is a fieldwork-based training course called the Global Field Exercise (GFE) at the Graduate Program in Sustainability Science, The University of Tokyo. The GFE is a methodological training course that emphasizes generating locally relevant research questions on sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: This research is a case study regarding how a sustainability science program can offer a fieldwork-based training course that focuses on a transdisciplinary approach. Five students from diverse academic disciplines and cultural backgrounds participated in the GFE in QwaQwa where they conducted semi-structured interviews with six local entrepreneurs to identify the challenges and opportunities of entrepreneurship. The authors investigated the learning process and outcomes of the students through participatory observation in preparatory meetings, daily reflection sessions during fieldwork and a content analysis of feedback reports. Findings: Four learning outcomes of the students were suggested: the reexamination of assumptions, managing misunderstanding and miscommunication, mutual learning and being empathic toward the local people. Research limitations/implications: This paper suggests three key opportunistic experiences for the transdisciplinary approach: discuss the normative dimension of sustainability; build intersubjectivity among team members and adopt methodological pluralism; and become empathetic to diverse stakeholder groups to facilitate the cogeneration of knowledge. Originality/value: How to design training on a transdisciplinary approach in educational programs remains an area for further exploration. This study addresses this knowledge gap by establishing a link between sustainability education and sustainability in practice.

AB  - Children are often denied science education that engages their emotions and multiple identities. This study focused on ways in which embodied arts-based experiences offer opportunities for such engagement in pedagogical efforts associated with justice-centered science. The conceptual framework that informed the study considers the body as a site of learning, embraces social justice in science education and engages with the dialectical relationship between various structures and children's agency, and frames the transdisciplinarity of imagination. The instrumental case study centered on a fifth-grade class of Latinx students in an urban public school, as they grappled with lead contamination and peoples' rights to clean water through an embodied, arts-based pedagogy in their science class. Analysis of video clips, student work, and other artifacts pointed to three findings on how children engaged with justice-centered science learning via arts-based embodied activities. Through perspective-taking in the dramatizing, children engaged with science ideas intertwined with sociopolitical understandings. Through centering emotions that drama afforded, children experienced empathy and solidarity with others affected by environmental injustices. Through imagined and enacted participation in struggles that the embodiments necessitated, children engaged in actions to resist injustices. These findings suggest that exploring children's arts-based embodied meaning making in science is a robust area of inquiry. Furthermore, the findings compel researchers and practitioners to consider emotions in performing arts, and how they can deepen engagement in, and exploration of, justice-centered science. Recommendations emerged for practitioners poised to explore justice-centered science with children through the arts.

AB  - Using their cross-disciplinary review of "Ideas that Work in College Teaching," the authors explore the pedagogical commonalities of fifteen higher education instructors from SUNY Potsdam (State University of New York at Potsdam) in an attempt to reveal the secrets of teaching success across thirteen academic disciplines--math, computer science, geology, modern languages, political science, philosophy, history, biology, psychology, sociology, physics, and art. While the specific instructional disciplines varied considerably in the content that was both studied and presented, the authors found that the principles of effective teaching were quite similar across each of these disciplines. The insights shared by these fifteen accomplished instructors provide pedagogical wisdom that all teachers can learn from regardless of context or developmental age and stage of student capability and competence. Common goals and principles associated with effective teaching in higher education are highlighted using specific examples from individual authors where appropriate. A new model of instruction is then introduced: Attention, Interact, Apply, Invite -- Fact, Think, Feel, Do (AIAI-FTFD), as a potential start-to-finish approach to effective teaching in higher education. Implications for use of the model in both national and international higher education contexts are discussed.

AB  - A goal in chemistry education research and teaching is to make chemistry education inclusive to our diverse students. Ethnography is one approach that can support this goal, because it supports researchers and educators in questioning what is considered ordinary by exploring chemistry as a culture. By exploring chemistry as a culture, we can understand how we represent the discipline of chemistry to our students in what we teach, how we teach, and who we teach. Questioning the ordinary aspects of research and teaching can help us work towards creating a more inclusive chemistry culture for our students, researchers, and instructors. Within this perspective, the authors explore ethnography as a research methodology and an approach to understanding experiences in practice. This perspective explores how different choices in research design, such as the research questions, theoretical framework, methods, and methodology framing, lead to different goals and representations of chemistry culture. This perspective aims to start conversations around what we can learn from different representations of chemistry culture for chemistry practice by questioning what is taken for granted in the learning theories chosen, approaches to interventions, and systematic barriers. In its potential to illuminate how chemistry culture is represented and transmitted to students, ethnography can help create more inclusive, accessible, and supportive spaces for learning and interdisciplinary research.

AB  - Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) are attractive solutions for scaling undergraduate research experiences at primarily undergraduate teaching institutions, where resources for faculty research activities can be limited. The Sustainable Interdisciplinary Research to Inspire Undergraduate Success (SIRIUS) project is a unique program that integrates CUREs, coordinated around a local real-world problem, throughout a biology department's curricula. The CUREs are scaffolded to provide all biology majors with multiple opportunities to engage in scientific investigations as they advance through introductory, intermediate, and advanced courses. In this mixed methods, cross-sectional study, we explore students' perceptions of the authenticity of their experiences as they progress through the SIRIUS CUREs. Triangulated data collected from two instruments indicated that students in advanced courses recognized more involvement in research activities and perceived greater authenticity in the science they were performing compared with introductory and intermediate students. Intermediate and advanced students perceived more opportunities for independence; however, experiences with failure and the influence these experiences had on the perceptions of authenticity was primarily observed with advanced students. This study contributes to the growing literature on CUREs with a focus on students from a primarily undergraduate institution with multiple minority-serving designations.

AB  - Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) are a promising integrated educational tool for customizing formal education using intelligent instruction or feedback. In recent decades, ITSs have transformed teaching and learning and associated research. This study examined the evolution and future trends of ITS research with scientometric methods. First, a dataset comprising 1173 relevant publications was compiled from the Web of Science Core Collection databases (including the Science Citation Index Expanded and the Social Science Citation Index). Then, the publication distributions by time, author, institution, country/region, and knowledge sources were analyzed to reveal the multidisciplinary integration paths. Dataset co-occurrence and co-citation analyses were conducted to identify the most popular research issues, the research chronology, and the emerging trends. It was found that: (1) ITS research has been growing in recent years. According to the Price literature exponential growth curve, this field is still in its initial stage while has high potential; (2) computer science, education, psychology, and engineering were the main ITS research knowledge sources, with ITS social science publications since 2007 being higher than ITS natural sciences publications; (3) interactive learning environments, student modeling, teaching/learning strategies, and machine learning have been the most popular research foci; and (4) the Coh-Metrix, problem-centered instruction, and STEM are the current research trends.

AB  - This article describes teaching science and dance together as part of a university first-year experience. This was done to address educational challenges including engagement and retention of diverse students, development of scientific literacy, and development of creative artistic expression. We describe team teaching "the Art and Science of Dance," where students learn about asking and answering questions through multiple lenses, learn how to do science, and learn how to dance. We assessed student experiences and found that the course challenges all students, but provides a structure where they are able to actively participate in the generation of scientific knowledge and art by the end of their first semester at college. Therefore, we advocate teaching challenging, multidisciplinary courses to first-year students. Dance collaborations seem to be an especially effective way to do this.

AB  - This perspective paper analyses the possibilities and challenges of using cheminformatics as a context for STEM education. The objective is to produce theoretical insights through a SWOT analysis of an authentic educational cheminformatics project where future chemistry teachers engineered a physical 3D model using cheminformatics software and a 3D printer. In this article, engineering is considered as the connective STEM component binding technology (cheminformatics software and databases), science (molecular visualizations), and mathematics (graph theory) together in a pedagogically meaningful whole. The main conclusion of the analysis is that cheminformatics offers great possibilities for STEM education. It is a solution-centered research field that produces concrete artifacts such as visualizations, software, and databases. This is well-suited to STEM education, enabling an engineering-based approach that ensures students' active and creative roles. The main challenge is a high content knowledge demand, derived from the multidisciplinary nature of cheminformatics. This challenge can be solved via training and collaborative learning environment design. Although the work with educational cheminformatics is still in its infancy, it seems a highly promising context for supporting chemistry learning via STEM education.

AB  - Background: Argumentation, that is the coordination of evidence and reasons to support claims, is an important skill for democratic society, developing subject-specific literacies, and can be embedded in multiple school subjects. While argumentation has been extensively researched in science education, interdisciplinary argumentation is less explored, particularly between subjects where collaboration is not the norm, such as science and religious education (RE). Yet everyday issues often involve considering information from multiple sources, such as scientific information or ethical, moral, or religious perspectives. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to better understand students' abilities in argumentation within and across the school subjects of science and RE to inform research and practice of interdisciplinary argumentation. Sample: The participants of this study were 457 students, aged between 11 and 14 years, from 10 secondary schools in England. Following data cleaning, 394 student responses were analysed. Design and Methods: Students completed simultaneous written assessments for argumentation in three tasks which are situated within three different subject contexts: (1) science (2) RE, and (3) an interdisciplinary context which involved argumentation from science and RE. Results: In each of the three contexts, high proportions of students achieve all available marks for identifying claims and evidence. These proportions drop when constructing the link between claim and evidence (warrant) and constructing an evaluative argument. Higher performances were generally noted in the context of science and that students experience particular challenges in argumentation in the RE scenario. Conclusions: This study contributes to our understanding of the challenges and successes of students' argumentation within and across the subjects of science and RE. Implications for both research and practice are discussed.

AB  - This study investigated the implementation of best teaching practices by science graduate teaching assistants [GTAs] (3 chemists and 2 biologists) in five inquiry-based, interdisciplinary chemistry-biology experiments during a six-week professional development (PD) program, Engage PD. Additionally, we examined GTAs' experiences in implementing specific PD aspects. The PD program took place as the GTAs taught sections of biology and chemistry laboratory courses, each comprising five interdisciplinary experiments. The PD aspects included defining expected learning outcomes, subject-matter knowledge, relevance to real-world and chemistry-biology connections, and other active classroom teaching practices. Data were collected through classroom observations, reflection questionnaires, and individual interviews. Findings indicated that 57% of the PD aspects investigated were implemented in the five interdisciplinary experiments. Results also revealed GTAs' initial areas of struggle in implementing specific PD aspects. Perceived implementation difficulties were attributed to individual perceptions and beliefs, and contextual factors. Through practice, continuous feedback, and reflections, most GTAs overcame the hurdles and refined their teaching. Findings imply the need to design training PD programs that offer mentoring and support to GTAs and future faculty in implementing teaching innovations. The teaching context and reflection prompts are helpful in identifying areas of difficulties and how to improve.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to provide physics teachers and physics students with interdisciplinary cultural and scientific related content. The "dombra" is on the one hand a cultural symbol of Kazakhstan with a long tradition. On the other hand, the dombra as a musical instrument is an object of interest in acoustics. The topic can lead to deeper insights into theory of musical instruments and acoustics and to positive motivational effects as well. The idea of this article originated in a guest lecture in physics at Taraz State Pedagogical University (Kazakhstan), where one of the authors introduced physics teacher students to "New Technologies in Physics Education." This course was about good practice examples of integration of mobile devices and their built-in sensors in physics classes. An overview of this innovative educational field is given in Ref. 1. There is a wide range of smartphone-enhanced experiments, from simple hands-on experiments to complex digital data collection and modeling tasks in particular in the field of acoustics.

AB  - Science is a systematic study of natural phenomenon. The natural phenomenon is perceived and understood by an individual based on his/her experience and cultural context. The term misconception is complex in nature and has been conceptualize as alternative conceptions, preconceptions, alternative ideas, conceptual stumbling blocks, erroneous concepts, alternative framework in various contexts by researchers at different level of schooling and geographical locations. Identification of misconception is a challenging task due to various factors such as cultural context, individual differences, teaching-learning processes, students personal experience etc. In the present context of multi and trans-disciplinary subjects, the identification of misconceptions has become essential and gain importance as they are contributing new knowledge and applications in Science and Technology. Hence, in the present paper researchers had made an attempt to analyze the intricacies in identification of misconceptions in biology. The paper heavily relies on secondary source of data. In the present paper researcher has thoroughly reviewed and studied the identifications of misconceptions in the subject biology mixed approaches along with tools, techniques and strategies.

AB  - Collaborative teamwork is fundamental to successful research and is a desirable skill set for employers. Yet students receive little training in how to effectively work in teams. This article presents the preliminary design and implementation of course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) in biology, geology, and environmental engineering in which student teams address questions related to their discipline while contributing to a shared research project. Team science training in communication, research planning, and conflict resolution was embedded into CURE classes at a regional R2 university. Although barriers to this approach were present, evidence in the form of writing prompt scores and team science products suggested student understanding of effective teams and the benefits of working with individuals within and across disciplines to solve complex problems increased.

AB  - Background: Knowledge of quantum computing is arguably inaccessible to many, with knowledge of the complex mathematics involving a particular barrier to entry, creating difficulty in terms of teaching and inclusive learning for those without a high level of mathematics. Meanwhile, it is increasingly important that the knowledge of quantum technologies is accessible to those who work with real-world applications and is taught to the younger generation. Purpose: Resulting from collaborative dialogue between physicists, computer scientists, educationalists, and industrial end users, we propose the concept of quantum literacy as one means of addressing the need for transdisciplinary research in response to the complex problems that we see at the heart of issues around global sustainability. In this way, quantum literacy can contribute to UN Sustainable Development Goal 4, Quality Education. Methods: We introduce a specific puzzle visualization learning tool through which to achieve the pedagogic ends we set out with respect to quantum literacy. Visualization through puzzles can enable non-specialists to develop an intuitive, but still rigorous, understanding of universal quantum computation and provide a facility for non-specialists to discover increasingly complex and new quantum algorithms. Using the Hong-Ou-Mandel optical effect from quantum mechanics, we demonstrate how visual methods such as those made possible through the puzzle visualization tool can be very useful for understanding underlying complex processes in quantum physics and beyond and therefore support the aims of quantum literacy. Conclusion: We argue that quantum literacy, as defined here, addresses the challenges of learning within a highly bounded discipline and of access to the kind of powerful knowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners. We therefore argue for the importance of addressing pedagogic issues when powerful knowledge consists of dense concepts, as well as complex and hierarchical relations between concepts, in addition to presenting a strong barrier to entry in the form of mathematics.

AB  - Technological progress, globalization and demographic changes have brought about transformations that have increased economic and social inequalities. A structural transformation in education could support economic growth and sustainability and could also be associated with common actions in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, together with social sciences, to mitigate the impact of these megatrends on inequalities. This research explores the effects of a technologically conceptualized transdisciplinary educational approach. A sample of 242 lower secondary school students was selected and a pre- and post-test research design was used to ascertain whether a two-level transdisciplinary educational approach used by technology teachers affected the development of students' technological literacy (TL). The task design included several real-life technological contexts and concepts wherein knowledge of other disciplines was needed to solve problems, create new knowledge and acquire higher-order skills while developing positive attitudes towards sustainable technology. A two-way analysis of variance indicated several significant effects of transdisciplinary education on the development of students' TL. These findings provide valuable insights into the nature of TL acquisition as a basis for curriculum design and the implementation of transdisciplinary technology education in the lower secondary school.

AB  - The importance of engaging students with complex societal challenges has led to the adoption of various interdisciplinary teaching and learning practices in both K-12 and higher education. However, interdisciplinary learning is one of the most complex domains of contemporary educational practice, and, despite its significance, remains significantly undertheorized and under-researched. This Special Issue highlights empirical research efforts toward understanding interdisciplinary learning in its complexity. It simultaneously aims to (1) advance ecological perspectives that encompass concepts and methodologies for studying complex heterogeneous learning practices and (2) apply these perspectives to the research of interdisciplinary learning - of how people learn across and beyond disciplines. This introduction provides a historical context for interdisciplinary learning, introduces an ecological stance toward researching learning across and beyond disciplines, and reviews critical theoretical and methodological challenges within interdisciplinary learning, arguing that the field of the learning sciences is well-positioned to address these challenges. It discusses how the contributions presented in this special issue shed light on theoretical, methodological, empirical, and design aspects of interdisciplinary learning and offer a basis for further design work and research.

AB  - Pigments are light-absorbing substances that are abundant in nature, serving roles in coloration, camouflage, mate/pollinator attraction and photosynthesis among higher life forms. Among microbial organisms, pigments can also be found in a wide range of phyla. While some of these pigments function in photosynthesis, namely among algae and some bacteria, the great majority of microbial pigments play entirely different roles. The exploratory study presented here will stimulate students to think about the cost and benefit of a heritable trait (pigment production) of microscopic organisms and its effects on survival in a competitive and hostile environment. Exploring and understanding the roles these pigments play allows for a number of cross-disciplinary learning opportunities that combine physics, chemistry, biology and even art, and can be set up as an inquiry-based learning module suitable for small-group and active learning experiences.

AB  - The climate emergency mandates a refocusing of society and education on the relationship between humans and the more-than-human world. Emerging from decades of social constructionism that openly promoted climate science denial, social and educational theorising now engages with new materialist philosophies and the agency of matter. Physicist Karen Barad's book Meeting the Universe Halfway, cited over 13,000 times, offers an ontological foundation for new materialism based on her idiosyncratic application of quantum physics. While critically reviewing Barad, I found myself unexpectedly "sliding back down" into the terrain of my physicist pastime, rereading quantum mechanics in depth. I reflect here on how this "ontological detour" empowered me to "climb up a ladder" towards the theoretical foundation for my PhD project in climate change education. I argue that ontological grounding and cross-disciplinary engagement are vital for advancing research and gaining perspectives through lateral connections.

AB  - One of the main goals of lower division "service" mathematics courses is to provide STEM-intending students with opportunities to engage in activities and contexts that can support their efforts to apply the mathematical ideas they are learning to successive major courses. The Mathematics Association of America has supported many mathematicians' efforts to ask partner discipline faculty what topics and habits of mind they feel should be covered in mathematics classes to prepare them for their subsequent classes. We add to this work with a twist: Instead of asking physics faculty what they want students to know, we analyzed videos that students in an introductory physics class created so that we could ask ourselves what mathematical practices were most and least prevalent in the students' physics problem-solving efforts. A qualitative analysis of the results, which we present here, indicated that most students were proficient in math practices involving problem setup and that the majority were able to apply mathematical concepts such as trigonometry and the solving of algebraic equations. However, only 44% of the student groups concluded their explanations by discussing answer reasonability and only 18% conducted a unit analysis to determine if their answers were applicable to the context of the problems assigned, even though both of these elements are important components of the overall sensemaking process. This report presents examples that illustrate these results and concludes with implications for teaching both entry-level mathematics and physics courses by modeling productive problem-solving and sensemaking practices.

AB  - While the great scientists of the past recognized a need for a multidisciplinary approach, today's schools often treat math and science as subjects separate from the rest. This not only creates a disinterest among students, but also a potential learning gap once students reach college and then graduate into the workforce. "Cases on Research-Based Teaching Methods in Science Education" addresses the problems currently facing science education in the USA and the UK, and suggests a new hands-on approach to learning. This book is an essential reference source for policymakers, academicians, researchers, educators, curricula developers, and teachers as they strive to improve education at the elementary, secondary, and collegiate levels. Following a foreword, preface, and acknowledgment, this book contains the following sections and chapters: Section 1: Curricula Changes: (1) Making Sense of Science: A Review in Scottish Further Education (Nancy El-Farargy); (2) Developing Scientific Literacy: Introducing Primary-Aged Children to Atomic-Molecular Theory (Jennifer Donovan and Carole Haeusler); (3) Implementing the Understanding by Design Framework in Higher Education (Judy Alhamisi, Blanche Jackson Glimps, and Chukwunyere E. Okezie); (4) Martial Arts and Physics: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Increase Student Engagement and Interest in the Sciences (Eugenie de Silva); and (5) The Inclusion of Multidisciplinary Research in Science Teaching: A Novel Teaching Method (Eugene de Silva, Eugenie de Silva, Jeffrey Horner, and Pamela Knox. Section 2: Content Presentation: (6) Developing a Research-Informed Teaching Module for Learning about Electrical Circuits at Lower Secondary School Level: Supporting Personal Learning about Science and the Nature of Science (Keith S Taber, Kenneth Ruthven, Neil Mercer, Fran Riga, Riikka Hofmann, and Stefanie Luthman); and (7) Presenting Physics Content and Fostering Creativity in Physics among Less-Academically Inclined Students through a Simple Design-Based Toy Project (Nazir Amir and R. Subramaniam).

AB  - The way science education is positioned and practised in New Zealand primary schools varies widely. In this qualitative case study, participants in senior management from five Auckland primary schools were asked how they perceived science, how it was taught and reasons for the pedagogical approaches chosen. It was clear all schools were different in terms of population and the pedagogical approaches used to teach science. Science was taught in a range of configurations--from siloed to transdisciplinary integrative approaches and by classroom teachers, specialists and outside providers. The schools in this study who saw 'science as everywhere' and practised collaborative teaching were more likely to teach science through integration.

AB  - Despite its popularity in education studies literature, interdisciplinary science education is mostly considered outside the multitude of social forces that drive education reform. This has contributed to a mythologizing of interdisciplinary science education and lead to assumptions about the necessity of its intervention into science education practice. This research constructs a critical analysis of interdisciplinary science education by exploring a philosophical understanding of the relations between scientific disciplines, investigating discourse about interdisciplinarity in science education policy literature, and provides socioeconomic context for this reform movement. In particular, Louis Althusser's theory of ideology as material force, his conception of the spontaneous philosophy of scientists, and his theses on the ideological nature of interdisciplinary science are foundational to this critique. Althusser's contributions allow for critical reflection on interdisciplinarity and the effects of promoting it throughout scientific enterprise. Viewing interdisciplinary science education through this critical lens allows for demarcating the ideological narratives of reformist discourse from the intended outcomes of reform. This investigation elucidates the intervention of interdisciplinarity as an ideological force governing the reproduction of scientific labor, with intended downstream socioeconomic effects, such as shifting science labor from the public sector to private industry to accommodate for austerity. The conclusions of this analysis advocate for historical materialist methodologies in science education research and critical education studies, while emphasizing the role of ideology in socioeconomic reproduction.

AB  - Faculty in the Chemistry and Environmental Science programs at St. Mary's University in San Antonio, Texas, collaborated to develop an undergraduate course in Field-Based Environmental Chemistry. The course was developed and implemented as a 2-semester, 1-semester, and online, synchronous course offered during the 2020/21 COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the course, chemistry and environmental science majors designed and executed a sampling and laboratory analysis plan for monitoring the physical and chemical conditions of soil and/or water in a local, urban setting. As part of a goal to help students develop communication skills, they presented their work to stakeholders from the local community. Through participation in an active learning model, students demonstrated significant gains in the student learning outcomes. Students in the 2-semester sequence showed gains in their understanding of the scientific process, more comfort with the uncertainty and the ambiguity of natural environments, and appreciation for the importance of statistics in data analysis. The online course and COVID-19 pandemic restrictions did not allow for student field or laboratory work but did engage students in a project typical of a work environment.

AB  - Successfully creating and implementing interdisciplinary curricula in introductory science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses is challenging, but doing so is increasingly more important as current problems in science become more interdisciplinary. Opening up the silos between science disciplines and overcoming common institutional barriers (cost, limited time, need to deliver specific course content, and lack of faculty commitment) is possible by bringing students together from different science courses to discuss interesting interdisciplinary problems. This article describes the mobilization and implementation of a community-oriented Interdisciplinary Science Seminar (ISS) that adds interdisciplinary content to traditional introductory science courses without a significant investment of additional resources. In addition, increased faculty collaboration on interdisciplinary curriculum was achieved, and a second new student-oriented interdisciplinary science program was created.

AB  - The public's growing interest in epigenetics, particularly its applications in human health, underscores the significance of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating gene activity and promoting phenotypic diversity without altering DNA sequences. Within the framework of the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis, epigenetics is regarded as a non-genetic contributor to evolution. The EPIBOOST project, "BOOSting excellence in environmental EPIgenetics," investigates epigenetic changes induced by contaminants in aquatic organisms and aims to enhance public understanding of epigenetics through science outreach videos. A multidisciplinary team comprising Biology, Education, and Design researchers produced the video "What is Epigenetics?" using a design-based research methodology and a design thinking approach. This process involved storyboard design, audio recording, image production, video editing, testing, refinement, and public dissemination. The interactive development of the storyboard and script aimed to efficiently communicate the significance of epigenetics, fostering public understanding of this emerging research area through an effective science communication strategy. This paper focuses on the development process for the first video, which aims to promote public awareness of epigenetics using the AEIOU framework (Awareness, Enjoyment, Interest, Opinions, and Understanding) to elucidate epigenetic concepts such as DNA methylation, gene expression, and phenotype, and their integration in environmental assessment frameworks.

AB  - Additions to the popular evaporation rate determination laboratory of alcohol-based hand-rub sanitizers are described here. Significantly, inquiry-driven protocols for formulating hand-rub sanitizers, falling-ball viscometry, and sanitizer efficacy are included. Incorporation of familiar substances ("molecular relevance") enables students to assimilate knowledge and connect to and recognize interrelated disciplines. To stimulate engagement and project ownership, students were given the opportunity to alter sanitizer formulations by varying the amount and molecular weight of the gelling agent. Viscosities were determined using a falling-ball viscometer to integrate physics and fluid dynamics concepts into these experiments. Lastly, to stress microbiological applications and determine the efficacy of their hand sanitizers, students tested the formulated hand sanitizers for qualitative efficacy using agar plating of skin secretions and comparing colonies formed from sanitized versus nonsanitized hands. Chemistry students with diverse interests recognized links across disciplinary boundaries (e.g., increased their awareness of physical properties of hand sanitizers and the relationship of molecular-scale phenomena to these properties). This three-hour laboratory provides an interdisciplinary supplement directly designed for freshman chemistry and engineering chemistry undergraduates and increases integration among biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics.

AB  - Research into Australian students' science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) engagement has highlighted that there are comparably fewer women enrolling in STEM programs and working in STEM industries. In Australia, males make up 84% of the total population with STEM qualifications, for example, a report in 2015 found only 13% of all engineers in Australia were women. Science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM), an approach to STEM education that encourages interdisciplinarity, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship, is a strategy that has the potential to increase girls' engagement with STEM. This research investigated the impact of the STEAMpunk Girls Program, funded by the Australian Government, on high school girls' learning and their teachers' teaching experiences. The program uses project-learning and design thinking strategies to enable the girls to gain confidence in themselves as change-makers with the capacity to generate solutions to real-world problems. Using a mixed method approach, the findings indicated that teachers and students were positive about the STEAMpunk Girls' experience, with significant increases in confidence and motivation in the girls at the end of the program.

AB  - The (STEM)[superscript 2] Network (Sustainable, Transformative Engagement across a Multi-Institution/Multidisciplinary STEM Network) is a National Science Foundation Research Coordination Network-Undergraduate Biology Education funded project intended to bridge disciplinary and institutional silos that function as barriers to systemic change in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in higher education. We utilized three foundational frameworks to develop an adaptable model that we posit is applicable across contexts. The model includes a core infrastructure that, combined with intentional self-reflection, results in an adaptable design that can be tailored to individual institutions, contexts, and goals. Herein, we describe the inception of the network, the foundational theoretical frameworks that guide network development and growth, and detail network structure and operations with the intention of supporting others in creating their own networks. We share the nuts and bolts of how we developed the (STEM)[superscript 2] Network, and include a supplemental network development planning guide to support others in utilizing the (STEM)[superscript 2] Network model to reach their own objectives.

AB  - The lack of an instructional definition of bioinformatics delays its effective integration into biology coursework. Using an iterative process, our team of biologists, a mathematician/computer scientist, and a bioinformatician together with an educational evaluation and assessment specialist, developed an instructional definition of the discipline: Bioinformatics is "an interdisciplinary field that is concerned with the development and application of algorithms that analyze biological data to investigate the structure and function of biological polymers and their relationships to living systems." The field is defined in terms of its two primary foundational disciplines, biology and computer science, and its interdisciplinary nature. At the same time, we also created a rubric for assessing open-ended responses to a prompt about what bioinformatics is and how it is used. The rubric has been shown to be reliable in successive rounds of testing using both common percent agreement (89.7%) and intraclass correlation coefficient (0.620) calculations. We offer the definition and rubric to life sciences instructors to help further integrate bioinformatics into biology instruction, as well as for fostering further educational research projects.

AB  - Julie Thompson Klein's contributions to interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research have enriched the way collaboration is discussed and handled by introducing concepts of boundary work and boundary crossing from the field of Science and Technology Studies. In recent years, she has been integrating those concepts into crossdisciplinarity, an effort culminating in the development of a framework for a forthcoming book ("Beyond Interdisciplinarity: Boundary Work, Collaboration, and Communication in the 21st Century"). With her permission, we have used an earlier version of her framework to analyze boundary work and boundary crossing in transdisciplinary sustainable water management projects in Australia and Switzerland. The aim of using the framework has been twofold: to explore and assess the heuristic value of the framework, i.e. how it improves our conceptualization of boundary work in the two projects, and to examine the framework itself, i.e. whether some of the seven concepts involved are hard to work with or should be further developed.

AB  - Background: Course-based research experiences (CBREs) are highly valued for science learning and research. Most are discipline-centered, but there is a great deal of interest in developing them to promote interdisciplinarity. Yet, we have much to learn about how CBREs work, and even more to learn about how disciplinary diversity operates as an element of design to promote learning and research. Method: This mixed methods case study triangulates data on student experience, research networks, research artifacts and fieldnotes from participant observation to understand how disciplinary diversity factors into productive engagement for learning and research in an interdisciplinary course-based research experience (I-CBRE). Findings: A common boundary object (scientific paper) mediated developmental interactions among individuals both within and beyond the course. The boundary object also facilitated the productive engagement of students as instrumental actors in broader interdisciplinary research networks. Contribution: This study shows how an "object tracing" approach can be used to examine productivity in disciplinarily diverse scientific contexts, and reveals some of the distinctly syncretic moves that participants deploy to make progress as learners and researchers. Extending work by Engel and Conant, the study emphasizes the importance of designing for "productive syncretic engagement" in research experiences characterized disciplinary diversity.

AB  - This laboratory exercise integrates chemistry and biology concepts to give third/fourth-year undergraduate students an opportunity to apply knowledge from different subject areas to address a real-world biomedical issue such as pathogen inhibition using composite materials. It involves the preparation of a bacteria-derived cellulosic biopolymer through microbial cultivation, impregnation of the bacterial cellulose(BC) with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), followed by the analysis of the materials and the antimicrobial properties of the biomaterial-AgNPs composites. The methods are relatively simple and use inexpensive chemicals. A Tollens type approach is adopted to produce silver nanoparticles-bacterial cellulose (AgNPs-BC) composites by the reduction of [Ag­(NH[subscript 3])[subscript 2]]+ complex embedded in the cellulose matrix. The samples were dried by two different methods: freeze-drying or vacuum-drying. The dried AgNPs-BC films were evaluated for antimicrobial properties against a test organism, in this example, "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", a Gram-negative biosafety containment level 2 (BSL 2) bacterium, using an agar diffusion test. For additional flexibility and customization, options for dividing the chemistry/biology content of this laboratory into smaller units with an emphasis on characterization techniques of nanomaterials for chemistry majors are also discussed.

AB  - There are strong classroom ties between mathematics and the sciences of physics and chemistry, but those ties seem weaker between mathematics and biology. Practicing biologists realize both that there are interesting mathematics problems in biology, and that viewing classroom biology in the context of another discipline could support students' development of biology understanding (as mathematics does for physics and chemistry). The Biology Levers Out Of Mathematics study, implemented in public and private schools throughout a metropolitan area in the northeastern United States, tackles this challenge by introducing engineering as a bridge connecting the heretofore isolated silos of classroom mathematics and biology. This study presents engineering design methods for students to use in the posing of biology problems that mathematics then makes possible to resolve. Interviews with teachers and observations of students suggest that this approach makes the understanding of inheritance processes accessible to a wide range of the study's participants.

AB  - This article examines the intersection of environmental justice and undergraduate chemistry education through a review of existing publications that highlight successful strategies for chemistry educators interested in incorporating environmental justice into their classrooms. It emphasizes the key roles of racial and social justice in the Environmental Justice movement and their connection to the shift toward diversity, equity, inclusion, and respect in chemistry education today. Five co-operative educational strategies are exemplified through established project- and problem-based learning examples, which include class-level as well as department and community-level projects. These projects demonstrate how powerful chemical content knowledge, socio-philosophical framing, eco-reflexivity, sustainable schooling and living, and student experience and engagement can all contribute to the successful teaching of environmental justice in chemistry. On the basis of its interdisciplinary nature, incorporating environmental justice involves providing the opportunity for students to develop their social agency and holding space and respect for those who have different cultural identities and/or come from historically marginalized backgrounds. The enrichment of existing chemistry curriculum through topics of environmental justice contributes to the achievement of the overall goal to graduate responsible, ethical, and compassionate members of the community from educational institutions.

AB  - Course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) exposes an entire class of students to scientific research and is thought to increase students' knowledge retention in science, technology, engineering and mathematics education. Microbial engineering is an interdisciplinary subject that combines science and engineering. We transformed a microbial engineering course into a CURE-type course by adopting an interest-oriented case teaching approach. Based on an investigation of the interest of students, which showed that the topics related to food and health were students' favourites, we selected beer brewing, glutamate fermentation and Monascus cultivation as teaching topics. To simulate the reality of industrial fermentation, pilot-scale fermentation equipment was selected and installed. The course focused on fermentation research; most of the time was spent on performing experiments, and theoretical lectures were held at the intervals. To complete the course in 10 days, three series of experiments were alternatively carried out, and students took turns to conduct fermentation control and process analyses in groups. A questionnaire survey showed that students were satisfied with the CURE-type course, their fermentation knowledge and engineering skills were improved, their research abilities were developed, and their scientific attitudes were cultivated. CURE-type courses are worth popularising in biology teaching.

AB  - This article seeks to provide a framework for recognizing and realizing the pedagogical potential of arts-science integration in early childhood. Herein, I present five ways of positioning arts vis-à-vis science and associate them with different learning opportunities. I have analyzed if and how these positionings come into play in teachers' documentation of arts-science projects conducted in eight Swedish preschool groups (children aged 1 to 5 years). These teachers positioned arts and science as "disciplinary distinct" (associated with acquiring and communicating knowledge in the respective subjects), as "multifaceted" (producing multidimensional knowledge), and as "entangled" (empathizing with human and nonhuman others). In addition, I discuss if and how teachers can position arts and science as "inquiry oriented" (investigating and identifying patterns) and "disciplinary transcendent" (solving problems in transdisciplinary ways). I suggest that teachers draw on these findings to plan and analyze integrated arts-science education in practice.

AB  - In classrooms worldwide, the use of English to teach science subjects is becoming increasingly common. There is an increasing number of English-as-a-second/foreign-language learners studying science in English. This review examines 66 empirical studies on this topic published from 2000 to 2021. We critically review and synthesise evidence of the language challenges faced by teachers and students in secondary and tertiary English medium instruction (EMI) science courses, as well as proposed coping strategies. By adopting a multidisciplinary approach, we examine our findings from three fields of research: science education, language policy and applied linguistics. Our study extends EMI research by combining language learning and canonical content learning. Our synthesis of previous findings enhances understanding of content teaching in a second/foreign language in language immersion classrooms (e.g. content and language integrated learning, content-based instruction) and provides evidence-based pedagogical suggestions for enhancing EMI science teachers' instructional practices worldwide.

AB  - The intersection of Data Science (DS) and Library and Information Science (LIS) is rapidly developing, with a notable need for ongoing transdisciplinary training between practitioners in these two fields. The LIS Education and Data Science Integrated Network Group (LEADING) fellowship program and its ancillary community of practice (CoP) showcase a unique response to this continuing learning need. In order to assess the impact of the fellowship and CoP, this study utilized a sequential mixed methods design, which adapted the value creation framework (VCF) to examine participants' engagement with, and their perceived value of, their LEADING experience. Using the five indicators of the VCF (immediate, potential, applied, realized, transformative) and DEI-centered values, the study results show clear evidence of themes that are reported in the literature as highly influential in CoP value perception (connectedness, emotional engagement, and community values).

AB  - Peer observation of teaching has been adopted as a method to improve the quality of teaching. It involves observers providing descriptive feedback to their peers on learning and teaching practices. However, although extensively described in the literature in the education field, its use as a tool for development beyond teaching skills has not been explored deeply, nor the best practices described. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare quantitative with qualitative peer observation, as well as to investigate the role of interdisciplinarity in the observation process. The present study results from experimental observation work carried out by four professors of higher education. Veterinary science, social work, pharmaceutical sciences, and education, the disciplinary areas of origin of the teachers, were the ecosystems in which the initial observation techniques were explored and applied, and the intention was to share good practices and pedagogical improvements through peer support. This study reports the experience of building an observation grid and its application, as well as the lessons learned during the observation experience. The aim was to evaluate whether the constructive criticism was focused on the pedagogical practices rather than on the content, which can be useful in understanding if the learning objectives are being attained, from the teacher's point of view. As such, we employed and assessed peer observation as a constructive, developmental process for higher education teachers from different fields of knowledge. The study concludes that feedback by peers is essential for the development of professional practice in higher education teaching, with the experience of qualitative observation being a fundamental path for teacher self-reflection in the search for their own authenticity. It further supports the notion that interdisciplinary differences, methodologies, styles, contexts, and practices can be used in a constructive way to improve course content and delivery, and, ultimately, to reinforce good teaching.

AB  - In a three-year, practice-based, creative research project, the team designed a video game for undergraduate biology students that aimed to find the right balance between educational content and entertainment. The project involved 7 faculty members and 14 undergraduate students from biological science, design, computer science, and music. This nontraditional approach to research was attractive to students. Working on an interdisciplinary practice-based research project required strategies related to timeline, recruitment, funding, team management, and mentoring. Although this project was time-consuming and full of challenges, it created meaningful learning experiences not only for students but also for faculty members.

AB  - In German primary schools, natural sciences and social studies are learned and taught in an integrative manner within a subject called Sachunterricht. To teach Sachunterricht in a high-quality manner, it is reasonable to assume that primary school teachers themselves require-- among other things, such as knowledge about pedagogy, teaching Sachunterricht, and the various content areas of Sachunterricht--a distinct interest, academic self-concept, and sense of belonging regarding natural and social sciences. Furthermore, they should possess a solid interdisciplinary competence that enables them to teach natural and social sciences in an integrative way. In the present study, we conducted a longitudinal survey of pre-service primary school teachers from a German university over a period of 2 years to investigate the changes in their (self-evaluated) interdisciplinary competence; the changes in their interest, academic self-concept, and sense of belonging regarding natural and social sciences; and the correlations between these constructs. Our data analysis revealed a decrease over time in participants' sense of belonging to natural and social sciences, as well as their (self-evaluated) interdisciplinary competence, while their academic self-concept in natural and social sciences remained stable. Participants' interest in social sciences decreased, while their interest in natural sciences increased. Moreover, we found varying degrees of correlation between these constructs. In summary, the results of the present study provide important insights into the professional development of pre-service primary school teachers within university-based teacher education for teaching natural and social sciences in primary school. The implications of these findings are discussed in detail at the end of this paper.

AB  - Hydraulic fracturing ('fracking'), like other complex social and environmental issues, is a controversy about science which raises educational questions about how best to prepare young people to understand, respond to and, where necessary, act (or not) in response. It raises political questions. We present a state-of-the-art review of research literature on fracking and education using systematic strategies, with a view to finding out how it is framed in educational situations and how politics enters the science classroom. This serves as an illustrative case of how contested scientific and technological interventions with implications for the environment and society are treated in school science. The review is supplemented by interviews with 10 teachers of science and engineering working in schools or colleges near sites of operational exploratory fracking. We find that the research literature on teaching hydraulic fracturing is sparse, with only 25 studies relating to teaching and learning about fracking. Few studies (n = 7) relate to high school education. Where it features in science education, fracking is used as a context for interdisciplinarity and critical thinking, and lends itself to approaches using discussion, dialogue and modelling. Outcomes from fracking education range include knowledge gains and critical thinking. Teachers interviewed tended not to see a place for fracking in the curriculum or in the classroom and were averse to including politics in upper high school science education. Our analysis suggests depoliticization through absence of this specific complex environmental issue from the public (education) sphere, reinforced by the desire for 'balance' in high school science education and instrumental approaches to science education which prioritize assessed learning outcomes. Dealing with complex social and environmental issues such as hydraulic fracturing in the years of compulsory science schooling is necessary because scientific knowledge is necessary but not sufficient to prepare young people for the critical scientific literacy required to meet sustainable development goals. There is a need to assess and respond to the educational needs of local communities affected by industrial interventions such as fracking. These findings are likely to be relatable to other issues where there are local and global consequences of action or inaction and where the environment and health are pitted against economic and energy demands.

AB  - This paper describes the results of a comparative study into the approaches used by science undergraduates when solving open-ended problems. This study adopted a pseudo-grounded theory framework to analyse six case studies, one from each of the science disciplines studied. The study involved 70 participants from 5 institutions solving open-ended problems using a think-aloud protocol. Analysis of the data identified a number of different approaches used by each subject group. Participants in psychology, pharmacy and sports rehabilitation used a greater number of novice-like approaches than participants in chemistry, physics and interdisciplinary science. The approaches used by physical science participants were very similar whereas those from pharmacy, sports rehabilitation and psychology were more varied and relied on students' ability to relate to a familiar context. Evaluation of the relative quality of solutions showed variation with discipline.

AB  - Robots are useful tools for teaching mathematics and physics and engineering subjects in K-12 setting; they can be utilized in classrooms for explaining difficult and complex concepts because they capture the imagination of students. Rapid developments robotics technology in recent decade, institutions and researchers have employed robots to support K-12 education. Furthermore, Educators are increasingly interested in the potential of robots in education for learners. Due to its multidisciplinary nature, robots are considered a gateway to STEM education. Researchers in educational field are looking answers of Can robots in classroom reshape K-12 STEM education, and foster new ways of learning? In the present study, IT and Technology & Design Teachers' views on utilizing robots in instruction was investigated. Furthermore, teachers' willingness to use robots in diverse learning settings. The findings of the research revealed that most of the teachers were not employed robots in their teaching. However, overwhelm majority participants expressed their willingness of using robots in their education specifically in STEM education. Teachers reported that robots can be utilized as an instructional support tool in the classroom. [For the complete proceedings, see ED631021.]

AB  - The article investigates how and when the two first movers in knowledge-based regulation -- the OECD and the World Bank -- developed policy brokerage as an instrument of global governance in the education sector. We also examine how their target clientele -- national governments -- responds to this instrument. Given the surplus of research evidence in today's digital economy, intergovernmental organisations have the challenge of standing out as trusted and credible knowledge brokers in a crowded space. The authors make the case for a comparative research programme -- tentatively labeled 'Governance by Numbers 2.0' -- that is informed by a multidisciplinary (history, political science, interdisciplinary policy studies) interpretive framework and that advances a transnational, relational method of inquiry which draws attention to the global/national nexus.

AB  - Despite growing advocacy of interdisciplinary approaches to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), there are persistent concerns about the practical and principled epistemic bases on which this can be justified as a mainstream curricular practice. A major issue concerns the nature of interrelations between the STEM disciplines in interdisciplinary work. In the paper, we argue that the spatial metaphor prevalent in discussions of interdisciplinarity, and boundary crossing, while useful, has limitations in capturing the challenges and possibilities for interdisciplinary STEM in schools and in some respects misconstrues the cultural and historical nature of disciplinary epistemic practices. We argue, as a contribution to a theory of interdisciplinary curricular practice, that key issues for such practice can be productively seen through a temporal metaphor and that a temporal model can usefully inform schools and teachers in framing and supporting student learning in interdisciplinary settings. To illustrate this, we use indicative cases from two major Australian STEM initiatives to examine temporal relations between mathematics, science and technology, at the micro-, meso- and macro-levels, and the implications of this for disciplinary integrity. Finally, we argue that contemporary interdisciplinary advocacy amounts to a challenge to renew epistemic traditions in the STEM subjects.

AB  - This book is a transdisciplinary, international collection situated within a genealogy of experimental walking practices in the arts, arts-based research, and emergent walking practices in education. It brings together emerging cartographies of relation amongst walking practices ranging across arts-based, ecological, activist, decolonising, queer, critical and posthuman modes of inquiry. Its particular investment is in the proliferation of artful modes of inquiry that open up speculative practices and concepts of walking as an orientation for pedagogy, inquiry, and the everyday, resisting the gaze of privilege and the relentless commodification of human and nonhuman life processes. This is important work for the burgeoning demand for creative methodologies in the social sciences, and more specifically, for arts-based educational research.

AB  - The present study sheds light on transdisciplinary education through the application of a scoping literature review, as a lack of a comprehensive synthesis in this area is evident. Thus, the overview frames and outlines the scattered research that has been fulfilled until now in this field. As a result, within transdisciplinary education, medical and adolescent themes form the main scopes, while within sustainable transdisciplinary education, pedagogical design, socio-efficiency, and philosophy are the major themes. Furthermore, the present study contributes to the understanding of transdisciplinary education by highlighting the avenues for future research. Consequently, the translation of transdisciplinary teaching practices to comparable languages and an increase of transparency in the application and reporting of the transdisciplinary design steps are suggested.

AB  - A two-part workshop connecting environmental science topics and green chemistry principles for undergraduate students is described. Students first collect acorns and rusted metal for dye and mordant baths. After 2 weeks they are invited back to tie-dye cotton fabric using dye baths prepared from steeped acorns and modify these colors using mordant solutions. This workshop allows students to evaluate how using different renewable food or nonfood biomass feedstocks (acorn seeds vs cupules) can create different impacts across chemistry and environmental science. During the workshop, students examine the role of acorns as part of local food systems, and the impacts iron mordants have on fabric dyed with natural tannins, and they design a tie-dye pattern. This activity is well-suited for the fall, when acorns drop from oak trees, and it invites students to come together for interdisciplinary hands-on activities. It serves to highlight green chemistry through the use of renewable and waste feedstocks and uses systems thinking activities to address the potential impacts of selecting different biomass feedstocks. By exploring connections between science and our local environments and the relevance, beauty, and utility of natural renewable chemicals, students from different backgrounds are better able to discuss important connections between green chemistry and environmental science.

AB  - Instructional design focuses on solving problems in a multitude of contexts. As such, designers are investigators, gathering evidence to optimally design solutions to learning problems within the identified context. The challenge described in this case study was the need to create an educational activity to promote interaction and collaboration among an interdisciplinary participant group comprised of physicians, radiobiologists, and radiation physicists. Based on the premise that interdisciplinary medical research collaboration requires a shared understanding of authentic problems from multiple perspectives, this design research case documents the design and implementation of an online case study incorporating collaborative inquiry in interdisciplinary teams with the intended outcome of building or strengthening interdisciplinary communication skills. Contextual factors--including the design team and design process--influencing the design of the activity are documented. Results indicate that using an interactive online case study as the basis for collaborative inquiry in small, interdisciplinary teams followed by a summative, large group discussion resulted in (1) evidence-based treatment decisions based on the data supplied in the case study and (2) participation of all disciplines in team interactions. Outcomes also indicated the building or strengthening of interdisciplinary communication skills and the understanding of the value and contribution of all three fields to radiation oncology treatment resulted in the participation of the online case study.

AB  - The science education community is deeply invested in growing the next generation of scientists. One way to do this is through evidence-based interventions that support the motivation and performance of students in introductory classes. The literature is replete with interdisciplinary research presenting such interventions. Unfortunately, the process of developing and evaluating pedagogical practices is not the same as the process required to scale those efforts into actual university classrooms. Efforts to spread the word about successful practices often move slowly, through relatively small personal and professional networks. We present a complementary proactive strategy designed to raise awareness of one exemplar intervention across a broad swath of U.S. biology faculty. Our 30-minute anonymous engagement (in three 10-minute asynchronous virtual sessions) resulted in this particular intervention being adopted in some form by more than 4 in 10 faculty who learned about it, reaching an estimated 7,500 students across the United States. We describe the three phases of our intervention adoption process, each informed by social psychology theories of persuasion and decision-making, and provide a detailed guide and ready-to-use resources to replicate the process using other evidence-based interventions ready for scale.

AB  - Chemistry education has been affected in various aspects, especially teaching models, teaching technology, curriculum design, and teaching assessment, in Chinese Mainland since COVID-19 struck. To explore the change in teaching performance and differences in those teaching performances between middle school teachers and university teachers, this study analyzes 46 chemical education journal articles in three academic levels, including Junior High School (JHS), Senior High School (SHS), and university through content analysis method. The result shows that all levels of chemistry teachers (CTs) prefer to adopt two teaching models (live teaching or a combination of live and recorded teaching) and use Tencent Meeting as a teaching platform, but, university chemistry professors can integrate some software (MOOC and WeiXin as well as QQ) into their class to improve the effectiveness of teaching. As for curriculum design and teaching assessment, university teachers can employ the news in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to carry out teaching more deeply than middle school teachers because university students learn more professional chemistry knowledge, but, all of them tend to evaluate students promptly (like oral assessment) through classroom interaction. Thus, it suggests the government and the school develop educational applications/software and teaching resources and a diverse curriculum to enhance online teaching work both domestically and foreign. And, it is also suggested that teachers should actively participate in the training of educational technology and strengthen cooperation with teachers in other disciplines to build interdisciplinary classrooms.

AB  - Scientific literacy is an important skill for students' success, given the characteristics of today's society. However, not all students have a natural predisposition toward science, chemistry in particular. Considering the relevance of transdisciplinary learning, schools should foster the scientific abilities for which students may have less aptitude or interest by taking advantage of areas and subjects that they have more inclination and knowledge. The use of analogies through comparisons between familiar and unfamiliar domains can potentiate the learning of abstract, unknown, or complex chemistry concepts. This article describes a case study regarding the use of a marching band analogy that was developed to teach kinetic-molecular theory. The study involved a convenience sample of 50 Portuguese seventh grade students attending a middle school music course, from four specialized music education schools. Data was collected through a questionnaire and an interview. Results reveal that the marching band analogy for kinetic-molecular theory, considering the students' profile, is didactic and suitable, enhances their attention and interest, and promotes their chemistry learning. In order to benefit chemistry education, we recommend the development and use of analogies between chemistry and music with students of similar profiles or the use of different areas and subjects for other student profiles.

AB  - Research Reproducibility: Educating for Reproducibility, Pathways to Research Integrity was an interdisciplinary, conference hosted virtually by the University of Florida in December 2020. This event brought together educators, researchers, students, policy makers, and industry representatives from across the globe to explore best practices, innovations, and new ideas for education around reproducibility and replicability. Emphasizing a broad view of rigor and reproducibility, the conference touched on many aspects of introducing learners to transparency, rigorous study design, data science, data management, replications, and more. Transdisciplinary themes emerged from the panels, keynote, and submitted papers and poster presentations. The identified themes included lifelong learning, cultivating bottom-up change, "sneaking in" learning, just-in-time learning, targeting learners by career stage, learning by doing, learning how to learn, establishing communities of practice, librarians as interdisciplinary leaders, teamwork skills, rewards and incentives, and implementing top-down change. For each of these themes, we share ideas, practices, and actions as discussed by the conference speakers and attendees.

AB  - Biochemistry and molecular biology education starts before our students get to university. From a very early age, they start learning informally about science beginning with the basics of science and as they progress through their school years they should be exposed to more advanced topics such as biochemistry and molecular biology. This session at the conference focused on three very different examples of engaging school students with biochemistry and molecular biology.

AB  - Background: Influential philosophers have suggested that interdisciplinarity is crucial for ecosystem management and scientific practice, and for education to democracy. However, a historical review of the rise of disciplines points at their compartmentalization in schools. An analysis of "core construct categories" of three disciplines, shows that this compartmentalization may decrease when dialogic argumentation is enacted. This background led us to launch an interdisciplinary program in schools. In previous publications, we identified multiple constraints in its implementation and listed design principles for affording interdisciplinary dialogic argumentation. Method: We adopt a "narrative approach" to analyze classroom talk, and ask whether and how interdisciplinary processes emerge in this talk. Findings: Students maintain dialogic argumentation around Interdisciplinary Social Dilemmas, but guidance is necessary for integrating knowledge from different disciplines. When the teacher is attentive to student's unarticulated references to disciplinary ideas, she may subtly guide the emergence of interdisciplinary dialogic argumentation. Often, the teacher misses those opportunities and declaims the integration of knowledge in a non-dialogic talk. Contribution: Dialogic Education is crucial for the success of interdisciplinary programs in schools, but the actual emergence of interdisciplinary processes depends on the handling of organizational and institutional constraints, on huge design efforts, and on subtle guidance.

AB  - An important issue in the discussion on the quality of legal education is the interdisciplinary character of legal studies. The main problem is how much the interdisciplinarity is demanded and needed by the consumers of the legal education market. It is believed that bringing interdisciplinary elements into law studies curricula, contributes to enhancing knowledge, skills, competence, and qualities that are necessary in modern times, sometimes much more than just dry legal knowledge. Lawyers who have sound knowledge of economy, finance, sociology, or psychology may provide better services tailored to their clients' needs. The major question remains--what makes a good lawyer--technical legal skills and fluent knowledge of legal provisions, statutes, case-law, or ability to listen, to understand the social processes or economic mechanisms better, having a better methodological apparatus, familiarised with a richer range of points of reference useful in creating solutions in their respective fields--having learned them from other disciplines of knowledge. The goal is to analyse the content of the Polish legal studies and reflect on how higher education institutions may address the issue of interdisciplinarity, in the context of the growing pressure to have highly skilled lawyers who can adapt to the fast-progressing socio-economic environment.

AB  - Futures studies offer a framework of ideas and guidelines that allow us to develop more productive images of the future and ways of working with it. Despite several efforts to translate this approach to different educational contexts, it is still a field under development. The main objective of this article is to present and discuss the latest international academic developments and contributions of futures studies to education. For this purpose, we conducted a systematic review of the literature using the Web of Science and Scopus databases. We considered articles published between 2012 and 2022. We started with 437 articles and after the application of the exclusion criteria, this number was reduced to 50 articles that were directly related to educational issues. The findings show that the literature included specific educational methodologies, a balance between theoretical and empirical publications, a focus on specialised journals and countries and that multidisciplinarity in education was not common with subjects outside social sciences. Moreover, we found that the predictive approach and negative perspectives were not present. We conclude that futures literacy is a key element to bringing together ideas related to futures studies in education, that futures studies contribute to changing the way of working with and conceptualising the future in education, and that they promote transformative movements.

AB  - This research presents results for the design and creation of supporting teaching materials using additive manufacturing. The materials are inspired by selected artwork of four animal species, which belong to a collection from the museum of the University of Antioquia. The topic selected was fauna in Colombia, and the animals in question were chosen based on important roles they have in areas like health, the environment, and food. These animals will complement science education given to several age groups visiting the museum. In addition to the 3D-manufactured objects, a study was conducted using several age groups that are very relevant to the museum: children, teenagers, and first year undergraduate students. A video showing technical information cards about the manufacturing process was also developed. This project was multidisciplinary, involving collaboration between the engineering school, the museum, and a local high school. The results showed that young visitors want complete information on the animals and to have interaction with the animal models, which is not always possible. This project serves as a local strategy not only for taking arts and knowledge out of the museum but also for planning first year courses in the university and thus reducing problems like school dropout, low motivation, and poor performance in national exams.

AB  - Behind the creativities and innovations in human history, there lie the humble practices of multidisciplinary studies that drive new revolutionary ideas and unconventional approaches. One such example is Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa"--one of the perennial portraits that bear witness to a transcendent level of creative art. It is one of his unique touchstones where he played with light and shade in such a way that both motion and emotion are entwined to the highest point of perfection in the ecstatic smile of the "Mona Lisa." By explaining how Leonardo created an unfathomable emotion in her smile and veiled her face by optics of uncertainty through the fusion of art and science, here we show why and how it can be considered as a prototype for multidisciplinary science education. The analysis of the inner details together with Leonardo's scientific epistemology advocates the importance of putting into practice repeated experiments and observations on widely diverse faculties for the emergence of innovative ideas, for the depiction of reality and for fostering creations.

AB  - Today, conserving the natural environment is paramount. Educators have been striving to develop pedagogical approaches that facilitate greater engagement in conservation behaviors. However, many of these reforms have been targeted at an institutional level, without necessarily testing whether changes in proenvironmental perceptions, attitudes, or behaviors occur for students. This step seems important when developing conservation biology courses that provide well-rounded education that may better prepare students for future challenges in biodiverse conservation contexts. Our objective was to assess the proenvironmental attitudes and conservation values of undergraduate students enrolled in an undergraduate conservation biology course before and after instruction to determine whether a multidisciplinary curriculum, in conjunction with traditional conservation biology content, would alter their perceptions. Students in both the control and intervention groups felt relatively neutral about a range of environmental and conservation topics. No statistical significance between curricula and impact on student perception was revealed. However, in the experimental course, shifts were found concerning students' understanding of the complexity of conservation. Results also highlight longstanding issues related to conservation education, such as a bias toward mammal conservation, and suggest that guest lectures are insufficient to bring about attitude change related to sustainability. Further research on incorporating cross-disciplinary pedagogy into STEM courses is recommended.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to develops an interdisciplinary business and computer science pedagogy for teaching and learning computer programming in business schools at higher education institutions and explores its associated benefits, challenges and improvement. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a body of theories, an interdisciplinary pedagogy is developed and tested for programming education in a business context. Meanwhile, based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, the authors used observation study and thematic analysis to explore opportunities, challenges and future improvements associated with this interdisciplinary pedagogy. Findings: The developed pedagogy includes integrating humanism and construction theory, problem-based learning, cognitive development, active instructional strategies, synergy of individual and group programming tasks and creating an encouraging and inclusive learning environment. This study shows that business students perceive this novel pedagogy as highly valuable because it enhances their logical thinking and problem-solving abilities while giving them a sense of accomplishment. Although students face challenges in data preprocessing, error handling and translating theoretical knowledge, they find it useful to review teaching materials, seek peer support and learn independently through online resources. Further improvements in pedagogy include incorporating collaborative code reviews, using shared documents for troubleshooting and grouping students based on their prior programming experience. Practical implications: This interdisciplinary pedagogy can guide business schools to improve the quality of programming-related modules, enhance students' performance and prepare them for future careers. Originality/value: This is the first interdisciplinary study investigating teaching programming in a business context.

AB  - With the benefits of low cost, energy efficiency, and environmental protection, photocatalytic hydrogen production is considered to be the most promising technology for the development of a clean and sustainable society. However, the utilization of photocatalytically generated hydrogen is not very common yet. Therefore, tertiary education urgently needs to guide undergraduate/graduate students to realize that the hydrogen generated by photocatalysis can be feasibly utilized. Herein, we report an experiment demonstrating the generation, storage, conversion, and utilization of photocatalytic hydrogen. In this paper, TiO[subscript 2], Pt, and lactic acid are respectively used as the photocatalyst, cocatalyst, and sacrificial reagent to generate hydrogen fuel from water. Upon light illumination, hydrogen is photocatalytically produced in the TiO[subscript 2]-Pt-lactic acid-water system. Then, through a drainage method, the hydrogen gas is stored in a U-shaped manifold. Subsequently, the produced hydrogen is directly circulated without purification into a hydrogen fuel cell. The electricity obtained from this fuel cell is used to drive an electric fan. The total lab time is about 3 h. Upon the completion of the experiment, students can master several basic operational skills and can experience how interdisciplinary knowledge of the chemistry and physics of materials can be utilized to solve some energy and environmental problems.

AB  - Educational research supports incorporating active engagement into K-12 education using authentic STEM experiences. While there are discipline-specific resources to provide students with such experiences, there are limited transdisciplinary opportunities that integrate engineering education and technological skill-building to contextualize core scientific concepts. Here, we present an adaptable module that integrates hands-on technology education and place-based learning to improve student understanding of key chemistry concepts as they relate to local environmental science. The module also supports disciplinary core ideas, practices, and cross-cutting concepts in accordance with the Next Generation Science Standards. We field-tested our module in three different high school courses: Chemistry, Oceanography and Advanced Placement Environmental Science at schools in Washington, USA. Students built spectrophotometric pH sensors using readily available electronic components and calibrated them with known pH reference standards. Students then used their sensors to measure the pH of local environmental water samples. Assessments showed significant improvement in content knowledge in all three courses relating to environmental relevance of pH, and to the design, use and environmental application of sensors. Students also reported increased self-confidence in the material, even when their content knowledge remained the same. These findings suggest that classroom sensor building and collection of environmental data increases student understanding and self-confidence by connecting chemistry concepts to local environmental settings.

AB  - The interdisciplinary nature, breadth of topics and frequently evolving industries Family and Consumer Sciences (FCS) courses engage with make it difficult for one approach to be appropriate in all circumstances. The Advanced Textiles, 4000 level course participating in this study focused mainly on color science, dyes and dyeing, in addition to colorfastness. The 10 students enrolled in the course had previously completed an introductory textile science course. The experiential learning exercises were modeled on elements of the product development evaluation process, in which concepts were first discussed in the Advanced Textiles Science course. This experiential learning project further adds to the FCS body of knowledge for effective teaching strategies within textile science courses.

AB  - This article is a small empirical study based on two assignments, both involving reading and writing, in two physics courses at a Christian college. Students read theological, philosophical, and scientific arguments and produced research papers. By performing interdisciplinary intellectual work, students considered the compatibility of science and Christian faith through a specific issue: the age of the earth and universe. Students indicated that they both changed and formed beliefs through their completion of the assignments. Furthermore, students became more amenable to the possibility that the principles of Christianity and science are compatible. The authors argue that incorporating theological questions into science classes fosters students' faith as well as their learning and moral development.

AB  - Teaching undergraduate science courses through the lens of local community issues has the potential to help students connect more strongly to the sciences and to the communities near the university. In considering the construction of such courses, it is clear that even community issues that have strong science cores--water quality, viral and bacterial disease vectors--are inherently multidisciplinary, with scientific and technological considerations in balance with the economic and social factors that inform public policy. The fundamental challenge is, then, to develop ways to teach complex and multidisciplinary community issues within the context of science courses. Here, we report on a pilot study of a course structure designed to address this challenge. Cohorts of students from different disciplines were paired, and a strategy was developed that required the students to work together to teach one another about a community issue from their discipline's perspective. This model was applied to cohorts of chemistry and interior architecture students studying local brownfield redevelopment efforts.

AB  - This study presents a conceptual framework for embedding interdisciplinary learning approaches in a postsecondary science program in order to foster interdisciplinary science habits in students. The framework was developed through the lens of a multi-year interdisciplinary postsecondary science program that encompasses a series of courses in which science disciplines are bridged within an authentic science research environment. The validity of the developed framework is supported by the empirical data comprising live experiences of the students obtained through questionnaires, interviews and focus groups. The data were processed and evaluated using content analysis and activity theory. This work provides design principles that will be useful for both program developers and education researchers seeking to launch effective interdisciplinary science programs.

AB  - Environmental science classes often ask students to examine changes in species or their environments to determine the human impact on a particular habitat or ecosystem. It is not always practical to take students out for a field study to do this kind of analysis; instead, the scientific method and diversity analyses can be utilized while students compare topographic maps, photographs, or paintings over time. In this article, we present three laboratories that use artwork (e.g., paintings or photographs) to have students examine anthropogenic alterations in the character of landscapes and explore how our connection with nature has changed over time. These laboratories can benefit educators looking for an interdisciplinary STEAM approach to introduce both biology majors and nonmajors to environmental science concepts and the scientific method in a highly relatable way.

AB  - The landscape of education is dynamically evolving with the infusion of technology into classrooms, but it is not just math or science disciplines that are getting a digital makeover. Social studies education has entered a transformative phase as well. The "Computer Science for Social Studies" project, funded by the National Science Foundation, proposes a groundbreaking model tailored for rural middle schools. This initiative aims to weave computer science into the fabric of social studies, rather than teaching it as an isolated skill, making both subjects more relevant, engaging, and beneficial for 21st-century students. This interdisciplinary venture not only enriches the curriculum but also equips students with a blend of technological literacy and historical knowledge, essential for navigating today's digitally driven world. By merging the analytical prowess of computer science with the depth of social studies, the authors are preparing their students to be critical thinkers and adept problem solvers.

AB  - There is growing recognition of the importance of engaging postsecondary students in experiences that challenge them to solve complex socioscientific problems, transdisciplinary in nature, requiring students to integrate and synthesize knowledge, skills, and ways of thinking across disciplinary boundaries. Yet these student experiences are atypical. One possible reason is that the cross-disciplinary collaborations of faculty needed to create meaningful transdisciplinary student experiences are likely to be challenging. Lacking insight into these novel collaborations, we conducted a phenomenological study that describes faculty experiences across multiple disciplines and institutions to develop a transdisciplinary curriculum. Faculty were motivated by their professional development needs and a desire to improve their teaching practices and to develop curricula that would enhance student learning, all around a topic of personal interest. Yet faculty experienced tensions related to navigating norms, practices, and language across disciplines, the suitability of transdisciplinary curricula to their courses, and confidence in teaching across disciplines. Project leaders were essential facilitators and codevelopers, helping to alleviate some tensions. We discuss implications for faculty, academic leaders, administrators, and other stakeholders interested in involving faculty working across disciplines to develop transdisciplinary curricula, notably around a timely and important topic in the biological sciences.

AB  - Much of the mathematics that children experience in school neglect the skills increasingly needed for citizenship, particularly the power of complex data to investigate and make sense of the world. We draw on the relatively new field of data science as a multi-disciplinary approach to investigate problems through analysis of massive, non-standard, incongruous and/or messy data. Our exploratory qualitative study had as its research question: What can children learn about citizenship when they engage with data science? The case study in this paper illustrated ways that children's learning about citizenship were enriched through an age-appropriate data science investigation. The study analysed classroom video from a Year 4 classroom (aged 9-10) over six lessons that integrated curricula in digital technologies, health, and mathematics. In these lessons, the children generated and analysed non-standard data and debated social, well-being and privacy issues as they considered their activities in cyberspace. The video data were analysed using a framework based on critical citizenship education literature that examined dimensions of power, collective engagement, individual responsibility and action. Three key findings emerged. First, the case study highlighted skills in citizenship education developed through data science, positioning children as agents and advocates. Second, the study showed how a complex data investigation in citizenship education was achievable with primary children through meaningful curriculum integration. This is important given that problems that citizens address are typically interdisciplinary. Finally, the findings revealed a gap between data science skills and those developed in the mathematics curriculum, and recommend ways that the maths curriculum could be updated.

AB  - This article presents results from a Scholarships in STEM (S-STEM) grant from the National Science Foundation that supported students from three majors and funded the development of cocurricular activities designed to increase the workforce development of first-generation and underrepresented students. Scholar cohorts were interdisciplinary, with students majoring in biology, chemistry, and environmental science. We present details from four categories of activities: library resources and information literacy, career services, professional development, and community engagement. We discuss how the process of designing the activities created collaborations between STEM faculty and student support staff and between faculty and regional employers and nonprofit organizations. Results from formative assessments are presented from the group of scholars as a whole, as we did not detect significant differences as a function of gender, first-generation status, race or ethnicity, or academic major. Overall, the community engagement events were rated more poorly than other activities because they were viewed as contributing less to gains of knowledge or skills. Finally, we found that how the scholars viewed the activities depended more on how we discussed the activities with them than on the scholars' academic or demographic features.

AB  - Contribution: This study represents the first systematic attempt to develop Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) integrated project-based learning (PBL) as a transdisciplinary teaching method for fostering students' creativity and computational thinking (CT) skills. Background: With the growing importance of creativity and CT skills in the modern world, there is a need for innovative teaching methods that can effectively nurture these abilities in students. This study explores the potential of integrating STEAM into PBL as a transdisciplinary teaching approach to address this need. Intended Outcomes: The outcomes of this approach include significant improvements in various dimensions of students' creativity (fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration) and enhanced CT skills, particularly in medium and hard tasks. Application Design: The study involved 54 junior high school seventh-graders, with 28 students in the experimental group and 26 students in the comparison group. The experimental group was exposed to a semester of STEAM PBL, while the comparison group followed the regular curriculum. Findings: After a semester of STEAM PBL, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in creativity dimensions, while the comparison group showed no significant changes. In terms of CT skills, the experimental group exhibited significant improvements in medium and hard tasks, whereas the comparison group did not. These results highlight the potential benefits of integrating STEAM into PBL as a transdisciplinary teaching approach for enhancing students' creativity and CT skills. The implications for educational practice and future research are discussed in depth.

AB  - In this paper, insight into forensic science students' experiences of a case-based scenario with an interdisciplinary guided-inquiry experience in chemistry and biology is presented. Evaluation of student experiences and interest showed that the students were engaged with all aspects of the case-based scenario, including the curriculum theory components as well as the active learning within interdisciplinary laboratories. Working in groups of three during laboratories was favored by students, but mixed responses for group assessment were observed. Since the introduction of the case-based scenario, sustained improvements in student assessment outcomes were observed. Questionnaire respondents indicated a strong interest in case-based learning. We propose a methodology framework for the case-based scenario investigation in forensic science and discuss the student experiences and improved learning occurring with the scenario involving an interdisciplinary guided-inquiry experience in chemistry and biology. This work suggests that an interdisciplinary guided-inquiry learning approach, ideally contextualized within a case-based scenario, is adaptable to other science discipline combinations.

AB  - Learning to use math in science is a non-trivial task. It involves many different skills (not usually taught in a math class) that help blend physical knowledge with mathematical symbology. One of these is the idea of quantification--that physical quantities can be assigned specific numbers (with a unit). A second is to develop an intuition for scale. One way to help students develop these skills is to teach "estimation": the ability to consider a physical situation and put reasonable approximate numbers to it. [For "Using Math in Physics: 1. Dimensional Analysis," see EJ1315121.]

AB  - Integrating computational thinking (CT) into STEM disciplines requires secondary teachers to develop their pedagogical content knowledge of computing and content integration. Experienced teachers who choose to integrate CT in their secondary STEM courses may struggle in the same ways as novice teachers as they learn about programming and its potential use within their content areas. This study describes these potential struggles as teacher re-novicing in the context of high school physics. The research team facilitated a week-long computing integration workshop for physics teachers (n = 24) from three countries. The teachers engaged with computational learning activities in Jupyter Notebooks with the goal of developing their capacity to integrate Python in physics applications. Qualitative analysis of teacher surveys supported our theorization of a pathway of CT integration knowledge development. We describe these professional learning needs in four illustrative cases, building a grounded theory for teacher re-novicing as a pathway beginning with computing knowledge, moving through physics applications of computing, and arriving at pedagogical knowledge for physics-CT integration.

AB  - This paper outlines the design, development, and implementation of a new Master of Science in Interdisciplinary Medical Sciences (MSc IMS) program at Western University in Canada. The course-based program focuses on interdisciplinary education and experiential learning with a goal to foster students' academic, professional, and personal skill development. The authors discuss the rationale for developing the MSc IMS program, describe the curriculum design process, outline the innovative features in the program, and share the findings from the inaugural cohort on their motivation to enroll in the program. The alignment between the data from the inaugural cohort and the rationale for the program is also highlighted. The paper adopts a narrative approach to detail the process used throughout the design of the program and presents findings from a pre- questionnaire--focusing on the overall needs of students and rationale for their enrollment--administered to the inaugural cohort of the program. This scholarly work informs educators, curriculum designers, and administrators about the importance of interdisciplinary programs in higher education. It is also of significant relevance to departments planning to develop new programs or update existing ones to reflect 21st century teaching and learning approaches.

AB  - The Arts and Science Honours Academy (ASHA) is a unique interdisciplinary undergraduate honours programme at a large research-intensive university in Canada. Data were collected in early 2020 from 108 past and present students, representing the first eleven cohorts of the programme. Triangulating results from quantitative and qualitative analyses, we describe the ASHA students' educational and social experience during their time at university and, for those who have graduated, their post-graduate activities. Situating our investigation within previous literature examining interdisciplinary undergraduate learning communities and high impact practices, we assess whether students from arts and science disciplines experienced the programme differently, and which aspects of the programme were most impactful. We find that academically, students reported benefiting from the exposure to interdisciplinary thought, the opportunity to do research, and the study abroad requirement. Socially, students reported benefiting from the connections they formed with a small cohort of high achieving peers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. While science students reported benefitting the most from ASHA socially, arts students were more likely to indicate that the programme influenced their careers following graduation. These findings provide evidence to support the creation and design of future interdisciplinary undergraduate programmes.

AB  - The current anthropogenic climate crisis presents unique challenges to the higher education classroom. Pedagogy in the context of climate change must be attuned to complex and varied student experiences that can contend with feelings of anxiety, disconnection, distress and hopelessness. As educators and researchers, we collate our pedagogical approaches in the humanities and social sciences to progress ongoing discussions about climate pedagogy and highlight possibilities for action from Australia. Drawing on the inherent interconnectedness of our disciplines, we offer an interdisciplinary agenda for teaching in the climate crisis that is attuned to framing, positionality and reflexivity; multiple temporal and spatial scales; other ways of living and knowing; and creative action and activism to cultivate an affective classroom.

AB  - Post-truth is a social condition that threatens the trust in science and people's critical thinking. This paper analyzes some of the educational responses to post-truth, claiming the potential contributions of Science and Technology Studies (STS). Some of the responses based on traditional epistemology, characterized as "epistemological vaccines," are contrasted with some of the possible responses based on a more complex and interdisciplinary knowledge of science and technology. It is argued that epistemological vaccines, despite having an enormous value in fighting against post-truth, are insufficient to transform this social condition and its implications for science and technology. It is sustained that a social epistemology and, moreover, an expert interdisciplinary approach to the knowledge of science and technology, such as the one offered by STS, is required to consolidate stronger educational strategies, formulating "STS vaccines," that could be useful as a counterweight to understand and deconstruct post-truth. Given that the STS academic field has developed a good account of how scientific facts and social trust in science are constructed, it also has the capacity to show how post-truth and alternative facts are constructed, unmasking for whom it is important that we decry science. The conclusion points toward the urgency to rethink the current influence of the STS field in the educational context to relocate the STS education.

AB  - Due to its constructivist nature, interdisciplinary teaching appears ideal for increasing students' interests in subjects (Brassler, 2020; Kramer & Wegner, 2021). Although many argue in favor of a more comprehensive implementation of interdisciplinary teaching in schools, many practical barriers arise during the realization that need to be resolved following the design-based research approach (DBR) (Kramer & Wegner, 2022b). Especially at the upper secondary school level, implementation seems to be difficult. The question arises of how interdisciplinary instruction can be usefully implemented in the upper grades. As a first potential solution, interdisciplinary project days were developed in the subject combination of biology and physical education and evaluated with the help of an initial study. The prototypes developed increased both students' situational interests and their perceptions of the utility value of the subjects involved (Kramer & Wegner, 2021; 2022a). However, the implementation process could be optimized, as it currently depends on reducing other school subjects. Therefore, following the iterative cycle of DBR, a new prototype was developed involving interdisciplinary units within the regular subject lessons. The second prototype was empirically evaluated with a control-group design. In contrast to the first prototype, only descriptive trends were found, indicating that the interdisciplinary units trigger situational interest and stabilize individual interest. However, this cannot be supported statistically. Due to a high data dropout, the sample size should be increased, and the trends should be further investigated. In terms of practical feasibility, the second prototype has an advantage as it does not require any cancellation of subject lessons. However, implementing a second subject may reduce the time available for subject-specific content.

AB  - We conducted a case study on the implementation of an adult mentoring program designed to connect land-grant university graduate students who participated in a transdisciplinary and multi-institutional research project with industry professionals for the purpose of exposing students to industry practices. Seven mentees and six mentors participated in the study. We employed the theory of planned behavior to inform findings regarding participants' behavioral, normative, and control beliefs surrounding professional performance and goal attainment. Program outcomes were positive for student career development, for example expanding graduate students' professional networks and sharing research findings with industry professionals. However, the COVID-19 pandemic hindered the mentoring program's success by adding stress and travel restrictions that prevented full engagement in the program by all parties. Recommendations for improving the program's success include providing participants with better support mechanisms for initiating mentoring relationships and encouraging mentees to develop coping mechanisms when faced with cognitive overload and communication apprehension.

AB  - The authors developed a lesson for teachers to integrate chemistry and culinary arts, providing students with an opportunity to participate in three-dimensional learning, engage in science and engineering practices, and apply disciplinary core content and crosscutting concepts (Krajcik et al. 2014). The project involved five classes: three integrated chemistry and physics (ICP) classes and two culinary arts (CA) classes, with mainly sophomores and juniors. The lesson was part of a larger interdisciplinary project involving multiple classes working together to develop a gingerbread house community with an interactive light and music show. The ICP students' task was to design a window panel on a gingerbread house out of candy with optimal transparency and provide data-driven recommendations to CA students for the proportion of sugars to use in the candy recipe. Students learned about the structure and properties of key components of candy (glucose and sucrose) and how the proportion of glucose and sucrose in the mixture affects the molecular structure, transparency, and hygroscopicity. (A hygroscopic substance is one that readily attracts water through its surroundings, through either absorption or adsorption. Hygroscopicity is the percentage of moisture on the surface.)

AB  - In this article, the authors describe critical issues related to the pursuit of rigorous and innovative research in the fields of mathematics and science education. The paper is framed to help researchers consider aspects of both their research project and their research proposal. The authors describe features of high-quality and fundable research projects and whether the research is intended to support descriptive, design-oriented, or causal interpretation. They discuss the critical role of grounding proposed research in existing literatures; attending to relevant research from associated fields; and posing research questions that are clear, specific, and feasibly addressable. The goals of the research should cohere with the methodological and analytic design proposed. The authors also discuss the multidisciplinary nature of research that has implications for practice in general and for educational practice more specifically. The authors touch on the characteristics of more and less successful interdisciplinary research teams, especially those that draw from education, cognitive science, methodology, educational psychology, the learning sciences, and relevant STEM disciplinary fields. Examples of STEM education research questions from different genres of research are considered and the authors describe how the questions themselves give rise to specific design choices, methodologies, measures, study samples, and analytical models as well as how they can reflect the disciplinary orientations of the researchers. Implications of these issues for successful educational research grant proposal writing are discussed.

AB  - This follow-up study presents a design-based research (DBR) setting implemented over a three-year project called 'eKidZ - Teach Your Parents Well' which uses research-based learning and follows the four phases of DBR. In an iterative cycle, 20 teenagers aged 14-16 took on the role of researchers and investigated intergenerational learning and the multiplier effects of students participating in the Climate Change Education project 'k.i.d.Z.21 - Competent into the Future' on their parents, using the complete research process. Simultaneously, scientists implemented and tested the DBR setting to validate student research findings and to evaluate the quality of the educational setting. In this fully integrated DBR, using multiple methods (quantitative and qualitative), educational and scientific perspectives are brought together to evaluate students' findings and draw conclusions regarding their learning effects. These research results demonstrate that not only did students generate valid and reliable research, but - when changing perspectives - teenagers also contribute to the discussion about closing the gaps in science education and practice. By examining young people's research on Climate Change Education and recognising their contribution in scientific discourse, this paper offers a host of new insights. Highlights: Teenagers take on the role of researchers and perform reliable and valid research results on intergenerational learning and multiplier effects in Climate Change Education, by completing all phases of research-based learning. Design-based research is an effective method to combine science and education and thus delivering novel insights into science education and practice. High-quality Climate Change Education fosters constructive cooperation among all participants with inter - and intragenerational learning and multiplier effects. Constructivism, transdisciplinarity and research-based learning form the basis for effective design-based research and Climate Change Education.

AB  - Pre-service teachers often learn to teach in siloed methods courses despite evidence that interdisciplinary pedagogies benefit elementary school students. To address this discrepancy, six teacher educators initiated a two-year self-study to improve their practice. They co-created a shared module to integrate technology, literacy, and science content. The self-study was designed to answer the research question: what are the successes and challenges of implementing an interdisciplinary module within an elementary teacher education program? Findings relate to three main categories: teacher education pedagogies, use of technology tools, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Areas of promise for future integration are discussed.

AB  - Reports of the results of research within the emerging field of biochemistry education are appearing at an ever-increasing rate. Capturing an image of the landscape of Biochemistry Education Research (BCER) is complicated, however, by the interdisciplinary nature of biochemistry courses that may be taught at different levels and in different departments, even at the same institution. To develop a model that provides a sense of what research has been done, so far, we have investigated the literature on biochemistry education research within the contexts of the traditional biochemistry lecture and laboratory environments as well as courses taught within the health sciences, medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and molecular biology, as well as courses that combine biochemistry with other topics in chemistry, such as general chemistry and organic chemistry. We found that existing BCER has focused primarily on the lecture/classroom environment. Only about one-fourth of the BCER literature has been based on research in the laboratory setting. We also noted that the primary focus of research done so far has been on the structure/function properties of proteins. The goal of this review was a holistic understanding of the results of BCER that could be used by instructors to shape classroom practice as well as to provide BCER practitioners with an idea of the gaps in the existing literature that could be filled by future research. To transform the results of our analysis into a publishable form, we have used a format in which brief summaries of the topics of the BCER papers are presented.

AB  - This paper aims to provide a contribution to the research in physics education regarding the interplay between mathematics and physics in teaching and learning physics at the university level. The argument is developed through a study focused on the historical case study of the blackbody that led Planck to make one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs in physics: the introduction of discreteness and quantization into physical processes. The study is methodologically guided by the model that Udhen, Karam, Pietrocola, and Pospiech elaborated to highlight the interplay between physics and mathematics within teaching and learning practices [O. Uhden, R. Karam, M. Pietrocola, and G. Pospiech, Modelling mathematical reasoning in physics education, Sci. Educ. Netherlands 21, 485 (2012).]. The model emphasizes the distinction between the technical and structural roles of mathematics in physics, with the latter role being argued to correspond to processes of mathematization and interpretation. We used this model to analyze Planck's original papers and to reconstruct the reasoning that, thanks to the structural role played by mathematics, paved the way for the quantistic scientific breakthrough. The results of the analysis led us to design a teaching tutorial that we implemented with mathematics and physics university students. Students' reactions are reported to discuss the educational potential of the approach beyond the specific case and to argue for its potential general application to other similar physics topics.

AB  - This study explores benefits of studying two related subjects, mathematics and physics, in teacher education. German teacher students study two subjects as a major, which allows for investigating how the development of content knowledge in one subject, mathematics, benefits students' content knowledge in the other subject, physics. The sample included teacher students from 12 major teacher education universities in Germany. Each of the N = 104 physics teacher students, whose second subject was mathematics, answered two tests assessing their content knowledge in (1) mathematics and (2) physics. Our results reveal an influence of taking mathematics as a second subject on students' physics content knowledge. However, the effect size is only small. We found this influence increased over the course of study, indicating that the study of academic mathematics provided increasing opportunities to learn physics over the course of study. Even when controlling for general cognitive abilities, there remains substantial and significant effect of mathematics on physics content knowledge. Mathematical knowledge proves to be relevant in all physical subdomains except for optics and solid-state physics. Overall, the present study confirms benefits of studying physics when also studying mathematics, and thus a synergy effect in studying two subjects in scope of teacher education.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate physicists' views about the possible impacts of recent developments in quantum physics on educational implementations, particularly on science learning. Throughout the research a mixed-methods strategy was used. The data were collected from the physicists working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The qualitative and quantitative results were compared to portray the consistency between the two cohorts. The results indicated that the physicists' experiences could provide valuable contributions to educational practices, and both teachers and students could benefit from the knowledge exchange between the field specialists. The implications for, and potential contributions to educational practices are discussed, taking into account the three most pertinent subfields, namely curriculum, learning, and teaching methods.

AB  - The recent movement to include art and design in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education has made Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) an increasingly common acronym in the education lexicon. The STEAM movement builds on existing models of interdisciplinary curriculum, but what makes the union of art and design with the STEM disciplines so persuasive? In this article, I draw from research on interdisciplinary curricular projects that fit into the category of STEAM, but may also be considered inquiries into the role of art and design in the creative inquiry process, in order to sketch a transdisciplinary curriculum model that may be applied across disciplines.

AB  - Background: Although pollinators play an integral role in human well-being, their continued global decline reflects the need to provide and evaluate general pollinator knowledge to promote their conservation. Enhancing learners' understanding of the complexity inherent in pollination systems within the science classroom may help them make more informed decisions regarding pollinator conservation actions. By measuring conceptual understanding of pollination systems, science educators can identify learners' knowledge needs and inform their teaching in science classrooms. Based on previously developed theoretical frameworks describing pollination systems knowledge, we created and evaluated a new instrument to assess pollination systems and conservation actions knowledge. The Pollination Systems Knowledge Assessment (PSKA) is a multiple-true-false instrument containing 18 question stems and 70 accompanying T-F items encompassing three organizational components of pollination knowledge regarding (1) plant structures, (2) pollinator structures and behaviors, and (3) pollination systems function and pollinator conservation. Results: We refined the PSKA based on expert discussions, think-aloud interviews, and pilot testing before and after presenting a wild pollinator conservation unit within a postsecondary science literacy course. The PSKA elucidated learners' misconceptions and revealed discriminating items from the three organizational components of pollination systems knowledge. Conclusions: The PSKA may aid educators in exploring learners' conceptual understanding, identifying areas of misconceptions, and refining educational programming aimed at improving learners' pollination systems knowledge.

AB  - Designing a science activity for middle school children is a challenging task, especially if it aims to be interdisciplinary. One may ask if it is possible to craft a positive learning experience from different areas such as history of science, chemistry, or ethics. In this paper, we argue it can be achieved if we use the right tools to engage a young audience. A combination of gamification, hands-on activities, and storytelling techniques was successfully used, providing a unique form to approach chemistry and ethics subjects in an "edutainment" format. The result is a game that challenges participants to solve a crime, while addressing chemistry topics to gather pieces of evidence and facing science-related ethical conundrums. In our pilot study, participants evaluated this activity positively, identifying the innovation and entertaining features as the most relevant in their gaming experience.

AB  - Background: Teachers' beliefs play an important role in how teachers think about how students learn, and how content should be organized and taught. Integrated STEM is pushing the boundaries of some of the traditional assumptions in education--disciplined-based courses, courses taught independently by teachers, standards and content-driven, and no collaborative planning time for teachers. Six teachers, located in two high schools, participated in a year-long program to develop interdisciplinary collaboration to implement integrated STEM learning in their courses. A qualitative instrumental case study of the two teams of teachers was conducted to gain insights and understandings of the teachers' beliefs and instructional practices of STEM integration through interdisciplinary approaches in a complex system (i.e., hydroponics). Results: Themes regarding features, beliefs and practices, and challenges emerged from cross-case analysis of the teachers' stories, which resulted in two interdisciplinary collaboration models, multi-classroom and extracurricular activity, from each of the teams at each of the two high schools. Multi-classroom and extracurricular activity models had some resemblances, but also had differences. Both cases had the same goals to use real-world problems to help students see STEM connections, learn STEM knowledge and skills, and apply STEM knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems. Conclusions: Based on teachers' beliefs and their interdisciplinary STEM collaboration practices, three components were identified. Team size, teaching goal, and collaboration structure highly affect a successful interdisciplinary STEM collaboration model in high school settings. The study also contributes to expend the concept of a continuum of STEM approaches to curriculum integration, disciplinary, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary (Vasquez, Sneider, & Comer, STEM lesson essentials: Integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, 2013), and provides frameworks for structuring a successful interdisciplinary collaboration model in high school settings.

AB  - Although environmental radioactivity is all around us, the collective public imagination often associates a negative feeling to this natural phenomenon. To increase the familiarity with this phenomenon we have designed, implemented, and tested an interdisciplinary educational activity for pre-collegiate students in which nuclear engineering and computer science are ancillary to the comprehension of basic physics concepts. Teaching and training experiences are performed by using a 4" × 4" NaI(Tl) detector for in-situ and laboratory ?-ray spectroscopy measurements. Students are asked to directly assemble the experimental setup and to manage the data-taking with a dedicated Android app, which exploits a client-server system that is based on the Bluetooth communication protocol. The acquired ?-ray spectra and the experimental results are analyzed using a multiple-platform software environment and they are finally shared on an open access Web-GIS service. These all-round activities combining theoretical background, hands-on setup operations, data analysis, and critical synthesis of the results were demonstrated to be effective in increasing students' awareness in quantitatively investigating environmental radioactivity. Supporting information to the basic physics concepts provided in this article can be found at http://www.fe.infn.it/radioactivity/educational.

AB  - Transforming difficulties into opportunities for thriving is at the heart of this volume on the science of learning and development. This chapter brings the perspective of European research and the Global North and South and discusses some of the challenges included in the call to create the conditions for promoting sustainable and equitable futures for all. Among others, globalizing transformative knowledge by recreating, replicating, and scaling up success stories in education research can overcome methodological or epistemological limitations. Examples of cocreation and interdisciplinary work are included to produce socially relevant knowledge and be effective in tackling the real problems affecting children and youth. Dialogic learning and successful educational actions illustrate how educational success and transformation can happen.

AB  - Elementary teacher preparation programs often separate content and technology courses. This study examined the impact of changing the required science content courses for elementary preservice teachers in a small liberal arts setting. Following the new science course, students participated in a field experience as part of an elementary science pedagogy course that required using technology when delivering content lessons. We compared the students' perceived technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) and confidence teaching with the technology between the two groups. Data was collected using the TPACK survey at the end of their teacher preparation program. The analysis showed a significant difference in students' perceived TPACK between a discipline-specific science course and a multidisciplinary course, except in one dimension, pedagogical knowledge (PK). Overall, candidate confidence in combining content and technology in teaching a classroom lesson was higher with the multidisciplinary course. However, students could not effectively describe specific episodes that indicate high-level, inquiry-based teaching but did describe overall knowledge of technological pedagogical knowledge.

AB  - In the past years Centers of Excellence (CoE) has risen to prominence as a funding instrument in science. The idea is that by focusing resources, people and attention within a center environment, and over a substantial time span, excellence in science can be promoted. Similarly, interdisciplinarity is often seen as an enabling condition or even necessary for frontier research. This article builds on a qualitative interview study with Swedish Centers of Excellence (CoE) directors, and asks the question: - how is interdisciplinarity governed and developed within a CoE environment, and what is its effects in terms of research processes and organization. The study presents a detailed account of a number of aspects of interdisciplinary governance, conditions and outcomes, and describes how these relate via specific mechanisms. Together the results illuminate how CoE governance creates pathways to interdisciplinarity, that allow collaboration to go beyond mere interaction, and towards integration of specialisms.

AB  - The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) proposes to enhance active learning and student protagonism in order to improve academic performance. In this sense, different methodologies are emerging to create scenarios for self-regulation of their learning. In this study the cooperative, collaborative and interdisciplinary learning methodologies were compared in Spanish universities. The main objectives were to evaluate their effects in higher education and to explore the relationship between perceived group cooperation and self-perceived ability to work in a group, differences between educational Spanish contexts, educational methodologies and gender. To this end, a quasi-experimental design was carried out. Data analysis included the descriptive metrics, correlations and analysis of variance to evaluate the differences among pedagogical methods, their effects on cooperative learning, teamwork outcomes and gender differences, comprising a total of 229 students in Spain from Psychology, Early Childhood Education, Primary Education and Computer Engineering completed the two questionnaires. Results showed that the highest correlation between perceived cooperative activity and self-perceived ability to work in a group was found among computer science students, especially among women, suggesting that the interdisciplinary learning focused on software tool development may be the most effective methodology to improve teamwork and cooperative learning outcomes. Despite these findings concern only to Spanish universities, limiting the generalizability of results, the interdisciplinary methodology seems promising for improving both teaching quality and teamwork skills. The learning methodologies of interdisciplinary projects may therefore need to be implemented within the framework of cooperative and collaborative methodologies.

AB  - As an outcome of multidiscipline integration, the polymeric surfactant is of growing importance in modern industry and scientific research. However, the instructional introduction on polymeric surfactants is still insufficient in universities nowadays. In order to effectively guide undergraduates to study polymeric surfactant, a new polymeric surfactant, poly­(acrylic acid-"co"-octadecyl acrylate), was designed and synthesized by copolymerization between acrylic acid and octadecyl acrylate. Moreover, its surface activity and rheological performance were also analyzed by contact angle meter, laser scanning confocal microscope, polarizing microscope, and rotary rheometer. Generally, as a combination of the hands-on exercise with theoretical lecture, this laboratory experiment enabled students to understand the key concepts and chemical nature of polymeric surfactants in depth. In addition, the ability to incorporate multidiscipline concepts into the practical issues students must solve was also cultivated by this exercise.

AB  - Western science has grown increasingly reductionistic and, in parallel, the undergraduate life sciences curriculum has become disciplinarily fragmented. While reductionistic approaches have led to landmark discoveries, many of the most exciting scientific advances in the late 20th century have occurred at disciplinary interfaces; work at these interfaces is necessary to manage the world's looming problems, particularly those that are rooted in cellular-level processes but have ecosystem- and even global-scale ramifications (e.g., nonsustainable agriculture, emerging infectious diseases). Managing such problems requires comprehending whole scenarios and their emergent properties as sums of their multiple facets and complex interrelationships, which usually integrate several disciplines across multiple scales (e.g., time, organization, space). This essay discusses bringing interdisciplinarity into undergraduate cellular biology courses through the use of multiscalar topics. Discussing how cellular-level processes impact large-scale phenomena makes them relevant to everyday life and unites diverse disciplines (e.g., sociology, cell biology, physics) as facets of a single system or problem, emphasizing their connections to core concepts in biology. I provide specific examples of multiscalar topics and discuss preliminary evidence that using such topics may increase students' understanding of the cell's position within an ecosystem and how cellular biology interfaces with other disciplines.

AB  - Interdisciplinary approach is viewed as the best way to learn about and perceive complex scientific phenomena in the real world; therefore, students need to develop interdisciplinary habits of mind in K-12 science education. This article provided a framework for understanding middle school students' interdisciplinary competence that included four dimensions, each with three performance levels. Science educators have claimed that the current assessment system is still oriented towards single discipline-based science learning. Therefore, this study presented a validated instrument based on our multidimensional construct to explore students' interdisciplinary competence. The participants in this study were 385 9th graders in Henan Province in China. Multidimensional Rasch analysis suggested that this measure had satisfactory reliability and validity. All the students demonstrated the basic level of ability for each dimension. More competent science learners were found to achieve higher ability levels. In addition, students with different scientific proficiencies underperformed in different dimensions. Implications and suggestions for interdisciplinary science teaching and assessment were also discussed.

AB  - This paper examines shifts in the knowledge production policy agenda at Japanese research universities -- a transition from discipline-based academic tradition towards interdisciplinary forms of knowledge production -- through a case study of a leading interdisciplinary research institute. We examine this transition through the case of Tohoku University, one of seven 'Designated National Universities', and its flagship International Research Institute of Disaster Science. Documentary analysis revealed a renewed emphasis on interdisciplinarity, evident in restructuring towards a 'blended hybrid' model to reconcile the different institutional logics of diverse research traditions among its staff. Interviews with key stakeholders uncovered the internal dynamics of this process, its barriers and opportunities. We conclude with implications for Japanese higher education, arguing that a shift to 'blended hybrid' institutional forms is necessary but insufficient to maintain successful interdisciplinary research institutes. Success is contingent on simultaneous commitment to sustainable international connections and relationships with diverse external stakeholders.

AB  - Interdisciplinary learning experiences (i.e., experiences which illuminate learning of, and connections among, multiple disciplines) are essential to building a more robust understanding of the interconnections of multiple systems. Having an interdisciplinary understanding positively influences the ability of learners to contribute to solving wicked problems (e.g., soil degradation, climate change), most of which fall within the realm of agriculture, food, and natural resources (AFNR). Therefore, within AFNR Education, preparing learners via interdisciplinary experiences could empower the next generation of problem solvers. The Curriculum for Agricultural Science Education (CASE) has emerged as a potential method for teaching AFNR and science in an interdisciplinary way. However, research has yet to evaluate the impact of CASE on teachers' intentions to teach science within curricula. In this study, intentions to teach science were compared between CASE-certified and non-CASE-certified educators via a national survey of 212 randomly sampled teachers, 81 of whom were CASE-certified. Within four of the eight courses evaluated, CASE-certified teachers intended to teach more science than non-CASE-certified teachers, while non-CASE-certified teachers intended to teach more science in the remaining four courses. The findings suggest opportunities to enhance the interdisciplinary structure of CASE curriculum and/or explore alternative models for facilitating interdisciplinary learning within AFNR Education.

AB  - This paper provides a conceptual elaboration of the role of Problem-based Learning (PBL) in the integration of social sciences and humanities (SSH) with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and an analysis of the challenges this brings about. SSH-STEM integration is an endeavor that is timely, relevant, and urgent given the insufficient answers that higher education provides to the challenges social science and (especially) humanity faces. PBL can be argued as a pedagogical model to naturally cater to this demand. Based on two cases of integrated study programs from Aalborg University, Denmark, we analyze and discuss challenges and potential pitfalls in integrating SSH and STEM. As a result, we pinpoint learnings that can serve as timely guides in future iterations of problem-based, inter- and transdisciplinary endeavors in higher education.

AB  - This book provides a fascinating insight into the on-going process of self-reflection in the Science|Environment|Health (S|E|H) community. The basic vision of a new S|E|H pedagogy is to establish a transdisciplinary dialogue between the three educational fields of science education, environmental education, and health education. This approach finds growing interest among science educators. Since 2014, the ESERA special interest group S|E|H has united both experienced and junior researchers all over Europe in a burgeoning research community. This book presents a selection of results of these vibrant activities. Systems theory has turned out to be a stimulating theoretical framework for S|E|H. The limits of predictability in complex living systems result in structural uncertainty for decision-making, and they ask for emphasising and rethinking the role of pedagogical concepts like informed citizenship and scientific literacy. They challenge crude scientific determinism in environmental and health education, which all too often ends up with students' eco- and health depression. Instead, S|E|H conceives coping with uncertainty in terms of an interplay between cognitive and affective factors. The horizon of the future remains always open. Hope must never die in a new S|E|H pedagogy.

AB  - Science and drawing have been paired for hundreds of years, and this synergy is still prevalent in research investigating the role of drawing for developing and assessing understanding. However, despite research at the primary and secondary levels of education, there is limited research on whether drawing facilitates learning at the undergraduate level, particularly in human biology. This subject is specifically important to focus on as it can be a core subject on some multidisciplinary programmes that do not require a science background at entry. The literature reviewed in this paper highlights that drawing tasks are well received by students and that they perceive the tasks to be helpful for their understanding. There is also some evidence that it might improve learning. However, this cannot be concluded with confidence due to some limitations with respect to comparison groups, including such a group being absent, using retrospective cohorts as a control, and not controlling for instruction between groups. Furthermore, some of the reported improvements in tests are practically very small. More work is warranted in this area as there is a risk that misconceptions can be passed on to students and between students using this type of teaching activity.
