AB  - Nowadays, research in second language acquisition (SLA) is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary while many technical frontiers and research hotspots have emerged. Many studies focus on interdisciplinary topics, but few in-depth studies have been conducted on interdisciplinarity. This study examined the interdisciplinarity of SLA and the interdisciplinary development process using a bibliometrics approach. The study has found that the SLA discipline has played roles as both the provider and recipient of knowledge in the development of interdisciplines. In the first case, SLA theories and methods flow into the research areas of "life sciences" and "technology" to form interdisciplinary studies with brain research, neurology, cognition, computer technology, and engineering, making SLA a provider of knowledge In the second case, SLA research receives knowledge from areas of arts and humanities and social sciences as well as from interdisciplinary studies within its own discipline, making SLA a receiver of knowledge. The new insights into the interdisciplinarity of SLA provided in this study are helpful for our deeper understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of the SLA discipline.

AB  - The introduction of Green Chemistry (GC) into school science curriculum is considered an important step that encourages students to build connections between chemistry, other school subjects, and different aspects of their daily lives. The concepts associated with GC can be applied throughout the various levels of education with different degrees of complexity and provide a systematic approach to the teaching of science for sustainability. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the specific content that can be associated with the teaching of GC in primary and secondary schools in Chile. This study aims to provide a model of curricular science content for GC school education, utilizing the framework of Educational Reconstruction. The research question was "What links do in-service science teachers and science education researchers establish between GC and the school curriculum?" Specifically, we were interested in comparing science teachers' and science education researchers' perceptions of the links between GC and school science subject, school science contents, and crosscutting science concepts. A qualitative approach was employed for data collection and analysis, focusing on the written responses of 20 in-service science teachers and 20 science education researchers. We conclude the study by proposing an empirically based model of curricular content for GC school education (GCSE), comprising three dimensions: the multidisciplinary dimension of school science subjects represented here by chemistry, with the greatest presence, biology, physics, and geology; the intradisciplinary dimension of core disciplinary contents within each school subject; and the interdisciplinary dimension linked to a range of crosscutting concepts for GC.

AB  - While a trans-disciplinary approach has been suggested within school science learning to facilitate the role of science education for societal development, lacking is a conceptualisation with respect to what trans-disciplinarity is, why it is needed, and how it can potentially be implemented in the classroom. In seeking to address this limitation, this study undertakes a systematically literature review of research articles published between 2011 and 2022, within the scope of trans-disciplinarity at school level science education. The five key transdisciplinary attributes are identified as -- complexity, liberation, inclusion, transcendence beyond education and reflection, leading to the identification of 12 key dimensions of trans-disciplinarity. Based on this finding, a model is put forward with respect to implementing trans-disciplinarity within school level science teaching-learning, incorporating all identified dimensions as an approach towards addressing wicked problems within the society. The significance of this study lies on the conceptualisation of trans-disciplinarity in a holistic sense, so as to address a wider societal development through school science education.

AB  - This study explored primary school teachers' self-efficacy beliefs about interdisciplinary teaching practices related to science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) education and project-based learning to understand teacher perceptions and practices and to recommend some teacher training according to the national curricular standards in Brazil. Qualitative data were gathered using semi-structured interviews carried out with in-service teachers, which were supplemented by a questionnaire featuring both closed-ended and open-ended questions. The data were subsequently subjected to quantitative analysis. The findings reveal that while most teachers are familiar with and incorporate project-based learning into their pedagogical approaches, their awareness of and training in STEAM education are limited. Nevertheless, teachers perceived themselves as being very competent across most STEAM domains, including interdisciplinary curricular integration and projects. Chemistry, physics and arts are exceptions, with lower levels of teacher self-efficacy when compared to the other disciplines. This article examines the implications of these findings for pedagogical practices and teacher training in Brazil, while addressing what are teachers' current perceptions of STEAM practices, encompassing project-based learning and interdisciplinarity. It identifies the training requirements necessary to enhance their confidence in teaching science, while integrating arts-related subjects.

AB  - This article develops a post-determinist and a post-instrumentalist understanding of education and educational research through the lens of postdigital theory. We begin with historicizing current postdigital research by showing its intellectual ancestry and recognizing its rapidly changing nature. We move on to current state of the art, which we present in three wide themes. The first theme is the great convergence of various lower-level techno-scientific convergences, such as analogue--digital, physics-biology, and biology--information, which results in new epistemologies, ontologies and practices. The second theme is some consequences of the great convergence for education and pedagogy, which result in new postdigital ecopedagogies. The third theme is postdigital research, which is reconfigured by the great convergence towards a closer collaboration between traditional scientific fields and disciplines. We briefly outline four such reconfigurations (multidisciplinary, interdisciplinarity, transdisciplinarity, and antidisciplinarity) and their implications. The article concludes with a brief list of directions for future work in the field.

AB  - Purpose: The goals of this research study included evaluating the outcomes of Interdisciplinary Science Threshold Experience (InSciTE) on student experience of science discipline, level of sense belongingness to a large Faculty of Science (FoS), outcomes in learning science literacy skills and whether a student's background played a role in the differences of effects of the high-impact teaching practices. InSciTE was designed to facilitate the transition from high school to a large research-intensive university, and specifically to a FoS with over 6,000 undergraduate students. Design/methodology/approach: The FoS in a Canadian university engaged in the development of a *9 credit program bundling foundational statistics and chemistry courses with integration of aspects of mathematics and biology or physics to create a new first-year, academic interdisciplinary experience called InSciTE. This project-based curriculum emphasized teamwork and leadership, and presented complex interdisciplinary challenges facing today's world. A team-teaching environment consisting of instructors, a lab coordinator and teaching assistants was instrumental for the core InSciTE courses. In addition, the authors utilized a variety of learning practices with interdisciplinary themes to meet the learning outcomes. Course activities included field experience and tours, blended learning and flipped lectures, guest speakers, discovery-based lab activities, group discussions and projects, a capstone research project, and a combination of formative and summative assessments. The authors proposed two hypotheses for the evaluative study; first that the high-impact practices (HIP) will improve students' experiences and belongingness to science faculty, and second that InSciTE facilitates learning of scientific literacy skills. To assess the effectiveness of InSciTE, the authors used two surveys, the first being the Test of Scientific Literacy Skills (TOSLS), which measures skills related to major aspects of scientific literacy: recognizing and analysing the use of methods of inquiry that lead to scientific knowledge and the ability to organize, analyse, and interpret quantitative data and scientific information. The second survey examined student belongingness, motivation and autonomous learning, combined with demographic data questions. Findings: The results suggest that InSciTE students reported higher feelings of relatedness, group membership, and career aspirations and performed better on the TOSLS compared to students in other science courses. Originality/value: As a leader in interdisciplinary science, the FoS at a Canadian university developed a full-year course bundling foundational statistics and chemistry courses with integration of some aspects of mathematics and biology or physics to create a new first-year, academic interdisciplinary experience called InSciTE. This project-based curriculum emphasized teamwork and leadership, and presented complex interdisciplinary challenges facing today's world aiming to facilitate transition from high school to a research-intensive university.

AB  - This study aims to determine the usability of the book 'Five Weeks in a Balloon' authored by Jules Verne, as a context for interdisciplinary teaching of fourth-grade science and social studies courses. As a document review, the book was analyzed based on the Science and Social Studies Curricula/Turkey-2018. The book was associated with all learning areas of the Science Curriculum and five of the seven learning areas of the Social Studies Curriculum. It was determined first the association between the two curricula and the book, then starting points for planning appropriate activities for multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary teaching. As a result, the book can use as a context for fourth-grade science and social studies courses. Also be used in multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary teaching to integrate science and social studies courses. Teachers and researchers can carry out various studies by designing interdisciplinary environments by benefiting from the study results.

AB  - For some professionally, vocationally, or technically oriented careers, curricula delivered in higher education establishments may focus on teaching material related to a single discipline. By contrast, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary teaching(MITT) results in improved affective and cognitive learning and critical thinking, offering learners/students the opportunity to obtain a broad general knowledge base. Chemistry is a discipline that sits at the interface of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine(STEMM) subjects (and those aligned with or informed by STEMM subjects). This article discusses the significant potential of inclusion of chemistry in MITT activities in higher education and the real-world importance in personal, organizational, national, and global contexts. It outlines the development and implementation challenges attributed to legacy higher education infrastructures (that call for creative visionary leadership with strong and supportive management and administrative functions), and curriculum design that ensures inclusivity and collaboration and is pitched and balanced appropriately. It concludes with future possibilities, notably highlighting that chemistry, as a discipline, underpins industries that have multibillion dollar turnovers and employ millions of people across the world.

AB  - Prompted by William Newell's 2013 call for the Association of Interdisciplinary Studies (AIS) to consider whether to rethink its mission in light of other organizations' interests, this article begins by reflecting on similarities and differences among five of the founding organizations of a recently formed Global Alliance for Inter- and Transdisciplinarity. In chronological order of their own founding dates they are AIS, the Network of Transdisciplinary Research, the Integration and Implementation Sciences network, the International Network for the Science of Team Science, and the Center for Interdisciplinarity at Michigan State University. Descriptions of the five in Part I account for their emergence, communication venues, keywords of representation, website features, and prominent outputs. Given the centrality of integration in both inter- and trans-disciplinarity, it also describes their stances on this prominent topic. Part II reflects on implications of the current heterogeneity of the core concepts, focusing initially on generalizations including distinctions between Zurich and Nicolescuian approaches to transdisciplinarity followed by the premise of distinct Franco and U.S. traditions of the field of nanomedicine. It then draws further insights from case studies of institutionalizing interdisciplinarity across Europe, Russia and the South Caucuses, Africa, Latin and North America, Australia, and Asia. After commenting on signs of change in AIS, discussion turns to historical precedents for prioritizing problem solving, followed by future horizons for both inter- and trans-disciplinarity with emphasis on implications of their heterogeneity and overlaps with other prominent concepts such as Convergence and Mode 2 Knowledge Production. The closing section presents final reflections for answering Newell's challenge for AIS members to consider expanding its definition of interdisciplinary studies and conception of integrative process in light of other organizations' interests.

AB  - The global carbon cycle (CC) is a key environmental literacy issue related to climate change, ocean acidification, and energy sustainability. Understanding the CC requires interdisciplinary knowledge informed by multiple science disciplines such as biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. To examine the core principles and interdisciplinary nature of CC, we interviewed 10 experts from various science disciplines and asked them to create their own models of the carbon cycle. We utilized the data to identify emerging core concepts of CC and discover commonalities and differences across the experts' models in the context of interdisciplinary understanding. The concepts and interdisciplinarity were compared with those of CC-related topics in the U.S. Framework and Next Generation Science Standards. Most experts demonstrated a breadth of interdisciplinary knowledge based on their disciplinary backgrounds. The experts hold a wider set of ideas about CC than is present in the standards. Many topics not included in the standards could feasibly be added (e.g., the process of carbon sequestration into the ocean and rocks and CO2 emissions by volcanic activity). This study generates concrete recommendations for science standards to guide the revision of existing curricula or to guide the development of new interdisciplinary approaches to teaching global CC.

AB  - Physics and mathematics represent closely intertwined fields, wherein physicists employ mathematical modeling to address intricate problems. A challenge encountered by physicists involves bridging conceptual understanding with mathematical equations, a task that educators can facilitate by supporting students in navigating these two realms of comprehension. Mathematical modeling has exhibited potential in assisting students in recognizing that the domains of physics and mathematics are not insurmountably complex. The present study investigated the capability of science preservice teachers (PSTs) enrolled in an introductory physics course to resolve real-life physics problems by adhering to the stages of mathematical modeling. Data were gathered through the Interdisciplinary Modeling Eliciting Activity, allowing students to collaboratively discuss problems and devise solutions. Analysis was executed utilizing the interdisciplinary mathematical modeling (IMM) framework. The activity provided an inclusive platform for all students, including those who typically remained reticent during classes, to actively participate in group discussions and articulate their ideas. Despite the successful navigation of the problem with the guidance of the IMM framework, groups encountered challenges in certain tasks such as parsing/grouping and generating a context. Overall, the study demonstrated promise in augmenting PSTs' enthusiasm for physics and enhancing their comprehension of mathematical models within the discipline.

AB  - We present an investigation into the interdisciplinary role of physics in a physics-for-nonphysicists course at Pomona College. This work is guided by prior research into introductory physics for life science (IPLS) courses, but attends to significant differences in the scope and context of this course. We interviewed enrolled students, physics professors, and professors from nonphysics disciplines to explore the function of this course and the role of physics in the education of nonphysics science students. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed, then analyzed to identify emergent themes. These themes outline the authentic physics, including content knowledge and other, broader learning objectives, that play an important and distinct role in the science education of enrolled students. Stakeholders generally align in their emphasis of interdisciplinary relevance with some divergence in the specific articulation of that idea. The differences can be understood through the stakeholders' distinct areas of expertise, with nonphysics professors expressing value through relevance to their discipline and physics professors focusing on essential aspects of physics.

AB  - Both in physics education and in science education more generally concerns exist that formal K-12 education structures limit and, in some cases, diminish students' interest and agency in these fields. Many stakeholders have turned to informal learning experiences as a means to inspire young people to pursue continual learning in these fields in ways that foster creativity and self-determination. While research exists on the effect of these informal science experiences on students' science identities and broader science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) identities, little is known about how specific informal science education experiences relate to students' "physics identity"--a construct strongly associated with physics career choice. The current study contributes to the literature by examining the effect of several informal science experiences on students' physics identity. Drawing on data from a national survey administered to students in required English courses at 27 colleges and universities across the US (N=15 847), we used multiple regression to test the relationship between informal science experiences in various topical areas at two educational levels (K-8 and 9-12) and students' physics identity, while controlling for science background and demographics. The results reveal positive effects for stereotypic informal experiences in physical science (e.g., tinkering, competitions) as well as for talking science with friends or family. In addition, there were negative relationships between biology-related experiences (at both levels) and physics identity. Group comparisons further revealed that female students were more likely to report participating in biology-related activities and less likely to report participating in tinkering, STEM competitions, and talking science with friends or family. Students who identified themselves as Black or Hispanic were also less likely than those of other racial or ethnic groups to report tinkering and talking science with friends or family. We use this evidence to build the case that informal learning experiences in physics should move beyond stereotypic activities, increase accessibility, facilitate discourse with family or friends, and focus on interdisciplinary experiences that better engage young participants with a wide range of interests that are connected to physics.

AB  - The movement from STEM to STEAM, with its emphasis on real-world applications, promises to meet the changing needs of a globally connected world. However, the potential of transdisciplinarity to inspire and deepen our understanding of who we are and how we make sense of a world in turmoil remains undertheorized. This article makes a case for repositioning STEAM education as democratized enactments of transdisciplinary education, where arts and sciences are not separate or even separable endeavors. Drawing upon posthumanist theorizing, three projects will exemplify transdisciplinarity across music, mathematics, and science education. Transgressing and transcending disciplinary boundaries, and attending to both human and nonhuman perspectives, we invite a rethink of the work of schools, going beyond democratizing creativity to fully enact posthumanist transdisciplinarity.

AB  - The underrepresentation of Black Americans in physics has been persistent for so long that it seems to have constrained physics educators' collective imagination when it comes to conceptualizing and pursuing equity in physics teaching and learning. Drawing on a teacher research study that foregrounds justice-centered physics teaching, this article pushes past the "equity as access" narrative toward more expansive visions of equity and justice by reimagining physics education as a liberatory praxis. Accordingly, this study explores the complexities that emerged while expanding the boundaries of physics learning to embrace a justice-centered curriculum through a Youth Participatory Science (YPS) project. Taught in the context of a freshman physics course at an urban public high school, this YPS project engaged students in designing solar energy systems for an African-American community historically harmed by environmental racism. Critically evaluating curricular documents, I juxtaposed the traditional goals of physics learning with respect to definitions of community needs and assets. Simultaneously, I investigated the ways in which canonical physics knowledge dialectically interacts with interdisciplinary knowledge throughout the defining, investigating, and intervening phases of the YPS cycle. Throughout this process, I considered how physics learning provides opportunities to either reproduce or transform existing power relations within the sociopolitical and environmental schema of the community. The critical understandings constructed from this study frame what it takes to repurpose physics teaching and learning for environmental justice, specifically emphasizing the agentic pedagogical and curricular decisions teachers must negotiate to transform physics education for liberatory purposes.

AB  - This article describes and illustrates a physics course for first-year college students whose only knowledge of physics is that they do not like the subject. The physics content is driven entirely by what appears in the daily newspapers and generally covers most physics topics in a semester. This course was structured as a learning community that combined English and physics in a single 6-credit course. Most of the writing assignments were about physics. A semester-long overview is shared, as is the instructional model for Newspaper Physics. We also provide three examples of how this model is used. Findings indicate that students gained higher physics content knowledge, higher-order thinking skills, greater confidence in seeking help and understanding science, and more opportunities to work with peers outside of class. This study contributes community-based interdisciplinary teaching and learning strategies.

AB  - This study on the Estonian lower secondary (7-9th grade) science curricula, is seen as an important framework for educators preparing students as tomorrow's citizens able to reflect on sustainable energy development. As the curriculum is taken to be the major document allowing insights into Estonian educational standards, this study identifies components within the intended lower secondary science curricula for subjects of biology, chemistry, earth science, physics, and interdisciplinary science. Using document analysis, verbs associated with career-related learning outcomes are detected, allowing the relatedness of the energy conceptualizations and determination of their cognitive level utilizing SOLO (Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes) taxonomy. A team of coders identify a total of 782 learning outcomes across three learning domains: psychomotor (176), affective (32), cognitive (574) at unistructural (33), multistructural (225), relational (276), and extended abstract (40) levels. The majority of energy concept learning outcomes (274) are identified in the source (form) and transfer (transform) categories. Very few career-related learning outcomes are detected with the science education relevance dimensions (individual, societal, career). The suitability of the findings is discussed. The current analyzing method can be applied to other educational disciplines for raising awareness of disciplinary crosscutting concepts.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed significant growth of interest in science-art integration in schools as an approach to creative teaching and learning. This conceptual turn in education implies profound institutional and philosophical changes. Central to this turn has been the development of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math (STEAM) education. In this article, we detail a progression from an existing model of pedagogical principles and educational objectives in science education within a global STEAM education environment, Global Science Opera, towards shared pedagogical principles and educational objectives in both science and arts education within that same environment. In this work, we rely on a transdisciplinary approach towards the integrated disciplines and the educators who teach them. We outline the need for the new, integrated approach to be validated in other, empirical, contexts in order to establish its capacity in the field of creativity in education, and specifically in global STEAM environments in order to ensure its relevance to teaching and learning of a kind which strengthen students' knowledge, abilities and democratic and inclusive values. We propose the Janus metaphor for the new approach as it represents the possibility of having a double perspective of a single focus of attention. We conclude by pointing at limitations of discipline integration in which pedagogical principles in science education are not in harmony with the pedagogical principles in arts education.

AB  - Among the new educational tools and new ways of teaching/learning of the last 20 years, educational approaches based on constructivism are of great interest because they offer the possibility for students to build scientific concepts from experimental observations. Cooking is truly a universal topic--it can be considered a true multidisciplinary science as it incorporates chemistry; biology; and to a lesser extent, physics. Therefore, it offers the possibility to perform many experiments and to evaluate them with all five senses, which is perfect for educational purposes, and in particular for children. The authors introduce a fun approach, mixing science and cooking, that involves several kinds of students and teachers: engineering students (ages 20-22), cooking students (ages 18-25), secondary school students (ages 14-15), and their respective teachers. This article reports on using chocolate as the theme. After a presentation of the project and the lesson, the benefits and difficulties of this approach for the different participants are discussed. A specific focus is given to the engineering students, who were simultaneously teachers and learners.

AB  - Contemporary society of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) increasingly requires the education system (i.e., the school) to train competent, creative and proactive professionals who will be able to solve real life problems. If society is to achieve this, some key paradigm changes must occur in education. The school must first prepare a competence-based curriculum and, secondly, school practice should move away from subject-based teaching, towards an interdisciplinary STEM teaching approach. Obviously, to support this, modern learning environments and ICT solutions and tools have to be used. However, since the interdisciplinary STEM approach has already been implemented and integrated, it can be said that a new, integrated science discipline (STEM) has already emerged, together with a transdisciplinary approach to STEM learning and teaching. In the present research, a concrete case of designing, developing and producing a solar chimney was used to demonstrate an integrated approach to learning and teaching, while emphasizing especially the advantages of such an interdisciplinary (transdisciplinary) approach to teaching Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematic content. The empirical research shows that such an approach produces incomparably better results, especially on higher cognitive levels, in comparison to traditional approaches to learning and teaching.

AB  - The professional high school by the federal schools in Brazil requires an integrated curriculum itinerary. There is a lack of information about how to achieve that in a practical conception of integration. This article aimed to investigate the interdisciplinary approach of the content "transformation of energy" involving the relationship among Science, Technology, Society, and Environment (STSE) in integrated high school. The applied research procedure was a pedagogical intervention in which research subjects were the third year high school students, integrated into the technical course in food (n = 36) at the Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Norte, municipality of Pau dos Ferros, Brazil. The process of planning, execution, and evaluation of the interdisciplinary teaching sequence was carried out by teachers and researchers from different areas i.e., forest engineering, chemistry, physics, and physical educational. The data were compiled and evaluated through thematic analysis. The results showed that interdisciplinary learning favors scientific and environmental literacy, conceptual changes, expanded discussions, and the integration of the curriculum.

AB  - Food, cooking, and eating are commonly used as contexts or legitimations to teach and communicate science. However, for teaching to have contextual credibility, the relationship between subject and context is a relevant area of study. The present contribution describes an analysis of curricula from three Nordic countries shedding light on conditions for interdisciplinarity and/or curricular integration between the subjects science/chemistry on the one side, and home economics on the other. A two-phase documentary analysis was conducted on curricula from Finland, Norway, and Sweden from 2006 to 2020, revealing substantial potential for interdisciplinary collaboration and/or curricular integration. This is seen both in common declarative knowledge content ('declarative knowledge overlap') and, more interestingly, meeting points between subject-dependent practices and ways of thinking ('transfer of practices and ways of thinking'). The second inductive phase produced 11 themes common to the subjects. Possibilities and challenges are discussed in relation to the subjects' epistemologies and ontologies, as well as practitioners' competencies, attitudes, and creativity for subject boundary-crossing. Consequently, we conceptualise teachers' roles as lying in the span between 'teacher as polymath' and 'teacher as collaborator'. The present work also provides a instrument for exploring curricular conditions for interdisciplinarity between subjects on a more general basis.

AB  - Students are encouraged to develop a set of scientific skills and disciplinary practices common across the STEM disciplines. These skills (scientific inquiry, quantitative skills, laboratory and computational skills, communication skills, teamwork/interpersonal skills, interdisciplinary competency) are highlighted as important in discipline-based guiding documents -- biology (Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action), chemistry (American Chemical Society Guidelines and Evaluation Procedures for Bachelor's Degree Programs), and mathematics (A Common Vision for Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences Programs in 2025) -- for undergraduate teaching of biology, chemistry, and mathematics, and for the professional success of STEM college graduates. To promote interdisciplinary teaching and learning of STEM, we present a comprehensive comparison of the different disciplines' competency statements for undergraduate education. This organization and comparison of commonalities in scientific skills and disciplinary practices can be used by faculty and departments to come together to break down traditional silos, help their students more easily apply learning from one STEM discipline to another, and to create institutional change.

AB  - Recent educational policies advocate a radical revision of science curricula and pedagogy, to support interdisciplinary practices, a distinguishing feature of contemporary science. Computational modeling (CM) is a core methodology of interdisciplinary science, as such models allow intertwining of data and theoretical perspectives from multiple domains, to address complex problems such as climate change and pandemics. This integrative nature of CM could support the pedagogical transition to interdisciplinary science as well. Most approaches to introduce CM in science curricula are based on learning new practices, such as VPython programming or agent-based modeling. These approaches do not integrate CM with existing content, media, and teaching practices. To facilitate this integration, we present a more gradualist design, starting from derivation models in physics. This design was implemented as a set of teacher professional development modules, and presented to a group of physics teachers interested in introducing CM to undergraduate students. The analysis of their responses indicates that even this gradual transition to CM requires teachers to significantly revise their ideas about the nature of physics and physics learning (their personal epistemologies). We discuss how the teacher professional development modules were redesigned based on this finding.

AB  - In the last decade, game-based learning has received growing attention in educational contexts in general and science education in particular. A recent game trend, which has also found its way into STEM classrooms, is escape rooms. In this type of game, players have to work through several puzzles to achieve a specific goal (mostly to escape from an actual room). We conducted a systematic literature review to find out whether the "market" for such games is already saturated or if there is still potential for further development. After searching the common databases (ERIC, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, as well as the German database FIS Bildung), we analyzed 93 journal articles, book chapters, and conference papers in English and German from the following domains: chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, computer science, general science (interdisciplinary), environmental science, and medicine. We selected the ones that targeted a specific educational level (primary, secondary or tertiary education) and were designed for formal educational settings. It transpired that there is a need for more easily adaptable escape rooms as well as for more empirical evidence on their actual effects.

AB  - Background: In responding to the global problems facing humankind, there is great value in equipping science and engineering students with skills to function well in multidisciplinary teams. Little attention has been paid into the factors that influence multidisciplinary collaboration and teamwork of science and engineering students. Purpose: This research describes multidisciplinary teamwork of applied physics and mechanical engineering students in a challenge-based learning (CBL) course. The study aimed to: a) identify the facilitators and barriers to multidisciplinary teamwork and b) explore learning outcomes connected to working in multidisciplinary teams. Sample: 30 students registered to the course, two teachers, and three tutors participated in this research. Design and Methods: An instrumental case study was conducted in the context of a pilot CBL course. Data included interviews, reflection reports, observations, and design posters. Transcribed video recordings were searched in an attempt to demonstrate the codes revealed with the qualitative content analysis of interview transcripts and reflection reports. Results: The results indicated knowledge acquisition, application, and an awareness of other disciplinary approaches as the learning outcomes with some differences for engineering and physics students. The findings also yielded individual (e.g. knowledge of control theory), team (e.g. disciplinary perspectives), and course factors (e.g. disciplinary connections to the challenge) that influenced multidisciplinary teamwork. Conclusion: Multidisciplinary teamwork is supported by the unique ways of thinking and approaching problems of the two disciplines. Implications contribute to future research and thinking for similar learning environments while improving student learning in multidisciplinary teams.

AB  - Transdisciplinary learning--where students develop and apply knowledge from multiple disciplines to solve open-ended problems--is necessary to prepare students for the most pressing real-world problems. Because transdisciplinary education often requires reimagining the content and design of undergraduate science courses, it can be a challenge for instructors to envision how such work might take place. In this article, we share an example of an undergraduate course developed at the intersection of animal sensory biology and robotics engineering. Students in the course developed knowledge from both disciplines to design a robot that could mimic the sensory behaviors of some animals to achieve a predetermined task. We share examples of students' work in the course and evidence of how students' perceptions of science and engineering changed throughout their participation in the course. Additionally, we describe how we adapted a hybrid model of collaboration that made it feasible for students to work together on an open-ended project requiring access to robotics equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This course can serve as a model for instructors working to incorporate more interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary perspectives into existing science courses.

AB  - A goal of introductory physics for life sciences (IPLS) curricula is to prepare students to effectively use physical models and quantitative reasoning in biological and medical settings. To assess whether this goal is being met, we conducted a longitudinal study of the impact of IPLS on student work in later biology and chemistry courses. We report here on one part of that study, a comparison of written responses by students with different physics backgrounds on a diffusion task administered in a senior biology capstone course. We observed differences in student reasoning that were found to be associated with prior or concurrent enrollment in IPLS. In particular, we found that IPLS students were more likely than non-IPLS students to reason quantitatively and mechanistically about diffusive phenomena, and to successfully coordinate between multiple representations of diffusive processes, even up to two years after taking the IPLS course. Finally, we describe methodological challenges encountered in both this task and other tasks used in our longitudinal study.

AB  - Among the relevant aspects of the family resemblance approach (FRA), our study focuses on the potential of the approach to elaborate on disciplinary identities in an interdisciplinary context, specifically regarding the interplay between physics and mathematics. We present and discuss how the FRA wheel can be used and intertwined with the framework of boundary objects and boundary crossing mechanisms (Akkerman & Bakker, "Review of Educational Research," 81, 132-169, 2011), which is well-known in STEM education for dealing with interdisciplinarity. The role of the FRA discussed in the article is dual: both practical and theoretical. It is practical in that we show how its use, in combination with the Akkerman and Bakker framework, appears effective in fostering productive discussions among prospective teachers on disciplinary identities and interdisciplinarity in historical cases. It is theoretical in that the combination of the two frameworks provides the vocabulary to characterise the 'ambiguous nature' of interdisciplinarity: like boundaries, interdisciplinarity both separates disciplines, making their identities emerge, and connects them, fostering mechanisms of crossing and transgressing the boundaries. This empirical study reveals how the theoretical elaboration took advantage of the prospective teachers' contributions. We initially presented the FRA to characterise disciplinary identities, but the prospective teachers highlighted its potential to characterise also the boundary zone and the dialogue between physics and mathematics. The data analysis showed that the combinination of the two frameworks shaped a complex learning space where there was room for very different epistemic demands of the prospective teachers: from those who feel better within the identity cores of the disciplines, to those who like to inhabit the boundary zone and others who like to re-shape boundary spaces and move dynamically across them.

AB  - Out-of-field teaching is a global educational challenge. In particular, many teachers whose academic background and main teaching experience is in biology are called to teach middle school physics and have limited opportunities for productive professional development. Based on previous studies, we expect these teachers to hold different epistemic cognitions from the in-field teachers. The present study builds on this epistemic diversity and offers dialogic argumentation as a means to promote mutual learning among physics teachers from different disciplinary backgrounds. We describe guidelines for designing "interdisciplinary dialogic argumentation" activities that aim to encourage teachers to express their disciplinary perspectives in the context of inquiry-based physics and to facilitate a deliberative discourse among them. We demonstrate in a case study the ways in which the discourse of a group of in-field and out-of-field teachers unfolds under the proposed design guidelines. Using the Actor-Network methodology and an analysis of power relations, we uncover a complex interplay between the social and the epistemic in the discourse: when interactions become more dialogic and power relations more equalized, the out-of-field teachers take an active role in the discussion, foregrounding their epistemic practices and enhancing the epistemic practices of the group, including the in-field teacher.

AB  - Natural phenomena and scientific issues are intrinsically interdisciplinary. Students need to study a variety of academic disciplines in the natural sciences to explain a phenomenon or its related problems. Our goal in the current study was to examine the epistemological foundation of students' interdisciplinary understanding of carbon cycling using the supervised latent Dirichlet allocation model. The 454 students in this study were from a public high school and a public research university in Texas. The students' interdisciplinary understanding was shown in each of the constructed response items. In the relationship between the proportion of interdisciplinarity in students' answers to the constructed response items and students' scores on interdisciplinary understanding, all integrations of disciplines were statistically significant in explaining students' interdisciplinary understanding. Moreover, one particular integration set had advantages for obtaining a high score. We found that science coursework contributed to students' interdisciplinary understanding in different ways, and this interdisciplinary understanding was influenced by the number and type of science courses taken. Characterizing interdisciplinarity based on the clusters of science disciplines provided insights into how students synthesize their knowledge. The significance of this study lies in its potential impact on diverse curricular and instructional approaches in interdisciplinary science education.

AB  - There are subjects which university students perceive as uninteresting and which they are reluctant to learn. The use of an appropriate approach to learning can contribute to the formation of positive students' opinions on learning. Project-based learning (PjBL) is characterized by active research, problem-solving, and student-made projects which is nowdays usually facilitated by the use of computer and network technologies. The aim of this research is to assess opinions of students of physics and technology at University of Novi Sad, Republic of Serbia, on PjBL, as well as to analyze these opinions in connection to three different factors: gender, academic performance, and study program. The physics content "Diffusion and Osmosis" was realized using PjBL. This topic was chosen because of possible interdisciplinary concepts' relations between physics, chemistry, and biology. After students' group work on projects and their project reports, a survey was conducted. Research results showed that opinions of students participating in the research about PjBL were independent of their gender, academic performance, as well as whether they study physics or technology. All students had equally positive opinions on PjBL. Further implementation of PjBL is planned in the authors' departments, along with the integrative implementation of PjBL in teaching science in collaboration with other departments at the university.

AB  - The concept of interdisciplinarity has been the focus of much reflection, but studies on the implementation of interdisciplinarity in secondary schools remain rare. This literature review aims to provide a state of the art empirical studies of interdisciplinarity in secondary schools. This systematic review, based on PRISMA standards, includes a descriptive analysis and a thematic analysis using inductive and deductive methods. Studies were identified using the following databases, Web of Science (WOS), Taylor & Francis (T&F), ERIC, and Science Direct (SD). A total of 40 studies were selected and analyzed to: (1) provide an overview of interdisciplinary practices in secondary schools; (2) highlight the effects of interdisciplinary practices on teachers and students; and (3) identify the conditions that favor the construction of interdisciplinary sequences. The results of this review show that few interdisciplinary practices are used in secondary schools and that even fewer achieve a real integration of disciplines. Interdisciplinary approaches seem to have positive effects on both students and teachers (promoting learning and, interest, developing interpersonal skills and encouraging professional development) when it is possible to overcome the many obstacles they face and to implement them in favorable conditions, such as those featuring a strong conceptual link between disciplines or complementarity between disciplinary and interdisciplinary moments.

AB  - The time-resolved detection of very low intensity light emission has become an essential capability in many areas of science including molecular biology, fluorimetry, DNA sequencing, virus detection, nanoparticle research, and optical materials development. Among the most basic techniques for the detection of rapidly fluctuating low-intensity light is photon counting. Despite its extensive applications in the physical and biological sciences and engineering, photon counting techniques have traditionally been left out of undergraduate curricula due to the prohibitive cost of the equipment and the complexity of its operation. However, the recent development of the low-cost silicon photomultiplier device, a solid-state single photon avalanche diode detector, has enabled the availability of easy-to-operate, low voltage, advanced timing performance, and highly sensitive photon counting systems well within the budget of undergraduate teaching laboratories. In this contribution, we provide a strategy to introduce undergraduate interdisciplinary chemistry and physics students to silicon-photomultiplier-based photon counting through the interesting phenomenon of delayed fluorescence from photosystem II in plants. This experiment is perhaps best suited for an upper-level undergraduate laboratory and should stimulate the interest of students across a wide variety of disciplines, from physical chemistry to molecular biophysics to photonics instrumental analysis.

AB  - This article intervenes in the persistent hierarchy of epistemological worth that produces scientific knowledge as meaningful, and knowledge from arts or humanities as marginal, or illustrative. The specific trans-disciplinary project we discuss brings together environmental social sciences with performance-based Forum Theatre methods to explore 'value' as understood in communities in Tabasco and Chiapas, Mexico in relation to Payment for Ecosystem Services. Trans-disciplinary collaborations that seek to incorporate 'novel' methods to engage participants differently might better reflect the dynamic, emergent, and often shifting nature of beliefs, attitudes and values.

AB  - In our technology driven world today, it is extremely important to increase the science literacy of our non-science majors. At Stockton University, this goal is attempted to be accomplished through our General Studies courses. This paper describes a lab-based course in the General Studies curriculum, 'The Science of Ice Cream'. At Stockton University, General Studies courses are interdisciplinary courses, designed for all students in four areas of study: general arts and humanities (GAH), general interdisciplinary skills and topics (GEN), general integration and synthesis (GIS), general natural sciences and mathematics (GNM), and general social and behavioral sciences (GSS). The GNM courses are designed to meet four main goals: to examine the broad concerns of science, to explore the nature of scientific process and practice, to provide students with an understanding of mathematics and the natural sciences, to acquire appreciation for how scientific knowledge of the physical and natural world is attained and evaluated. The topic of ice cream was chosen because it provides a rich environment, full of practical applications of thermodynamics and fluid dynamics, as well as general concepts in physics, biology, food science, and chemistry. Since this course is designed for both science and non-science majors, it provides a platform to discuss applications of concepts learned in introductory physics. It is sometimes difficult to get non-science majors excited about science, but the laboratory exercises, where the students use the concepts learned in lecture to make ice cream, provide the students with interesting and approachable examples of the physical concepts.

AB  - While interdisciplinarity has been promoted in universities for decades, research suggests that untenured faculty struggle to receive recognition for their interdisciplinary research. Informed by the microfoundations of institutional theory and discursive legitimation, we examine how members of academic departments participate in the legitimation and reproduction of tenure and promotion norms in relation to disciplinary and interdisciplinary research in a prestigious private university. Our analysis draws on 59 interviews with department chairs, directors of interdisciplinary centers, and disciplinary and interdisciplinary untenured faculty in the STEM fields, the social sciences, and the humanities. Our findings reveal three mechanisms and processes through which tenure and promotion norms become legitimated and reproduced in academic departments: 1) institutional micro-practices concerned with evaluation and gatekeeping, 2) discursive legitimation of the expulsion of interdisciplinarity at the pre-tenure stage, and 3) scholarly positioning through discursive boundary strategies directed at rationalizing the expulsion of interdisciplinarity or the expansion of existing tenure and promotion norms. Taken together, these findings advance our understanding of the tensions between the promotion of interdisciplinary research in higher education institutions, reproduction of the disciplinary order in academic departments, and interdisciplinary early-career scholars' career advancement.

AB  - The process of perceiving music involves the transference of environmental physics in the air to anatomical and physiological interpretations of resonance in the body and psychological perceptions in the brain. These processes and musical interpretations are the basis of physical and cognitive science, neurophysiology, psychoacoustics, and cultural psychology. The intersection of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary curricular offerings forms the basis of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). In this study, the researcher explores the synergy of music in STEM for formulating and affording authentic STEAM programmatic offerings for learners. The blending of the art of music within STEM provides opportunities for teachers and students to address and connect content through creative, innovative approaches for deeper, meaningful learning. Threading the art of music within STEM affords discovery-learning opportunities that facilitate both critical thinking and social, emotional learning skills development in students. This study provides perspective in terms of developing curricular offerings for students that blend physical and cognitive science with the art of sound. The researcher provides authentic curricular exemplars regarding the synergy of music in STEM and concludes by offering recommendations for designing and implementing expressive curricular programmatic offerings for students from early childhood settings through higher education.

AB  - Interdisciplinary models of teaching have been present in education systems for at least 30 years. The idea of the interdisciplinarity is to show students the contextualisation of subject knowledge, its relation to real-life problems and to build skills across traditional disciplinary boundaries. This is essential to future competitiveness since innovations frequently occur at the interface of disciplines when people are able to collaborate. Schools try to respond to the need to prepare students for an interdisciplinary and collaborative job market by modifying the curricula and training teachers. But one of the most primary and difficult problems is preparing a truly interdisciplinary lesson or a project. It seems that all complex issues could be good examples for this purpose. One of these complex issues is the study of climate change, which requires the collaboration of different specialists and a comprehensive understanding of the problem in different scientific fields: physical, geographical, biological, social, engineering, etc. The paper presents an interdisciplinary project which links knowledge within a few different science areas around the real-life problem important for students. The work shows the developed and tested interdisciplinary educational project 'Panta Rhei' which integrates physics and other STEM subjects to present the biological and social consequences of changes in vegetation periods for different climate zones. It shows how Earth observation research can be utilised in schools for teaching physics and other science subjects. The project was validated on a group of Polish teachers. In the paper we present the whole project together with teachers' opinions.

AB  - Many physics teachers have experienced the challenges of implementing the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) in their high school curricula. These standards, based upon the Framework for K-12 Science Education, were intended to shift science instruction towards an interdisciplinary focus on three-dimensional learning, phenomena anchored explorations, and developing solutions for technological problems. The present paper describes a collaboration between electrical and computer engineers and physics educators, whereby a physics unit was created to embed engineering practices in the design of a night light. Although the project also incorporates aspects of crosscutting concepts and disciplinary core ideas, we focused on engineering practices since more educational resources are needed that illustrate this aspect of NGSS-aligned teaching and learning. The unit was piloted with over 1500 high school students in an informal outreach program, as well as professional development workshops for 100 secondary science teachers, with the intent that teachers would incorporate this and other engineering projects in their physical science classrooms.

AB  - Biochemistry primarily focuses on the non-metal chemical elements carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus in the four groups of building blocks (sugars, lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides) and the corresponding macromolecules. However, at least 10 essential chemical elements of life are metals. This article discusses the consequences of such a bias, presents current knowledge that over 20 chemical elements are required for life, and makes a case for--and suggests benefits of--teaching "elemental biology" alongside molecular biology and biochemistry, and inorganic chemistry in addition to organic chemistry. A relatively new interdisciplinary field, metallomics, has the potential to be a platform for integration when added to glycomics, lipidomics, proteomics, and genomics. It would fill a major gap in contemporary education, be relevant for many areas of science, and facilitate the teaching of important principles of chemistry in the biological sciences, thus helping students to gain a broader understanding of life processes from the molecular to the systemic biology level.

AB  - Using data from approximately 342,000 course-taking records collected from 4406 college students enrolled at Taipei Tech during the 2009-2012 academic years, we examine the impact of multidisciplinarity on students' academic performance. Our study contributes to the literature in three ways. First, by applying natural language processing (NLP), we analyze course descriptions of 375 subject areas from the Classification of Instructional Programs and measure the pairwise distances among them. Second, based on the course-taking records and the subject area distribution, we measure each student's degree of multidisciplinary learning using a proposed weighted entropy formula. Third, using the proposed multidisciplinary index, we find that the impact of multidisciplinary course-taking experience on individual students' academic performance varies across academic fields. In the college of engineering, the college of electrical engineering and computer science, and the college of mechanical and electrical engineering, a higher level of multidisciplinarity is associated with a higher average weighted GPA in core courses. However, a positive association does not exist for students in the college of management.

AB  - Health-related career goals are popular among high school science students, yet few understand the application of chemistry and biology research to the field of medicine and its impact on society. In this five-day multidisciplinary summer camp, high school students learn about the real-world relevance of medicinal chemistry research and its application to human health through a series of hands-on synthesis, isolation, and biological testing experiments. Our approach makes use of natural product related bioactive molecules, namely aspirin, oil of wintergreen, and eugenol, to highlight the connection between biology and chemistry in the field of medicinal chemistry. The subsequent analysis of these pharmaceutical agents via a variety of antibacterial testing, cell viability, and toxicity assays helps students understand the drug discovery process. In addition to laboratory experiments, students learn about various health professions through visits to Lawrence Technological University nursing and physician assistant program suites and a meeting with an experienced pre-health professions advisor. Through this unique ensemble of experiences, high school students gain valuable insights into the nature and impact of scientific research on the field of medicine and learn about a variety of health-related occupations. Participant survey responses indicate that students enjoyed learning about chemistry- and biology-related concepts and techniques related to the drug discovery process. Furthermore, this week-long summer camp met or exceeded all participants' expectations, with many students expressing enhanced confidence in their scientific abilities.

AB  - Purpose: This article considers how the evaluation of research teams can better account for the challenges of transdisciplinarity, including their larger team size and more diverse and permeable membership, as well as the tensions between institutional pressures on individuals to publish and team goals. Design/methodology/approach: An evaluation team was retained from 2015 to 2020 to conduct a comprehensive external evaluation of a five-year EPSCoR-funded program undertaken by a transdisciplinary research team. The formative portion of the evaluation involved monitoring the program's developmental progress, while the summative portion tracked observable program outputs and outcomes as evidence of progress toward short- and long-term goals. The evaluation team systematically reviewed internal assessments and gathered additional data for an external assessment via periodic participation in team meetings, participant interviews and an online formative team survey (starting in Year 2). Findings: Survey participants had a better understanding of the project's "Goals and Vision" compared to other aspects. "Work Roles," and particularly the timeliness of decision-making, were perceived to be a "Big Problem," specifically in regard to heavy travel by key managers/leadership. For "Communication Channels," Year 2 tensions included differing views on the extent to which management should be collaborative versus "hierarchical." These concerns about communication demonstrate that differences in language, culture or status impact the efficiency and working relationship of the team. "Authorship Credit/Intellectual Property" was raised most consistently each year as an area of concern. Originality/value: The study involves the use of a unique survey approach.

AB  - Sustainability science calls for new methodologies and collaborations that go beyond disciplinary boundaries. This points to a new role for sustainability science communication. Here, we explore how science communication can employ aesthetic formats (e.g., storytelling, performance, artistic installations) to promote transdisciplinary collaborations. We conducted a series of experiments in a master-level science communication course at the University of Copenhagen, engaging students, practitioners and researchers in experimental collaborations and qualitative data collection. Through thematic analysis of classroom observations and interviews, five elements of transdisciplinarity emerged: Acknowledgement of disciplinary identities, negotiation of diverse vocabularies, disruption of hierarchical structures, experience of novel insights and evident learning processes among participants. These moments challenged direct observation but became discernible through post hoc analysis. We suggest they constitute a sequence that together describes a transdisciplinary moment. We thus conclude that the aesthetic formats we employed were instrumental in disrupting conventional boundaries and enhancing collaboration across disciplines. However, we also acknowledge the complexities of achieving transdisciplinary moments and emphasize the importance of reflective practice.

AB  - This study aimed to recognize upper-secondary school science teachers' perceptions of the meaning, importance, and integrating mechanisms of science, technology, engineering, math (STEM) education, taking in to account the differences between the science teachers' perceptions according to their specialties, years of experience, and degrees. A closed-ended questionnaire was distributed among 700 science teachers (biology, physics, and chemistry) in Riyadh, and 255 teachers responded. The results showed a strong alignment in the upper-secondary school science teachers' perceptions of the meaning and the importance of STEM education, although there was less of a consensus regarding the integrating mechanisms. There were statistically significant differences in the physics teachers' perceptions of STEM meaning, although there were otherwise no significant differences by specialty in the science teachers' perceptions of the importance of STEM education and its integration mechanisms. Furthermore, the teachers showed no statistically significant differences in STEM's meaning, importance, or integrating mechanisms according to their years of experience. Based on the results, recommendations included intensifying professional development programs on utilizing technology, engineering, and mathematics in learning science concepts and application.

AB  - Despite a key feature of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and a core strength of liberal arts and sciences education, interdisciplinarity is also a noisy buzzword which does not always make sense from an institutional point of view. Traditional interdisciplinary fields take it for granted like fish in the water while, somewhere else, people keep a distance with questions. "Doing" interdisciplinarity faces additional boundary challenges due to strong gravitational forces that are national, historical, and increasingly from between college and workplace. For a higher education institution whose vision for robust interdisciplinarity is rooted across these boundaries, it is not enough to set up a curriculum, hoping that once and for all the train of interdisciplinarity will roar on. In reality, it may take a higher magnitude of interdisciplinarity and constant enabling mechanisms to balance out certain gravitational forces, such as the pro-STEM and pro-exam tendencies in Chinese higher education. This study surveyed the inaugural undergraduate class of Duke Kunshan University (DKU) as well as its undergraduate faculty to propose a theory of change for scaled interdisciplinarity. The resulting theory of change elaborates on an actionable definition of interdisciplinarity using a vocabulary common to college and workplace, a mobility lens for measuring and leveraging different and especially higher magnitudes of interdisciplinarity, and a linchpin mechanism for energizing this mobility so that interdisciplinarity is more entwined with other institutional facets of teaching, learning, and research.

AB  - This research is a needs analysis study aimed at developing a curriculum based on an interdisciplinary context-based learning approach within the 10th-grade physics course, focusing on the electricity and magnetism unit. The research was designed according to the case study model and data were collected from expert, teacher, and student sample groups through questionnaires and interview forms. Descriptive statistics were utilized for quantitative data analysis, while content analysis technique was employed for qualitative data. The results indicated that the physics curriculum continued to maintain a disciplinary perspective and a classical understanding of physics, with insufficient connection with daily life and adaptation to contemporary conditions. Similar results were identified in the 10th-grade physics textbooks and in-class instructional practices concerning the unit of electricity and magnetism. In this respect, the research identified the needs for developing a curriculum based on an interdisciplinary context-based learning approach to address these negative results. These needs, while enhancing interdisciplinary context-based understanding, can also contribute to the emergence of various opportunities and different perspectives in physics education. It is recommended to identify needs in other subfields of physics as well and develop curricula designed with an interdisciplinary context-based approach for more effective and efficient physics education.

AB  - Limited studies investigate the high school teachers' challenges and strategies while teaching science and mathematics in English as the target language through the content and language integrated learning (CLIL) approach. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the challenges that science and math teachers encounter and the strategies they employ while fostering students' development of proficiency in English as the target language in physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics courses in the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) and International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP). The study utilized various qualitative tools such as semi-structured interviews, open-ended questionnaires, and lesson observations to analyze science and math teachers' strategies and challenges at a case school in eastern Turkey. The study revealed that as part of the CLIL approach, the participant teachers indicated various challenges such as a lack of vocabulary repertoire, translation problems, and weak foundational knowledge. They used common strategies such as group work interactions, interdisciplinary activities, individualized feedback, the promotion of higher-order thinking skills, inquiry-based learning, and reinforcement of language used to deal with these challenges. The study presents further implications for good practices and recommendations to resolve challenges.

AB  - : Current research on self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching indicates shortcomings in facing recent teaching challenges in secondary education and corresponding valid instruments. Thus, we designed the Self-Efficacy Beliefs of Interdisciplinary Science Teaching (SElf-ST) instrument based on a pedagogical content knowledge model for science teaching. We ensured the factorial validity of ten factors. To bring construct validity down to a round figure, we examined convergent and divergent validity in this paper. For answering the overall research question regarding arguments for the convergent and divergent validity of the interpretation of the SElf-ST instrument's test values (and related hypotheses), we analyzed data of pre-service, trainee, and in-service biology, chemistry, and physics teachers (n = 590) in a cross-sectional study. While the strong latent correlations of the ten SElf-ST factors with self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching in primary education (r = 0.40 - 0.63, p < 0.01) indicate convergent validity, the rather weak correlations with self-efficacy beliefs of general teaching (r = 0.17 - 0.54, p < 0.01), self-rated content knowledge in science (r = 0.13 - 0.40, p < 0.01), and perceived stress (r = -0.13 - -0.19, p < 0.01) support different divergent validity intensities. Thus, assumed relations within the nomological net surrounding the self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching construct were confirmed for secondary education. In sum, we shed light on a rarely explored aspect of construct validity in science education research regarding self-efficacy beliefs. Doing so, we gained strong arguments that the SElf-ST instrument's test values can serve as indicators of self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching in secondary education.

AB  - This essay gives a broad overview of a team-taught course on Alexander Hamilton that merges discourses in music theory and political science. Authors describe pedagogical approaches to teaching both the musical "Hamilton" to non-musician students and Hamilton's history and politics to students not majoring in these fields. Contrasting challenges and outcomes of the seminar's first (2017) offering with its second (2020), authors consider the scope and implications of cultural intelligence and scholarly interdisciplinarity, maintaining that courses team-taught by instructors of different disciplines make connections across disciplines more explicit for students and enhance the transdisciplinary nature of the honors experience. Pre-course assessments are included, and future directions for team-teaching are discussed.

AB  - In this paper we begin to explore how knowledges being generated in bioscience might be brought into productive articulation with the Sociology of Education, considering the potential for emerging transdisciplinary, 'biosocial' approaches to enable new ways of researching and understanding pressing educational issues. In this paper, as in our current research, we take learning as our focus. Our work brings together collaborators from across fields: sociology of education; molecular biology and biochemistry; cognitive neuroscience; fMRI imaging; and EEG. Through the paper we explore the generative potential of an encounter between life sciences and sociology of education. Through consideration of the conceptual and methodological elements of our 'Synchrony in Learning' research and engagement with our pilot experimental approach, our research is suggesting that our central concept, learning, is undergoing metamorphosis, challenging us to understand learning as a phenomenon produced through the intra-action of a multiplicity of forces and processes.

AB  - Integrating information from across multiple sources is an important science literacy skill that involves the following: identifying intra- and intertextual ties, modeling relationships between sources and claims and making an evaluation of the claims made. Tasks that involve reading, interpreting and synthesizing multiple sources have been well explored particularly in the epistemic cognition literature. Interdisciplinarity is a growing area of interest in science education, in terms of the ways we induct students into interdisciplinary ways of thinking and working, including the synthesis of knowledge from across scientific disciplines. While interdisciplinary contexts frequently involve connecting multiple sources from different disciplines, how students complete these text-integration tasks has not been well investigated. This paper develops a model of interdisciplinary text integration for science literacy, drawing on dimensions of epistemic cognition. We exemplify the application of this approach in a specific case of environmental science graduate students, drawing on student syntheses to illustrate how our approach can be used to differentiate between students' written syntheses.

AB  - While biomedical and life science research have embraced interdisciplinarity as the means to solving pressing 21st century complex challenges, interdisciplinarity in undergraduate education has been more difficult to implement. As a consequence, disciplinary rather than interdisciplinary capstones have become ubiquitous. Disciplinary capstones are valuable for students because they enable them to integrate knowledge and skills within the discipline, but they are also limiting because the integration is within rather than across disciplines. In contrast to a capstone, which involves a single discipline, interdisciplinary capstones require two or more disciplines to combine and integrate across disciplinary boundaries. Interdisciplinarity, where two of more disciplines come together, is difficult to implement in the biomedical and life science curricula because student majors and finances are administered in ways, which reinforce institutional organization of schools and faculties and prevent collaboration. Here in this "idea to explore" we provide an interdisciplinary capstone model where students enroll in disciplinary courses, but then these disciplinary courses and students collaborate on interdisciplinary real-world problems. This interdisciplinary capstone model was implemented across two diverse and large biomedical and life science schools within two faculties in a research intensive, metropolitan university. This approach allows for integration of the biomedical, social and ethical perspectives required when solving problems in the real world, such as COVID-19. Interdisciplinary learning also better prepares students for higher degree research and future careers. Overcoming disciplinary curriculum silos and faculty barriers is critical if we are to meet expectations of acquiring interdisciplinarity as a key competency.

AB  - There is emerging recognition that mechanistic reasoning about scientific phenomena as well as developing an interdisciplinary understanding of science are valuable for student success. Our team of chemistry, biology, and teacher education researchers strives to support students in their interdisciplinary learning and engage them in causal mechanistic reasoning (CMR), a thinking strategy that involves identifying underlying entities and their properties and linking these ideas to explain or predict a target phenomenon. We aim to help students build connections between their undergraduate chemistry and biology courses through engagement with carefully developed activities, which can be administered in a range of courses. In this study, we explored how students in 7 different chemistry, biology, or biochemistry courses engaged in CMR about preferential protein-ligand binding, a biological phenomenon that requires an understanding of core chemistry ideas like atomic properties and electrostatics. Explanations varied from noncausal mechanistic to fully causal mechanistic across all courses; however, students co-enrolled in molecular biology and second semester general chemistry did not differ in their engagement in CMR when situated in each course. Student responses provided evidence of activation of different conceptual resources, including charge, polarity, and space, to explain this phenomenon. Lastly, correct predictions about the preferred binding site were highly correlated with fully engaged CMR, showing compelling evidence for the power of this thinking strategy. This task effectively elicits CMR in both chemistry and biology courses, thus making it a potential tool for helping students build connections across disciplinary silos they experience in undergraduate science curricula.

AB  - Background: The goal of this research was to determine students' perceived self-efficacy in science classes through involving students in expanding disciplinary core idea (DCI) and interdisciplinary core idea (ICI) maps, as a method to visualize knowledge (utilizing mind mapping and concept mapping) to support students to integrate interdisciplinary learning. The research involved (a) creating (by science educators) eight curriculum-related, disciplinary core idea maps and two interdisciplinary core idea maps; (b) teachers guiding students in an experimental group, to make interdisciplinary connections so as to expand DCI and ICI maps in an intervention lasting a year and a half from grade 10 to 11; (c) providing feedback on students' developed DCI and ICI maps; (d) administering questionnaires seeking students' perceptions about their self-efficacy towards core ideas, both before and after the intervention and (e) interviewing science teachers (5) and selected students (25), after the intervention, about their perceptions towards the use and outcomes of their DCI and ICI maps. Besides the experimental group, a control group (no intervention) was involved. Results: Outcomes showed that the intervention (guiding students in creating disciplinary and interdisciplinary core idea maps to visualize their learning) supported students significantly in their perceived self-efficacy in the fields of Life Science and Earth Science, plus in the use of Models and Systems. In Physics and Chemistry, the students' perceived self-efficacy was not statistically significantly positive after the conducted intervention. This stemmed from disciplinary core ideas, related to Physics and Chemistry, being more abstract, with students making fewer connections and integrating less new knowledge into the related DCI and ICI maps. In the interviews, both teachers and students stated that the intervention (including expansion of DCI and ICI maps) supported students' science learning. Conclusions: Creating and expanding disciplinary and interdisciplinary core ideas more clearly indicates students' learning, through their ability to make meaningful connections, enabling students to raise their self-efficacy in preparing for their future. The results from this research demonstrate that students' perceived self-efficacy can occur through knowledge visualization by expanding both DCI and ICI maps enabling the making of greater interdisciplinary connections.

AB  - The galvanic cell is a typical interdisciplinary topic, which is primarily taught in chemistry but its underpinning is closely related to physics. Student learning in galvanic cell has been extensively studied in chemistry education, which has revealed a large number of misconceptions that are difficult to change through traditional instruction. A source of the learning difficulties is that most students lack an explanatory framework to integrate the many complex phenomena and processes into a coherent knowledge system. As a result, students often rely on memorization of terms, laws, and equations in solving problems but without a meaningful understanding of their reasoning. To address the deficit in learning, this study aims to help students develop an explanatory framework for supporting an integrated knowledge structure. Specifically, a conceptual framework model for galvanic cell is developed based on the central idea from physics, which is used as the core concept for mechanistic explanations of the related chemistry concepts. Guided by the conceptual framework, an instrument is developed to assess the knowledge integration in student learning of galvanic cell. A combination of qualitative and quantitative measures was used to assess the levels of knowledge integration in learning galvanic cell with a large number of Chinese high school and college students. The assessment results show that the conceptual framework model can effectively represent the knowledge structures of students at different levels of knowledge integration. The galvanic cell conceptual framework and assessment results can provide useful resources for teachers to develop instruction for promoting knowledge integration.

AB  - In recent years, we have been observing the phenomenon of an emerging scientific field: "digital transformation research" (DTR). Due to the diversity and complexity of its object of research digital, transformation is not effectively researchable if confined to the boundaries of individual disciplines. In the light of Scientific/Intellectual Movement theory (Frickel and Gross 2005), we wonder how interdisciplinarity could and should be mobilized to further advance the development of the field of DTR. To answer this question, we (a) need to understand how interdisciplinarity is conceived and (b) how it is considered in research practice by researchers in the emerging field. This is important, as scientists' application of interdisciplinarity will highly influence an emerging field, shape its growth, consolidation as well as its academic establishment. We conducted six group discussions with 26 researchers from different disciplines and career levels (PhD students, postdocs, professors). The discussions were studied with a structuring qualitative content analysis. The results reflect the vagueness of the concept of interdisciplinarity. Interdisciplinarity is largely conceived as multidisciplinarity. Further, the interviewees mentioned more challenges than opportunities when it comes to interdisciplinary DTR. The present study widens the scientific understanding about how researchers of different career levels perceive, learn, and practice interdisciplinarity in DTR. It further provides valuable indications of how interdisciplinary research in an emerging field can be profitably shaped for practice.

AB  - The literature on interdisciplinary teaching has tended to stress undergraduate teaching. As interdisciplinary graduate teaching becomes increasingly common, we need to reflect on what graduate students need to know. This article discusses key ideas that all interdisciplinary graduate programs should communicate. In particular, we need to teach graduate students how to do interdisciplinary research. Students should also be prepared for interdisciplinary careers. Since there has been relatively little written about interdisciplinary graduate education, this article is necessarily exploratory, and intended to encourage a conversation.

AB  - The growing number of interdisciplinary degree programmes offered at comprehensive research universities aim to ensure that students gain interdisciplinary understanding, defined as knowledge and skills that provide them with the means to produce cognitive enhancements that would not be possible through monodisciplinary programmes. Previous studies suggest that interdisciplinary understanding comprises six main elements: knowledge of different disciplinary paradigms, knowledge of interdisciplinarity, reflection skills, critical reflection skills, communication skills, and collaboration skills. However, empirical evidence to support this conceptualised model is lacking. The current study therefore proposes an Interdisciplinary Understanding Questionnaire (24 items) to assess this model. Its construct validity and measurement invariance were tested among 505 first-year Bachelor's students from different academic disciplines (e.g. humanities, science, social sciences). A (multigroup) confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the conceptualised model of interdisciplinary understanding, as well as measurement invariance across academic disciplines. Implications for educational practice, for instance regarding student assessment and quality assurance, are discussed.

AB  - Data analysis is one of the most popular fields of mathematics and includes statistics and probability. These two mathematical domains are some of the most well-known, influencing everyday life and the various sciences. Their teaching lays the foundation for primary education and culminates in secondary education. Probability and statistics are necessary for today and the future of several professions. This research attempts to highlight the multidisciplinary character of these two disciplines through the textbooks of primary education in Greece and Singapore. It aims to highlight the dependence of mathematics teaching on interdisciplinarity through textbooks. The textbook analysis was chosen because books offer varied learning opportunities. The researchers selected the books, partaking in the comparative analysis. After defining the basic principles dividing lines for the differentiation of the exercises, the analysis was conducted. It included two stages. In the first stage, the activities of the books were examined in their framework application. Then, their interdisciplinary character was accentuated in the scientific field. The results reveal a substantial dependence of data analysis on interdisciplinarity. More interesting is that the distribution of interdisciplinary exercises is prevalent in the scientific milieus.

AB  - Chemists have always designed and deployed cross-disciplinary approaches that interface chemistry with other disciplines to proffer solutions to many human problems. We designed a laboratory experiment that implements chemistry concepts in a biological model to prime undergraduate students to appreciate interdisciplinarity as an approach to solving complex problems in contemporary society. The experiments can also be implemented with graduate students transitioning to chemical biology research. The experiment introduces students to classical and emerging chemistry and molecular biology techniques--mammalian cell culture, bioorthogonal metabolic labeling, azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction ("click" chemistry), microplate photometry, gel electrophoresis, and far-western blot analysis--that are routinely used in research at the interface of chemistry and biology. The students cultured a Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-K1) and metabolically labeled the cellular sialoglycans with azide groups. Next, they used a click chemistry reaction to bioconjugate a fluorogenic molecule to the labeled sialoglycans, enabling the detection of the glycans using microplate photometry or far-western blot analysis. The experiment created a context for a first-hand demonstration of bioorthogonal chemical reaction, a concept novel to most undergraduates with traditional chemistry (organic, inorganic, physical chemistry, and analytical) background. The experience allows the students to apply and connect organic chemistry, bioanalytical chemistry, and molecular biology concepts while learning techniques such as microplate reading, SDS PAGE, and western blot imaging that are indispensable to the growing fields of drug discovery, chemical toxicology, chemical biology, and molecular biology. This experiment is ideal for preparing and motivating students to pursue future research opportunities at the interface of chemistry and biology.

AB  - In recent years there has been a movement towards offering interdisciplinary curricula within higher education. While there are numerous benefits associated with interdisciplinary learning, the disciplinarily focused structure and culture of higher education can constrain interdisciplinary activities, and the challenges associated with developing this type of learning experience have been less researched. Given that faculty are key figures in organizational change and curriculum development, this study sought to understand faculty members' perspectives on interdisciplinary curriculum development and refinement, including their perceptions of what constitutes an interdisciplinary program, the value associated with interdisciplinarity, and the challenges they have experienced developing and/or refining interdisciplinary programs. Faculty members from the Faculty of Science at a mid-sized university in the province of Ontario, Canada were interviewed, and these data were subjected to a content analysis. Faculty perceived interdisciplinary academic programs as including a collection of courses that offer a combination of knowledge from different disciplines; however, only a few participants identified the integration of knowledge from different areas of study as key to interdisciplinarity. Participants perceived that interdisciplinary learning was important for students to develop diverse, but not necessarily integrated, skillsets. Challenges related to interdisciplinary curriculum development and refinement included navigating institutional structures and collaborating with other academic units. Suggestions for navigating interdisciplinary curriculum development are discussed.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity has the potential to lead to more innovation and advances in knowledge than are possible from a single discipline. Yet, little is known about interdisciplinary collaborations and the perceptions of those involved. This quantitative study investigated the perceptions of U.S. faculty, staff, postdocs, and graduate students involved in education and science/engineering collaborations. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted for two modified scales, Collaboration Perceptions (CP; n = 117; 17 items; [alpha] = 0.923) and Interdisciplinarity Perceptions (IP; n = 119; 11 items; [alpha] = 0.852). Participants' perceptions of collaboration and interdisciplinarity were strongly positive and did not significantly differ based on demographic factors (e.g., gender, discipline, role). Perceptions were influenced by collectivist orientation; the high collectivism group had significantly more positive perceptions of collaboration and interdisciplinarity, and collectivist orientation was positively and significantly correlated with CP and IP scores. Implications and recommendations for interdisciplinary collaborations will be discussed. [Note: The volume number (9) shown on the PDF is incorrect. The correct volume number is 10.]

AB  - Background: The high rates of attrition in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) programmes causes concern over a future shortage of graduates entering STEM careers. Students' first year experiences critically affect their motivation and are therefore also critical components of students' academic success in terms of retention, learning and subsequent performance. Purpose: This study explores STEM students' encounters with an interdisciplinary first year. Specifically, motivational patterns towards learning in two introductory courses followed by students from multiple study programmes are investigated. Sample: 173 Danish undergraduate students enrolled in three science programmes: biomedicine; biochemistry and molecular biology; and physics. Design and methods: Within the framework of Self-Determination Theory, a measure of autonomous and controlled motivation forms the basis for quantitative analyses (n = 173). A qualitative thematic analysis of students' open responses further supplements and gives nuance to the findings. Results: The motivational pattern of physics students is found to differ significantly from that of biochemistry and molecular biology (BMB) students and biomedicine students. The comments reveal that some students struggle to realise the relevance of the course content for their chosen study programme to an extent that makes them reconsider their study choice. Conclusions: The study offers input to the discussion of how to present inter- and/or multidisciplinarity to students and points to implications on two levels: curriculum design and course content. The findings are of importance to educational planners, decision-makers and teachers dealing with the motivational range that exists within their courses.

AB  - The incorporation of interdisciplinary education, a topic of significant global interest, is increasingly being recognized as a key aspect of educational innovation in Vietnam. This recognition extends to several fields, including STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education. This research aims to design and implement a STEM situation associated with the context of water protection in Vietnam for 10th-grade students in which students mobilize the knowledge of Physics (specific gravity, Archimedes' principle) and Mathematics (volume) to design a salinometer. This device measures the salinity of the water. The research methodology is based on the observed increase in saline levels in the coastal regions of Vietnam in recent years, which has had a substantial impact on agriculture and the livelihoods of millions of people. This methodology aims to provide realistic scenarios for students to address and resolve these problems. A total of forty students in the 10th grade were involved in a teaching situation that consisted of five distinct phases. Forty 10th-grade students participated in a teaching situation conducted in five phases. The results showed that the situation helped students strengthen and connect their physics and mathematics knowledge, create a vibrant learning atmosphere, enhance communication, and develop problem-solving competency. Furthermore, the teaching situation also needs to be revised regarding the measurement practices of Vietnamese students. The situation contributes to educating students' awareness of current events, protecting Vietnamese water resources, and the importance of sustainable development. In addition, we can use the same teaching process as in this research to develop other STEM teaching situations.

AB  - A physics professor (DS) and a theater technical instructor (BC) came together in 2018 to plan a general education course on the Physics of Theater Stagecraft. This is less surprising than it sounds, because theatrical lighting design had been Smith's hobby for almost 30 years, and he has always felt that his understanding of physics helped him better implement the art of stage lighting. In 2019, Guilford College launched a new instructional calendar, and we worked together to offer this interdisciplinary general education course for the first three-week class session. We agreed that our priority was that the students would learn by doing, rather than reading and homework. We spent mornings in the physics lab and afternoons in the theater. There was no final exam--the practical task of creating a design for an actual performance was students' opportunity to show what they had learned.

AB  - The technical barriers to video production are decreasing and the popularity of video as an instructional medium in science is increasing. Although a large body of education research is available to inform the selection and design of instructional videos, this research is dispersed across journals, disciplinary traditions, and STEM fields, and the practical lessons are not readily accessible to readers. To guide the development and critique of science and mathematics instructional videos, our interdisciplinary team, with members from mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, has developed an instrument by synthesizing the relevant education literature and translating it into recommendations for practice. The user-friendly instrument is a 12-item checklist grouped into the categories of content and sequencing (concepts, logic, story, and language), cognitive supports (visualizations, signals, synchronization, segmentation, and streamlining) and affective considerations (relevance, rapport, and accessibility). The instrument provides a conceptual foundation and evaluation framework for designers of educational videos.

AB  - The history of science has a unique value to teaching, and textbooks play an important role in permeating the history of science in science courses. This study aims to compare the presentation of history of science in two versions of high school physics textbooks in China. We selected the 2019 edition of the national and local textbooks as samples. The revised Leite's checklist is used to conduct statistics and comparative analysis on the history of science content in the two versions of textbooks, referred to as the PEP and Luke versions described in more detail in the paper. The results show that, in terms of the quantity and presentation of the history of science, the PEP version contains more history of science, while the Luke version presents the historical content more intuitively. In terms of the type and organization of the history of science, the Luke version describes scientists and the type of evolution in more detail. In the presentation of the history of science, both of the two versions of textbooks are mainly based on texts written by textbook authors, supplemented by pictures of scientists and instruments. In the description of the contexts of the history of science, both tend to use the scientific context to present the history of science. In terms of the status of the history of science content, it mostly acts as a fundamental role in the Luke version while plays a complementary one in the PEP version. As for the learning activities related to the history of science, both tend to set up normal-level activities. The two versions of textbooks are relatively poor in the internal consistency of the textbooks with respect to the historical information and interdisciplinary activity design. Only Compulsory Book 1 of PEP version has the content of history of science as bibliography, and both of the two versions of textbooks seldom have history of science books as its bibliography.

AB  - This research conducted a combined bibliometric and scholastic analysis for characterizing and assessing rectors' academic performance and scholarly impact at public universities in Indonesia. This bibliometric study evaluated the academic performance of 82 rectors of public universities in Indonesia from 93 initial candidates, focusing on 2706 data obtained through triangulation of open and verified data sources. The analysis showed male dominance, disparities in scientific productivity, and a tendency toward "academic inbreeding." In citation analysis, the supremacy of natural science fields, especially Fisheries, Biology, Physics, and Engineering, becomes clear, showing a wider global impact than Accounting, Sociology, and Medicine. The richness and diversity of scientific areas are reflected in a higher range of citations, highlighting multidisciplinary integration and adaptation in responding to global challenges. These results trigger the need for intervention strategies to increase leadership diversity, scientific productivity, and gender equality in Indonesian public universities.

AB  - The authors describe an instructional model of interdisciplinarity that aims to simultaneously develop undergraduate students' disciplinary knowledge and foster integrative skills. Two faculty members taught separate undergraduate courses in history and microbiology during which students came together at multiple points throughout the semester. During these joint sessions, the students integrated disciplinary perspectives to examine the significance of natural disasters for public health. While group assignments initially reflected minimal integrative moves, the final assignments reflected students' progress in interdisciplinary writing. The authors describe the guiding principles that informed this interdisciplinary model and present evidence of student development on integrative tasks.

AB  - Games are a proven tool for learning at all ages and in many contexts. They increase the attractiveness of learning processes through arousing interest and enhancing motivation, and aid with the development of social skills. Educational games provide teachers with different approaches to teaching. 'The Game of the Sea' is an interdisciplinary board game, specifically designed to teach its players about the marine environment, regardless of their age. Through its 68 sections, coloured according to particular topics and organised as a fish shape, players encounter a wide range of questions and activities. Through playing this game, players acquire a broad knowledge of science, the marine environment and its importance, and literature. The game uses an interdisciplinary approach with question cards on a variety of topics (including maths, physics, biology, chemistry, art, etc.). A total of 222 players (111 children, aged 11-15, and 111 adults, aged 18-72) tested the game. These players were enrolled in different formal and non-formal educational contexts and had different educational backgrounds. For a qualitative analysis of game sessions (participant observation), researchers acted as game moderators and, while doing so, made subtle observations of players playing the game. On top of this, the value of the game, as a didactic tool, was evaluated with a test that players took before and after the game. After playing the game, knowledge of the marine environment, increased in both children and adults, with a slightly higher increase in children. Therefore, 'The Game of the Sea' is suitable for teaching all ages about the marine environment. Further, this game can impart to its players the importance of the marine environment and the importance of protecting this environment.

AB  - Researchers in higher education (HE) are a community of academics with backgrounds and experiences in a variety of scientific disciplines. For this reason, HE research is influenced by other disciplines from which HE researchers take theories, constructs and research methods. This article describes a large-scale analysis of the impact of different scientific fields on HE research. Special attention is paid to the analysis of the influences of psychology, sociology & political science, and economics as the disciplines that have the greatest impact on HE research. To assess this impact, we analyse citation patterns in seven key HE journals. Our empirical analysis confirms that HE research is indeed a multidisciplinary field and experiences a different impact of identified scientific fields for HE articles of different topics. We analyse the dynamics of such an impact and discuss the factors that may cause the growth of multidisciplinarity in HE research.

AB  - Hierarchical structure and mechanics are crucial in biological systems as they allow for smaller molecules, such as proteins and sugars, to be used in the construction of large scale biological structures exhibiting properties such as structural support functionality. By exploring the fundamental principles of structure and mechanics at the macroscale, this general theme provides a clear insight into how physics can be applied to the complex questions of biology. With a focus on biopolymer networks and hydrogels, we present a series of interactive activities which cover a range of biophysical concepts at an introductory level, such as viscoelasticity, biological networks and ultimately, hierarchical biomechanics. These activities enable us to discuss multidisciplinary science with a general audience and, given the current trends of research science, this conceptualisation of science is vital for the next generation of scientists.

AB  - This study explored teachers' conceptualizations of integrated computational modeling in secondary physics by exposing twelve experienced physics teachers to programming and then analyzing interview responses. Responses revealed that teachers fell along a spectrum of disciplinary boundary-stretching mentalities. This paper presents a preliminary conceptual framework for exploring both horizontal (interdisciplinary) and vertical (intradisciplinary) boundary stretching, as well as for identifying bounded mentalities as teachers consider integration. Horizontal boundary stretchers envisioned opportunities to use computational modeling to shift their curriculum or pedagogical approaches in physics to help students enhance skills underlying multiple fields, while vertical boundary stretchers considered how computing might allow students to explore physics concepts more deeply. Teachers with more boundary-stretching indicators at the outset of an integrated curriculum development workshop were more likely to persist in the implementation of computational modeling-integrated materials in their physics classrooms than those who expressed more bounded thinking. These findings emphasize the importance of considering teachers' perceptions about how their own science discipline is connected to similar fields and provide implications about how to identify potential adopters of innovative teaching approaches.

AB  - The complexity of modern biology poses challenges in fostering interdisciplinary understanding, particularly between practicing scientists and the public. Furthermore, scientists often lack formal training in science communication, despite various motivations to engage the public. The science literacy of the public in the biological sciences can also vary across socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. Leveraging popular culture and informal learning practices to promote active learning offers promising avenues to enhance public understanding of biological systems. Organized sports hold collective recognition across various communities and cultures, serving as a means to bring people together. Notably, the NCAA March Madness event holds widespread national and international popularity, presenting an opportunity to laterally apply this concept to promote science communication within STEM and biology education. An educational social media and web-based contest tool was developed integrating NCAA-inspired brackets with animal biological systems concepts. The tool featured tournament-style matchups based on animal biological systems, interesting animal facts, and a voting system, all housed within a user-friendly interface. To encourage regular user access to the tool, graphic designs were developed for all social media posts to aid in visual recruitment to the voting website. Based on online metrics, the use of social media garnered repeat users across both the public and educators. The latter noted the tool's simplicity and informative content. Application of this social media and web-based bracket contest tool, which leverages informal settings for active learning for use in biology education, can foster science communication to engage audiences, improve comprehension, and promote interdisciplinary biology education.

AB  - The concept of relative density is introduced in the middle school and high school curricula by an intuitive approach based on the phenomena of immersion and flotation. In high school, the same concept is taught as the ratio between the masses of two bodies of the same volume. This dichotomy of the concept of relative density between the two educational cycles, separately approached, induces initial representations that can constitute epistemological obstacles for its conceptualization and scientific understanding. This study proposes an interdisciplinary approach between chemistry, physics, and mathematics, combining "intuitive understanding" and "mathematical formalism", with the aim of evolving intuitive perceptions toward a scientific understanding of the concept of relative density, based on the sorting of plastic waste. After establishing the conditions of buoyancy, immersion, and sinking, this approach highlights the existence of several types of plastics and their relative density based selective sorting. This experimentation on the buoyancy of solutions on each other and of solids in solutions provides chemistry and physics teachers with an experimental didactic tool to support their interventions in the teaching/learning process of the concept of relative density. This didactic tool has been proven fruitful for a better understanding of the concept of relative density.

AB  - An expanded investment in interdisciplinary research has prompted greater demands to integrate knowledge across disciplinary boundaries. "Vision and Change" similarly made interdisciplinary expectations a key competency for undergraduate biology majors; however, we are not yet synchronized on the meaning of interdisciplinarity, making this benchmark difficult to meet and assess. Here, we discuss aspects of interdisciplinarity through a historical lens and address various institutional barriers to interdisciplinary work. In an effort to forge a unified path forward, we provide a working definition of interdisciplinary science derived from both the perspectives of science faculty members and scientific organizations. We leveraged the existing literature and our proposed definition to build a conceptual model for an Interdisciplinary Science Framework to be used as a guide for developing and assessing interdisciplinary efforts in undergraduate science education. We believe this will provide a foundation from which the community can develop learning outcomes, activities, and measurements to help students meet the "Vision and Change" core competency of "tapping into the interdisciplinary nature of science."

AB  - Interdisciplinary research is gathering increasing support from sustainability scholars, however, there is little dialogue between scholarship on interdisciplinarity and interdisciplinary environmental science education. The aim of this paper is to take stock of the insights of studies of interdisciplinary research to inform environmental research and education. We take as our case study a research centre in Spain, which created an interdisciplinary PhD programme on climate change. The analysis is based on 18 interviews with PhD students and supervisors. We focus on: (1) the need to train experts while redefining expertise outside of disciplinary boundaries; (2) the practical and institutional challenges of interdisciplinarity in the context of PhD training; and (3) the challenges of assessing the quality across disciplines. Our results show that conflicts with institutional requirements lead to a tendency to abandon interdisciplinary aspects and to the training of experts narrowly centred on the specific problem they analyse.

AB  - Rarely are scientific phenomena isolated to a single discipline such as biology, chemistry, physics, Earth science, or others. Rather, these phenomena span multiple disciplines and often require bringing together content and understandings from multiple disciplines to engage with or explain the target phenomena. This study uses a model-based explanations framework to explore high school students' abilities to integrate science content from the disciplines of chemistry and Earth science within the context of generating models to explain a local phenomenon--the urban heat island effect. Students experienced a multiweek instructional unit as part of a larger integrated curriculum that brings together chemistry and Earth science content and features local phenomena to engage students in the scientific practice of modeling. Quantitative and qualitative findings from this study demonstrate students' emerging proficiency with integrating science content, practices, and crosscutting concepts to explain a phenomenon. Students' model-based explanations tended to include phenomenon-relevant components (e.g., physical features of the phenomenon) and sequences (e.g., cause--effect relationships), but tended to include relatively fewer explanatory mechanisms. Implications related to the utility of modeling as a practice-based venue for integrating content from diverse science disciplines are also discussed.

AB  - Sound mathematical knowledge is an essential ingredient for student success in many disciplines, and quality mathematics support is crucial to that success. How that support is delivered is often the key to student engagement, satisfaction and positive outcomes. Many students require sound mathematical knowledge to engage in their discipline activities. Since lack of mathematical skill is a barrier to student retention, progression and self-efficacy, the onus is on the university to provide quality support. This paper describes the expansion of a cross-disciplinary model of mathematics support that has grown to include a suite of programmes that accommodate diverse needs. A previous study evaluated the model's delivery in 2010-2012 for Chemistry, Physics, Biology and Statistics. Since then, not only have these programmes continued to run and expand, new ones have been implemented for further disciplines. After 17 bi-annual iterations, it is timely to investigate the extension of the original model and evaluate whether it continues to address the original objectives. Our findings reveal a high proportion of students who engage in a Maths Skills programme report increased mathematics confidence and skill, and subject pass rates of those who engage are almost always higher than the pass rates of those who do not.

AB  - This article explores results from a 3-year model of laboratory instruction, Project Synapse, that synthesized biology, chemistry, and communication curricula for firstyear science majors at a STEMfocused university. Laboratory biology-chemistry integration was featured at natural intersections where disciplines used similar tools, such as microscopy, or areas where content naturally overlapped, such as the biochemistry of photosynthesis. Communication-related proficiencies, such as lab report writing, were featured across disciplines and in stand-alone writing courses. Faculty perspectives are also part of model analysis using an autoethnographic approach. Primarily qualitative methods were implemented to better understand the participant experience, using Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) as a guiding framework. The most prominent themes that emerged from the data and aligned with statistical findings included the following: (i) The instructors were positioned as collegial teaching and learning partners; (ii) formative lab experiences are pivotal for understanding interdisciplinary nature of science content; and (iii) students viewed communication skills as embedded within science learning.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, many youth felt disconnected from on-the-ground engagement with their peers, their communities, and the wider society. School closures also impeded progress in some students' abilities to write, speak, and express themselves through various media. A team of interdisciplinary and intergenerational faculty and undergraduate students from Merrimack College in Massachusetts sought to investigate and redress these challenges by building young people's interest in engaged citizenship along with their writing, speaking, and team-building skills through a civic engagement program with middle school students, facilitated in collaboration with the local YMCA. In designing and delivering the program, we took an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach that centers the voices of youth in both research and action. Drawing on our team members' disciplines of biology, criminology, education, health sciences, history, human development, and political science, we developed a conceptual framework to co-create a civic engagement curriculum for BIPOC and multilingual youth in a neighboring community that is currently ranked as having the lowest per capita income in Massachusetts. We made a point of incorporating the views of our youngest team members, our students, and also those of the middle school youth we hoped to serve. A focus group that we conducted with the undergraduate students after the first iteration of the program was completed revealed that their understanding of civic engagement and desire and capacity to pursue it were positively impacted as a result of the interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary, and intergenerational collaboration that we describe below.

AB  - Chemistry, with its related technical applications, is of crucial importance for creating a sustainable future. Without chemistry, current challenges will be difficult to solve. Such problems include meeting most of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) announced by the United Nations and adherence to planetary limits, for example, novel chemical substances being released to the environment, biochemical flows, and climate change. Such challenges can, however, only be solved via transdisciplinary approaches. They can never be fully explored by a single discipline only, either in reality or in the context of teaching and learning. In order to strengthen education for sustainable development (ESD), we suggest including geographical perspectives in science education. Geography commits itself to the analysis of human-environment systems and combines social perspectives with those found in the natural sciences. In our opinion, such an approach can increase the educational value of science learning, e.g. in the case of chemistry education. An exploratory interview study with twelve purposefully selected chemistry teachers was recently conducted in order to explore chemistry teachers' views on implementing geographical perspectives. This study reveals that German chemistry teachers view such inclusion as generally positive, but also recognize limitations in the approach due to curricular and time constraints.

AB  - This article explores how global citizenship can be seen in the practices of science education in the context of international education policy and Finnish school and teacher education, with a focus on scientific literacy and sustainability education for promoting a sustainable future. Possibilities of science education to promote sustainability are discussed through teaching examples based on socio-scientific approaches. In addition, transformative science education for sustainability is regarded through competence development taking into account different knowledge dimensions. Solving problems however requires not only knowledge but also communicative and strategic and speculative activity. Thus, education must emphasize the main visions of scientific literacy and transdisciplinary perspectives proposed in the literature, supporting students to understand society and everyday socio-scientific challenges from the local to global level and to deal with differing scientific results and uncertain information. Our article presents findings and conclusions that provide opportunities for further work and provide insights into science and educational sustainability practice.

AB  - This article focuses on the questions of academic freedom, scholar activism, public science, and social engagement. The five authors represent scholars from different disciplines and scientific paradigms as well as diverse gender, sexual orientation, nationality, ethnic, and class backgrounds, yet they share a joint passion for academic 'activism'. The paper, therefore, reflects a multitude of transdisciplinary perspectives and positionalities. This dialogue was born out of the group's desire to investigate the role of scientists in public and political matters, including engagement in social justice. The interdisciplinary nature of the dialogue allows for comparisons between how activism is defined, perceived, practiced, and considered (un)welcome in the disciplines of Sociology, Psychology, Law, Media Studies, and Medical Sciences.

AB  - Background: In the contemporary recent education landscape, an inventive paradigm known as "STEAM" has emerged, which augments the erstwhile STEM framework by incorporating the dimension of "Art". STEAM endeavors to enhance students' capacities for creativity, innovation, and design thinking. Among the various forms of artistic expression, the visual arts, as the earliest form of human expression, play a pivotal role within and beyond the boundaries of the arts, which gives visual arts-based STEAM (VA-STEAM) fundamentally advantageous and potential to enhance student learning in STEM fields. However, many explorers have encountered challenges when embarking upon or sustaining their involvement in VA-STEAM initiatives, primarily stemming from constraints such as an insufficiency of clear instruction, dedicated resources, requisite materials, or adequate temporal provisions for planning and preparation. This paper aims to understand the existing approaches of applying visual art into STEM dominated education system and explore the feasible and efficient way to integrate visual art into current STEM system. This paper aims to understand the existing approaches of applying visual art into STEM dominated education system and explore the feasible and efficient way to integrate visual art into current STEM system through a comprehensive literature review. Methodology: In order to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current status of VA-STEAM to the explorers and interested parties in the related fields, the present literature review delves into the manifold benefits inherent to the existing domain of VA-STEAM education, elucidated illustrative pedagogical instances categorized by subject matter, and delineated prevailing trajectories within the educational landscape pertaining to this domain. 57 articles were identified, from which 49 papers were deeply studied and summarized. Results: Prior research has indicated that the integration of VA-STEAM education holds the potential to yield a spectrum of benefits for students, encompassing improvements in memory retention, facilitation of causal reasoning skills, utilization as a pedagogical tool and resource, cultivation of nuanced artistic cognitive faculties encompassing observation, description, association, and comparison, as well as the enhancement of critical thinking capacities spanning observation, allocation, interpretation, and analysis. Moreover, VA-STEAM facilitates the application of multidisciplinary knowledge and creative thinking in the execution of design-based projects (DBP) or problem-based learning projects (PBL). To better assist teachers in implementing VA-STEAM, this paper summarized existing VA-STEAM teaching examples and multidisciplinary contents by subjects, including related projects or ideas for math & geometry, physical, biology, chemistry, and history classes. Notably, visual art serves as a conduit to express and evaluate STEM concepts, affording students the flexible means to visually depict and communicate complex concepts and ideas that elude verbal articulation. In the interest of supporting educators in the successful integration of VA-STEAM, this study also synthesizes extant teaching instances and interdisciplinary content across subjects, encompassing pertinent projects and concepts tailored to mathematics and geometry, physical sciences, biology, chemistry, and history disciplines. Conclusion: Visual art can be a great entry point to integrate art into STEM curriculums, it can provide a variety of benefits for different subjects. The current trajectory of VA-STEAM initiatives encompasses several key dimensions: (1) the strategic utilization of visual art as a mechanism for facilitating the visualization, exploration, and comprehension of STEM disciplines; (2) the integration of DBP and PBL that foster cross-disciplinary engagement and promote inquiry-driven educational experiences; and (3) the formulation of symbiotic programs characterized by mutual enhancement of STEM and art learning paradigms, yielding optimal outcomes for both domains.

AB  - Non-formal learning environments, such as science museums, have a fundamental role in science education and high potentialities as ideal contexts for science teachers' training. These aspects have been analyzed and reported in several recent works mainly focused on students' perception of science and increased engagement towards scientific disciplines. In this work, a project-based learning methodology optimized and experimented in the frame of a pre-service chemistry teachers' course at the University of Pisa (Italy), during the last eight years, involving in total 171 participants, is presented. This educational project has several distinctive features related to the STEAM philosophy, with a high level of multi-disciplinarity and creativity. Most of the laboratories and chemistry-centered activities were conceived, planned and carried out by the future chemistry teachers in non-formal contexts, such as science museums. A case study based on a series of non-formal laboratories designed by a group of students during their training in the academic year 2018-2019 and performed in a science museum is reported and examined in details. In this paper, all steps of the STEAM project-based learning methodology are described underlining the main learning outcomes and cognitive levels involved in each step and the relevant methodologies proposed during the training course and adopted in the project. The effectiveness of this pre-service teachers' training methodology is finally discussed in terms of participants' motivation and interest towards the course's content, students' final judgment of their training experiences and, in particular, of the STEAM project-based learning activities. From the students' feedbacks and final assessment, the role of the non-formal context in teaching and learning chemistry and the efficacy of developing educational activities related to current and real-life chemistry-centered topics emerged as very positive aspects of the proposed approach.

AB  - We present a new highly interdisciplinary project-based course in computer aided drug discovery (CADD). This course was developed in response to a call for alternative pedagogical approaches during the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused the cancellation of a face-to-face summer research program sponsored by the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network (LBRN). The course integrates guided research and educational experiences for chemistry, biology, and computer science students. We implement research-based methods with publicly available tools in bioinformatics and molecular modeling to identify and prioritize promising antiviral drug candidates for COVID-19. The purpose of this course is three-fold: I. Implement an active learning and inclusive pedagogy that fosters student engagement and research mindset; II. Develop student interdisciplinary research skills that are highly beneficial in a broader scientific context; III. Demonstrate that pedagogical shifts (initially incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic) can furnish longer-term instructional benefits. The course, which has now been successfully taught a total of five times, incorporates four modules, including lectures/discussions, live demos, inquiry-based assignments, and science communication.

The physics community is familiar with the name James Joyce mainly through the word "quark" (onomatopoeic for the sound of a duck or seagull), which Murray Gell-Mann (1929-2019 -- Physics Nobel Prize 1969) sourced from Joyce's "Finnegan's Wake." "Ulysses," however, was ranked number one in 1998 on the Modern Library "100 Best Novels" list and is, in whole or in part, in the literature curriculum in university English departments worldwide. The fact that "Ulysses" contains so much classical physics should not be surprising. Joyce's friend Eugene Jolas observed: "the range of subjects he [Joyce] enjoyed discussing was a wide one … [including] certain sciences, particularly physics, geometry, and mathematics." Knowing physics can enhance everyone's understanding of this novel and enrich its entertainment value. "Ulysses" exemplifies what physics students (science and non-science majors) and physics teachers should realize, namely, physics and literature are not mutually exclusive.

AB  - Previous statistical studies found that polymathic networks of vocational and avocational interest predominate among Nobel Prize winners, discriminating them from less-successful peers. Here we confirm qualitatively and phenomenologically that this multidisciplinarity is a considered creative strategy. Peers often recognize Nobel laureates as "Renaissance" intellects; Nobel Prize committees often award their prizes for transdisciplinarity and integration; Nobel laureates often describe their polymathy as conscious choice to optimize creative potential. That so many Nobel laureates should develop diverse interests and harness them to creative ends is, probably, the result of a confluence of factors. Laureates experience, on average, enhanced access to education; they train differently and more broadly than their peers; they retrain and extend themselves as serious amateurs; and they meld vocational and avocational sets of skills and knowledge into integrated networks of transdisciplinary enterprise. In effect, this combinatorial approach to learning and doing enables them to perceive unusual problems at the intersections of disciplines, to transfer ideas and techniques from one field to another, and/or to synthesize knowledge across domains. Specializing in breadth can be a path to innovation comparable to, and (at least in terms of Nobel Prizes) arguably better than, specialization alone.

AB  - National calls to transform undergraduate classrooms highlight the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). As biologists, we use principles from chemistry and physics to make sense of the natural world. One might assume that scientists, regardless of discipline, use similar principles, resources, and reasoning to explain crosscutting phenomena. However, the context of complex natural systems can profoundly impact the knowledge activated. In this study, we used the theoretical lens of framing to explore how experts from different disciplines reasoned about a crosscutting phenomenon. Using interviews conducted with faculty (n = 10) in biology, physics, and engineering, we used isomorphic tasks to explore the impact of item context features (i.e., blood or water) on how faculty framed and reasoned about fluid dynamics, a crosscutting concept. While faculty were internally consistent in their reasoning across prompts, biology experts framed fluid dynamics problems differently than experts in physics and engineering and, as a result, used different principles and resources to reach different conclusions. These results have several implications for undergraduate learners who encounter these cross-disciplinary topics in all of their STEM courses. If each curriculum expects students to develop different reasoning strategies, students may struggle to build a coherent, transferable understanding of crosscutting phenomena.

AB  - Twenty years into the millennium, the world has been confronted with a pandemic that has had an immeasurable impact on the workplace, learning environment and related technologies. Technology and technological advancements are founded on three disciplines, namely Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science. Internationally, an integration of the curricula of these disciplines are promoted in the education space, as an effective way to achieve 21st century capabilities that lately includes computational thinking. This study explores the changes in the content and alignment of the three subjects in the South African secondary school system from an interdisciplinary framework perspective. Textbooks, curriculum documents and planning calendars provided the information for the content analysis. The content in Physics and Mathematics have remained basically the same, with a few topics removed from Physics and some added to Mathematics. Information Technology has replaced Computer Science, with significant changes in content in alignment with developments in computing technology. No clear indication of an alignment between the disciplines could be found, which, to a certain extent, puts South Africa outside the international frame. The basic education system appears to run an assessment-driven curriculum in Mathematics, Physical Sciences and Information Technology. This system produces poor results and seemingly does not allow for interdisciplinary skills development.

AB  - Among strategies that campus leaders and research administrators employ to spur interdisciplinary research in U.S. higher education, one of the costliest--and increasingly popular--is designated interdisciplinary research spaces and buildings. Yet while interdisciplinary research buildings, often focused on the sciences, stand as significant investments and concrete manifestations of institutional interdisciplinary commitment, empirical research thus far has shed little light on who leads them, the challenges these leaders face, and buildings' broader aims and effectiveness. Using interviews with 26 leaders of and documents related to interdisciplinary research buildings at ten U.S. higher education R1 institutions, this qualitative multi-site case study begins to fill this gap. In probing key issues attending interdisciplinary buildings as a growing tool for research administration and development, this study describes various types of interdisciplinary building leaders; details novel challenges, lessons learned and suggested leadership practices; and explores how leaders already do (and future scholarship might) conceptualize and gauge building effectiveness. In doing so, this work provides novel and timely contributions to the current practice of leading interdisciplinary research efforts and grounds future directions for research.

AB  - The use of transdisciplinary approach to promote learners' interest in the acquisition of natural science at school provides new opportunities for a complex explanation of the phenomenon and improving the quality of the process of learning. The aim of the study is to explore the learners' cognitive interest, personal participation and the approaches chosen by teachers from the perspective of transdisciplinary approach. The study characterises students' subjective evaluations of their personal participation and cognitive interest in the subjects of biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics, and the approaches used by teachers. The participants were 9th grade students from 17 Latvian schools (536 respondents) with the average age of 15.3 (SD=0.63). The results of the study showed that students' evaluations concerning their personal participation in the process of learning were contradictory. They devote little of their free time to the acquisition of science subjects. As to teachers' activity, a variety of teaching approaches are used. According to students' subjective evaluations, the constructivist learning approach corresponds to the trends of sustainable education, whereas the overall context in which the development of learners' cognitive interest in the acquisition of natural science subjects takes place at school highlights issues concerning the sustainable development of the system and the prospects of using the transdisciplinary approach.

AB  - The aim of the paper is the presentation of an interdisciplinary topic that allows applying content knowledge in physics, mathematics and biology in real life environment. Students use to play games and view crime scenes but in common they have little knowledge about the science used during crime scene investigation. In this paper the science background of blood spatter analysis is presented--the physics of non-Newtonian fluids, the biology of blood and mathematics--the measurement and calculation of the angle of inpact, the relationship between height and spatter diameter. This topic was choosen according to the analysis of interviews with secondary and high school learners realized at four schools in Moravia, Czech Republic. The topic can be taught at secondary schools so as at a higher level at high schools. Hands-on activities are included. The teaching strategy supports group work. The appropriateness and reasonableness of the topic was checked in the real teaching process and the activities have had a positive feedback.

AB  - Purpose: To advocate educational improvement science (EIS) as an emerging transdisciplinary field, I reflect on the three major pathways of educational advancement in human history, discern the misuses and pitfalls of reform, and theorize how education can be improved to better serve its mission. Design/Approach/Methods: Employing a multiperspectival approach, I critically re-examine educational reforms and improvements worldwide and conceptualize the emerging transdisciplinary field through an extensive literature review, etymological analysis, international comparisons, and socio-historical,-cultural and-philosophical reflections. Findings: In this paper, I advance the concept of neo-improve mentalism for EIS by elucidating its philosophical assumptions, disciplinary fundamentals, and theoretical frameworks through historical and comparative lenses. I identify and construct disciplinary knowledge of EIS comprising two categories, namely, subject matter knowledge and profound knowledge, adopted from improvement science. I then highlight three methodological approaches of EIS and the building of professional improvement communities empowering individual and institutional improvement capabilities. I propose that EIS is the art of the improving organization for classes, schools, and/or more broadly defined educational agencies. Originality/Value: This study recognizes the significance of EIS and research thereon, especially discipline-building and exploration based on local characteristics in a global vision, and the cultivation of new frontiers of educational research and practices.

AB  - Many current curricula, in going beyond traditional goals, increasingly foster creativity in science classrooms, declaring creativity a core skill of the 21st century. For enhancing creativity in science classrooms, the subject Arts is considered to offer a potential way from STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) to STEAM (STEM with Arts)). The Horizont-2020 project Creations prepared more than 100 creativity-enhancing STEAM modules based on the 5E instructional model. STEM subjects were mathematics, biology, physics, chemistry or technology, and often interdisciplinary for different school and class levels between the ages of nine and nineteen. All modules provided a social environment fostering creativity where students imagine, explore, experiment, test, manipulate, and speculate. Exemplarily, five modules including physics, math, and biology, were selected, for monitoring motivation and creativity. The first was measured on the level of career-motivation and self-efficacy, the latter focused on two sub-constructs: active cognition such as idea processing (ACT), and a mental state of creative immersion (FLOW). Subjects were a sample of 995 students (9-18 years). In summary, no gender impact or age effect appeared in any of the monitored variables. Participation intervened with Self-Efficacy and ACT, while Career Motivation or FLOW did not. Act as a cognitive variable associated with creativity might be more sensitive to changes, whereas Flow as a parameter measuring a state of mind related to emotion appears more stable. Path analysis supported the role of creativity for Career-Motivation by promoting Self-Efficacy. Conclusions for appropriate educational settings to foster STEAM environments are discussed.

AB  - Race for the Red Planet was designed by Daphne Fauber to teach engineering design principles through the contextualization of popular culture, science fiction, and the current race for Mars. The goal of the lesson was for students to learn how people may be living on Mars in the future through a variety of interdisciplinary sources and various mediums. Specifically, students were meant to understand how different subject areas, such as biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering, intertwine in order to give innovators more holistic views of problems and how that informs the design of Mars habitats today. The lesson was designed to last four 50-minute class periods and follows the Modified Five E model for engineering design-based lessons. Students will develop skills associated with "Standards for Technological and Engineering Literacy" 7Y, "Optimize a design by addressing desired qualities within criteria and constraints" (2020). As per the Modified Five E model, the lesson has an Engage, Explore, Explain, Engineer, and Evaluate section. The lesson was designed to be adaptable to different classrooms. Due to the nature of the lesson, the Explore stations can be altered to better reflect other lessons and subject matter that have been taught in the classroom. This lesson provides a unique opportunity to collaborate between departments and make an inter-classroom project that engages all types of students. By connecting science fiction, popular culture, current events, and engineering grand challenges, Race for the Red Planet provides context to the engineering design process in a way that fosters creativity.

AB  - Despite its relevance to all scientific domains, the debate surrounding the teaching of energy is still open. The main point remains the problems students have in understanding some aspects of the energy concept and in applying their knowledge to the comprehension of natural phenomena. In this paper, we present a research-based interdisciplinary approach to the teaching of energy in which the first and second laws of thermodynamics were used to interpret physical, chemical and biological processes. The contents of the three disciplines (physics, chemistry, biology) were reconstructed focusing on six basic aspects of energy (forms, transfer, transformation, conservation, degradation, and entropy) and using common teaching methodologies. The module was assessed with 39 secondary school students (aged 15-16) using a 30-question research instrument and a treatment/control group methodology. Analysis of students' learning outcomes suggests a better understanding of the energy concept, supporting the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary approach in the teaching of energy in physics and science in general. Implications for the teaching of energy are briefly discussed.

AB  - Rate of change concepts from calculus are presented and applied rather differently in college mathematics, physics, biology, and chemistry classes. This is not simply a matter of pedagogical style but reflects real cultural differences between these disciplines. We describe the efforts of our interdisciplinary collaboration to understand and reconcile these differences as we designed and discussed instructional videos for students. We summarize our conversations about terminology, notation, functions, rates, units, and sign conventions across the disciplines. We present some strategies that enabled us to communicate effectively, resolve confusions, and reach shared understandings. Our work has implications for others involved in collaborative interdisciplinary projects and for STEM educators. "In theory, there's no difference between theory and practice. But in practice, there is." -- Benjamin Brewster. Also attributed to Yogi Berra.

AB  - Interdisciplinary education offers a collaborative approach to multifaceted topics, such as environmental sustainability. In this article, we present the conceptual framework and lessons learned from a team-taught course, entitled Sustainability, Energy, and the Green Economy (SEGE). Faculty from the departments of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology offered the course during the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 academic years at Bronx Community College (BCC). The described interdisciplinary approach was intended to engage students through research-driven, project-based learning using life cycle analysis (LCA) of a simple consumer product. By teaching solution-oriented approaches, SEGE translates complex real-world problems into classroom learning for nonSTEM majors. As compared to student performance and engagement data from three 100-level STEM courses at BCC, analyses of C or above grade performance, passing rate, and withdrawal rate indicate that SEGE effectively engaged and retained students. Additionally, student surveys are presented, and were used to guide instructional strategy for effective team teaching and assessment.

AB  - Transforming the chemistry curriculum to an interdisciplinary perspective is essential for preparing students to meet interdisciplinary career demands and to brace themselves for the challenges of complex environmental and health issues. The study introduces four interdisciplinary electrochemistry STEM-lab activities as an alternative to the single disciplinary electrochemistry laboratory curriculum. The electrochemistry STEM-lab activities are designed considering the learning objectives stated in the curriculum specifications. This enables teachers to seamlessly replace the single disciplinary curriculum, which emphasizes the mastery of chemistry concepts, with the interdisciplinary curriculum that stresses applying the concepts in solving complex multidisciplinary real-world problems. The interdisciplinary curriculum allows students to learn electrochemistry concepts considering the mathematics, engineering, and technology disciplines. During the interdisciplinary electrochemistry STEM-lab activities, secondary school students exhibited collaborative teamwork and communication skills. The activities engage them in science and engineering practices, and engineering design thinking. The activities enforce crossing the boundaries between the STEM disciplines to understand the application of principles to manufacture products in industry. Eventually, the activities engender a meaningful learning context that enhances cognitive and affective outcomes.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity has become one of the catchwords in current higher education and science policies, with the underlying rationale being that scientific breakthroughs and solutions to today's global challenges require collaboration across scientific fields. However, several empirical studies have shown that interdisciplinary promises are not necessarily realised in research practices, due to manifold cognitive, epistemic, cultural and organisational barriers. Drawing on interviews with women academics working in health technology in Finland, this paper traces subtle obstacles, hidden power relations and invisible hierarchies in interdisciplinary research work. A special emphasis is placed on understanding intersections of gender and interdisciplinarity, pointing to gendered implications of the current policy rhetoric of interdisciplinarity.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence is widely used across contexts and for different purposes, including the field of education. However, a review of the literature showcases that while there exist various review studies on the use of AI in education, missing remains a review focusing on science education. To address this gap, we carried out a systematic literature review between 2010 and 2021, driven by three questions: a) What types of AI applications are used in school science? b) For what teaching content are AI applications in school science used? and, c) What is the impact of AI applications on teaching and learning of school science? The studies reviewed (n = 22) included nine different types of AI applications: automated assessment, automated feedback, learning analytics, adaptive learning systems, intelligent tutoring systems, multilabel text classification, chatbot, expert systems, and mind wandering detection. The majority of the AI applications are used in geoscience or physics and AI applications are used to support either knowledge construction or skills development. In terms of the impact of AI applications, this is found across the following: learning achievement, argumentation skills, learning experience, and teaching. Missing remains an examination of learners' and teachers' experiences with the use of AI in school science, interdisciplinary approaches to AI implementation, as well as an examination of issues related to ethics and biases.

AB  - A key desired learning outcome of higher education is that students understand the complexities and contexts of, as well as the multiple disciplinary perspectives on, the subjects they are studying. Geography higher education has been particularly adept at meeting this objective. Geographers have played key roles in the development of interdisciplinary areas of studies such as environmental studies, cultural studies, food studies, and science and technology studies, which have increased interest in thematic learning and awareness of the myriad disciplinary perspectives on a particular topic. These efforts, however, have failed to achieve the broader dissolution of siloed disciplinary thinking in classrooms and across the university, leading to proposals for new transdisciplinary frameworks, such as "convergence science." In this paper, we argue that geography, due to its long-standing role as a synthesis discipline, ought to be at the forefront of bringing this new wave of convergence research into education and training programs. We provide an example of a convergence-based and co-instructed course series for graduate students called the Biosocial Studio, led by a geographer in collaboration with bioscientists. We identify two key pedagogical tools that facilitated the learning process -- studio-based teaching and cross-epistemological convergence -- and discuss the internal and infrastructural challenges to their implementation.

AB  - Transition from high school to higher education poses a significant challenge for students, particularly in chemistry, where students' prior laboratory experience is varied. Traditional laboratory education, focusing on chemical knowledge, scientific methodology, and practical skills, does not focus on the development of translational skills and establishing a proper level of self-efficacy, critical for students' success as future scientists. To address this problem, we developed the Chemical Kitchen, a transdisciplinary simulation utilizing the parallels between professional gastronomy and chemistry laboratory practices. By engaging students in creative food experiments that mimic chemistry experiments, the course aims to enhance practical skills in a less intimidating environment. We evaluated the impact of the Chemical Kitchen on students' self-efficacy through pre- and postcourse surveys. We found a significant adjustment in students' self-efficacy: those with initially lower self-efficacy experienced increases, while those with initially higher self-efficacy saw decreases, showing a "leveling of the playing field" among first-year chemistry students. Qualitative feedback highlighted the course's success in providing a fun, engaging, and meaningful learning experience, underscoring the importance of innovative teaching methods in enhancing practical skills and confidence. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the Chemical Kitchen in establishing students' self-efficacy and practical and transferable skills, offering a novel approach to laboratory education that could be beneficial across various scientific disciplines. Future research is encouraged to explore the long-term effects of such interventions on students' engagement with science and their overall development as learners.

AB  - Interdisciplinary science teaching is an issue in various countries. One example in Europe is Germany, especially regarding comprehensive schools. At the same time, German teacher education is primarily subject-specific. An examination of data on self-efficacy beliefs is helpful for understanding the qualifications of teachers for interdisciplinary science. Previous measurement instruments for teaching biology, chemistry, physics, and science lack a literature-based, theory-based, or curricular-valid measurement or a systematic obstacle to overcome. Thus, to meet these requirements, this research developed a draft for a new instrument to measure self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching (SElf-ST). As the theoretical base, the instrument operationalizes a model of pedagogical content knowledge for teaching science and adapts it to self-efficacy beliefs. In a cross-sectional study (N = 114 pre-service and trainee teachers), a ten-factor-solution for self-efficacy beliefs resulted from an exploratory factor analysis (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin-criterion = 0.858, [alpha] = 0.70-0.86). Nine factors are linked to the theoretical model. An additional tenth factor emerged: Teaching Ethically Relevant Issues. Nine factors show low and medium correlations with teaching experience. Eight factors show at least low correlations with self-rated content knowledge in no less than one of the three subjects. In general, science-specific factors show rather low or medium correlations, and generic factors (e.g., Applying Media, and Applying Methods of Evaluation) show low or no correlations. This result is in accordance with the context specificity of self-efficacy beliefs. These results meet most of the research expectations and provide initial indications of the concurrent, curricular, and divergent validity of the SElf-ST instrument. The paper argues for the development of a new, theory-based instrument to measure self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching.

AB  - This book provides an international platform for educators from different STEM disciplines to present, discuss, connect, and develop collaborations in two inter-related ways: (1) sharing and discussing changes and innovations in individual discipline-based education in STEM/STEAM, and (2) sharing and discussing the development of interdisciplinary STEM/STEAM education. Possible relationships and connections between individual disciplines (like mathematics or physics) and STEM education remain under explored and the integration of traditionally individual discipline-based education in STEM education is far from balanced. Efforts to pursue possible connections among traditionally separated individual disciplines in STEM are not only necessary for the importance of deepening and expanding interdisciplinary research and education in STEM, but also for the ever-increasing need of reflecting on and changing how traditional school subjects (like mathematics or physics) can and should be viewed, taught, and learned. Scholars from eight countries/regions provide diverse perspectives and approaches on changes and innovations in STEM disciplinary and interdisciplinary education. Disciplinary and Interdisciplinary Education in STEM will be a great resource to students and researchers in STEM education as well as STEM curriculum developers and teacher educators internationally.

AB  - This paper describes the results of a survey administered to members of the American Association of Physics Teachers and the National Earth Science Teachers Association to measure the nature and frequency of the integration of Earth and space science (E&SS) concepts into physics courses, as well as the need and interest of physics teachers to do so. Data included 92 responses from secondary physics and physical science teachers around the US. Results showed that physics teachers typically include E&SS content during the teaching of universal gravitation, circular motion, and Doppler effect, but that integration is usually limited to contextualized word problems. While the teachers surveyed are highly interested in learning more about E&SS integration, they are limited by time and a scarcity of quality resources.

AB  - Chemistry education research (CER) as a field is inherently interdisciplinary and has traditionally borrowed ideas, frameworks, and methodologies from other fields, such as anthropology, psychology, cognitive science, and science education more broadly. In this paper we encourage researchers to continue this tradition by utilizing the rich body of literature that exists outside of CER, specifically looking to communities interested in mathematics education and physics education to expand the research carried out in our field. Previous work situated in university-level mathematics and physics involves considerations and concerns shared by the chemistry education community, such as integrating conceptual and mathematical reasoning during problem solving. We also briefly discuss and draw attention to a recent ACS Symposium Series book, "It's Just Math: Research on Students' Understanding of Chemistry and Mathematics," that illustrates the rich area of inquiry at the interface of chemistry and mathematics. An overview of frameworks that have been productive for investigating students' mathematical reasoning in a chemistry context is provided, encouraging researchers to engage in work that crosses disciplinary boundaries and promotes discussion between experts from different fields.

AB  - Whereas hackathons are widespread within and outside academia and have been argued to be a valid pedagogical method for teaching interdisciplinarity, no detailed frameworks or methods are available for conceptualizing and organizing educational hackathons, i.e., hackathons dedicated to best achieving pedagogic objectives. This paper is dedicated to introducing EDUCational Hackathons for learning how to solve Interdisciplinary Challenges (EDUCHIC) through: (1) defining the fundamental principles for framing an activity as an EDUCHIC, integrating principles from pedagogical methods, hackathon organization, and interdisciplinarity processes; (2) describing general properties that EDUCHIC possess as a consequence of the interaction of the fundamental principles; (3) developing operational guidelines for streamlining the practical organization of EDUCHIC, including an exhaustive end-to-end process covering all the steps for organizing EDUCHIC and practical frames for carrying the key decisions to be made in this process; and (4) a demonstration of these guidelines through illustrating their application for organizing a concrete EDUCHIC.

AB  - Transdisciplinary research (TDR) is conceptualized as not only providing societal effects but also benefiting academia. However, recent literature on the evaluation of TDR has focused almost entirely on the societal effects of TDR. A discussion of the scientific effects of TDR is needed to do justice to the potential of this research mode. To date, little empirical research has focused on the effects of TDR on science. Our explorative study addresses this gap. The empirical basis are qualitative interviews with scientists engaged in transdisciplinary research and anchored in three sub-disciplines: environmental sociology, sustainable chemistry, and participatory health research. We identify as main effects of the transdisciplinary research mode: changes in the understanding of scientific problems, changes in the quality of scientific insights, and the promotion of a reflexive turn in science.

AB  - 'A lack of prior knowledge in the other discipline' is often given by geoscience instructors to explain why students struggle to apply knowledge from other disciplines to the Earth. We examine this assumption by considering the disciplinary crossing of buoyancy (physics) to isostasy (geoscience). We investigate the teachers' perspective through workshops, and use the theoretical framework of Interdisciplinary Reasoning and Communication to explore what geoscience textbooks ask of students. Most introductory textbooks rely on students applying pre-existing knowledge of hydrostatics in a geoscience context ("forwards transfer"), while intermediate and advanced textbooks develop the necessary physics explicitly in a geoscientific context ("backwards transfer"). Moreover, introductory textbooks frequently use analogies for "concrete translation" between physics and geoscience ideas, but the analogical relations and where they break down ("relational translations"), receive little attention. This places high demands on students' prior understanding of hydrostatics to successfully integrate and transfer knowledge from physics to geoscience. If students lack the relevant physics background, introductory textbooks may force them to rely on intuitive ideas of physics, potentially reinforcing old, and giving rise to new misconceptions. Our results move the focus from perceived shortcomings of students to the demands made on them in interdisciplinary learning.

AB  - Ion channel sensors have several applications including DNA sequencing, biothreat detection, and medical applications. Ion channel sensors mimic the selective transport mechanism of cell membranes and can detect a wide range of analytes at the molecule level. Analytes are sensed through changes in signal patterns. Papers in the literature have described different methods for ion channel signal analysis. In this paper, the authors describe a series of new graphical tools for ion channel signal analysis which can be used for research and education. The paper focuses on the utility of these tools in biosensor classes. Teaching signal processing and machine learning for ion channel sensors is challenging because of the multidisciplinary content and student backgrounds which include physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. The paper describes graphical ion channel analysis tools developed for an online simulation environment called J-DSP. The tools are integrated and assessed in a graduate bio-sensor course through computer laboratory exercises.

AB  - In this research, an educational approach to the concept of energy is proposed. It is based on the history of physics. In 1854 Hermann Hemlholtz gave a popular lecture on the recent discovery that energy is conserved. Such lecture is used as a guide to introduce the pupils within several nuances of this concept. Not much mathematics is used, so Helmholtz's work, with several additions proposed here, is an excellent guide to understanding, from a qualitative point of view, the reasons that led scientists to establish the principle of conservation of energy. At the same time, it allows us to grasp two other concepts which are fundamental in reference to energy: work and heat. This panorama will be drawn in the first section. In the second one, some more mathematical and physical details on the teaching of energy in mechanics and thermodynamics will be offered. Finally, in the Conclusion, the interdisciplinary value of a historical approach to physics education will be pointed out. [For the full proceedings, see ED629086.]

AB  - The integration of biology with mathematics and computer science mandates the training of students capable of comfortably navigating among these fields. We address this formidable pedagogical challenge with the creation of transdisciplinary modules that guide students toward solving realistic problems with methods from different disciplines. Knowledge is gradually integrated as the same topic is revisited in biology, mathematics, and computer science courses. We illustrate this process with a module on the homeostasis and dynamic regulation of red blood cell production, which was first implemented in an introductory biology course and will be revisited in the mathematics and computer science curricula.

AB  - Introductory physics for life sciences (IPLS) courses have emerged as a type of physics course within the introductory courses sequence. The interdisciplinary aspects of these courses as well as the diverse student populations that they serve create significant challenges for instructors who choose to design and deliver them. The Living Physics Portal is a collaborative project, funded by the National Science Foundation, that is designed to support instructors involved in teaching IPLS courses. As part of the project, a survey was administered to document current pedagogical beliefs and practices in teaching IPLS courses. On this survey, 383 instructors (out of 762 respondents) reported that they had taught an IPLS course in the past two years. We analyzed instructor perceptions about the effectiveness of their IPLS courses in engaging students and examined predictors of differences in their perceived course effectiveness. Descriptive statistics showed that there is considerable variability in instructors' perceptions of the degree to which their courses are effective in engaging students. Hierarchical linear regression analyses identified self-reported teaching strategies as independent predictors of perceived course effectiveness, even after controlling for prior teaching experience and community of practice self-perceptions. We present our results and discuss implications for the IPLS community.

AB  - The Coronavirus outbreak allows for a number of possible applications to classroom teaching (biology, computer science, Earth science, physics, statistics), as well as student research. A number of simple models reproduce fairly well the case numbers (total confirmed cases) of the Coronavirus pandemic in specific regions. These models may also be used to predict future cases and can be updated as data become available in a region (city, state, country).

AB  - Energy is considered both as a disciplinary core idea and as a concept cutting across science disciplines. Most previous approaches studied progressing energy understanding in specific disciplinary contexts, while disregarding the relation of understanding across them. Hence, this study provides a systematic analysis of cross-disciplinary energy learning. On the basis of a cross-sectional study with n = 742 students from grades 6, 8, and 10, we analyze students' progression in understanding energy across biology, chemistry, and physics contexts. The study is guided by three hypothetical scenarios that describe how the connection between energy understanding in the three disciplinary contexts changes across grade levels. These scenarios are compared using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results suggest that, from grade 6 to grade 10, energy understanding in the three disciplinary contexts is highly interrelated, thus indicating a parallel progression of energy understanding in the three disciplinary contexts. In our study, students from grade 6 onwards appeared to have few problems to apply one energy understanding across the three disciplinary contexts. These findings were unexpected, as previous research concluded that students likely face difficulties in connecting energy learning across disciplinary boundaries. Potential reasons for these results and the characteristics of the observed cross-disciplinary energy understanding are discussed in the light of earlier findings and implications for future research, and the teaching of energy as a core idea and a crosscutting concept are addressed.

AB  - Students entering health sciences programs may face challenges on their road to successful completion and possible entry to medical school in the area of preparedness in quantitative skills. At our institution, faculty analyzed evidence of these challenges including performance on the ACT Math Test, an in-house math placement test and quantitative tasks for physics and chemistry courses. The authors have used the ARCS (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, Satisfaction) conceptual framework developed by John M. Keller to examine a collaborative effort by our faculty from mathematics, chemistry and physics to design and deliver an interdisciplinary quantitative curriculum in the first 2 years. Preliminary results show high levels of attention, an improvement in student perceptions regarding the relevance of math to science, significant improvements to student confidence in their ability to learn and apply algebra, and reasons for student satisfaction. Faculty reflections indicate that this was a significant and rewarding effort.

AB  - In recent years, several innovations have emerged in the field of education, including Blended-Learning, Massive Open Online Courses, Flipped Classroom and Gamification. In particular, several investigations have highlighted the effectiveness of student response systems, or clickers, in different subjects and disciplines. Although some literature reviews have been published on this subject, none of them offer a review of a large volume of publications from a multidisciplinary approach. Similarly, in the literature there are no studies that have analyzed scientific collaborations on this subject. To respond to these concerns, we proposed the use of a bot to retrieve information from a large number of papers (1696 documents co-authored by a total of 4091 researchers) included in the Scopus database. The disciplines covered include natural sciences, engineering and technology, medical and health sciences, agricultural and veterinary sciences, social sciences and humanities, and the arts. The review of the literature reveals that student response systems are generally well-perceived by teachers and students in all the disciplines. Another interesting result achieved from visual data obtained using network visualization software and word clouds is that student response systems are mainly used in some disciplines, such as physics, chemistry, medicine, and nursing. It is clearly observed that the relationship between researchers from the same country is stronger than between researchers from different countries. Finally, some reflections are included on the role of student response systems in online teaching, especially regarding the changes experienced after the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - It can be difficult to find ways to motivate students while teaching a physics course for non-physics students. Students come to class with many different attitudes and preconceptions, some of which are detrimental to their learning. As physics educators, we strive for student engagement and motivation in course material no matter what type of students we have. One way to pique a student's curiosity is to contextualize the course and relate it to a student's career goals or interest. In this article, a physics course is customized by implementing relevant physics problems to motivate students. Students are given an assignment to create an original physics problem that is applicable to their lives, especially with reference to their career path or special interest. These problems are then assessed and implemented throughout the course with the aim of enabling students to see interdisciplinary connections and creating student motivation. In this article, I argue that this method has brought excitement and value to physics in their lives because they can find this personal relevance. The rationale and process of customizing a university Intro to Physics course (a precalculus-based course) is discussed in detail; however, I believe that this customization can easily be incorporated at the high school level.

AB  - STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) Education is one of the approaches that teachers adopt as they shift from content delivery focused teaching to skills development teaching. Also, effective STEAMING requires connection to issues outside the classroom (outdoor STEAM) and hence the coinage of the term Transdisciplinary Outdoor STEAM. However, research shows that teachers fail to design problems that match the framework of Transdisciplinary outdoor STEAM. In this study, we propose a model for using real-life crises such as COVID-19 or heatwaves or famine to support teachers in their effort to improve teaching practices in the 21st Century. The development of our model was informed by the theoretical framework for Transdisciplinary STEAM proposed by Quigley and colleagues (Sch Sci Math 117:1-12, 2017; J Sci Educ Technol 29:499-518, 2020) and the model for problem mathematical modelling cycle proposed by Blum and Leiß (Mathematical Modelling, pp. 222-231, 2007. https://doi.org/10.1533/9780857099419.5.221). We have also illustrated teaching-learning activities for this model to develop learners' expected skills in STEAM education. We argue that using this model may cater to the lack of educational technologies in low-resource countries and that it will promote an action-oriented spirit among students to deal with crises emerging in their contexts.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the extant research on data science education (DSE) to identify the existing gaps, opportunities, and challenges, and make recommendations for current and future DSE. Background: There has been an increase in the number of data science programs especially because of the increased appreciation of data as a multidisciplinary strategic resource. This has resulted in a greater need for skills in data science to extract meaningful insights from data. However, the data science programs are not enough to meet the demand for data science skills. While there is growth in data science programs, they appear more as a rebranding of existing engineering, computer science, mathematics, and statistics programs. Methodology: A scoping review was adopted for the period 2010-2021 using six scholarly multidisciplinary databases: Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and the AIS Basket of eight journals. The study was narrowed down to 91 research articles and adopted a classification coding framework and correlation analysis for analysis. Contribution: We theoretically contribute to the growing body of knowledge about the need to scale up data science through multidisciplinary pedagogies and disciplines as the demand grows. This paves the way for future research to understand which programs can provide current and future data scientists the skills and competencies relevant to societal needs. Findings: The key results revealed the limited emphasis on DSE, especially in non-STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines. In addition, the results identified the need to find a suitable pedagogy or a set of pedagogies because of the multidisciplinary nature of DSE. Further, there is currently no existing framework to guide the design and development of DSE at various education levels, leading to sometimes inadequate programs. The study also noted the importance of various stakeholders who can contribute towards DSE and thus create opportunities in the DSE ecosystem. Most of the research studies reviewed were case studies that presented more STEM programs as compared to non-STEM. Recommendations for Practitioners: We recommend CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISPDM) as a framework to adopt collaborative pedagogies to teach data science. This research implies that it is important for academia, policymakers, and data science content developers to work closely with organizations to understand their needs. Recommendations for Researchers: We recommend future research into programs that can provide current and future data scientists the skills and competencies relevant to societal needs and how interdisciplinarity within these programs can be integrated. Impact on Society: Data science expertise is essential for tackling societal issues and generating beneficial effects. The main problem is that data is diverse and always changing, necessitating ongoing (up)skilling. Academic institutions must therefore stay current with new advances, changing data, and organizational requirements. Industry experts might share views based on their practical knowledge. The DSE ecosystem can be shaped by collaborating with numerous stakeholders and being aware of each stakeholder's function in order to advance data science internationally. Future Research: The study found that there are a number of research opportunities that can be explored to improve the implementation of DSE, for instance, how can CRISPDM be integrated into collaborative pedagogies to provide a fully comprehensive data science curriculum?

AB  - This study aims to investigate textbook tasks in the Norwegian school subject Natural sciences and the views of science that the tasks mediate to the pupils. Natural science is an interdisciplinary subject taught in Years 1-11 that includes chemistry, physics, biology and parts of the geosciences. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of 2,927 tasks from three Year-11 textbooks. The results showed that most of the tasks in all three textbooks were closed and asked the pupils to reproduce facts from the textbook or other information sources. However, findings also indicated that there are differences between and within the different chapters of the textbooks. In the topics that include socio-scientific issues, the tasks are more open for the pupils to both explore and evaluate evidence. Furthermore, all the three books have an introductory chapter focusing on scientific methodology, and the tasks in this chapter are much more diverse than in the remaining chapters. It therefore seems that the aim of the textbooks is to shed light on the nature of science, but the tasks embedded in the textbooks do not support scientific inquiry and perpetuate the traditional approach of asking learners to provide already determined answers to scientific issues.

AB  - The article deals with the problem of interdisciplinarity impact on higher petroleum education in Ukraine. Different views on the essence of interdisciplinarity, especially in the context of higher petroleum education, have been presented. It has been indicated that many scholars have studied the essence of interdisciplinarity within higher education systems of different countries and identified that interdisciplinarity encompasses a combination or interrelation of various sciences that are embodied in engineering training process. Interdisciplinarity is considered as one of the effective tools to support enthusiasm of young generation for petroleum engineering; to increase motivation of future petroleum experts; and to enhance the efficiency of collaboration between professionals from different fields. In reality, interdisciplinary approach is very often confused with multidisciplinarity when educators give students knowledge from various disciplines without making the link between them into a coordinated whole. It has been concluded that interdisciplinarity or interdisciplinary approach can be regarded as a natural training context in which boundaries between knowledge systems tend to be erased and a new teaching paradigm is required. It has been revealed that implementation of interdisciplinary approach in engineering programmes necessitates the development of such an educational framework that would provide educators with the relevant methods, tools, and models for design of interdisciplinary engineering curricula regarding specific learning outcomes and ensure support for faculty members to improve their own competence in the interdisciplinary issues. The standards and guidelines of international educational interdisciplinarity of degree programmes in petroleum engineering are analyzed in the article.

AB  - Biological organisms function as the result of a multitude of complex physical systems all interacting with one another at different length scales and over different time scales. At stages of education below university undergraduate level, this complexity often prevents the discussion of physics within a biological context, subtly implying that the two fields are completely distinct from one another. With science becoming steadily more interdisciplinary at the level of research, this distinction can therefore be quite counterproductive, and potentially even misleading for students with regard to the nature of the scientific method. To explore the interplay between biology and physics with prospective STEM students, we present a series of formal teaching activities utilising a novel piece of experimental equipment we have designed called BioNetGrid. We are able to use BioNetGrid to cover a range of physical concepts at an introductory level, such as Hooke's law, springs in series and parallel, Poisson's ratio, elastic modulus and energy distribution. These can be presented together with specific biological systems as examples, such as biopolymer networks, enabling a discussion of the importance of biophysics in research at an earlier stage in a student's academic career.

The chemistry-based research projects were carried out as a part of an informal program, in real-world laboratories on 330 high school students from 2010 to 2020 integrating different branches of chemistry, including physical, organic, inorganic, electrochemistry, and biochemistry, in addition to other science and engineering areas. The chemistry subjects harmonize with many science and engineering disciplines, thus providing an immense research scope in various multidisciplinary topics. The data were collected using a mixed method by performing an indirect assessment on the program effectiveness, conducting surveys on students, research assistants, and the research faculty mentors involved in the program. The program was primarily successful in developing students' research self-efficacy and fostering their research competencies in multidisciplinary science. Further research targets to analyze the long-term effect of the multidisciplinary research experiences on their attitudes toward higher education and research-oriented careers that can contribute to a knowledge-based economy.

AB  - Large numbers of Americans of all ages are interested in learning more about climate change education (CCE) (Perkins et al. 2017) and high schools have the opportunity to contribute to that learning. The "Next Generation Science Standards" (NGSS Lead States 2013) attempt to address climate change for high school students across disciplines. Despite the presence of climate change in NGSS, most high schools do not dedicate a class specifically to climate change or even to Earth Science. This leaves the burden of CCE to physics, chemistry, and biology classes, which often make space for it by mentioning the topic in ancillary form. To leave students with applicable knowledge, CCE must be interdisciplinary. This allows students to address the most important questions--ones left out when CCE is just taught from an Earth Science perspective--such as "How might farmers adapt to changing climatic conditions? How might such adaptations affect the price of staple foods, such as corn or wheat?" (Monroe, Oxarart, and Plate 2013). Many articles reference what CCE should do (Chang and Pascua 2017; Monroe, Oxarart, and Plate 2013; Monroe et al. 2017; Reid 2019; Schreiner, Henriksen, and Kirkeby Hansen 2005; Stapleton 2019). None of these lists can be accomplished in passing. A stand-alone climate change course provides time for students to develop needed synthesis and skills and allows teachers in other classes to address climate change as it naturally comes up. In this case study, the authors provide evidence of that demand and propose a path for schools to deliver on it.

AB  - This article describes the design and initial implementation of a multidisciplinary, integrative learning course on the art and science of virtual worlds. The course combines complementary disciplines -- Computing, Physics, and Narrative Art -- in a single general education course for first-year students. The course attempts to incorporate narrative design elements with the scientific considerations and technological tools necessary to create immersive environments. The intended outcome of this course is for students to have an engaging, team-based, interdisciplinary learning experience which will allow them to build their integrative learning skills. The initial offering of the course did not go as planned but provided insight into future course revisions (e.g. more emphasis on coding skills, a shift in technologies used) which may enable the course to better achieve its intended goals.

AB  - Like learning analytics, physics education research is a relatively young field that draws on perspectives from multiple disciplines. Network analysis has an even more heterodox perspective, with roots in mathematics, sociology, and, more recently, computer science and physics. This paper reviews how network analysis has been used in physics education research and how it connects to some of the work in this special issue. Insights from physics education research suggest combining social and interaction networks with other data sources and looking for finer-grained details to use in constructing networks, and learning analytics is promising for both avenues. The discussion ends by looking at the complications with incorporating gender into network analysis, and finally the possibilities for the future.

AB  - Chile implemented a new national quality assurance system for its higher education institutions in 2006 that included a set of policies and procedures for graduate education. Ten years after its implementation, this study looks at the perceived alignments and misalignments between the national accreditation goals and the graduate programs' visions of improvement. By using the concept of loosely coupled systems, we studied eight science and technology master's and doctoral programs at four research-oriented Chilean universities. In total, we conducted 26 interviews, visited all campus sites, and analyzed related documents. The results indicate that the national accreditation system improved academic quality across programs by strengthening the influence of university central administrations and raising faculty productivity standards. In particular, the accreditation meant a push for internationalization, which was welcomed at all institutional levels. However, after a decade, the accreditation system seems misaligned with programs' new improvement efforts, such as the promotion of multidisciplinary work. To some extent, accreditation standards, based on strong disciplinary orientations, penalize a diverse student body and curricular innovation and do not consider the challenges of publishing multidisciplinary research.

AB  - In an academic semester, living in social isolation and under restrictions of the pandemic, we organized weekly multidisciplinary seminars from a postgraduate course program in Curitiba, Southern Brazil, integrating students from different regions of Brazil and South America. Outstanding researchers from Brazil, Germany, France, Argentina, Mexico, Portugal, England, and United States' institutions gave seminars on chronic and infectious diseases with immunological, pharmacological, biochemical, cellular, and molecular biology point of views. The meetings were longer than traditional seminars, containing a part with scientific debate and other with a humanization or deconstruction of the researcher including trajectory, hobbies, scientific, and social thoughts. To facilitate learning and conceptualization, the seminars were available through YouTube and we applied weekly questionnaires to be answered rescuing scientific and motivational topics to give companionship and support to the students in pandemic times. Here, we are defending the creation of permanent platforms for scientific diffusion, with higher accessibility, connecting centers of different levels and giving academic excellence and opportunities for young researchers. Feedback received from participants indicates that this seminar structure can increase confidence and improve their perception of scientific processes and inspire researchers with development trajectories. We have discussed multidisciplinarity, scientific excellence, regional isolation and economic inequality, integration, humanization, and the value of science in society.

AB  - In today's complex and unsettling global landscape, it is crucial to seek, define, and legitimize educational perspectives and research that are underpinned by philosophical paradigms that enable us to respond to unforeseen challenges and effectively address the ever-growing complexity and multiplicity of reality. The evolving nature of education -- in particular -- underscores the urgent need for a paradigm shift. Education itself is in crisis, dominated by unsustainable approaches and narrowly conceived solutions. The main objectives of this study are to provide a summary of the metamodernist paradigm as introduced in previous works and to conceptualize the newly established interdisciplinary principles of metamodernism for the current and future educational research. The theoretical discussion in this paper adopts a constructivist-based integral eclecticism as its methodological framework. Following a concise introduction to metamodernism as an emerging cultural paradigm, the main body of the paper examines the ontological, epistemological, axiological, and methodological dimensions of research through a metamodernist lens. These four aspects of educational research are then contextualized within a broader interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach to educational sciences, emphasizing their relevance to social practice. The paper concludes with a brief discussion on the practical implications of the concepts and conclusions presented.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to explore how elementary preservice teachers' mathematics-science integrated teaching strategies changed as a result of participating in exemplary interdisciplinary activities with multiple themes across school curricula. The participating elementary preservice teachers (n = 28) were recruited for this study from the College of Education students enrolled at a medium-sized southwestern research university in the United States. A qualitative methodology with pre-and-post data collection from open-ended surveys was used in the current study to explore the development of preservice teachers' mathematics teaching strategies with connections to science themed activities before and after an 8-week intervention. In general, the results from the pre-and-post surveys revealed that the preservice teachers' interdisciplinary knowledge of using science-themed activities as instructional approaches for teaching mathematics had remarkable changes across all four science content areas including physics, chemistry, biology, and environmental and space science. This study provided additional empirical evidence on how contextualized mathematics educational activities, in the current case using the association between science and mathematics, can be used as effective teacher education resources for developing teachers' capacity for designing mathematics lessons.

AB  - Contribution: Visual maps that illustrate how mathematics, physics, and electrical engineering classes are connected to each other during the first two years of the electrical engineering curriculum were developed. Key terminology and differences in presentation between fields are discussed. Background: Experience has shown that engineering students struggle when they need to use an approach from their mathematics or physics courses in their first- or second-year engineering courses. In particular, students have difficulty making connections between what they learned in mathematics and physics and how it applies to engineering problems. Improving students' ability to identify the connections between fields could increase student resilience in their engineering coursework. Research Questions: 1) Can visual representations of topic connections between fields across the entry-level engineering curriculum increase student's motivation for learning topics in physics and mathematics and improve their problem solving ability? 2) Are there language barriers or other differences between fields that hinder student learning? Methodology: A multidisciplinary team of faculty members from mathematics, physics, and electrical engineering developed visual representations of the links between the core electrical engineering, physics, and mathematics concepts required to solve problems that students will see in their early electrical engineering coursework. Inconsistencies in terminology or notation were explored and documented. Findings: The developed visual aids, coined systematic approach to problem solving (SAPS) maps, describe a mechanism for linking concepts and skills across the technical courses in the first two years of the electrical engineering curriculum.

AB  - This study focused on the design of interdisciplinary STEAM educational strategies supported by the Internet of Things. The second cycle of a Design-Based Research approach was implemented, refined prior citizen science strategies designed, implemented, and analysed in a co-creation process, in the first cycle. The iterative implementations/evaluations aimed at answer the secondary research questions: How to develop citizen science strategies that foster students' participatory citizenship? Teachers designed citizen science learning materials, emphasizing the co-construction of knowledge and educational practices, under STEAM . Research instruments were used the participants -- students and teachers. A closer look at the data reveals the existence of students' voice amplification with evidence of ' their perception of having an active voice regarding the resolution of community problems after the teachers implement the STEAM educational strategies. This reinforces the need to foster the implementation of relevant participatory citizenship strategies, customized STEAM learning solutions that addressess the issue of low participatory citizenship, to involve students in community issues. A shift in the educational environments is essential within a STEAM approach, engaging students in real-world citizen science projects that encourage cooperation between teachers, stakeholders, and students, thus allowing students' personal and social development within the scope of educational intervention projects.

AB  - A workshop using dance to introduce particle physics concepts to young children is presented. The workshop is realised in the dance studio, the children assume complete ownership of the activity and dance becomes the means to express ideas. The embodiement of the physics concepts facilitates knowledge assimilation, while empowering the students with respect to science. Beyond the scientific and artistic benefits of this workshop, this approach aspires to overcome the barriers between art and science; and open new interdisciplinary horizons for the students.

AB  - Scientific literacy requires students to generalise their scientific understanding to contexts beyond the classroom and engage in effective communication. An interdisciplinary approach with the curriculum areas of science and English could address the increasingly complex and multidisciplinary needs of future citizens. This scoping review targets research concerning written argumentation, which is typically positioned as an educational goal or demonstration of learning in English and science education. The systematic literature search process yielded a total of 260 research outputs, with a total of approximately 54,233 participants included across all outputs. Research themes in science written argumentation research were frequently related to content, scaffolding, and instructional style, while English written argumentation research had a more even distribution of research interests, showing a slight inclination for student characteristics and genre. It is clear that argumentation in science education should move beyond a purely objectivist emphasis on facts to a fuller consideration of perspectives, norms, and rhetorical features in English argumentation to further improve the collective scientific literacy of our learners.

AB  - In this position paper, I examine how the history, philosophy and sociology of science (HPS) can contribute to science education in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. I discuss shortcomings in the ways that history is often used in school science, and examine how knowledge of previous pandemics might help in teaching about COVID-19. I look at the potential of issues to do with measurement in the context of COVID-19 (e.g. measurement of mortality figures) to introduce school students to issues about philosophy of science, and I show how COVID-19 has the affordance to broaden and deepen the moral philosophy that students typically meet in biology lessons. COVID-19 also provides opportunities to introduce students to sociological ways of thinking, examining data and questioning human practices. It can also enable students to see how science, economics and politics inter-relate. In the final part of the paper, I suggest that there are strong arguments in favour of an interdisciplinary approach in tackling zoonoses like COVID-19 and that there is much to be said for such interdisciplinarity in school science lessons when teaching about socio-scientific issues and issues intended to raise scientific literacy.

AB  - We explore the sources of student engagement with curricular content in an Introductory Physics for Life Science (IPLS) course at Swarthmore College. Do IPLS students find some life-science contexts more interesting than others, and, if so, what are the sources of these differences? We draw on three sources of student data to answer this question: (1) quantitative survey data illustrating how interested students were in particular contexts from the curriculum, (2) qualitative survey data in which students describe the source of their interest in these particular contexts, and (3) interview data in which students reflect on the contexts that were and were not of interest to them. We find that examples that make interdisciplinary connections with students' other coursework in biology and chemistry, and examples that make connections to what students perceive to be the "real world," are particularly effective at fostering interest. More generally, students describe being deeply engaged with contexts that foster a sense of coherence or have personal meaning to them. We identify various "engagement pathways" by which different life-science students engage with IPLS content, and suggest that a curriculum needs to be flexible enough to facilitate these different pathways.

This study includes a comprehensive overview of STEAM education and its integration with historical context and explores relationships beyond the acronym of STEAM itself, with an emphasis on STEAM advancements, the humanities, and digital citizenship for contemporary learners. The role of humanities in relation to STEAM is considered for delving into the historical background of robotics, the technological evolution from simple machines to complex tools for machine learning, engineering innovations during Industrial Revolutions, the Renaissance for creativity, and the Maker Movement for makerspaces in fostering innovation. The researchers consider how scientific, technological, engineering, and mathematical advancements have shaped societal development, as well as the historical roles of artistic expression on cultures. An analysis of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary connections among STEAM disciplines within historical contexts creates a holistic educational view of societal evolution. The researchers also reflect on the contemporary implications of historical STEAM developments, advocating for the integration of historical context into STEAM curricula -- and STEAM curricula into the humanities -- for cultivating critical thinking, creative thinking, and a deeper understanding of civilization's interconnectedness.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to understand if a project work methodology proposed to students, based on an inquiry perspective and dealing with different dimensions of sustainable development, contributed to creating an interdisciplinary solution for a problem on sustainability challenged by food production and consumption, and also to understand if this methodological approach is perceived as important to their learning as professionals and citizens. Data were collected by direct observation, a questionnaire applied to the students and students' individual reflections. Design/methodology/approach: This paper aims to present the research results of the impact of a pedagogical approach on students, implemented as a part of the Doctoral Programme in Sustainability Science, which was designed following an innovative model at the University of Lisbon, Portugal. The main drivers include building a new body of interdisciplinary knowledge leading to the application of science to address real problems towards transdisciplinary education. Findings: The results suggest great potential for an inquiry perspective in trying to solve a real problem. Students' proposals were realistic, viable and complementary enough to collectively contribute in response to the global problem. The use of approaches acquired from different areas of knowledge was clear, and the project methodology was well understood. Students considered the experience very rewarding in terms of learning and contributing positively to their personal and professional development. Originality/value: This Doctoral programme is anchored in a progressive continuum encompassing holistic debates with a multidisciplinary team of professors in environments that promote interdisciplinary attitudes and new knowledge, and also project work aimed at guiding students to transdisciplinary learning, which constitutes an innovative form of dealing with the complex challenges created by the science of sustainability.

AB  - This paper describes a set of project-based learning activities focused on a theme of the oceans and marine life. Whilst still providing a clear link to existing physics curricula, the STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) design tasks embrace oceanography's interdisciplinary nature and its scope for allowing students to appreciate the complexity of the real world, affording connections to be made between science and art. By encouraging such links to be made, we exemplify how to effectively communicate to students that imagination and creativity is essential to successful scientific research and we highlight activities that can make physics more accessible, relevant, and interesting to a broader range of students. We also analyse the activities' effects upon the students' attitudes to physics and their spatial ability, manual dexterity, grit, patience and creativity.

AB  - According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015 measurements, Slovak primary school pupils commonly can reach some below average scores in terms of scientific literacy and have less and less positive attitudes towards the natural sciences. Natural sciences and statistics are intertwined disciplines. This implies that there is a room for teachers to try using interdisciplinarity and including basic statistics in the laboratory lessons of natural sciences. The aim of this research paper is to identify the difficulties that can occur when primary pupils collect and process data during a practical research task, combining, here, the knowledge stemming from the natural sciences and statistical reasoning. The research sample consisted of nine primary pupils from grade 1 to grade 4; the average age was 9.44 ± 1.33 years. Pupils were divided into the three age heterogeneous groups who were assigned a laboratory exam. The data were collected via an unstructured participatory observation. The results of our analysis of verbal expressions and practical activities suggest that pupils in our research sample are in the range of levels of nonformal and inconsistent understanding of statistics. In addition, we observed here some characteristics of consistent noncritical understanding. These findings suggest that, with the proper stimulation and frequent research activities requiring the direct activity and involvement of pupils, they could achieve higher levels of statistical literacy as well.

AB  - By arguing for "putting science education in its place," this essay cautions against overstating the role of science education with respect to global crises with technical components, like climate change. At the same time, it challenges the assumption that science education has no role in addressing equally urgent and widespread problems of oppression, like white supremacy. Putting science education in its place implies considering the potential contributions of science education to the unfinished field of critical pedagogy. This essay takes up this potential in discussion with three contributions in the special issue of this journal commemorating the centenary of Paulo Freire. By highlighting science curriculum that is organized around generative themes, this discussion emphasizes transdisciplinarity as a feature of transformative science education. This discussion also points to counternarratives where cultivating critical consciousness and moving toward collectivism are sources of hope and inspiration in the face of overwhelming challenges to our collective well-being.

AB  - Pupil research in school lessons in the sense of Inquiry-Based Education (IBE) is one of the constructivist approaches to education. Inquiry strengthens the positive approach of pupils to natural science subjects, encouraging them to study phenomena and processes taking place in the natural environment around them and use the acquired knowledge in their practical life. Geography as a school subject, due to the multidisciplinary nature of geography as a science, is close to natural sciences as well. This is because of the broadness of the subject of geographical studies, the complex (natural and cultural) landscape. The close links of geography to all cross-sectional themes make it a good support for teaching classical science subjects at schools such as mathematics, physics, chemistry or biology, environmental education. Moreover, the field teaching is one of the strong assets of the implementation of IBE in the school geography. Presented case study on the 'effect of noise on the surroundings' explores the facts mentioned above, in geography teaching. It verifies the pupils' knowledge and skills to adopt the basic principles of IBE in the practice. At the same time, it presents the concrete experiences how the children master the individual stages of IBE during the process of education.

AB  - Issues like why students felt far from physics and did not choose physics as their prime learning option are familiar in education. This paper aims to study the effectiveness of the STEM-Project-Based learning module in physics on students' personal interest and sensemaking and effort. This research used the quasi-experimental model, employing a two-group pre-survey-post-survey design. Quantitative data were collected using the Colorado Learning Attitude about Science Survey (CLASS) instrument at two selected schools in Sabah, Malaysia, and Seoul, Korea. The sample size was 88 Form 4 students in Malaysia and 66 second-year high school students in Korea who learned classical mechanics. The students were divided into two groups, respectively, i.e., the experimental group (Malaysia=44, Korea=33) and the control group (Malaysia=44, Korea=33). Participants in the experimental group were intervened with the integrated STEM-PBL physics module, whilst participants in the control group learned physics through a conventional approach for eight weeks. Participants in both groups were then administered a pre-survey before and post-survey after the intervention. This research showed that the integrated STEM-PBL physics module significantly improved students' personal interest, and sense-making and effort after the intervention. The paper also highlighted the research's implications and suggestions.

AB  - The interface of art and science provides a broad range of educational and collaborative projects at various learning stages. Therefore, the use of historic artists' materials for teaching chemistry is receiving more attention. We prepared and used copper acetate (verdigris pigment) for a series of interconnected, lab-based activities, which can be applied to high-school-level chemistry, to undergraduate general chemistry, and further to heritage conservation science research for emerging art conservators. The synthesis and degradation processes of artists' materials like this pigment allow instructors to illustrate scientific concepts like redox chemistry, while extending the vision of science to arenas beyond the classroom.

AB  - Higher engineering education programmes increasingly include courses characterised by real-world problems and student collaboration in multidisciplinary teams. Research findings demonstrate that students remain limited in perceiving and meaningfully bridging disciplinary differences in these course contexts. Drawing on the literature on boundaries and boundary interactions, this study sought to investigate how applied physics and mechanical engineering students managed their disciplinary differences in a challenge-based learning course. Using a qualitative, case study methodology, data from two multidisciplinary student teams (n = 12) were collected through reflective journals, individual interviews, and observations of team meetings. The findings confirm the value of disciplinary boundaries in creating new learning opportunities. The students coordinated their disciplinary differences during discussions in team meetings, preparations for the project plan and the stakeholder pitch, and test sessions in the lab. Results provide insights for designing similar courses and for future research.

AB  - Systems-level approaches are required for addressing the world's major challenges at the food-energy-water nexus. Taking on complex issues, such as rising food insecurity, malnutrition, and food waste, concomitant with unprecedented levels of stress on environmental systems, will necessitate that future scholars and decision makers be prepared through transdisciplinary student training. However, in higher education, students tend to be siloed within their discipline. In this study, we present a case for the development of transdisciplinary graduate student training based on an inter-institutional and fully remote group of graduate students who assembled during the COVID-19 pandemic to address the issue of food waste. We use our wide-ranging disciplinary backgrounds, high-performance transdisciplinary team training, and stakeholder feedback to develop and conduct a weeklong social media campaign to share educational resources for reducing household food waste. This work offers valuable lessons learned through the student's lens to those seeking to create or improve future transdisciplinary training methods for tackling food waste and other global grand challenges. Key insights from this process include the importance of accountability and open communication when conducting collaborative teamwork, the utility of various mobile and online tools for effectively facilitating remote group work, and the vital role of transdisciplinarity in devising creative solutions.

AB  - Education research tends to exhibit interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary characteristics. Based on the subject areas in Google Scholar, within the 51 disciplines under social sciences, nine subjects are directly related to education (early childhood education, education, educational administration, educational psychology & counselling, educational technology, higher education, science & engineering education, special education, teaching & teacher education). The interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary characteristics of education research make it difficult for researchers to identify the overall development of specific topics within the field. In this paper, we first collect core papers from the field of education. Then, we construct keyword co-occurrence networks using these papers. Finally, based on the density distribution of keyword co-occurrence networks, we analyse changes in network density at each stage of educational research. Last, we identify the development trends of core topics in the education field. Our main contribution is the quantitative methodological design for examining the hot topics and evolution of education research, which is highly multidisciplinary and covers a large volume of publications.

AB  - This paper takes an institutional perspective on the topic of sustainability in order to analyse how this "idea" enters science teacher education through an interdisciplinary approach. It shows how the development and implementation of a course for Danish pre-service teachers was conditioned and constrained by a complex web of interactions in and among the teaching disciplines of biology, geography and physics/chemistry and among the institutions of school, teacher college and university. The data collected are used to identify influences among the disciplines as well as disciplinary differences, conceptualised through a new reference model that separates the analysis from the usual sustainability dimensions. The findings reveal how sustainability as a teaching topic can be a unifying idea in an interdisciplinary setting. Disciplinary differences evidently impact course planning and implementation significantly, but not exclusively. By elaborating on the interactions between these circumstances, the paper provides insight into the processes of developing interdisciplinary teacher education.

AB  - Primary school teachers need adequate professional knowledge and motivational orientations to qualify scientifically and technologically literate students. Previous studies have focused on the impact of coursework on (pre-service) primary teachers' content knowledge, rather than on the development of academic self-concepts. In addition, the influence of the course format and the major field of study has not been investigated much to this date. Thus, this study examines the effects of an interdisciplinary course on pre-service primary teachers' content knowledge and academic self-concepts in science and technology using a quasi-experimental, quantitative, pre-post-follow-up design (n = 202). Whilst no significant changes in knowledge were revealed for the baseline group not participating in the course, significant short-term and long-term cognitive gains were found for the experimental group. Biology-, chemistry-, physics- and technology-related self-concepts increased significantly when participating in the course. The results also indicate that the course format and major field of study can have an impact on the development of pre-service teachers' professional knowledge. Regarding the development of academic self-concepts in the experimental group, it can be assumed that both the weekly and block course format are beneficial for heterogeneous learner groups consisting of pre-service teachers with different major fields of study.

AB  - This article reports on a study investigating how computational essays can be used to help students in higher education STEM take up disciplinary epistemic agency--cognitive control and responsibility over one's own learning within the scientific disciplines. Computational essays are a genre of scientific writing that combine live, executable computer code with narrative text to present a computational model or analysis. The study took place across two contrasting university contexts: an interdisciplinary data science and modeling course at a large research university in the Midwestern United States, and a third-semester physics course at a large research university in Scandinavia. Over the course of a semester, computational essays were simultaneously and independently used in both courses, and comparable datasets of student artifacts and retrospective interviews were collected from both student populations. These data were analyzed using a framework that operationalized the construct of disciplinary epistemic agency across the dimensions of programming, inquiry, data analysis and modeling, and communication. Based on this analysis, we argue that computational essays can be a useful tool for fostering disciplinary epistemic agency within higher education science due to their combination of adaptability and disciplinary authenticity. However, we also argue that educational contexts, scaffolding, expectations, and student backgrounds can constrain and influence the ways in which students choose to take up epistemic agency.

AB  - Science writing is a complex rhetorical activity that enhances disciplinary participation in university education and requires learner-centered, inquiry-based explicit instruction. This study aimed to determine the effects of teaching writing self-assessment of scientific posters on writing quality and academic achievement in a higher education science class. An interdisciplinary team of science and writing scholars designed an action-research intervention based on two 90-min workshops focused on students' self-assessment of writing scientific posters for a first-semester Cell Biology course for prospective teachers of biology and chemistry in secondary schools. Students co-created and applied a checklist to assess writing traits central to scientific communication (e.g. use of reliable references and original figures, inclusion of limitations and projections) in their posters. Promoted writing traits were qualitatively coded in double-blind fashion in posters from 19 teams with similar intakes: 9 teams (45 students, 100% population) in the treatment group and 10 teams (50 randomly selected students, 50% population) from two previous years. Principal component analysis (PCA) and permutation ANOVA were used to quantitatively determine divergence between groups. Results indicated that posters constructed by intervention-treated teams were significantly better in terms of the reliability and retrievability of sources; they also showed a higher number of student-made figures, projections and conclusions. In addition, evaluators' scores for posters increased in the treatment groups, although this did not have a significant impact on overall grades. These results offer empirical support of self-assessment for learning and the use of poster construction as effective pedagogical strategies in science teacher education.

AB  - Advances in nanotechnology have drawn attention to nanotechnology education. The aim of this study is to determine awareness, exposure, and knowledge levels of science (physics, chemistry and biology) teachers about nanoscience and nanotechnology. Teachers (N=624) from secondary schools in Turkey comprised the working group. Descriptive methods were used in data analyses. Awareness and exposure subscales were adopted from the "Nanotechnology Awareness Instrument" developed by Dyehouse et al. (2008), and the knowledge subscale, developed by the authors, was added to the Turkish version. Differences among or between the teachers' awareness, exposure, and knowledge levels regarding nanoscience and nanotechnology were determined. No significant differences were found in levels of awareness, exposure, and knowledge of teachers in terms of subject specialisation and educational levels; however, some significant differences were found in gender, tenure, grade and type of school, in-service training participation, following scientific publications, documentary watching frequency and school localisation variables. In general, nanoscience and nanotechnology awareness, exposure, and knowledge levels of the teachers were at a "neutral" level. This study shows needs for further training of science teachers in nanoscience and nanotechnology, to increase their level of awareness and knowledge and to ensure their preparedness for teaching this topic.

AB  - Background: We examine the development of youth sociopolitical consciousness and agency in an eighth-grade science classroom as students of color engage in critical speculative design activities, exploring the multi-scalar, racial realities and possibilities of the science and engineering of pervasive digital technologies--specifically involving the entanglement of lightwaves and melanin in computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Methods: Through case studies of two girls of color (ES and GS), we analyze the youths' learning pathways across three instructional phases: threading practices (learners' sociopolitical interpretation); weaving practices (learners' coordination of multiple ways of knowing and being in relation to their interpretation); and patternmaking practices (learners' visions of more just patterns, practices, and politics through speculative design). Findings: Our analyses show how youth use their felt, cultural, and community knowledges, as well as their developing scientific knowledge of physics, to confront and analyze manifestations of racial bias in technologies. The findings highlight the significance of teachers' pedagogical support and providing opportunities for meaningful transdisciplinary science investigations and speculative designing for more just and thriving futures. Contribution: The Critical Speculative Design Pedagogy framework developed suggests how such activities in the classroom can cultivate equitable, expansive science learning that is consequential to youth and their communities.

AB  - A science, technology, society, and environmental (STSE) impact assignment framework was developed that bridges the gap between analytical chemistry education and broader societal and environmental contexts. Over the course of [approximately]8 weeks, students were provided with the opportunity to engage in a self-directed learning opportunity to explore an instrumental analytical technique of interest for the analysis of a sample of choice. The assignment, which could be completed as a written report or video presentation, had students investigate not only the scientific principles behind the analytical technique they selected but also the societal implications of their application and potential environmental repercussions. By delving into these broader, multidisciplinary considerations, students were encouraged to think critically, make informed decisions, and recognize the ethical and environmental responsibilities that accompany ongoing developments associated with technological innovation (and instrumental analytical chemistry, in particular).

AB  - Course syllabi are a required component of college and university courses. Syllabi present both broader course structuring practices, are a valuable "first impression" of what instructors want to offer their students, and are used as tools in course design. While best teaching practices suggest specific recommendations for syllabi development, there is little research evidence regarding their structure and use, especially in the context of introductory physics for life sciences (IPLS) courses. IPLS courses typically host students pursuing careers in the biological or health-related sciences, which are rapidly growing majors compared to other STEM degrees. Since few of these students have significant previous experience with physics, the course syllabus provides a first framing and establishment of expectations for them. In this paper, we analyzed how IPLS instructors write syllabi, how they use them in the course design process, and what experienced instructors recommend to be included in the syllabi. Furthermore, based on these analyses we compiled a set of 31 key components (organized in seven categories) for IPLS course syllabi supported by both widespread use and recommendations from experienced practitioners. We present these components and discuss implications for IPLS syllabus design. Specifically, we bring attention to the value of explicitly incorporating interdisciplinary language in syllabi narratives and learning objectives. This work provides guidance for IPLS course and syllabus design, and can also be relevant for modern interdisciplinary courses with features similar to IPLS courses.

AB  - Interdisciplinary teaching and learning is an approach that synthesizes the curricular objectives and methods of two or more disciplines or subjects focusing on a specific topic or issue. While it is being increasingly implemented in universities, at lower levels of education there are still countries where science subjects are taught and learned fragmentarily. To assess the significance of the interdisciplinary approach in primary school biology teaching, the paper aims at an experimental verification of the effectiveness of this method in relation to the quality and retention of student knowledge, compared to the monodisciplinary approach to teaching and learning biology. The paper also describes a scenario for teaching a topic in which biological and geographical contents correlate. The study applied a pedagogical experiment with parallel groups. In total, 180 students attending two primary schools in the city of Novi Sad participated in the experiment and were divided into an experimental and a control group. The findings suggest that the interdisciplinary approach improved the quality and retention of student knowledge. The experimental group was more successful in completing tasks that required comprehension and practical application of knowledge. The study thus emphasizes the need for a professional curriculum development that would enhance the interdisciplinary correlation of various disciplines.

AB  - A growing number of Introductory Physics for Life Sciences courses have been developed to prepare biology, premedicine, and prehealth majors for cross-disciplinary connections between physical principles and biological systems. Many students find it challenging to apply idealized algebra-based general physics to more complex biological systems. A novel biological case study was developed to teach undergraduates to expand their energy transformation analysis of a simple system--a bouncing ball--to a more complex biological system of a kangaroo hopping. Similar to a ball, kangaroos transform elastic potential energy into kinetic energy to power their "bouncing." Unlike the bouncing ball, kangaroos gain additional potential energy through metabolic processes. Students follow a sequence of guided tutorials that facilitate small-group learning as they evaluate quantitative data from video analysis with metabolic energy expenditures from literature to synthesize a real-world understanding of energy transformations. In this article, we describe learning progressions, practical tips for teaching, and lessons learned in this activity covering energy transformations.

AB  - With the emergence of data science as an inherently multidisciplinary subject, there is increasing demand for graduates with well-rounded competence in computing, analytics, and communication skills. However, in conventional education systems, computing & quantitative, and communication skills are often taught in different disciplines. Data storytelling is constructing and presenting data stories to highlight the analytical insights to achieve the communication goals to a specific audience. Digital data storytelling leverages digital storytelling techniques and best practices in communication to deliver stories that can be shared in digital formats to a wide audience. In this paper, we describe and reflect on a semester-long project-based learning pilot using Digital Storytelling as a framework to allow students to explore topics themed around human flourishing and sustainability with the end goal of constructing data stories delivered in digital or video format (i.e., Digital Data Storytelling). The pilot work was conducted in an introductory data science course at a 4-year Minority Serving Institution in collaboration with students studying non-STEM disciplines at a partner community college. Our pilot demonstrates the potential benefit of this sustainability-aware Project-Based Learning design in raising students' awareness of sustainability issues, increasing confidence in cross-disciplinary communication competency, and at the same time deepening their understanding of data science concepts. We further reflect on the significant role of an effective program model as well as challenges and opportunities for building transdisciplinary communication competency to prepare for a diverse data science workforce.

AB  - Photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue was implemented as a laboratory experiment by the undergraduate students majoring in chemical education using graphene (GR)/TiO[subscript 2] as a catalyst. These chemistry preservice teachers synthesized a GR/TiO[subscript 2] composite and used it to degrade wastewater containing methylene blue under simulated sunlight irradiation. The main objectives of this experiment are to introduce cutting-edge science to preservice teachers, train their ability to comprehensively use multidisciplinary science or techniques, and teach the concept of green chemistry and environmental protection. By simplifying the experimental procedures, this experiment may be introduced into chemistry classrooms as a laboratory experiment or demonstration at middle schools and even primary schools because of the limited time required for complete degradation of methylene blue.

AB  - The theoretical model presented in this study explores the transformational potential of a digital Community of Practice (dCoP) within higher education, focusing on Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics (STEAM) education. A dCoP serves as a virtual space for educators to exchange knowledge, foster interdisciplinary collaboration, and construct meaning through discourse. Through the use of digital artifacts, a dCoP provides tangible exemplars for intersecting abstract concepts to real-world applications, thus strengthening educational experiences and outcomes. This study emphasizes the cognitive, social, and emotional skills developed through STEAM education, projecting future career growth for learners in these areas. Establishing a dCoP for teachers in higher education facilitates the transfer of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary skills to students, supporting STEAM learning and future career opportunities. Additionally, this study employs portraiture and autoethnography methodology for storytelling and cybernetic learning. The incorporation of a cybernetic mindset, presented through a theoretical Cybernetic Three-Realm Model, enriches a dCoP by addressing (1) a Canvas for Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL), (2) an Artist's Palette for Authentic Artifacts, and (3) The Paints of Modalities for Learning. This theoretical construct affords a tangible framework for fostering STEAM skills and nurturing leadership development for pervasive learning within higher education dCoPs.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity is becoming increasingly important in education. With the rapidly evolving job market, an interdisciplinary education can prepare students for the flexibility and broad knowledge base required to adapt. At the University of Pisa, we recognized the value of an interdisciplinary educational environment during our participation in the European project EINFOSE, where we harmonized the entry requirements for master programs in Information Science. Prior to this project, we had been building study programs in Digital Humanities and Data Science, whose intersection organically nurtured a diverse learning space. Through this lens, we will reflect on the obstacles constituted by disciplinary barriers and stress the importance of a flexible and open 'ecosystem' for education. These conclusions will be supported by data analysis on the careers of our students over the last eight years.

AB  - It has been shown that active learning strategies are effective in teaching complex STEM concepts. In this study, we developed and implemented a laboratory experiment for teaching the concepts of Boolean logic gates, molecular beacon probes, molecular computing, DNA logic gates, microRNA, and molecular diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, which are related to DNA molecular computing, an interdisciplinary cutting-edge research technology in biochemistry, synthetic biology, computer science, and medicine. The laboratory experience takes about110-140 min and consists of a multiple-choice pretest (15 min), introductory lecture (20 min), wet laboratory experiment (60-90min), and a post-test (15 min). Students are tasked to experimentally construct three molecular logic circuits made of DNA oligonucleotides and use them for the fluorescence-based detection of microRNA markers related to diagnostics of hepatocellular carcinoma. The class was taught to undergraduate students from freshman to senior academic levels majoring in chemistry, biochemistry, biotechnology, and biomedical sciences. Students were engaged during the session and motivated to learn more about the research technology. A comparison of students' scores on the pretest and post-test demonstrated improvement in knowledge of the concepts taught. Visual observation of the fluorescence readout led to a straightforward interpretation of the results. The laboratory experiment is portable; it uses inexpensive nontoxic reagents and thus can be employed outside a laboratory room for outreach and science popularization purposes.

AB  - An interdisciplinary climate change project aligned with Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) was developed and implemented in an undergraduate chemistry course for K-8 preservice science teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Three demonstration activities aligned with NGSS and the Framework for K-12 Science Education are included in this project, which can be adopted and implemented in science classes in primary/middle schools. This project demonstrated to students how to align the activities with NGSS and the three-dimensional framework, as well as how to select phenomena on the basis of local relevant context and using the 5E instructional model in the teaching of the project. The preservice science teachers also learned chemistry concepts related to climate change through the project. Moreover, this project provides the opportunity for instructors to introduce the teaching of NGSS-based science activities to preservice science teachers using phenomena-based learning and a 5E instructional model.

AB  - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education garnered significant attention in recent years and has emerged as a key field of research globally. The goal of this article is to offer a critical review of how STEM education and its transdisciplinarity were defined and/or positioned in empirical studies published during the early formulation of the field. In particular, we sought to identify how these studies conceptualise learners and learning and portray the underlying assumptions in light of the macrosystemic discourses that often serve as ideological forces in shaping research and practice of STEM education. We examined 154 peer-reviewed articles published between January 2007 and March 2018 and analysed them along several emergent dimensions: their geospatial focus, focal disciplinary areas, methodological and theoretical assumptions, and major findings. Grounded in a critical transdisciplinary perspective, we used critical discourse analysis to identify how macrosystemic and institutionalised forces -- overtly and implicitly -- shape what counts as STEM education research, including its goals and conceptualisations of learners and learning. Our analysis highlights the need for aesthetic expansion and diversification of STEM education research by challenging the disciplinary hegemonies and calls for reorienting the focus away from human capital discourse.

AB  - This article examines an outdoor science activity based on Interdisciplinary Teaching and Learning of Science (ITLS) undertaken with a collaborative research methodology as a Research-Practice Partnership (RPP). The activity was implemented in a national reserve in Chile as part of continuing professional development and co-designed by in-service science teachers and researchers. The study had two research questions: 1) How do in-service teachers, working in a RPP, connect and articulate different science topics through methodological and theoretical interdisciplinary perspectives? 2) Can a RPP be a pedagogical resource to generate positive changes in professional development within the practice of managing outdoor science activities? The analysis was qualitative and based on content analysis of data collected from questionnaires about the teachers' perceptions and scientific posters designed by the teachers as part of their course. Teachers were able to connect interdisciplinary topics -- using theoretical and methodological interdisciplinarity -- to solve real problems that arise from the environment within a field trip. In addition, findings reveal benefits of RPP and ITLS, for the management of outdoors activities, supporting the importance and relevance of learning science outside the classroom. However, the boundaries between researchers and science teachers should consider the cultural worlds of participants in the partnerships.

AB  - The complexity of the world's current grand challenges demands interdisciplinary approaches. The education of future scientists must cross the silos of the traditional disciplines; however, there is still a strong reluctance to tear such walls down. Here, we describe an integrative chemical biology course focused on epigenetics that strives to bring research culture to chemistry and biology Master's students. The course, which has been successfully implemented for the past two years, combines three modules: lectures, discovery-based research lab, and science communication. Importantly, the outline of our course design could be easily adapted to different fields, improving the synergy between research and teaching in our universities.

AB  - This case study aims to verify the benefits of theme-based project learning for convergent science experiments. The study explores the possibilities of enhancing creative, integrated and collaborative teaching and learning abilities in science-gifted education. A convergent project-based science experiment program of physics, chemistry and biology with the theme of environment such as seawater and wetland was designed and applied to science-gifted secondary school students in an international science contest. The program was initiated with integration of physics, chemistry and biology, interrelating both field work and laboratory work. Besides, logical discussion and humanistic writing activities with environmental issues were followed. The participants were tasked to conduct hands-on multi-disciplinary projects for both in the fields and laboratories. The projects involve raising creative and critical thinking through interpreting collected data, predicting outcomes, drawing conclusions, and presenting results. The study shows a model of project-based convergent programs for integrated experimental composition to facilitate collaborative and creative learning as well as to improve students' interests in related subjects. The study discusses ways to raise awareness of benefits from multi-disciplinary approaches through theme-based project learning in science-gifted education.

AB  - A large number of articles in the field of science education reflect on scientific literacy as the main goal of science education (SE), although often with varying viewpoints. Nevertheless, researchers have begun to highlight subject-specific teaching practices that are expected to specifically enhance science subject teaching, including biology. The main aim of this theoretical article is to come on consensus and to conceptualise the term biological literacy (BL) more clearly and to present a theoretical concept of BL, composed on the basis of systematically analysed articles. This theoretical concept includes two dimensions of BL: (1) cognitive (cognitive skills, conceptual understanding, biological inquiry) and (2) affective dimension, based on systematic literature review (SLR). This theoretical concept also includes in addition four dimensions of BL: (3) sustainability; (4) interdisciplinarity, (5) career awareness and (6) nature of biology (NOB), based on literature review (LR) of recent decades, that was conducted to write theoretical overview of this research.

AB  - Photosynthesis is the predominant metabolic process for energy obtention in plants. Here we describe a case study where a set of anatomical, biochemical, and molecular characters are used to reconstruct the evolution of the C[subscript 4] photosynthetic pathway, within the evolutionary framework provided by the genus "Flaveria." Our main educational goal was to engage biology undergraduate students to solve a photosynthesis-related phylogenetic problem by stimulating them to assemble informative characters of diverse nature. This case study was successfully implemented as a seminar in a massive university introductory course, during the COVID19 lockdown. Using an online learning environment, most small groups achieved the Students Learning Outcomes, which were assessed through a questionnaire and an open-ended question. Individual performance was also evaluated through a specific exercise in the course's midterm test. Finally, students were surveyed for their perception about the seminar through a poll. We concluded that this seminar could be easily adopted to promote the learning of complex and interdisciplinary content like the C[subscript 4] photosynthetic pathway in undergraduate botanical education, even in a large online introductory course.

AB  - The research orientation of the Department of technics, Faculty of Education, University of Hradec Kralove focuses on finding new ways for development of polytechnic and science education. The research is motivated by the fact that children's interest in technical and science subjects is decreasing in recent years in the Czech Republic. The research aims are to prove the applicability and effectiveness of multidisciplinary methods in teaching of technical and science subjects. The research observed the effect of the use of construction activity in teaching of physics in lower secondary school. The results of research confirmed that working and construction activity can develop technical and science thinking of children. [For the full proceedings, see ED619611.]

AB  - Students in one discipline often receive their scientific training from faculty in other disciplines. As a result of tacit disciplinary differences, especially as implemented in courses at the introductory college level, such students can have difficulty in understanding the nature of the knowledge they are learning in a discipline that they do not identify as their own. We developed a course in introductory physics for life science (IPLS) students that attempts to help them cross disciplinary boundaries. By analyzing student reasoning during recitation sections and interviews, we identified three broad ways in which students in our course meaningfully crossed boundaries: (i) by unpacking biochemical heuristics in terms of underlying physical interactions, (ii) by locating both biochemical and physical concepts within a mathematical bridging expression, and (iii) by coordinating functional and mechanistic explanations for the same biological phenomenon. Drawing on episodes from case-study interviews and in-class problem-solving sessions, we illustrate how each of these types of boundary crossing involves the coordination of students' conceptual and epistemological resources from physics, chemistry, and biology in distinct but complementary ways. Together, these boundary crossing categories form a theoretical framework for classifying student coherence seeking. We explore how the IPLS course helps our life science students fill in the gaps that exist between traditional introductory courses, by finding and exploring questions that might otherwise fall through disciplinary cracks. By identifying these types of explanatory coherence, we hope to suggest ways of inviting life science students to participate in physics and see physics as a tool for making sense of the living world.

AB  - The multidisciplinary fields of public administration (PA), public policy sciences (PP), and nonprofit studies (Nonprofit) contribute in different ways to interdisciplinary knowledge integration in public affairs. At the field and topic level, we examine the variety and coherence of the disciplinary knowledge that each field draws upon when conducting research. Our analyses focus on citations from articles published between 2009--2020 in PA, PP, and Nonprofit journals indexed in Web of Science (n = 991,627). The contributions of each field are shaped by their distinct disciplinary origins. PA is more insular than PP and Nonprofit, in part due to its need to adopt new paradigms because of rapid, substantial shifts in public administration practice. Although Nonprofit achieves relatively more interdisciplinary knowledge integration, public affairs is heavily influenced by knowledge integration in PP. We identify variation in interdisciplinary knowledge integration across research topics and discuss possible explanations for the observed patterns.

AB  - Student-created videos engage students' interests, creativity, and content knowledge and enrich collaborative learning in STEM education. These videos enhance critical thinking and analytical skills, which are essential tools in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This study presents the results of such an assignment across several STEM areas (biology, chemistry, exercise science, information technology, and mathematics) at a minority-serving, liberal arts higher education institution in the southeast region of the United States. Undergraduate students (n = 557) across varied, online course modalities (synchronous and asynchronous) were required to create four problem-solving videos 3-8 min in duration. Assessment tools included a self-assessment of learning gains survey given to control and experimental groups and a post-video creation survey given only to experimental groups. Grade data was also collected from all sections. Comparing the experimental and control groups, students showed a statistically significant gain in their ability to give oral presentations, create videos, and edit videos. Qualitative data from free-response questions corroborate these gains and suggest that students also grew in content knowledge and conceptual understanding through these assignments. Our study implements a multimedia theoretical framework which suggests students learn more effectively from consuming presentations with both auditory and visual components. Our results suggest students see similar gains from producing presentations with both auditory and visual components. Further our results suggest that multimedia production enhances students' presentation skills. From a practical perspective, this study suggests that faculty should incorporate student-created videos in online classes, which typically require oral presentations in person. Faculty are also advised to require oral and visual components within these videos to maximize learning gains from the perspective of a multimedia theoretical framework.

AB  - This paper offers a perspective on the relationship between communities that conduct research on teaching and learning in higher education, focusing on Higher Education Studies (HES) and science Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER). The paper responds to HES debates about the strength of its epistemological base and who belongs to that community, and to a perception that DBER is marginalized in the higher education research context. To explicate our perspective, we describe the origins and trajectories of Physics Education Research and Engineering Education Research, as exemplars of DBER. Using Turnbull, we conceptualize HES and these two exemplars as distinct "knowledge spaces," with different histories, orthopraxes and participants, and hence different unifying principles, research foci and trust mechanisms. We conclude that HES, DBER and other higher education research communities stand to benefit from multidisciplinary engagement with each other, because of their different perspectives on the problems of higher education.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is the unification of philosophy, cognitive science, mathematics, neurophysiology, psychology, computer science, information theory, cybernetics, and uncertainty theory. Therefore, it is feasible and necessary to utilize STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Liberal Arts, and Mathematics) education to learn artificial intelligence courses. Computational thinking skills are of vital importance to high school students. This paper integrates artificial intelligence education with STEAM model with the aim of enhancing students' computational thinking skills. First, we investigate the feasibility of this model and set teaching objectives about artificial intelligence curricula. Second, artificial intelligence curricula with STEAM model is proposed to carry out interdisciplinary artificial intelligence knowledge acquisition. Finally, the effects of this model on students' computational thinking skills, learning motivation, and self-efficacy are evaluated. One hundred thirty-six participants are recruited from a high school in Beijing. The results reveal that the integration of artificial intelligence education with STEAM is able to promote computational thinking skills, learning motivation, and self-efficacy of the students in the experimental group. The main implication of this study is that artificial intelligence education in light of STEAM model can be used as a teaching guide for the combination of artificial intelligence curricula with multi-disciplinary knowledge at the primary and secondary levels.

AB  - This study explores the relationship between engagement with an online, free-to-use question-generation application (PeerWise) and student achievement. Using PeerWise, students can create and answer multiple-choice questions and can provide feedback to the question authors on question quality. This provides further scope for students to engage in discussion about the question with their peers. Data on PeerWise use and examination performance were collected from over 3000 students across six large undergraduate courses (in physics, chemistry and biology) over three academic years in three research-intensive UK universities. A reliable and valid measure of overall PeerWise activity was created and a multilevel model developed describing the relationship between PeerWise activity and student performance in end of course examinations. Using this approach, a significant positive association was found between students' engagement with PeerWise and their academic attainment in end of course exams, even controlling for prior ability. The implications of these findings for educators are discussed.

AB  - University students crave immersive, collaborative, interdisciplinary, applied learning contextualized to real world sustainability challenges. Liberal arts and sciences institutions are particularly well positioned to respond. Here we report on our high impact, cross-disciplinary, biomimicry-themed firstyear experience (FYE) curricula. Biomimicry is an emerging, multidisciplinary approach to innovative problem-solving that seeks to emulate functional biological adaptations to inspire more innovative, efficient, resilient, and regenerative solutions to human challenges. In the classroom, biomimicry fosters higher-order thinking, creativity, and imaginative problem-solving while teaching the fundamentals of functional biology, STEM research, communication, and systems thinking. The highly integrative, skills-focused, experience-based, and philosophy-grounded nature of our curricula is optimized for the liberal arts and sciences FYE mission. Our goal is for students to successfully begin their transition to the liberal arts and sciences undergraduate setting, relate more strongly to the natural world, and draw inspiration for human problem-solving from nature. Merging the first-year seminar and biomimicry pedagogies seems to amplify learning in both areas. We share highlights of our curricula and pedagogy to encourage the development of more nature-based biomimicry first-year seminars promoting global citizenship at other liberal arts and sciences institutions.

AB  - The main aim of this paper is to address the increasing need for science-art integration across all levels of education globally. Specifically, the need to identify a signature pedagogy for the Global Science Opera (GSO) that can be used in teaching and learning contexts in formal and non-formal education. This part of the paper draws upon the seminal work of Lee Shulman (2005) to contemplate and propose a signature pedagogy for the GSO. Contemporary ideas from the science-art teaching and learning sources are also used to develop a sound pedagogical foundation for the approach advocated by the GSO. We argue that the development of a signature pedagogy for the GSO provides clarity around the challenge of developing a standard approach to teaching science through art activities. This paper presents the GSO practices that has the potential influence to reshape science teaching and learning process through art.

AB  - Spatial reasoning is a valuable cognitive tool which enables navigation of the body in relation to other objects in space, permits deconstruction of dimensional forms, allows reconstruction of two-dimensional representations into three-dimensional objects, and facilitates diagramming of processes or concepts. A considerable body of work has suggested that these skills are particularly important for success in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields (reviewed in Wai, Lubinski, & Benbow, "Journal of Educational Psychology" 101: 817-835, 2009); however, much of this data has been derived from studies with relatively narrow populations in terms of participant sex, race, academic ability, or socioeconomic condition and very few of these studies have attempted spatial reasoning training from a diversity of academic disciplines. The current study was designed to assess the influence of a week-long, academically interdisciplinary spatial reasoning Bootcamp on a small, diverse group of female participants' spatial reasoning abilities and to determine if Participants' subsequent performance in organic chemistry and physics coursework differed from that of a Match (non-Bootcamp participant) Control group. The data indicate that Bootcamp participants significantly improved their scores in some commonly accepted measures of spatial reasoning abilities and that Bootcamp participants' final grades in organic chemistry, but not physics, were significantly higher than the Match Control group. The data suggest that intentional programming to improve student spatial reasoning abilities can influence short-term spatial skill performance that may translate into improved success in certain types of subsequent coursework.

AB  - Primary literature searching and the utility of research articles in chemistry teaching and instructions provide connections between conceptual understanding and the application of chemical knowledge. Article citation tracking, an often-neglected dimension in literature exploration, expands information seeking and provides opportunities to track how the reported breakthroughs of a research article are utilized and how the science behind the work progresses. Tracking published works that cite an article can be an effective methodology to gauge the impact of the work not just on the chemical sciences but also on other fields, thus highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of chemistry. The activity reported herein explores the utility of article citation tracking as an exercise for students to realize the potential impact of a published work and how the findings, whether infinitesimal or grand, contribute to creating knowledge and their applications in dealing with contemporary issues. The activity uses citation databases and indexing platforms for the learners to generate information such as the type of documents that cite a paper, the field or subject area of the citing articles, and the evaluation of the reasons for citing the work. Implemented among students taking introductory chemistry classes, encompassing psychology, medical technology, and nursing students, the exercise captures the enhancement of information-gathering skills, effectively incorporating research into classroom instructions and promoting critical thinking among students. Anchoring on an active cognition framework that weaves information and extracts related scientific concepts, this exercise addresses the adoption of strategies serving the global drive for sustainability in science education.

AB  - Science and art are traditionally represented as two disciplines with completely divergent goals, methods, and public. It has been claimed that, if rightly addressed, science and art education could mutually support each other. In this paper I propose the recurrent reference to certain famous paintings during the ordinary progress of physics courses in secondary schools, in order to convey, in a memorable way, some basic features of physics methodology. For an understanding of the overall characteristics of science should be regarded as one of the crucial goals of physics education. As a part of a general education, the forgetting of physics concepts may be acceptable, but failing to grasp the very nature of science is not. Images may help in conveying the nature of science, especially for humanities-oriented students. Moreover, famous paintings, with their familiarity and availability, are a valid tool in facilitating this.

AB  - In massive open online courses (MOOCs), recommendation relationships present a collection of associations that imply a new form of integration, such as an interdisciplinary synergy among diverse disciplines. This study took a computer science approach, using the susceptible-infected (SI) model to simulate the process of learners accessing courses within networks of MOOC offerings, and emphasized the potential effects of a network structure. The current low rate of access suggests that a ceiling effect influences learners' access to learning online, given that there are thousands of courses freely available. Interdisciplinary networks were created by adding recommended courses into four disciplinary networks. The diversity of interdisciplinarity was measured by three attributes, namely variety, balance, and disparity. The results attest to interesting changes in how the diversity of interdisciplinary knowledge grows. Particularly remarkable is the degree to which the diversity of interdisciplinarity increased when new recommended courses were first added. However, changing diversity implied that neighbouring disciplines were more likely to come to the forefront to attach to the interdisciplinarity of MOOC offerings, and that the pace of synergy among disparate disciplines slowed as time passed. In the absence of domain experts, expert knowledge is not sufficient to support interdisciplinary curriculum design. More evidence-based analytics studies showing how interdisciplinarity evolves in course offerings could help us to better design online courses that prepare learners with 21st-century skills.

AB  - This talk provides the speaker's perspective on how the fledgling new area of educational neuroscience has emerged from a disenchantment with brain-based education, through various multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary initiates and collaborations involving educationists and neuroscientists. Specific examples and results pertaining to research in mathematics education will be presented. Beyond the current state-of-the-art, the speaker will conclude with some speculations on what might be anticipated as this area of research continues to unfold into the near and far futures.

AB  - An important step in learning to use math in science is learning to see symbolic equations not just as calculational tools, but as ways of expressing fundamental relationships among physical quantities, of coding conceptual information, and of organizing physics knowledge structures. In this paper, I propose "anchor equations" as a construct to support teaching and learning in introductory physics. I define anchor equation, provide examples, and suggest ways anchor equations can be used in instruction to support the development of students' mathematical sense-making.

AB  - There is growing awareness of the need for mathematics and computing to quantitatively understand the complex dynamics and feedbacks in the life sciences. Although several institutions and research groups are conducting pioneering multidisciplinary research, communication and education across fields remain a bottleneck. The opportunity is ripe for using education research-supported mechanisms of cross-disciplinary training at the intersection of mathematics, computation, and biology. This case study uses the computational apprenticeship theoretical framework to describe the efforts of a computational biology lab to rapidly prototype, test, and refine a mentorship infrastructure for undergraduate research experiences. We describe the challenges, benefits, and lessons learned, as well as the utility of the computational apprenticeship framework in supporting computational/math students learning and contributing to biology, and biologists in learning computational methods. We also explore implications for undergraduate classroom instruction and cross-disciplinary scientific communication.

AB  - Agriculture, food, and/or natural resources (AFNR) content offers a tremendous context for interdisciplinary teaching and learning. Collaboration between AFNR and core content area educators has been recommended to increase interdisciplinarity in school-based AFNR Education; however, existing research lacks an empirical investigation of the relationship between interdisciplinary collaboration and outcomes associated with interdisciplinary teaching in school-based AFNR Education. Therefore, the current study explores the scope of collaboration between AFNR, leadership, mathematics, and science educators and the relationship between collaboration and interdisciplinary teaching in school-based AFNR Education. Findings indicate opportunities to initiate and strengthen interdisciplinary communities of practice through purposeful interactions, especially regarding length of interactions between AFNR and core content area educators. Recommendations for practitioners, teacher educators, and researchers are provided.

AB  - Environmental education (EE) in elementary schools (6 - 15 years old) in Slovakia is not systematically defined, it is often dependent on the voluntary efforts and enthusiasm of teachers. Schoolchildren acquire environmental knowledge in a limited form during the teaching of individual subjects, especially Biology, Geography and to some extent, also Chemistry, Physics etc. In elementary schools, the school subject of EE is absent. Therefore, the aim of the presented study is to find out the current situation in formal and informal EE at elementary schools in Slovakia. We gathered data on formal EE in the form of a google questionnaire survey, in which only 18% of all elementary schools in Slovakia were willing to participate. Through some questions in the google questionnaire, these elementary schools also provided informations about the inclusion of formal, informal and non-formal education at elementary schools. Our SWOT analysis indicate a need for systematic EE in elementary schools, as well as improvements of teaching materials and teacher training in this area. At the same time, we present the EE model at the Rakovec nad Ondavou Elementary School with Kindergarten, which is included in the Green School Network and actively involved in Erasmus projects providing the opportunity to implement part of the study and internships abroad.

AB  - Learning goals and objectives are a key part of instruction, informing curricular design, assessment, and learning. These goals and objectives are also applied at the programmatic level, with program learning outcomes (PLOs) providing insight into the skills that undergraduate biology programs intend for their students to master. PLOs are mandated by all major higher education accreditation agencies and play integral roles in programmatic assessment. Despite their importance, however, there have not been any prior attempts to characterize PLOs across undergraduate biology programs in the United States. Our study reveals that many programs may not be using PLOs to communicate learning goals with students. We also identify key themes across these PLOs and differences in skills listed between institution types. For example, some "Vision & Change" core competencies (e.g., interdisciplinary nature of science; connecting science to society; quantitative reasoning) are highlighted by a low percentage of programs, while others are shared more frequently between programs. Similarly, we find that biology programs at 4-year institutions likely emphasize PLOs relating to computational skills and research more than at 2-year institutions. We conclude by discussing implications for how to best use PLOs to support student learning, assessment, and curricular improvements.

AB  - Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is a growing interdisciplinary field addressing exposures to microbial pathogens and infectious disease processes. Risk science is inherently interdisciplinary, but few of the contributing disciplinary programs offer courses and training specifically in QMRA. To develop multidisciplinary training in QMRA, an annual 10-day long intensive workshop was conducted from 2015 to 2019--the Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment Interdisciplinary Instructional Institute (QMRA III). National leaders in the fields of public health, engineering, microbiology, epidemiology, communications, public policy, and QMRA served as instructors and mentors over the course of the program. To provide cross-training, multidisciplinary teams of 5-6 trainees were created from the approximately 30 trainees each year. A formal assessment of the program was performed based on observations and surveys containing Likert-type scales and open-ended prompts. In addition, a longitudinal alumni survey was also disseminated to facilitate the future redevelopment of QMRA institutes and determine the impact of the program. Across all years, trainees experienced statistically significant increases (P < 0.05) in their perceptions of their QMRA abilities (e.g., use of specific computer programs) and knowledge of QMRA constructs (e.g., risk management). In addition, 12 publications, three conference presentations, and two research grants were derived from the QMRA III institute projects or tangential research. The success of QMRA III indicates that a short course format can effectively address many multidisciplinary training needs. Key features of QMRA III, including the inter-disciplinary training approach, hands-on exercises, real-world institute projects, and interaction through a mentoring process, were vital for training multidisciplinary teams housing multiple forms of expertise. Future QMRA institutes are being redeveloped to leverage hybrid learning formats that can further the multidisciplinary training and mentoring objectives.

AB  - Although undergraduate research experience has proven to have positive effects on student outcomes, such opportunities are not always widely available. Options can be especially limited for early-career engineering students who have limited research experience. One approach to addressing this issue is to partner engineering instructors with active research laboratories to build research experiences into general engineering courses. This article details a collaboration between engineering and chemistry faculty to develop a pipeline of interdisciplinary, research-based projects for second-year engineering students. Chemistry laboratories are a good fit for this approach because they require a wide array of machinery and hardware for experimentation. This work also takes advantage of recent trends toward do-it-yourself labware that has been used with increasing frequency in colleges and universities through expanded access to 3D printing labs. Specifically, we present 3D printing projects as a potential conduit between chemistry and engineering that can enable engineering students to use their design skills to contribute immediately to laboratory projects. Our findings show that this approach allows engineering faculty to meet course objectives while involving students in interdisciplinary research that offers tangible benefits to chemistry laboratories.
