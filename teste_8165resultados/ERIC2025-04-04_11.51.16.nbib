AB  - In this article I present a practical model that primary and secondary teachers might use to help students explore the intrinsic connections between science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The analogy of a Russian nesting doll (matryoshka doll) can be used to stimulate classroom conversations about the nature of STEM and lead to an understanding that there is more to the relationship between these discipline areas than is typically represented in policy documents or the media. The article also aims to provoke conversations among teachers about the strengths and limitations of these relationships and of the analogy itself.

AB  - For six seasons, Richard Lee has included a K-12 teacher on his Antarctic research team to coordinate outreach to U.S. classrooms. These teachers have communicated with thousands of students and their teachers and planned authentic outreach activities to improve student performance. Program success depends on funding by the National Science Foundation, passionate leadership, and five components for launching a successful outreach initiative: recruiting and mobilizing support, introducing Antarctic researchers to students and community, communication using technology, purposefully planning interdisciplinary instruction, and using media and publications to extend the outreach.

AB  - It is one thing to produce an innovative, construct-based assessment task; it's another to produce 10 a year that are comparable in difficulty, measure the same competencies, are free of differential item functioning, and can be scaled and equated. These challenges contributed to the failure of the performance (or authentic) assessment movement of the 1990s to gain much traction for summative uses. Many of those performance assessments were innovative and construct relevant, but failed to meet some fundamental requirements, including efficiency (in terms of cost and time) and psychometric quality (particularly in terms of reliability/generalizability, and form-to-form comparability). How can replicating these problems in the new science assessments be avoided? As Alonzo and Ke (2016, see EJ1122509) suggest, new science assessments will be needed to satisfy the new science standards, but the authors of this commentary suggest that new architectures for these new assessments will probably also be needed. Herein they discuss the uses of assessments, using embedded assessments for certification, and propose linking embedded assessments to standard certification assessments.

AB  - Collaborative international research projects represent excellent opportunities for students to obtain unique and life-altering educational experiences. Dynamic interactions with people from a variety of countries, institutions, and departments, in diverse situations, provides students with new perspectives, encourages them to operate in a multidisciplinary environment, and facilitates real-world problem solving. This article discusses important concepts and issues in geographic education that are based upon real-world experiences in the Himalaya Mountains of India and Pakistan, involving undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral research assistants. Multidisciplinary research/education activities reveal the importance of geography in problem solving and scientific inquiry. This work also highlights numerous issues and curriculum challenges required to establish a scientific foundation in geography, as traditional empirical approaches to geographic education and research frequently hide the complexities of dynamic systems and our world. Students require a multitude of perspectives that incorporate cultural and communication experiences, knowledge synthesis, field and laboratory work, and real-world problem solving. International research experiences can address some of these requirements, so that students can effectively solve problems in an increasingly international and multidisciplinary world. This personal article incorporates numerous examples from physical geography and geographic information science. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - This paper argues that field courses can improve college students' interest and engagement not only in the environmental sciences, but also in the environmental humanities--including environmental history, philosophy, and literature. We base this argument on five years of experience teaching an environmental studies field course through the Wildlands Studies Program in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. In the paper we draw from field notes, discussions with students, correspondence with other instructors, and a survey sent to all of our former students. We conclude that three factors--the field immersion experience, the small group dynamic, and the curriculum design--all contributed to an increase in our students' interest and engagement in the environmental humanities.

AB  - Through the generosity of a Lowes Toolbox for Education Grant and a grant from the Bill Graham Foundation, an interdisciplinary mosaic mural was created and installed at Riverview Middle School in Bay Point, California. The actual mural, which featured a theme of nurturing students through music, art, sports, science, and math, took about three months to complete--one month to make the tiles and two months to put it together. In this article, the author describes how the mural was created--from planning the design to constructing the mural. (Contains 2 online resources.)

AB  - This study investigated the use of interdisciplinary learning activity task to construct students' knowledge in Mathematics, specifically on the topic of scale drawing application. The learning activity task involved more than one academic discipline, which is Mathematics, English Language, Art, Geography and integrating the Brunei Darussalam national philosophy of the Malay Islamic Monarchy. A quantitative method using a pre-experimental design focusing on one-group pre- and post-test design was used for this study. The participants were selected from a convenient sample of 43 Year 9 students in one of the secondary schools in Brunei. The findings were also triangulated with the students' collected reflective journal artifact documents. Each student journal was analyzed using the identified learning activity stages within the RBC-model, where the R denotes "Recognizing," B is "Building with" and C means "Constructing." The results showed an improvement in the students' achievement, and they were able to construct the mathematics knowledge by means of collaboration among group members. Based on the findings, it is recommended that Mathematics teachers be encouraged and supported to design authentic and interdisciplinary learning activity that are learner centered catering to the different needs of our students and also to meet the 21st century skills demand.

AB  - Bridging/foundation programmes are often provided by tertiary institutions to increase equity in access and academic performance of students from under-served communities. Little empirical evidence exists to measure the effectiveness of these bridging/foundation programmes on undergraduate academic outcomes. This research identifies the predictive effect of academic outcomes achieved within a bridging/foundation programme, targeted towards indigenous and ethnic minority students, on first-year degree-level outcomes. Overall performance within the bridging/foundation programme was positively associated with increasing Grade Point Average (GPA), "Core 4" GPA and passing all courses in first year. However, mixed associations were identified between feeder bridging/foundation courses and their intended first year course counterparts. These findings support the continued provision of bridging/foundation education; however, curricular reform within the bridging/foundation programme was required. Key developments included: restructuring course delivery; increasing constructive alignment across the curriculum; increasing cultural content within western science-orientated courses; introduction of cross-curricular assessment and use of additional innovative teaching and learning activities. Additional challenges remain for degree programmes to explore how they can change in order to better support indigenous and ethnic minority student success within first-year tertiary study.

AB  - In this work, a laboratory experiment to introduce graduate students to nanotechnology is described. Students prepared poly(lactic-"co"-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles using two different synthesis procedures, a single and a double emulsion-solvent evaporation method. The students also performed a physicochemical characterization of the prepared nanoparticles (NPs) by determining the hydrodynamic size and zeta potential values through Dynamic and Electrophoretic Light Scattering, respectively. The experiments were designed to be accomplished in two 180 min sessions and have been successfully conducted by 24 graduate students.

AB  - Incorporating research activities at the secondary-school level is an effective method to teach science; however, students and teachers may feel intimidated when trying to identify a suitable research topic. Ideas may be obtained from short articles in periodicals or newspapers to allow students to design their own experiments and interpret data. To illustrate how high-school research projects can be developed from such sources and accomplished with simple techniques and tools, a student-directed project inspired by historical metal-casting methods is described. References to key steps in the process of scientific inquiry are included to demonstrate how simple ideas can yield research questions.

AB  - The impact of developing technologies is also observed in educational environments where many digital content-based applications are used. When the studies conducted are examined, it is seen that the applications where digital content is presented to students constitute the majority. However, considering the 21st century skills, more is needed to give students high-level experiences. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of innovative application, which is applied by the students developing their own digital content within the English course, on their academic achievements, attitudes towards English lessons and attitudes towards computer-aided teaching. The study was carried out at the secondary school level. In the experimental group, a game-based application was made with Scratch, a block-based programming tool within the scope of English lessons. The control group continued its technology-supported education with its current technological infrastructure (interactive board with fiber internet access). The mixed method research design was used in the study. The academic achievement test developed for two different units as the quantitative data collection tool by the researcher, the Attitude Scale for Elementary English Lesson Developed by Bas (2012), and the Computer Assisted Instruction Evaluation Scale developed by Dinçer and Doganay (2016) were used. In addition, semi-structured interview form was used as a qualitative data collection tool. As a result of the research, significant differences were seen in the academic success values of the experimental group, where innovative application was performed. When students' attitudes towards English lesson and their attitudes towards computer-aided education are examined, meaningful results are obtained in favor of the experimental group. As a result, the findings showed that, with the necessary preparations, the innovative application used in this study can benefit students' academic achievements, their attitudes towards English lessons and their attitudes towards computer-aided teaching.

AB  - The integration of career and technical education (CTE) and academic curricular content represents a challenge for CTE professionals. Currently, little is known about the process of integrating science into secondary CTE programs. Grounded theory method was employed to create information about CTE teachers' perspectives of and experiences with the process of CTE and science content integration. From the perspective of the CTE teachers involved, integrating CTE and science content resulted in their programs of study being adapted into something very different than they were before the process of integration was begun. The CTE teachers revealed that evolutions in their programs of study and themselves were associated with three other categories within the grounded theory: connecting; enacting; and futuring. The findings indicate that the process of CTE and science content integration represents a deep and complex episode for CTE teachers. The findings also reveal that the process of CTE and science content integration requires connecting to others, putting ideas into action, and an orientation towards the future.

AB  - This paper is an activity report that draws on the experience of embedding sustainability into the mainstream curriculum in the Language Centre, School of Languages, Cultures and Societies at the University of Leeds, UK. It describes and reflects on programmes that delivered the concept of sustainability and how learners developed their academic and sustainability literacies. The programmes in question are Language for Engineering and Language in Context Sustainability module. These programmes are developed and delivered in the context of English for Academic Purposes to pre-sessional postgraduate and undergraduate international students. The former programme prepares students for their postgraduate studies in the receiving schools, such as Engineering, Computer Science and Transport. The latter is an elective programme for a cross-discipline student cohort primarily to develop language specific to the concept of sustainability. Both programmes focus on expanding subject specific lexis and developing criticality skills. Positive student engagement and response -- student feedback -- is an effective indicator that there is a demand for programmes in the mainstream curriculum that promote sustainability literacies. It is time for sustainability to move from the margins and occupy its place at the forefront in language learning.

AB  - Numerous nanoparticle (NP) fabrication methodologies employ "bottom-up" syntheses, which may result in heterogeneous mixtures of NPs or may require toxic capping agents to reduce NP polydispersity. Tangential flow filtration (TFF) is an alternative "green" technique for the purification, concentration, and size-selection of polydisperse NP suspensions or colloids, in that it allows for real-time analysis and reduces the usage of additional solvent and post-synthetic reagents. Upper-division undergraduate and graduate students in engineering and chemistry successfully applied a three-step TFF process to reduce the polydispersity of Creighton colloidal silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). UV-vis absorption spectroscopy in conjunction with the Lambert-Beer law and Mie's solutions to the Maxwell equations were employed to rapidly estimate the concentration and size of nanosilver in each TFF-fractionated colloidal sample using the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of AgNPs. A thorough emphasis on "green" nanochemistry and its underlying principles were also provided to educate the next generation of environmentally conscious nanochemists and nanoengineers for the ever-expanding nanosectors. The overall laboratory experience was perceived as intellectually stimulating and was highly rated in the student evaluations. This interdisciplinary experiment may be implemented in various nanotechnology, physical, or analytical courses.

AB  - The paper investigates how planetary science could be integrated into other courses, specifically geography and astronomy, at two universities in Hungary and the UK. We carried out both a classroom course and an online course over several years. The methods used and the experiences gained, including feedback from students and useful examples for other educators, are summarized. We found that it is possible to integrate planetary science into geography-related subjects and that planetary science can be used to encourage the students to uncover gaps in their knowledge and also to help to synthesize information they have learnt from different disciplines.

AB  - This article introduces a curricular innovation, the Integrated Health Scholars Program (IHSP), developed to prepare master's-level social work students for practice in integrated health care settings, and presents preliminary findings related to students' self-reported program competencies and perceptions. IHSP, implemented in a research-intensive school of social work in a large midwestern public university, includes specialized course work, interprofessional education across health science disciplines, and field practicum in integrated health care settings. Curricular components support stepwise learning and follows the British Columbia model of interprofessional education learning tiers: exposure, immersion, and skill mastery. Despite IHSPs successful development in a well-resourced, supportive environment, challenges facing our profession's ability to develop and sustain training of MSW students in integrated health care are discussed.

AB  - This paper introduces a mini-symposium on bringing Indigenous ways of knowing together with the teaching of environmental studies and sciences (ESS). Both knowledges share a fundamental interest in the relationship of humans with the Earth, yet until recently, Indigenous ways of knowing have rarely been visible in the teaching of ESS. Teaching with both knowledges can better prepare ESS students for a multicultural world and help them develop a more complex perception of the environment. Such teaching helps address the social justice issue of longstanding marginalization of Indigenous peoples in academia. As ESS explores its boundaries and identity, addressing the many knowledges that lie outside of Western scientific and intellectual frameworks is critical. The authors include faculty and researchers from biological science, plant ecology, integrative science, sustainability, Indigenous environmental studies, and education. They identify as members of specific Native American, First Nations or Aboriginal communities, and/or Anglo-European or European heritages. They hail from public, private, and tribal institutions in the USA and Canada, serving Indigenous and mainstream students. Their papers range from scholarly analyses to conceptual reviews to personal narrative and a Trickster tale. A theme throughout is the need to respect both ways of knowing, dismissing neither science nor Indigenous ways of knowing, but bringing both together. The papers describe significant groundwork in teaching practices, conceptual frameworks, a body of literature, and course and program structures. The authors address the relationship between knowledges, why and to whom this interface is important, the impact of cultural erasure, the necessity for Indigenous voice in the classroom, the teaching/learning process, and directions for further research.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to share the experience gained in, and the efforts made toward, introducing and implementing a new course in the challenging and important area of geophysical signal processing at the Electrical Engineering (EE) Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM), Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The new course, titled "Geo-Signal Processing," was offered both at the graduate level and as a special topics course to undergraduates. The course was developed in collaboration with the Earth Sciences Department at KFUPM. This paper contributes new information because it stresses the multidisciplinary aspects of digital signal processing (DSP) technologies when applied to estimating the Earth's layered structure on the basis of seismic data. Unlike many Earth sciences seismic data processing courses, this Geo-Signal Processing course also emphasizes that the perspective taken by those working in DSP is different from that taken by geophysicists. The course presents DSP with particular emphasis on seismic data signals and the artifacts accompanying them while covering the principles and algorithms needed for processing seismic signals in both deterministic and statistical fashion. Topics include, but are not limited to, basic seismic theory, acquisition of seismic data, analysis of seismic signals and noise, deterministic filtering of seismic data, and statistical processing of seismic data.

AB  - The acronym STEM--the teaching of science, technology, engineering, and math--now a familiar term in education, is evolving into STEAM--STEM plus "A" for art. Educational researcher Martin Storksdieck's studies have shown that infusing art into STEM allows for "a different way of perceiving and knowing and dealing with the world, as a means to expand the toolbox of science and engineering," that can also "free the scientist's and engineer's mind." STEAM is an opportunity for teachers to partner, learn, and teach about the many areas where art and STEM intersect. Paradoxically, as arts electives continue to be eliminated first in budgetary belt-tightening, and as parents continue to dissuade their children from majoring in art, the arts are being recognized as essential to innovation. Innovation, a hallmark of success in STEM and in art, drives quantum advances in all fields. Recognizing that the best art students are those with highly developed intellectual and technical skills, and the best science students are those whose creative imaginations have been nurtured, the authors explore the movement toward collaborating with STEM teachers.

AB  - This phenomenological study examined the impact of Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) teacher-developed curriculum on teaching styles and strategies at two RET sites with common Legacy Cycle training. The study was conducted to assess and document program-specific and National Science Foundation (NSF) goals related to classroom practices and outcomes. We set out to define how the RET program influenced teachers' teaching style and strategies and how teachers' new curriculum from the RET program affected students. Twenty-seven science and math teachers participated in interviews at the end of their summer research experience, and twenty of these teachers participated in interviews after teaching their Legacy Cycle module during the academic year. These interviews were coded for themes and subthemes relating to teachers' teaching styles and their effects on students. Teachers used real-world contexts within their Legacy Cycle curricula and thus began to teach in interdisciplinary ways, exposing students to engineering in the process. According to their teachers, students enjoyed learning with the Legacy Cycle curricula. They took a more active role in the classroom, leading them to be better able to apply their new knowledge. Using the Legacy Cycle as a pedagogical approach in an RET program leads to instructional materials that integrate teachers' research while maintaining use of state and national standards. Teachers perceived that student enjoyment of, and engagement in, the material increased, while also exposing them to engineering.

AB  - This paper looks at the design process of an inquiry-based mathematics and science unit in two urban grade nine classes. Three teachers who teach in an urban, all-girls' junior high school collaborated with math/science and educational experts to design and implement the unit. Results showed the following: teachers needed to be flexible regarding the direction of the unit, collaborating with experts helped teachers to design a more authentic unit, topic selection needed to be carefully considered, and that the resulting unit was worthwhile due to its relevance, richness, and increased student interest and ability to make multidisciplinary connections. Issues with this approach included workload, the amount of time required for planning, and a lack of inquiry-based materials in math.

AB  - The Paterno`-Bu¨chi photocycloaddition reaction is used as the basis for physical-organic final-year undergraduate laboratory experiments designed to emphasize the multidisciplinary approach to modern-day chemical practice. These reactions are performed using commercially available LED-based light sources, which offer a convenient and safe tool for teaching photochemistry. Using a series of substituted benzaldehydes and furan, experiments can be conducted to measure reaction rates and to isolate the products for structure determination. The experiments are deliberately broad in scope, covering mechanistic photochemistry, chemical kinetics, and photochemical organic synthesis in a holistic manner in order to demonstrate to students how topics usually taught separately are brought together. The reported experimental program also offers actinometry and quantum yield determinations, as well as NMR-based structural analysis, as potential routes for further elaboration of the experimental program.

AB  - The study analyses the extent to which the sociological message transmitted by the teachers' pedagogic practice recontextualizes the official pedagogic discourse of the natural sciences curriculum for a Portuguese middle school. Theoretically, the study is based on theories of psychology (e.g. Vygotsky), epistemology (e.g. Ziman) and sociology, with a particular emphasis on Bernstein's theory of pedagogic discourse. A mixed methodology was used in the study. The results suggest the existence of processes of transformation of the message within the Ministry of Education, when passing from the general principles to the specific principles of the curriculum. Transformation is in the direction of decreasing the quality of science education. The results of the curriculum analysis are discussed with regard to specific characteristics studied: metascientific knowledge, scientific knowledge and competences, intradisciplinary relations and evaluation criteria. The results also showed a decrease in the quality of the teaching-learning process when recontextualizing curriculum into pedagogic practices. This is shown by the absence by teachers of recognition and passive and active realization rules in most of the characteristics under study. These processes of transformation of the message are discussed, as well as its consequences in terms of scientific literacy.

AB  - The discovery of DNA is a classic example of the importance of working across content areas. Conceptually, interdisciplinarity can be fuzzy. Thankfully, scholars like Allen Repko and Julie Thompson Klein offer definitions one can build on. Klein (1990) sees interdisciplinarity as a bridge that links different disciplines while restructuring and integrating knowledge on a grand scale. The interdisciplinary approach is not against disciplinary knowledge. It recognizes the disciplines as enabling great sight, but insists that they do not show the whole picture. In the same way that one does not have stereoscopic vision with a single eye, a single discipline's reliance on a solitary viewpoint restricts one's perception. In interdisciplinarity, multiple points of view are essential to create the "aha" moments. By putting diverse disciplines in conversation with one another, spaces open up for making unexpected connections. These connections across content areas usually yield solutions that most people would label as creativity in action. When teachers start making a practice of pairing unrelated content areas, creative breakthroughs occur that transcend existing disciplinary thinking and boundaries. Interdisciplinarity is not antidiscipline. Working both within and beyond a content area does not need to be a source of conflict. The authors contend that teachers must teach who they are and who they aren't to grow as teachers and to serve a wide range of students. This means teachers must work inside and outside their content-area specializations regularly to improve their practice and grow as professionals.

AB  - According to the author, the Modern Language Association's (MLA's) recent publication of the reports "Foreign Languages and Higher Education: New Structures for a Changed World" and "Report to the Teagle Foundation on the Undergraduate Major in Language and Literature" concerning foreign language education has caused many of them to reexamine the language programs at their institutions and reflect on how they measure up against the proposed goals. The challenges with today's foreign language education identified in the 2007 report "New Structures" stem mostly from the two-tiered system where "two or three years of languages sequence feeds into a set of core courses, primarily focused on canonical literature." The authors point out the professional disconnect between the "humanists," who do research, and the "language specialists," who provide technical support and language training. The proposed solution lies in "replacing the two-tiered language-literature structure with a broader and more coherent curriculum in which language, culture and literature are taught as a continuous whole, supported by alliances with other departments and expressed through interdisciplinary courses" ("New Structures"). Furthermore, "New Structures" acknowledges that this transformation has already started taking place and that "foreign language faculty have been working in creative ways to cross disciplinary boundaries, incorporate the study of all kinds of material in addition to the strictly literary, and promote wide cultural understanding through research and teaching." The 2009 "Undergraduate Major" report echoes this position and suggests that in order to fully commit to courses that cut across disciplinary and language boundaries, institutions need "to invest in the interdisciplinary capacity of their faculty members through support of team teaching and faculty development." In this essay, the author discusses an initiative at her institution that through collaborative efforts and faculty development led to the creation of interdisciplinary courses that begin to address the need to broaden the foreign language curriculum.

AB  - This practical article features an arts-integrated science unit on fossils of the Burgess Shale for fourteen elementary/middle school students at a weeklong summer day camp. The day camp had a theme of recycling, reduction and reuse; all of the fossil models had substantial recycled components to support this theme. Next Generation Science Standards were supported by the course activities in which students examined fossil specimens, images, and comparative modern relatives to determine the anatomy and lifestyles of Burgess Shale Cambrian Period fossil animals (e.g., "Olenoides" trilobites, "Anomalocaris," "Canadaspis," "Opabinia," "Wiwaxia," "Hallucigenia") through making scientific drawings and craft models (3-LS4-1), interpreting the environments in which they thrived by creating a diorama (3-LS4-3), considering how populations change as the environment changes (3-LS4-4), and creating a model of a fossil animal using only recycled plastic bottles, lids, pipe cleaners, beads, and sheet foam (3-5 ETS1-1). Students greeted the activities with great enthusiasm, demonstrating their learning of science content by eventually excelling at a fossil hunter game in which people related to paleontology were connected with their fossil finds or products and through responses to oral questions. Plans, results, and example student products document this effective arts-integrated science and engineering unit. Students expressed pride and excitement regarding their creations. Students engaged socially as they excitedly showed one another their creations and discussed their design choices.

AB  - Imagine a classroom where students are actively engaged in seeking scientific knowledge from books and computers. Think of a classroom in which students fervently write to create PowerPoint presentations about their scientific topic and then enthusiastically practice their speaking roles to serve as docents in a classroom museum setting. Visualize a group of students that feel knowledgeable and empowered. Such visions could become reality through the initiation of a museum literacy project. The authors decided to transform their school library into a museum--which one might define as a place where one can view a collection of items of natural, scientific, literary, or artistic value--to display their students' projects generated from their air and weather unit. A museum literacy project provides the opportunity for cross-curricular teaching that links science and literacy in an authentic and meaningful context. In this engaging and creative project, the authors will show how a second-grade teacher collaborated with the school reading specialist for 50 minutes twice weekly to provide literacy instruction and support as the teacher taught concurrent science lessons throughout the week. Although this project was conducted with second graders, it would be a viable project for all students from grades 2-8. (Contains 1 figure and 6 online resources.)

AB  - Cruise planning may seem like an ordinary task for oceanographers, but it actually involves logical and strategic thinking, collaboration, and multidisciplinary work. The "Challenger" expedition, led by Charles Wyville Thomson from 1872 to 1876, was the first to be fully dedicated to understanding oceans (Rice et al. 1999) and was responsible for the discovery of over 4,000 new species. In this activity, the authors encourage students to set their imaginations free by playing the role of the adventurous Thomson to prepare and virtually execute an oceanographic cruise plan and report their findings. The authors use the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (GoM), which includes the Mississippi River Bird-Foot Delta, as a sample location for preparing a cruise plan. The authors encourage teachers to explore other areas such as the Hudson, Congo, or Amazon rivers.

AB  - This study focused on the undergraduate course that covers basic topics in general, organic, and biological (GOB) chemistry at a mid-sized state university in the western United States. The central objective of the research was to identify the main topics of GOB chemistry relevant to the clinical practice of nursing. The collection of data was based on open-ended interviews of both nursing and chemistry teaching faculty and nursing graduate students with clinical practice experience. From the resulting interview transcripts, three categories emerged: (i) topics that are important, having a direct application in nursing clinical practice; (ii) topics that are foundational, facilitating understanding of important topics, but are not directly important in nursing clinical practice; and (iii) topics that are not important, having no direct application and significance in nursing clinical practice. With the data collected, a list of clinically relevant chemistry topics was developed. Information from this study can assist GOB chemistry instructors to better understand which topics to emphasize in their teaching. Representatives of the two cultures, the disciplines of chemistry and nursing, agree that a good understanding of chemistry, with clinical implications, is important for a practicing nurse.

AB  - Fine arts teachers' concerns about male underachievement in a Quebec coeducational high school, and a related survey showing boys' negative perceptions of fine arts motivated this interdisciplinary literature review. Referring to biology and cognitive science, the article explores concepts of sex-related cognitive traits to help in designing sex-adapted approaches to individual learning in art education. The nature-nurture controversy still surrounds sex-based cognitive differences studies, though science agrees that natural and socio-cultural factors are somehow closely interwoven in the complex gender identity construction process. Sex-related biological predispositions influencing cognition are proposed notably in "instrumentality-expressiveness" and "empathising-systemising (E-S)" theories. The article suggests that in the context of art education, these sex-related cognitive models deserve study, because they could initiate sex-adapted teaching strategies with the necessary flexibility and wider scope to overcome gender-stereotyped biases and stimulate boys' interest in the arts. This suggested approach should not be confused with stereotype-based pedagogy, which merely strengthens learned gender characteristics, producing or maintaining academic underachievement.

AB  - In 2014 Wesley College adopted a unified undergraduate program of evidence-based high-impact teaching practices. Through foundation and federal and state grant support, the college completely revised its academic core curriculum and strengthened its academic support structures by including a comprehensive early alert system for at-risk students. In this core, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty developed fresh manifestations of integrated concept-based introductory courses and revised upper-division STEM courses around student-centered learning. STEM majors can participate in specifically designed paid undergraduate research experiences in directed research elective courses. Such a college-wide multi-tiered approach results in institutional cultural change.

AB  - Scientifically literate citizens are able to evaluate news reports on everyday problems with a critical stance to information, which means using both value and norm-based as well as evidence and logic based thinking. Developing a critical stance towards information in the news media, requires familiarity with a complex set of interdisciplinary skills, currently examined by standards in separate content domains. Therefore, our current schooling is limited in preparing future citizens for the combination of multiple skills and both value-based and logic-focused thinking processes. Using an exploratory, descriptive design, this study documented 14 pre-service elementary teacher candidates' critical examination of news media reports as they developed arguments about the use products from Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) discoveries in response to dire human need. The results indicated candidates' difficulties in combining logic focused thinking and the use of factual, "hard" evidence with personal perspectives based on personal values and norms. As a result their integration of evidence to develop well-supported arguments for civic action was limited. The findings suggest the need for additional studies on the evidence-interpretation processes of pre-service teacher candidates. By better understanding the argument and reasoning processes of teacher candidates, we can improve the preparation of our citizens for evidence-based civic action based on news-media reports.

AB  - An exploratory study of a middle school curriculum directly aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards was conducted with a focus on how the curriculum addresses the instructional needs of students with learning disabilities. A descriptive analysis of a lesson on speed and velocity was conducted and implications discussed for students with learning disabilities. Areas of strength are noted, including the use of color-coded equations, teacher demos, visual learning, and inquiry-based labs. It was determined that situations likely to create difficulties for students with learning disabilities include a heavy emphasis on reading and fast-paced, verbally demanding, discussion-based activities.

AB  - The "measure" of this article is a bit different from most--there are almost as many words in the notes as in the body of the text. Notes are a significant part of my writing, both in terms of recognizing the connections and complexities among issues, trying to capture the richness of interdisciplinary teaching, and in terms of strengthening our struggles by (when relevant) referring to each other's work so that our individual work becomes understood as part of collective work to move mathematics education in the direction of the public interest. A quote I love that I often start my talks with, after saying how I talk in parentheses, although eventually closing most of them, is from a Hmong saying that translates "to speak of all kinds of things." It is often used at the beginning of an oral narrative as a way of reminding listeners that the world is full of things that may not seem to be connected but actually are; that no event occurs in isolation; that you can miss a lot by sticking to the point; and that the storyteller is likely to be rather long-winded (Fadiman, 1998, pp. 12-13). Teaching in an interdisciplinary way means that there are a lot of endnotes and a lot of parentheses, not all of which get closed--that is how to do this kind of teaching, without having to know everything and without needing a zillion years to research and teach one lesson.

AB  - Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) teachers teach multiple concepts that lend themselves to possible collaboration on a daily basis. Much like Metz's (2009) insightful discussion about the importance of science educators creating partnerships in the community "outside the school walls," integrative STEM teaching also requires a commitment to strong partnerships "inside the school walls." STEM partnerships face barriers related to the current perceptions and lack of understanding of STEM teaching and learning. However, there are common characteristics and content that unite the STEM areas, especially science and technology. This article establishes the need for collaboration and explores ways science and technology/engineering teachers can collaborate inside the school walls. This article is based on: (1) exploring enacted curriculum of practicing public school STEM teachers; (2) explaining findings from a practitioner-based study focused on the content taught in science and technology/engineering classrooms; and (3) offering suggestions on how science and technology/engineering teachers can create or enhance partnerships to better utilize the strengths of their disciplines.

AB  - Issues of disconnect and isolation from other disciplines seem to plague numerous subjects taught in high schools today. Although they share common roots, mathematics, natural sciences and humanities appeared to have developed rich, but separated curricula with only occasionally emphasized and seemingly weak connections between their respective contents. The absence of truly meaningful context that allows students to build connections to material they are learning often results in procedural, factual and regrettably short-term knowledge. One approach to repair the disarray within our educational structure may be by developing integrated projects that span not only across different facets of one particular subject, but across multiple disciplines as well. Most educational reforms have been strongly supporting the idea of integration of curricula, emphasizing that the noticeable lack of connections between the subjects is affecting not only mathematics, but also language arts, social studies and various other disciplines. The primary purpose of this article is to describe an integrated project that successfully merged the teaching standards of mathematics, social studies and language arts, while utilizing technology as the means to an innovative learning medium for high school students. The focus of the article is the development process of an integrated project, more specifically the obstacles that needed to be overcome for its successful completion. Through this particular example of a mathematics-based integrated project, we demonstrate how content standards of various disciplines can be effectively combined to produce a meaningful teaching and learning context. It is our hope that the presented development process can be generalized and applied in various collaborative teaching efforts.

AB  - Despite the poor outcomes for U.S. students on national writing tests, overall research on how to teach writing is sparse, and this scarcity is more pronounced in the early years of beginning to write. In this study 81,200 we present preliminary findings from Year 1 of a 3-year Institute of Education Sciences-funded Goal 2 project aimed at improving the writing performance of kindergarten children. We designed peer assisted writing strategies (PAWS) and tested its feasibility and promise. Participants for this study were 86 kindergartners ranging in age from 62 to 76 months, recruited from five classes in two different schools. It was feasible for research staff to deliver PAWS, which combined the need to focus early writing instruction on critical transcription skills with an effective learning pedagogy (i.e., peer-assisted learning). Lessons that targeted writing letters focused on formation and fluency, and lessons that targeted spelling focused on teaching letter sound correspondence for spelling decodable words and recognition and spelling practice for sight words. Results indicated that there were statistically significant differences between the PAWS participants and the control children on the alphabet fluency and essay post-test measures. Thus preliminary results indicate that PAWS instruction helped children, on average, improve early writing skills. Directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Context: Interprofessional education (IPE), an emerging theme in health professional education programs, intends to prepare students for collaborative practice in order to improve patient outcomes. In 2012, the profession of athletic training strategically began to increase program participation in IPE. Objective: This article compares 2 studies that examined the presence of IPE in athletic training. Design: Cross-sectional design utilizing similar surveys regarding athletic training program participation in, and readiness for, IPE initiatives were administered via Qualtrics in 2012 and 2015. Patients and Other Participants: Program directors of Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education--accredited athletic training programs were surveyed in 2012 and 2015 using the "Interprofessional Education Assessment and Planning Instrument for Academic Institutions" in addition to program demographic information and IPE participation. Data Collection and Analysis: The participants involved included 160 of 367 surveyed (43.6%) in 2012 and 162 of 380 surveyed (42.6%) in 2015. Results: Data were analyzed, and ?[superscript 2] analysis revealed a significant relationship between level of accreditation and academic unit housing the program in both studies. Significant change was also shown in program participation in IPE from 2012 to 2015. However, institutional readiness and infrastructure for IPE was low in nearly all categories. Conclusions: Interprofessional education has a greater presence in Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education professional programs that reside in health science-related academic units and are accredited at the master's level. However, less than 50% of the programs participate in IPE. There is also a need for greater institutional infrastructure and readiness for IPE.

AB  - Recently, there has been increasing criticism concerning academic computer science education. This paper presents a new approach based on the principles of constructivist learning design as well as the ideas of knowledge transfer in communities of practice. The course "High-tech Entrepreneurship and New Media" was introduced as an interdisciplinary project management lab in which students collaborate in groups to develop software solutions for authentic problems. Main goals were the tighter integration of university and local start-up companies, an intense knowledge transfer on software engineering methods, as well as the implementation of constructivist learning principles in academic teaching. This paper presents the background and structure of the course as well as the results of a formative evaluation. While being successful in introducing a course based on digital-media assisted, constructivist learning arrangements, establishing lasting communities of practice between university and industry is still an open issue. After discussing several reasons, the paper concludes with a list of general recommendations on how to improve the approach and its implementation. (Contains 1 note and 5 tables.)

AB  - The Democracy USA (DUSA) Project was an interdisciplinary experiential-learning project designed to engage students and faculty in the 2012 elections. It was launched in response to the U.S. Department of Education's national call to action ("A Crucible Moment") on civic engagement and democratic education. The project had five key components: affiliated coursework, a colloquium series, extracurricular activities, The American Dream Project, and collecting public opinion data. This article presents an analysis of pre- and posttest data collected from over 500 students at a midsize southern liberal arts college during the Fall 2012 semester. The findings underscore the importance of varied approaches and interdisciplinary collaborations to engage students in the democratic process. We find that students enrolled in DUSA classes demonstrated little change in their civic engagement. However, those who participated in cocurricular programming, extracurricular activities, or learned about the program during the semester exhibited changes in both their political skills and willingness to participate in politics.

AB  - This descriptive case study examined student attitudes, writing skills and content knowledge of urban fourth and fifth graders (6 males, 9 female) during a six-week literacy, thinking skill, and art-integrated environmental science unit. Pre- and post-test questions were used to address knowledge of environmental problems and student environmental actions. Students expressed knowledge and suggestions for positive action of youth through four essays throughout the unit, the final essay being accompanied by a pop-up construction. Writings showed steady growth in number of words, sentences, suggested environmental actions for youth, and instances of discussing consequences and sequels of actions. Students were engaged, collaborative, and reported implementing positive environmental actions.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to review the literature published during the last 20 years that investigates the impact of approaches that describe themselves as integrating science and language arts on student learning and/or attitude at the elementary level. The majority of papers report that integrated approaches led to greater student achievement in science and language arts across elementary grade levels. Additionally, integrated approaches facilitate improved attitudes toward both science and reading. The second section of the findings provides an overview of the types of pedagogical approaches used in the classrooms described in the studies. At all grade levels, teachers linked a variety of strategies including read-alouds, independent reading, at home reading, and writing in various genres that connected hands-on science activities to language arts skills.

AB  - When we think of communities of the future, we have to think of new social contracts between universities and society with a different ecology, and an intense compatibility towards transdisciplinarity. We know that today there is a need for truly fundamental reflections and questions on knowledge as the building block of global societies worldwide. But we suffer from a lack of clear understanding of what is the "definition" of the knowledge that we are talking about. Universities are awash with literature on knowledge societies, knowledge economies, and scientific knowledge, but there is no notion of the social contract that should underpin the different understandings of knowledge as they reveal themselves in diverse settings. This article summarises many conversations between the two co-authors with Jarl Bengtsson as they battled to find answers to these pertinent questions and some of the deep issues facing the whole of humanity.

AB  - This article describes how a multidisciplinary problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum was established at the International Medical University in Malaysia for preclinical education in a 5-semester phase 1 programme. Based on positive feedback from a modified PBL program implemented in one discipline, a multidisciplinary PBL curriculum was established. PBL training for facilitators and students, development of resource materials, curriculum design, and case writing were done in a manner that is consistent with the characteristics and learning style preferences of undergraduate medical students. About 80% of the lectures were kept in the new PBL program. The multidisciplinary PBL curriculum has been successful in helping undergraduate medical students mentally construct an understanding of the interrelationship between medical knowledge and basic science concepts. The experience at International Medical University, Malaysia, indicates that there are clear benefits for students in the PBL format. A benefit to faculty is that PBL tutorial facilitators were partly liberated from their traditional roles and developed additional skills for facilitating. However, conflict arises when PBL-trained students encounter the traditional exam-centered education system.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of a distant-professional development model that supported the implementation of genre-based strategy instruction for procedural writing on second grade teachers' fidelity of implementation and students' writing quality. Participants were 84 s graders and four teachers who were randomly assigned to condition. Teachers completed an online workshop module prior to instruction, a survey on their instruction and confidence to teach writing, received coaching feedback during implementation, and were interviewed at pretest and posttest. Students wrote in response to two procedural topics at pretest and posttest, at maintenance, completed transfer tasks in science and in persuasion, were interviewed at posttest, completed a confidence scale, and standardized measures. Results showed that treatment teachers positively evaluated the PD and its components, taught with high fidelity, and positively commented on the instructional approach. Treatment students wrote papers of better quality at posttest and maintenance tasks, while there were no statistically significant differences at the transfer tasks, on students' confidence, and on standardized measures. Implications for professional development, practice, and research are further discussed.

AB  - Knowledge of all disciplines is more or less equally important and crucial but, in education management, it is important to integrate disciplines so that the knowledge is useful and can be applied to create new things, solve problems and prevent future threats. STEM education for vocational student is not only a trend in education, but also an instructional approach that focuses on students and will lead to sustainable knowledge and learning. This research studied documents that explored the importance of STEM literacy for vocational school students in Thailand. Vocational education must be aligned with Thailand 4.0 and Industrial 4.0 models, and thus vocational schools must adjust their learning approach to be aligned with the Education 4.0 model. As vocational school students will be valuable to the development of the country, STEM literacy must be integrated into a project-based learning model which is a teaching approach for creating invention and innovation. The result of the study shows that STEM literacy for Thai vocational education consists of six components: identifying a STEM problem, exploring and acquiring new knowledge, applying STEM concepts, solving the STEM problem, communicating STEM information and making a STEM decision. The aforementioned components can be used to create a STEM literacy evaluation form for vocational school students.

AB  - In the authors' science classrooms, students respond favorably and with more enthusiasm when they engage them with doing activities and building their own connections, as opposed to simply listening to or reading about the important concepts. Creative activities are important in science classrooms because creativity is not only an integral component for knowledge construction but also can make instruction more effective. The authors' own experience demonstrated that creative classroom investigations inspire students and promote effective learning environments. In an attempt to integrate a geological component in a classroom investigation of biological evolution, the authors developed two activities with an interdisciplinary approach that includes the role of the environment. Their activities not only offer alternatives for addressing the mechanism of natural selection, but they also have been affirmed by their students as their classroom favorites. The authors like to think that they "evolved through their students' natural selection processes." (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - In this article, Tammy D. Lee and Jane L. Lubischer describe a classroom lesson designed to explore how animals use sound to communicate and how this communication affects their survival. Lee and Lubischer wanted to bring an awareness of how science is happening in students' own backyards. They developed a half-day 5E lesson integrating two of the disciplinary core ideas from the "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS)": physical science (Wave Properties, grade 1) (PS4.A) and (Social Interactions and Group Behavior, grade 3) life science (LS2.D). They integrated these two disciplinary core ideas to demonstrate how science disciplines work together within the natural world. The first-grade disciplinary core idea (PS4.A) of how sound is created and travels was chosen to establish this physical science conceptual foundation for the first-grade students as well as to assess the prior knowledge of the third-grade students in terms of sound creation. With this foundation established, they then wanted to extend the concept of sound creation of vibrating human-made materials to how animals create sounds using vibrating materials within their bodies. Finally, Lee and Lubischer wanted to build upon this physical science concept of creation of sound to understanding the purpose of this creation of sound (LS2.D). In the real world, science disciplines do not exist in isolation (NRC 2012). The integration of science concepts was demonstrated by exploring how animals use sound to communicate messages (life science), with students using vibrating materials (physical science) to mimic these animal calls (sounds). Using the theme of sound, students asked questions (Connections to Nature of Science) about how frogs make sounds and how they use sounds to communicate. Students also had an opportunity to plan and carry out an investigation (Science and Engineering Practices) in a non-laboratory environment, just as many scientists (e.g., Earth scientists, ethologists, ecologists) collect data within a natural setting. Finally, within this lesson, students used evidence to construct an argument based on their own interpretation of collected data. This was done through a game that explored whether frogs benefit from living in a community by exploring how frog calls help frogs locate mates.

AB  - This paper is an attempt to support and promote education programs that cover the entire cultural heritage landscape (libraries, archives, museums) as an integrated, larger meta-discipline. By taking a larger picture approach, professionals who do the work of memory institutions can be more effective in their work, in the promotion of that profession, and increase public value of all related institutions and their purposes. Through the description of the integrated museum studies specialization at Kent State University School of Library and Information Science, this paper aims to provide one example of how this can work, first by describing the role of Library and Information Science (LIS) as a meta-discipline, next by discussing the changing landscape of cultural heritage professional education, and finally by describing in detail the new Kent State integrated museum studies specialization. The infusion of museum studies with LIS is discussed as a part of a larger movement toward integration of training information professionals in the entire cultural heritage sector.

AB  - This paper contributes to a nascent conversation in environmental education (EE) research by using ethnographic data and extant theory to develop a feminist posthumanist political ecology of education for theorizing human-animal relations/relationships. Specifically, I (1) engage feminist methodologies and theories; (2) give epistemological and theoretical attention to nonhuman animals; and (3) address the field of EE's minimal engagement with the interdisciplinary research agenda of political ecology. The paper begins with a literature review examining how feminist and/or posthumanist scholars have theorized human-animal (or human-nature) relations/relationships. Next, I outline the conceptual frameworks guiding the analyses of ethnographic data I collected at Long Beach, California's Aquarium of the Pacific and follow with a brief overview of the study. I conclude by outlining the major tenets of this article's conceptual framework, which contributes to a growing conversation in EE regarding human-animal relations/relationships and lays the groundwork for other political ecologies of education.

AB  - Teams become a key resource for organisations to meet different challenges. Thus a high team performance is essential in work context. The aim of this study was to get a deeper understanding of meaningful team learning and team mental models in educational contexts, by analysing the effect of team learning behaviours (TLBs) on the development of task-related team mental model (Task-TMM) and team performance. A three-wave longitudinal survey was conducted among interdisciplinary vocational teacher teams (N = 66 teams with 276 team members). TLBs and team performance were measured by validated scales. Task-TMM was measured by an open question about the work tasks of the teams to achieve its goals. The answers were evaluated by content analysis and categorised according to their semantic similarity. Path modelling of the data shows that TLBs have a positive effect on developing Task-TMM and on team performance in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and innovativeness. Task-TMM has a positive effect on effectiveness but not on efficiency or innovativeness. The results provide insights into how teachers' team performance can be fostered, such as by fostering TLBs creating a learning environment where team members depend on each other to accomplish their work tasks. Especially the longitudinal design and the type of analysis of Task-TMM provides new and deep insights into the relationship between TLBs, Task-TMM and team performance. Through the qualitative approach investigating Task-TMM the study also provides insight into the work tasks of teams in detail.

AB  - General chemistry and introductory chemistry students were presented with a laboratory exploration for the determination of the mass percent of copper in rock and mineral samples. They worked independently in the laboratory, which involved multiple lab (pipetting, preparing standard solutions by quantitative dilution, recording visible spectra with spectrometers) and data analysis skills (graphing and multistep stoichiometry calculations) using spreadsheet software. The results from the malachite mineral samples were used to evaluate the success of the copper extraction and analysis methods. Students were tasked with evaluating the economic viability of a "mining site" using their analysis of the malachite bearing rock samples. They worked with the entire class data set to make this evaluation. Students' lab reports and spreadsheets (submitted electronically) were evaluated using a grading rubric. Their engagement and enthusiasm for this exploration was high as they were eager to solve this real-life problem scenario that would be tackled by a professional chemist.

AB  - This paper focuses on the professional development of formal science educators through extraordinary experiences that occur within the realm of informal science learning. For many years the University of Colorado Denver (UCD) has offered programs that take teachers on "science learning journeys" to Africa, South America, through the Pacific, and many U.S. destinations through its Experiential Science Education Research Collaborative (XSci). On these adventures, teachers gain direct, first person experiences of unique and often challenging environments and multidisciplinary science within those settings. Similar professional development opportunities for teachers are widespread as summer programs through organizations nationwide. However, there is currently a lack of in-depth qualitative research investigating the actual benefits and interpretive nature of such programs as personal and professional "extraordinary" science learning experiences for the individuals who participate in them. The research agenda for the XSci Collaborative examines the experiences of educators engaged in informal extraordinary professional development experiences in order to understand the personal processes that make them extraordinary and valuable. Specifically, the primary research approach is to examine the "interpretation" of these experiences by teachers as case studies under the conceptual framework of a phenomenology. This approach utilizes several data sources, including teacher-created digital stories and video documentaries as personal narratives of their extraordinary experience; journals completed throughout the experiences, pre and post experience interviews, classroom observations and student interviews.

AB  - Background: This study is about teachers' collective activity during the development and initial year of a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-focused school in the USA. The target school of this study was inclusive, as it sought admission of students from varying backgrounds and levels of ability. Drawing from narrative inquiry and case study methodologies, we examine the collective work of the teachers in the target school from 6 months prior to school start-up through the end of the first year. We focus on visioning, collaboration, and curriculum development in our analysis of the teachers' collective work. Results: We analyze the collective sense-making activity of the teaching staff regarding key facets of the start-up process. While the teachers received a variety of supports, including time and resources for collaborating, there was a lack of specific support for the conceptualization and creation of multi-disciplinary, STEM-focused projects. The risk-taking and collaborative actions of the teachers led to three specific instructional approaches that were continuously adjusted to respond to the evolving vision of the STEM-focused school. The teachers also solicited the needs and interests of their students and utilized these in curricular design and instruction, which promoted student buy-in and participation. By the end of the school year, a common vision for STEM-focused, project-based learning was emerging, but not solidified. Conclusions: Our study confirms the power of "doing" and "risk-taking" in teacher development, particularly in the ways in which teacher collaboration advanced curriculum and instruction in this STEM-focused school context. The intellectual supports that teachers require in this context are numerous and must be carefully identified and nurtured, and the subsequent teacher activity must be monitored as contextual shifts occur and sources of pressure (e.g., external learning standards) become relevant. The teachers' role is a complex mixture of learner, risk-taker, inquirer, curriculum designer, negotiator, collaborator, and teacher. Instructional and curricular supports require substantial time to synthesize and eventually enact, and more than a few months prior to school start-up are necessary to fully engage and prepare teachers for the collective task of visioning, collaborating, and planning the curriculum and instruction of an innovative school.

AB  - To meet the demands of industry, undergraduate business curricula must evolve to prepare analytics-enabled professionals in fields such as finance, accounting, human resource management, and marketing. In this article, we provide a case study of developing a rigorous, integrated finance and data analytics course that was delivered using a simultaneous team-teaching approach within a regional, teaching university. This case study describes developing the learning outcomes; defining the integrated teaching approach; identifying and developing course content and materials; and planning the course delivery. Next, we describe the course delivery, including student achievement of course learning outcomes, and a summary of student feedback from end-of-course evaluations is provided. Finally, we present lessons learned from delivering the course and provide considerations for future work such as scaling this course and replicating it in other business domains.

AB  - Science programmes which prepare students to read critically and respond thoughtfully to science-based reports in the media could play an important role in promoting informed participation in the public debate about issues relating to science, technology and society. Evidence based guidance about the practice and pattern of use of science-based media in the classroom is limited. This study sought to identify learning intentions that teachers believe ought to underpin the development of programmes of study designed to achieve this end-result. Teachers' views of knowledge, skills and attitudes required to engage critically with science-based news served as a basis for this study. Teachers developed a pedagogical model by selecting appropriate statements of learning intentions, grouping these into coherent and manageable themes and coding them according to perceived level of difficulty. The model is largely compatible with current curricular provision in the UK, highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and illustrates the developmental nature of the topic.

AB  - Within higher education in the United States and Canada, calls to promote global awareness and global literacy among undergraduate students have become increasingly urgent. Yet, there are multiple challenges in achieving these outcomes. One challenge lies in making this "literacy" authentic and relevant for diverse students aspiring to be professionals in different fields. A second challenge is reconciling the tension between teaching for deep mastery of knowledge in a subject area, on the one hand, and teaching for broader global awareness through a collection of courses or experiences, on the other. A third challenge is developing in students the tacit understanding that enables them to link the global and the local in ways that are meaningful and useful in their work and their lives. This is particularly relevant in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, where the problems students see in the classroom are usually decontextualized, and where solutions are developed as if the broader (e.g., social, environmental, political) context were irrelevant. Perhaps the greatest challenge of all is supporting faculty as they wade into the necessarily interdisciplinary nature of such teaching and learning. The primary question, however, is: What is global literacy, and how do we teach it? In this article, the authors describe their attempt at Carnegie Mellon University to approach this question in a semi-empirical way by gathering the outcomes faculty members see as most salient for global literacy.

AB  - In recent years nanotechnology has become part of the content of many undergraduate chemistry and physics degree courses. This paper deals with the role of contextualisation of nanotechnology in the delivery of the content, as nanotechnology is only now being slowly integrated into many chemistry degree courses in Ireland and elsewhere. An evaluative methodology of the pedagogical approach for two introductory nanotechnology courses has been chosen for this study. Pre and post-course testing at 2nd year level (Case study A) and 4th year level (Case study B) has been carried out, 80 % of students in case study A and 64 % in case study B felt that they had little or no prior knowledge of nanotechnology before the courses were delivered. The students were very interested in learning about nanotechnology and enjoyed its futuristic concepts. They recognised that nanotechnology is an enabling technology, and when surveyed, considered the biomedical applications of most interest. (Contains 3 tables and 5 figures.)

AB  - One prevention strategy for childhood sexual abuse (CSA) involves educational programs delivered to children in the school environment. The purpose of this integrative literature review was to determine the state of the science on school-based CSA prevention programs. The authors extracted data from 26 articles that fit inclusion criteria to answer research questions on types of programs, methods used to evaluate programs, and program success. Analysis of the extracted data led to the identification of seven categories of teaching learning content. Delivery methods included films, plays, discussion, and role play. Most authors used an untreated or placebo control group pretest/posttest design for evaluation. According to the child outcome measures chosen, the majority of programs were successful. The review also found school nurses rarely involved in these programs. Although not a traditional aspect of their responsibilities, information from this review can help school nurses implement a school-based CSA prevention program.

AB  - In this theoretical article, we argue that the imminent collapse of earth systems that sustain life forms calls for mathematics education as a field to reflect on and re-evaluate its priorities and thus practices. We consider both what ecological collapse means for mathematics education and whether mathematics education might offer meaningful gestures in response. We explore how the relationship between the social and the ecological is conceptualised in mathematics education (and other relevant) research and what this implies for mathematics education. We read, in this scholarship, a growing focus on the ecological and conceptualisations of socio-ecological relations between existing entities that are dialectical, or mutually dependent. More rarely, are they seen as entangled and monist, and it is in this thought that we locate our contribution of multi-layered gestures of mathematics education. We describe these, in terms of three broad practices: listening for socio-ecological entanglement; attending to the scales of socio-ecological entanglements; and living entanglement as mathematics educators. We exemplify these gestures through examples of curriculum innovation. This article, a socio-ecological gesture in itself, is written in the spirit of opening a conversation into which we invite others.

AB  - In today's knowledge society, there is a demand for professionals who are able to create knowledge across boundaries of disciplines, professions and perspectives. Traditional universities, universities of applied sciences and institutions for vocational education are all challenged to educate these knowledge workers. Accordingly, these institutions are developing competence-based education programmes that promote authentic, self-directed learning and the development of a professional identity. A possible environment for realising this type of learning is the hybrid learning configuration in which learning is embedded in ill-defined and highly-authentic tasks. This study attempted to identify a set of principles that can underpin the design of such a learning configuration at the interface between school and workplace. The research approach consisted of educational design research. Starting from cognitive constructivist and socio-cultural perspectives, a set of initial design principles was developed and evaluated from the perspective of the participants during three consecutive iterations of design and implementation. The process resulted in a set of seven refined design principles which can be used as heuristics to guide the design and development of hybrid learning configurations in contexts that have similar goals and aligned tenets.

AB  - Nanoscience is an important new field in modern science. It deals with the ability to create materials, devices, and systems having fundamentally new properties and functions by working at the atomic, molecular, and macromolecular levels. Many teachers in the educational system have relatively limited knowledge related to nanochemistry and nanotechnology, as they completed their training well over 10 years earlier. The current paper describes an advanced course for teachers in materials and nanotechnology. The course was designed to make chemistry teachers nanoliterate by providing them with the basic principles of nanoscience, enabling them to independently study any subject in nanoscience, and elevating their enthusiasm for chemistry. The course is structured with content introduced initially followed by opportunities to apply concepts. The course presents fundamental knowledge required to understand topics in nanoscience and advanced materials characterization. The teachers then apply this knowledge while independently studying one topic that they select themselves. Research lab experiments follow, offering an additional opportunity for knowledge integration. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)

AB  - With the convergence of an ailing economy, a new generation of political leaders, and a strong public sentiment that change is needed on many fronts within the society and across the world, the phenomenon of social entrepreneurship has found new life and is flourishing within society as a whole and within higher education in particular. Yet, there exists some confusion and debate about the definition of social entrepreneurship and whether it is a useful concept for application across disciplines within the academy. There are also questions about where such programs should be situated within the academy. Do they belong in the business school alongside entrepreneurship education? Are they a better fit for the social sciences? Is social entrepreneurship an interdisciplinary field of study or a multidisciplinary field? This article seeks to shed light on these questions by examining the origin and evolution of the term "social entrepreneurship" and its use by practitioners outside the academy. Drawing upon this background, the article suggests a conceptualization of social entrepreneurship that would situate it broadly in the curriculum rather than limiting it to one discipline.

AB  - University-based entrepreneurship education is facing a paradigm shift between the classical "business school" and the contemporary cross-disciplinary "technology venturing" approach, mainly advocated by engineering schools and other communities outside business schools. The conflict is between structured "business planning and executing" following a tradition of management education, and "opportunity search and exploitation," following Schumpeterian entrepreneurial thought and reflecting the method common to cross-disciplinary discoveries in science, thus reflecting the nature of entrepreneurship. In the latter approach, the entrepreneurship curriculum is built as a platform for the interaction of a variety of disciplines to enhance cross-disciplinary thinking. Based on a comparative analysis of internationally acknowledged entrepreneurship education programmes, this article presents the cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural approach to the technology entrepreneurship curriculum development for undergraduates at Kaunas University of Technology in Lithuania. The method relies on the sequential development of individual, team-based and business skills. These three levels of competence development build the framework for the curriculum design and course didactics, which focus on mixed group work, international curriculum design and teaching, and participation in international innovation challenges. The efficiency of the method was assessed using student entrepreneurial attitude testing (at the start and end of the course) and international student achievement testing (achievements in the international business idea contest). The article offers an insight into the development of a technology-based entrepreneurship curriculum which is relevant to universities in Europe and worldwide.

AB  - In this paper we describe how we fostered learning by modifying an existing course which covered topics relevant to biosciences. This course was offered predominantly to first year undergraduate science, biomedical science and environment students. The students were trained to find reliable scientific information via computer searches, and shown ways to use and cite references. Small teams of students used Internet resources to find, evaluate and summarise information for 15 minute "PowerPoint" presentations. An initial lack of confidence in presentation ability improved significantly over this period. The students identified the computer workshop format, the presentations and the interesting lectures as outstanding course features. The structure facilitated student-centred learning by providing interdisciplinary research topics that were considered interesting, relevant and authentic. The learning environment supported the diversity of abilities and interests of the students. Other positive student outcomes were the formation of friendships, a broadened interest in science, discovery of possible career paths, and greater confidence in their ability to find good references. The provision of computers with Internet access in the students' workshops changed the previously tutor-led approach to a student-centred format, ideal for ensuring active learning. The choice of interesting, multidisciplinary topics and lecturers also helped mitigate the possible negative effect of a student cohort drawn from diverse disciplines.

AB  - The MLA Report on "Foreign Languages and Higher Education: New Structures for a Changed World" has been criticized for focusing its proposals on large German programs. This article attempts to show how some of its recommendations can also be implemented in smaller language programs. These programs exist within a network of relations to other academic programs in their institution with which they both compete and collaborate in order to perform and grow, such as the proliferating International Studies major. Inter-institutional collaboration can also open up opportunities for richer course offerings than what one small German program could provide. Designing a curriculum that encourages students, especially those from the science and technology disciplines, to double major in German Studies and achieve a high level of proficiency, includes components such as flexible groups of electives, mandatory study abroad or internship abroad, and courses tailored to a student audience interested in science and technology. This includes cultural studies courses that follow a model of interdisciplinarity with the potential for connections with other disciplines. In this article these are explored and illustrated with examples from a course on "Green Germany." Finally, measures of success are addressed, including ways that even a small German Studies program can establish and maintain its relevance and value in a range of institutional contexts.

AB  - Undergraduate research experiences (UREs) are part of an expanding toolkit of experiential learning experiences that can help students engage with the practices and processes of STEM. Civic engagement is another type of experiential learning experience that can offer students meaningful interactions in the wider community, thus leading to greater relevance and application of their work. Research studies suggest that both civic engagement and UREs are high-impact practices. Much of the work to date on experiential learning has been discipline based. This may be due to challenges in getting faculty members from different disciplines to work together, or because of issues with infrastructure, budget policies, credit hours, incentives, and/or the reward systems in higher education. This paper aims to help readers better understand the potential for UREs that integrate civic engagement to enhance learning. To illustrate how the obstacles might be surmounted, an example of an interdisciplinary URE that is coupled with civic engagement is provided.

AB  - The "new biology" of the 21st century is increasingly dependent on mathematics, and preparing high school students to have both strong science and math skills has created major challenges for both disciplines. Researchers and educators in biology and mathematics have been working long hours on a project to create high school teaching modules suitable for both biology and mathematics classrooms, as well as classes held jointly, to help supply teachers with materials that can be used in classrooms attempting to overcome the disciplinary boundaries that often separate them. Biology topics such as evolution, ecology, bioinformatics, and epidemiology are interwoven with a variety of mathematical topics, including algebraic equations, multiplying matrices, algorithms, dynamic programming, probability, and graphing. These modules will be free to educators for a few years. We give an overview of the modules and describe how to obtain them.

AB  - The rapid academic and industrial development of nanotechnology has led to its implementation in laboratory teaching for undergraduate-level chemistry and engineering students. This laboratory experiment introduces the galvanic replacement reaction for synthesis of hollow metal nanoparticles and investigates the optical properties of these nanoparticles. Changes of localized surface plasmon resonance from solid to hollow nanoparticles are monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy, while corresponding morphological changes are validated by transmission electron microscopy. The optical properties are further investigated by the use of a laser pointer, laser irradiation, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. By performing these experiments, students gain practical knowledge for the synthesis of hollow metal nanoparticles and the underlying structure-dependent optical properties.

AB  - The evolution of science is seldom about solitary individuals busy at work in labs making discoveries. This is especially true of the Earth sciences, where time-intensive fieldwork is usually required. Single scientists are rarely capable of amassing the requisite data sets to form grand, unifying theories. This is the case with the new airburst theory put forth by a large team of interdisciplinary scientists, including geologists, chemists, and anthropologists, who are trying to help explain several mysteries involving climate change and extinctions. The airburst theory, alternately known as the Younger Dryas impact or Clovis comet hypothesis, potentially explains four events: (1) Could a meteor entering the Earth's atmosphere around 12,900 years ago be responsible for the mass extinction of the megafauna of North America--the large sloths, mastodons, woolly mammoths, and saber-toothed cats found in the fossil record?; (2) Could this meteor also have caused the end of the Clovis culture, the first well-established Paleo-Indians in North America associated with a particular projectile point?; (3) Could this meteor have put enough debris into the atmosphere to bring about what's called the "big freeze," or the Younger Dryas, a geologically brief cold climate that occurred approximately 12,800 to 11,500 years ago?; and (4) Could this meteor have hit the massive ice sheet over North America, sending smaller particles ricocheting off the ice to form the elliptical depressions collectively called the Carolina Bays? The debate really got started when a diverse team of scientists published an article postulating the connection among the four previously unexplained historical events described above (Firestone et al. 2007). The article was cited in a case study in a nontechnical textbook widely used in university courses (Keller and Blodgett 2008). The authors decided to turn the case study into a lesson plan for middle school students to teach Earth science concepts, along with a bit of archaeology, astronomy, and something about the nature of scientific discovery. The lesson plan is about posing the four questions above and having students find and evaluate evidence to explain each event and then engage in critical thinking to see how the events might all be connected through an emerging theory. An early version of the lesson plan became a piece of action research and was piloted in three eighth-grade middle school classrooms. The lesson is also linked with the newest science education standards. (Contains 2 figures, 18 resources and 12 online resources.)

AB  - Upon entering the workplace, speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are required to work on interprofessional teams, yet many of these professionals have not received adequate preservice instruction on how to collaborate. Furthermore, collaborating to provide services for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been found to improve developmental outcomes; however, many SLPs are not prepared to engage in this type of collaborative practice. Based on the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's (ASHA) recommendation that university programs include interprofessoinal education (IPE) into Communication Sciences and Disorders programs, coupled with the need to prepare students to provide interprofessional services for children with ASD, Wichita State University developed a field-based interprofessional diagnostic team for SLP students. The process used to develop this team followed Pickering and Embry's recommended steps for cultivating interprofessional collaboration within a university environment. The purpose of this article is to describe the procedures used to develop the team and activities used to target competencies for interprofessional collaborative practice.

AB  - A new multi-disciplinary degree program in education and information studies was developed to uniquely facilitate educators' capacity to be responsive to the demands of a digitally connected world. Charles Sturt University's Master of Education (Knowledge Networks and Digital Innovation) aims to develop agile leaders in new cultures of digital formal and informal learning. The co-construction of knowledge through interpersonal discourse creates a pedagogical tension between a focus on knowledge-based instruction and outcomes, and on praxis-based instruction. This digital context draws attention to academic integrity issues in online learning environments. Through the new subject Game-Based Learning, students engaged in theory, practice, trends in game designs and immersive aspects of game, utilizing the technology and pedagogical affordances of a range of online tools. The subject builds on the keystone subject and incorporates reflective participation and a culture of participatory learning through integration of social media, social scholarship and open sharing of ideas, resources and experiences online within the broader education community. Subject engagement and assessment design incorporated academic integrity strategies, and needed individual and group collaboration to be fully integrated into the learning experience of the students, thus modeling practices relevant to the student's own processional practices. This paper also considers the contribution of global connectedness to the success of the pedagogic processes used for embedding academic integrity through social scholarship into the curriculum and learning experiences.

AB  - Promoting sustainability and dealing with complex environmental problems like climate change demand a citizenry with considerable scientific and quantitative literacy. In particular, students in the STEM disciplines of (biophysical) science, technology, engineering, and mathematics need to develop interdisciplinary skills that help them understand the social dynamics of environmental problems and solutions. To this end, this study examines how participation in a semester-long inquiry-based learning project that involves sociological research on climate change beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors enhances the scientific and quantitative literacies of STEM students. The results suggest that participation in a sociological inquiry-based learning project helps STEM students to (a) improve their knowledge of scientific and statistical principles and processes, (b) hone their scientific research skills, and (c) gain respect for sociology specifically and social science more generally. While the inquiry-based learning project described here deals with climate change, educators can adapt it to deal with other environmental social science research topics (e.g., water use, energy conservation, food security, sustainability).

AB  - To address arts education disparities in middle level schools, this paper explores evidence that infusing the visual and performing arts into language arts, math, science, and history/social studies courses is a pedagogical approach that meets the developmental needs of early adolescents and fosters a relevant, challenging, integrative, and exploratory curriculum for all learners. The strategy, often identified as integrated or interdisciplinary arts education, is examined through the literature and a case study of five middle level classrooms. Findings from this study, derived from participant (teachers and administrators) interviews and classroom observations, provide the compelling argument to support implementation of arts integration pedagogy in middle level schools. Moreover, positive outcomes for diverse learners suggest that this study has direct implications for educational practice and policy. Arts-infused learning can shift the current educational paradigm and foster positive change in middle level classrooms. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - In the paper, the authors propose a variant of the mathematical model for justifying the optimal ratio of researchers of different categories to conduct scientific research of the highest possible quality in conditions of limited resources. The discrepancy is formulated between the quality of scientific research and the restriction on financial resources, that is, the problem of resource allocation is solved. The relationship between the quality of scientific research and the number of researchers is proposed to be reflected by the canonical parabola equation. A mathematical model is formulated that reflects the essence of the question under study. The problem is solved using the method of Lagrange multipliers. The results of the study are confirmed by a numerical experiment. Resource constraints have always existed. This is especially true now for the development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and increasing their combat and mobilisation readiness, which result in the country's defence capability as a whole. Limited funding also takes place in military science. It is very difficult to introduce new full-time positions and divisions. Previously, the number of researchers was justified following regulatory documents when creating scientific institutions and divisions, or by analogy with similar scientific institutions. In other words, the problem was solved empirically or situationally. This scientific study concerns substantiating the number of scientific personnel in conditions of limited resources, taking into account the work that is now performed and will be performed in the future.

AB  - Objective: This article 1) provides an overview of formal Health Sciences Teaching Scholars Programs as presented in medical education literature and 2) presents information about an innovative multidiscipline Teaching Scholars Program. Method: Health Sciences Teaching Scholars Programs and similar programs were reviewed in the medical education literature to identify similar and dissimilar characteristics. The WVU Teaching Scholars Program highlighted in this article is presented with a discussion of goals, objectives, target audiences, course length, session frequency, program topics, learning methods, and assessments of the programs. A summary of the WVU Teaching Scholars Program and two Teaching Scholars Programs at McGill University and the University of Toronto were presented at the Association for American Medical Colleges (AAMC) annual meeting in 2006 for input from the general medical education audience. Results: Comparisons of Health Sciences Teaching Scholars Programs reveal that successful programs are uniquely shaped by their educational environments. Scholars report that they value learning new teaching methods and improving their educational careers. Conclusion: Teaching Scholars Programs are valuable for the development of enhancing both teaching and scholarship in Health Sciences Programs and must adapt to the uniqueness of their respective educational environments and must continue to nurture scholars beyond graduation.

AB  - This paper summarizes our experience of teaching undergraduate robotic courses in the past ten years. The objective is to introduce students to the fundamental knowledge in robotics. Lecture topics covered subjects in both Autonomous Mobile Robots and Robotic Manipulator. In the lab sessions, students work on physical robots to acquire basic robotic design, integration, and algorithm implementation skills. The commercially-available VEX robotic kits, together with its extensions, are used as the robotic platform. By constructing an autonomous mobile base, students can explore topics pertaining to Autonomous Mobile Robots. By adding a simple robotic arm on top of the mobile base, students can investigate subjects in Robotic Manipulator. By further integrating the VEX robot with other devices such as Raspberry PI (with its camera module) and XBee modules, the enhanced VEX robots achieved onboard image processing and wireless inter-vehicle communication capabilities. More advanced topics, such as vision-based control and coordinated control, can then be brought to the undergraduate robotic classroom, boosting students' interest in robotics and the STEM fields in general. The course learning objectives of obtaining knowledge and skills in both Autonomous Mobile Robot and Robotic Manipulator were assessed using direct assessment methods via in-class exams. Students' acquired hands-on skills and their interests into robotics and general STEM fields were evaluated using indirect methods via surveys and Student Evaluation of Teaching (SETs). The combined assessment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed course content, projects, and the overall teaching approaches.

AB  - In this study, interdisciplinary environments were created in NSF institutes and classrooms with graduate fellows and teachers. Using a mixed methodology, we examined how experiential learning influenced participants' mathematical/scientific actions and compared differences in mathematics/science efficacy and content understanding between participant groups. Pre-assessment findings revealed no significant differences in content knowledge or self-efficacy issues between fellows and teachers. However, midyear and post test results showed a significant difference between fellows and teachers on the mathematics content domains. Significant differences were observed between gender groups (favoring males) on mathematical items of content and efficacy pre and midyear assessments and between science/mathematics discipline groups on mathematical items of content pre and post tests (favoring mathematicians). Interdisciplinary settings initiated learners to voice their beliefs and realizations regarding their mathematical and scientific understandings. Most discomfort displayed by participants revolved around mathematics. (Contains 3 figures and 4 tables.)

AB  - The purpose of this article is to describe how an elementary art specialist scaffolded learning of specific academic vocabulary during a unit on how to create hollow clay ceramic sculptures. Although much has been written recently on how elementary teachers might better teach academic vocabulary in reading and language arts contexts as well as in social studies, math, and science, addressing methods to teach academic vocabulary in the arts has been virtually ignored (Beck, McKeown, & Kucan, 2002; Blachowicz, Fisher, Ogle, & Watts-Taffe, 2013). The article discusses (a) research, theory, and policy issues that support this initiative; (b) details of the sculpture-related vocabulary and reading activities enacted in 14 art periods with third-grade children; and (c) extensions and elaborations of this approach for other elementary educational contexts.

AB  - This article explores the use of a social science-fictional play to teach macro-structural concepts related to global capitalism and surplus labor in a small and large Introduction to Sociology course. Relying on a cross-disciplinary and critical pedagogical approach that combines theory and practice to empower students to develop a critical consciousness of the world around them, the authors develop an active learning exercise centered on an in-class reading of the dystopian play "I Like Firing People" written by sociologists Charles Derber and Yale Magrass. To assess the effectiveness of the exercise to increase student engagement and conceptual learning, the authors use quantitative and qualitative data and a quasi-experimental research design. Even with the mixed findings, the reading of an evocative social scientific fictional play coupled with short writing exercises and class discussions appears to assist in making macro-structural systems more visible and real to students and offers a unique role-playing opportunity that highlights multiple perspectives on the global capitalist economy.

AB  - Romanian scholars, and others, have decried the quality and quantity of scholarly productivity from Romania. However, Romanian scholars face challenges of both tradition and resources as they try to westernize their higher education system. We analyzed data from two sources to compare Romanian scholarly productivity to that of other countries from Central and Eastern Europe that have similar histories, as well as to worldwide publication rates. We found that Romanian scholarly productivity is weak compared to other countries in psychology, sociology, environmental sciences, linguistics, geology and medicine. However, Romanian scholarly productivity has been comparable to other countries in agriculture and computer sciences. We also found that Romanian scholarly productivity has shown gains in engineering and economics compared to other countries over a 20-year period. We conclude this paper with research-based recommendations for improving scholarly productivity.

AB  - At the James Weldon Johnson Leadership Academy in East Harlem, New York, administrators, teachers, students, families, and community-based artists worked together to create a visually explosive environment that reflected enriched learning experiences based on their multidisciplinary study of New York's history. The Mano a Mano ("Hand to Hand" in English) project reflects the values of a unified, collaborative school community that approaches education and learning from the perspective that "it takes a village to raise a child" (African proverb). This arts-based, interdisciplinary, and thematic approach to curriculum emphasizes visual texts, nonfiction literacy, and content area learning in pursuit of a deeper, richer understanding of a topic. The topic changes year by year, but the approach remains the same. The curriculum integrates all subjects (e.g., science, social studies, English language learning, English language arts, technology, art, music, and the performing arts), and the current unit and theme, a study of "New York: Past, Present, and Future," to provide curricular vision for teachers and children in all grades. This article features examples of children's work related to "New York's Past": displays of Henry Hudson's voyage to New York in 1609; Lenape people, whom Hudson encountered on his trip; and animals prevalent at that time. Children's work samples were reviewed as a part of a larger case study of the school's implementation of this unique arts-based, nonfiction inquiry, and content area curriculum. Of particular interest is the role of the visual arts as a means for developing children's understanding of the world and promoting literacy through nonfiction materials. (Contains 12 figures.)

AB  - In this article, the authors explore how the 3C Model can be used to integrate other curriculum areas with mathematics, namely digital technologies. To illustrate the model, they provide a practical example of a teaching sequence. T he 3C Model is designed to create opportunities for applying reasoning and problem-solving skills and learning coding and algorithmic thinking using digital and physical devices. The model comprises three stages: Context of the problem (learning curriculum content within a contextual problem); Capabilities of the device (students are exposed to capabilities of software or physical computing devices in an exploratory or play-based activity); and Computational focus of the unit of work (an intentional and gradual shift in language from child-familiar terms to the more abstract representations of coding). The three stages are situated as the first three lessons of a 5 or 6 lesson sequence.

AB  - This study examined the forms and functions of reformulation markers (RMs) in the three disciplines of philosophy, economics, and biology to see whether there is any disciplinary variation regarding these linguistic devices and their functions in essays written by undergraduate students. To this purpose, two corpora of university students' essays were prepared using Michigan Corpus of Upper-level Student Essays and Sketch Engine. The functions of RMs were examined based on an established framework. Moreover, two further functions, clarification and exemplification, also emerged out of the data. The findings of this corpus-based study revealed that essays written in economics contained the highest frequency of RMs. As for the functions, the macro-function related to the interpretation of explicit meaning was the most common in all three disciplines. The baseline comparison revealed that reformulation is used almost similarly by the students for whom English is a native language and those for whom English is a second language: however, some remarkable differences existed with the way first-year students use RMs.

AB  - Undergraduate public law courses often attract students with competing expectations. Some students enroll in these courses to prepare for law school, while others enroll in the courses to gain a broader understanding of courts in the American system of government. These differing student constituencies can create a dilemma for instructors. A course designed to cater to students with a general interest in the judiciary may not afford prelaw students with an appreciation for the demands of the legal profession. Conversely, a course narrowly tailored toward prelaw students risks alienating the majority of students for whom this class may be their only look at the judiciary. As a means to promote pedagogical balance and to appeal to varied student constituencies, we profile five public law simulations in this article that engage students in active learning and promote a greater understanding of law and courts.

AB  - The higher education regulation process in Europe, known as the Bologna Process, has involved many changes, mainly in relation to methodology and assessment. The paper given below relates to implementing the new EU study plans into the Teacher Training College of Vitoria-Gasteiz; it is the first interdisciplinary paper written involving teaching staff and related to the Teaching Profession module, the first contained in the structure of the new plans. The coordination of teaching staff is one of the main lines of work in the Bologna Process, which is also essential to develop the right skills and maximise the role of students as an active learning component. The use of active, interdisciplinary methodologies has opened up a new dimension in universities, requiring the elimination of the once componential, individual structure, making us look for new areas of exchange that make it possible for students' training to be developed jointly.

AB  - Although several studies have shown that the problem-based learning (PBL) method promotes relevant professional skills as well as critical thinking and lifelong learning, some teachers remain sceptical regarding whether PBL is also adequate in acquiring the factual knowledge that students need. In this article, we describe an experience in which PBL has been introduced as an interdisciplinary activity in the teaching of students in the bachelor degree of biology, with special attention on the analysis of contextualised complex problems. This experience was a part of a traditional curriculum and roughly 20% of the entire learning time was devoted to it. We named this teaching approach "hybrid problem-based learning" (H-PBL) curriculum, in contrast to the lecture-based learning (LBL) traditional curriculum. The study reported here aims to answer a fundamental question: are there differences between both models in the students' factual knowledge acquisition? The results of this study have failed to show significant differences in factual knowledge acquisition between both groups of students. We conclude that the use of an interdisciplinary H-PBL approach has no deleterious effect on the recall of factual knowledge, while it may permit the simultaneous development of other professional skills, which could be more difficult to attain in traditional curricula based mainly on the lecture-based method.

AB  - At the University of Vermont, an interdisciplinary faculty team developed an introductory watershed science field course. This course honed field skills and catalyzed communication across water-related disciplines without requiring specific prerequisites. Five faculty (geology, engineering, geography, natural resources) taught the four-credit course, highlighting interactions between the hydrosphere, biosphere, and solid Earth. The course, based in the Winooski River watershed, followed the river from its headwaters downstream to its outlet in Lake Champlain focusing on data collection and analysis methods, while exploring threats to this freshwater ecosystem. This course was offered as a summer field course in 2007. Student learning was assessed using weekly summative assignments and final presentations incorporating field data and acquired knowledge. Attitude and knowledge surveys, administered before and after this first year, documented increased self-assessed learning, affinity for the field learning environment, and that the course provided training relevant to various disciplines. The fiscally unsustainable summer model, and course evaluations guided major revisions to the course. The second offering, in 2009, met weekly during spring term to provide students with context before a two-week field component. This field component was held immediately after classes ended to avoid the need to pay faculty summer salaries.

AB  - Numerous STEM agencies and advocacy groups posit that Outside of (regular) School Time (OST) STEM opportunities spur middle school students' learning, especially in fostering students' interests in and motivations for STEM. The purpose of this study was to investigate the sources of students' interest in and motivation for STEM while participating in one or two OST STEM activities (i.e., SeaPerch, Science Olympiad, Girls Who Code, and/or eCYBERMISSION) at their independent (private) middle school. Using an illustrative experimental single case study design, data were sourced from observations, a questionnaire, and interviews from 15 middle school students participating in one (or two) 13- to 16-week OST STEM activities at their private school. Results suggest that sources of student interest and motivation related to OST STEM activities were mainly sourced (30% of data coded) from students' self-motivation and intrinsic interests in STEM. Other sources of student interest and motivation were from their teachers (20%), the enjoyment they derived from the OST activities (20%), support from family (10%), school friends (10%), and supportive persons outside of school (1%). Recommendations for strengthening participation in OST STEM activities as well as avenues for further research are discussed.

AB  - More collaborative work in the humanities could be instrumental in helping to break down the traditional rigid boundaries between academic divisions and disciplines in modern universities. The value of the traditional model of the solitary humanities scholar or the collaborative science paradigm should not be discounted. However, increasing the use of collaborative and interdisciplinary research models in the humanities would promote new forms of scholarship and also help to create a better, more integral and inclusive world.

AB  - Despite the increasing number of inclusive STEM schools, little is known about the cultural dimensions that influence STEM curriculum and instruction within these schools. This paper describes research conducted at three inclusive STEM schools, one each at the elementary, middle, and high school level. We explored similarities and differences in cultural dimensions across the schools with specific attention to how these differentially influence teachers' perceptions and enactment of STEM curriculum and instruction across the elementary, middle, and high school levels. Our cross-case analysis revealed structural aspects (school vision, community partnerships, course scheduling, and testing pressures) as well as professional orientations (i.e., instructional practices, interdisciplinary collaboration, and teacher content knowledge) that appear particularly important to student learning experiences at each grade level. Navigating these factors of STEM school culture requires teachers to not only be knowledgeable but also to draw on a professional orientation that encourages collaboration and risk-taking. We discuss implications for teacher education and STEM school development.

AB  - Background: Theory, methods, and knowledge gained from years of study in psychological science and human development apply to the understanding and improvement of teacher quality and, ultimately, student achievement and social and emotional outcomes. With these applications, educational research has stronger potential to make more effective and systematic contributions to the improvement of teaching in American schools. This potential can be realized by linking the scientific study of psychology and teachers' development (social, relational, psychological, and cognitive) to teachers' classroom behaviors (the mechanisms and processes underlying quality) and student achievement of educational and social and emotional objectives (the outputs of quality). New funds of knowledge in developmental and psychological science can serve as a basis for future research on inputs into teacher quality. Purpose: The present article advances an interdisciplinary perspective on the factors influencing teacher quality, specifically defined as teachers' practices and their interactions with students that can be shown to relate to student achievement. The article (1) offers a view of teacher quality focused on teacher-child interactions that serve as explanatory mechanisms in predicting children's achievement; (2) introduces key principles of human adult development that offer insights to link developmental research on teachers to teacher quality and, ultimately, to student achievement and social and emotional outcomes; and (3) discusses two bodies of research from psychological science that illustrate the ways in which psychological principles and an overarching view of teachers as developing people may contribute to current debates about teacher quality. Research Design: The article synthesizes research from the fields of education and psychology. Conclusions: The article closes with recommendations for basic, developmentally oriented research on teacher quality and student achievement.

AB  - This study examined the self-efficacy in science, art, dance, and music; attitudes concerning contributions of people of various ethnic/cultural groups; and science learning of students involved in an after-school arts-integrated science enrichment project. Students dramatized three traditional animal legends from African, Native American, and Mexican cultures to drum beats while wearing student-made papier-mâché helmet crest masks of the animal characters. They learned the structure and functions of the featured animals through slide shows, embedded explanations in the play scripts, and hands-on form and function analogy materials that related the form and function of animal body parts to manufactured items. Although at least 40 students participated at times in the after-school program, matching pretest and posttest data were only available for 13 students. Results showed positive changes in students' art self-efficacy with a medium effect size, improvements in knowledge of animal form and function with a large effect size, and a trend toward greater appreciation of the cultural contributions of different ethnic groups. Photographs of student-made masks and the animal legend scripts with added form-and-function content are provided.

AB  - Arts integration has shown to enhance student comprehension, retention, and engagement, while connecting to rich science content. The integration of the Next Generation Science Standards and the National Arts Standards into a first grade lesson illustrated how the arts enhanced the students' understandings of the sun's apparent motion during the day, an idea that is difficult for many young children to grasp. In this project students explored the sun outdoors throughout the school day to document changes by tracing their shadows in chalk and by making a shadow clock. Students also applied the information they learned to the creation of a flip book depicting the motion of the sun in the sky during the day.

AB  - The raising of Henry VIII's warship, the "Mary Rose," from the sea bed set in train an extraordinary programme of interdisciplinary research, relentlessly pursuing the clues to Tudor life and death provided by the remains of the ship, its cargo and crew. In this article Clare Barnes offers fascinating insights into the way in which this recent scholarship has helped to transform our understanding of the period. She also explains how the Learning Department at the Mary Rose Museum use artefacts and source materials alongside competing theories advanced over time, to build historical enquiries for students of different ages. While these tap into young people's curiosity about the ship's sinking, they go beyond the details of this question to develop their knowledge of the enquiry process itself and of the ways in which historical knowledge is constructed and debated.

AB  - Contribution: This paper quantifies the phenomenon of more versus better research output in computing research education and elaborates on how the organizational variable known as cognitive distance plays a fundamental role in mediating such more versus better research output relation. Background: To improve the current educational system, investigation and quantification is needed of the "silos." Cognitive distance--a measure of the differences in background, culture, and expertise between collaborators--may be a factor influencing the lack of quality and variety in research outputs. Addressing this is a key enabler for fruitful collaboration. Research Question: Does collaboration with similarly expert researchers yield better research? Methodology: A quantitative survey provides baseline data for cognitive distance while publication data allowed creation of a co-authorship network between 123 researchers in a European computing research department. The network was analyzed through quantitative and qualitative research methods. Findings: Increased expertise overlaps across sub-fields of computing is a strong predictor for further collaboration (quantity), but research impact (quality) decreases with larger overlaps. This reveals an educational silo effect in doctoral computing education and, consequently, a flaw in the connected research output. The lack of a single, agreed way to evaluate research impact across sub-fields further hinders cross-departmental collaboration among doctoral students. Conclusion: Three recommendations emerge for policy makers and educational leaders: 1) departments should be cross-functional and focused on societal interests; 2) communities of practice should be created at the level of doctoral education and upward; and 3) departments should hold matchmaking and speed-meeting events regularly within and across institutions.

AB  - Following the decision at the KU Leuven to implement the educational concept of guided independent learning and to encourage students to participate in scientific research, the Faculty of Bioscience Engineering decided to introduce a bachelor thesis. Competencies, such as communication, scientific research and teamwork, need to be present in the design of this thesis. Because of the high number of students and the multidisciplinary nature of the graduates, all research divisions of the faculty are asked to participate. The yearly surveys and hearings were used for further optimisation. The actual design of this bachelor thesis is presented and discussed in this paper.

AB  - In both universities and K-12 schools, students leave one world and enter another as they attend classes in discipline-specific domains. But how can students gain the experiences necessary to make discoveries--for personal satisfaction, for academic enlightenment, and perhaps even for the betterment of humankind--without educators who see the advantages of and can provide worthwhile experiences in interdisciplinary practice? In our age of hyper-reductionism, accompanied by an almost fortress-like mentality regarding the sanctity and value of disciplines, perhaps it is time to examine what it would be like to think and learn outside the boxes.

AB  - Professionals increasingly must collaborate very closely, such as through inter-professional work arrangements. This involves learning both "in" and "for" collaboration. Some educational researchers have turned to complexity science to better understand these learning dynamics. This discussion asks, How useful is complexity science for examining professional learning in collaboration? After introducing complexity principles that appear in accounts of professional practice and education, selected studies are presented that draw from complexity science to examine professional collaboration in fields of management, social and health care, and education. A critical discussion of these studies points out oversights and limitations. Complexity theory is concluded to offer useful insights for two areas: (1) articulating complexities of professional practice and knowledge and (2) providing educational support for professional knowing-in-undecidability. However, it is also argued that complexity analyses of professional collaboration could do much more to exploit the explanatory power of complexity concepts, by returning to rich dynamics of strong emergence in a sociomaterialist analysis, and by avoiding metaphorical uses of complexity. Used rigorously rather than romantically, complexity concepts may prove more useful not only in analysing political dynamics of collaborative professional practice, but also in opening new questions and approaches for future research in professional learning.

AB  - One of the important themes that emerged from the CAL'07 conference was the failure of technology to bring about the expected disruptive effect to learning and teaching. We identify one of the causes as an inherent weakness in prevalent development methodologies. While the problem of designing technology for learning is irreducibly multi-dimensional, design processes often lack true interdisciplinarity. To address this problem we present IDR, a participatory methodology for interdisciplinary techno-pedagogical design, drawing on the design patterns tradition [Alexander, C., Silverstein, M., & Ishikawa, S. (1977). "A pattern language: Towns, buildings, construction (Center for environmental structure series)." New York, NY: Oxford University Press] and the design research paradigm [DiSessa, A. A., & Cobb, P. (2004) Ontological innovation and the role of theory in design experiments. "Journal of the Learning Sciences, 13"(1), 77-103]. We discuss the iterative development and use of our methodology by a pan-European project team of educational researchers, software developers and teachers. We reflect on our experiences of the participatory nature of pattern design and discuss how, as a distributed team, we developed a set of over 120 design patterns, created using our freely available open source web toolkit. Furthermore, we detail how our methodology is applicable to the wider community through a workshop model, which has been run and iteratively refined at five major international conferences, involving over 200 participants.

AB  - Psychology is a valuable Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) discipline, but one which could do far more at communicating its value to the wider public. This paper discusses how popular initiatives, such as "The University of Northampton's STEM Champions" programme, enhance psychology's STEM membership, while increasing public engagement and participation. These opportunities also enhance the psychology STEM student journey, by helping them to develop employability-related skills and allowing them to obtain valuable experience in the environments that they may later be working in.

AB  - Science involves children in exploring and gaining understanding about the world they live in. Use of a creative and imaginative approach to science can enhance this learning in many ways (Coates and Wilson, 2003). When presented with the challenge of teaching a series of science lessons on food and nutrition to a mixed class of years 4 and 5 (ages 8-10), the author and her colleagues decided to focus on creating a relevant and creative context in which the children could make decisions and direct their own learning. Their aim was to engage and motivate children through a cross-curricular, contextual, child-centred learning experience. In this article the author describes how she implemented this approach through multiple classroom sessions.

AB  - Virtual environments can resolve many practical and pedagogical challenges within higher education. Economic considerations, accessibility issues, and safety concerns can all be somewhat alleviated by creating learning activities in a virtual space. Because of the removal of real-world physical limitations like gravity, durability and scope, virtual space allows for an expansion of possibilities and approaches to knowledge transfer and discovery learning and becomes an "environment for information" rich with collaborative possibilities. Experimentation and participation in conceptual as well as applied projects is encouraged for both students and instructors. One of these virtual environments, Second Life, was used in a cross-disciplinary project for the creation of a Marine Science virtual class environment as an assignment for design students at a major southwestern research university in the United States. This paper reports on the findings from a project that utilized Second Life as a medium for enhancing and extending design education using a process of interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - The design of educational software interfaces is a complex task, given its high domain dependency and multidisciplinary nature. It requires that teachers' knowledge and pedagogical beliefs be incorporated into the interface, posing a challenge to both teachers and designers, as they have to act as partners from the earliest phases of the process, sharing their knowledge. The present work investigates the strategies designers used when paired with experienced teachers, to design two interfaces on chemistry, evaluating how designers work with subjects they know little about, in the initial phases of the design process. Our observations demonstrate that although experienced and non-experienced designers use different strategies to couple with the design task, both approached the task in a depth-first manner. These results should not be generalized, because few subjects were investigated, but point to the importance of being familiar with the knowledge domain--which poses a challenge for designers.

AB  - What is realia and theory-building? Tim Kinard and Jesse Gainer explain that when students explore using "realia," they are not just being exposed to abstract concepts or text on a page, they are using "real-life" objects to build understandings of the natural world while they builds vocabulary about it. Handling and discussing real-world objects (acorns, pine cones, flowers, bones, antlers, dirt), in both the first language of the students, as well as a second language learned in school, builds vocabulary quickly as students engage in meaningful communication with scaffolds bridging first and second languages. The use of "realia" and other visuals are one way to provide ESL students opportunities for meaningful communication in English. Creating strategic partnerships that pair ELLs with native English speakers is another effective strategy that provides both groups the opportunity to interact and learn from one another. When students learn through explorations, not by directly being told about or shown the concepts--and in a group setting with real-world, everyday materials and ideas--they are "theory-building." Increasingly, the very young have been found to build sophisticated theories when they are able to build them through real-world, experiential knowledge and conversation. The idea that theory-building among peers in their first languages can create deep understandings about science, math, society, literature and other topics can be a very hopeful idea. Therefore, when pre-K teachers provide students with many of the keys to success in schooling by hands-on practice, in the out-of-doors, which builds on prior knowledge, and exercises home languages, these teachers are offering opportunities for practicing "realia" and theory-building skills.

AB  - Introduction: This study describes the intellectual landscape of iSchools and examines how the various iSchools map on to these research areas. Method: The primary focus of the data collection process was on faculty members' current research interests as described by the individuals themselves. A co-word analysis of all iSchool faculty members' research interests was used as a research method. The relations between the current research profiles of the iSchools were compared by calculating the cosine similarity between co-word profiles and visualized in network graphs. Results: The results show that the iSchools still contain many dominant themes from library and information science, but have an expanded conceptual landscape with the introduction of new iSchools. The methods used for data collection guaranteed the most current data available (in contrast to using publications) and the methods used for analyses gave multiple perspectives to the research landscape of the iSchools. Conclusions: The results of the present study showed how the current research landscape of the iSchools and the shared research interests were built by many topics that still reflect dominant information science topics (e.g., bibliometrics, information retrieval, and information seeking behaviour), but that there are also growing areas that reflect the iSchools' interdisciplinary composition, thus answering the research questions.

AB  - There is little doubt that the healthcare industry is experiencing tremendous growth in regards to technology. If you have visited a healthcare professional recently, you may have seen a similar notice, "Please be patient as we implement a new electronic healthcare record system." This confluence of technology and healthcare provides a new field of study in IT--Health Information Technology (HIT). This paper describes the development and implementation process and the curriculum for a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a major in Health Information Technology. Developed in collaboration with nursing educators and in consultation with HIT professionals, this unique multi-disciplinary program blends technology and healthcare to prepare students for a wide variety of opportunities in the evolving field of HIT. The development of this degree was funded in part by a grant awarded under ARRA High Growth & Emerging Industries Grant as implemented by the U.S. Department of Labor's Employment & Training Administration.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance, genetically modified produce, avian flu, and invasive species persistence are just a few scientific issues pulled from the headlines that affect society on a daily basis. Understanding these issues requires knowledge of evolutionary processes. Educating students about evolution may never have been as necessary as it is today; however, public battles between science and religion provide hurdles to teaching evolution. The need to produce students equipped to understand current and future scientific issues of societal relevance is rarely disputed. Therefore, it is important to find creative ways to accomplish this goal. Improving a student's ability to understand evolution may be achieved through an inquiry-based module that focuses on relevant and uncontroversial geological, physical, and life sciences. This article describes a module which engages students in determining the age of their fossil, its relationship to living organisms, and observing natural selection through inquiry-based and collaborative learning. By first understanding the scientific methods used by paleontologists to document evolutionary processes, later lessons specific to evolution are effective and well-received. The module described in this article consists of three lessons that address "National Science Education Standards" and have the potential to improve science process skills through interdisciplinary content. All lessons utilize group collaborations and provide inquiry-based activities that model the science done by university professors and scientists. Additionally, each lesson focuses on understanding uncontroversial scientific material including the law of superposition (i.e., the idea that younger sediments are laid down on top of older sediments), relative vs. absolute dating (i.e., methods for determining the age of fossils and surrounding rocks), classification methods, and the process of natural selection.

AB  - In an effort to improve science and social studies instruction, preservice teachers developed original science, technology, and society units to teach in elementary and middle school classrooms during their clinical field experience. Data revealed that the preservice teachers fell into categories of being skeptics, open-minded instructors, or positively engaged leaders as they negotiated science, technology, and society curriculum requirements. In follow-up interviews after a full semester of student teaching, the categories held, thereby suggesting that preservice teachers' dispositions have a strong influence on their approach to curriculum and instruction.

AB  - Mutate is a program developed for teaching purposes to impart a virtual laboratory class for undergraduate students of Genetics in Biology. The program emulates the so-called fluctuation test whose aim is to distinguish between spontaneous and adaptive mutation hypotheses in bacteria. The plan is to train students in certain key multidisciplinary aspects of current genetics such as sequence databases, DNA mutations, and hypothesis testing, while introducing the fluctuation test. This seminal experiment was originally performed studying "Escherichia coli" resistance to the infection by bacteriophage T1. The fluctuation test initiated the modern bacterial genetics that 25 years later ushered in the era of the recombinant DNA. Nowadays we know that some deletions in fhuA, the gene responsible for "E. coli" membrane receptor of T1, could cause the "E. coli" resistance to this phage. For the sake of simplicity, we will introduce the assumption that a single mutation generates the resistance to T1. During the practical, the students use the program to download some fhuA gene sequences, manually introduce some stop codon mutations, and design a fluctuation test to obtain data for distinguishing between preadaptative (spontaneous) and induced (adaptive) mutation hypotheses. The program can be launched from a browser or, if preferred, its executable file can be downloaded from http://webs.uvigo.es/acraaj/MutateWeb/Mutate.html. It requires the Java 5.0 (or higher) Runtime Environment (freely available at http://www.java.com). (Contains 1 table and 5 figures.)

AB  - Teaching practices in natural settings such as activity-based intervention (ABI) are suggested as alternatives to be used in effective early childhood education. As a multidisciplinary model, ABI consists of four components, which are choosing activities according to the child's interests; teaching generalizable goals embedded in routines and planned activities; and using before and after behavior stimuli which have natural and meaningful relations with behaviors. The benefits of using ABI within instructional settings include providing children with multiple-practice opportunities; teaching the target skill within the framework of daily routines without further need for any extra activity; focusing on children's interests and intrinsic motivation; and enhancing the level of success in educational settings. Considering these advantages and benefits, one can state that practices based on activity-based intervention can be used effectively for children with developmental disabilities from various age and disability groups. This article included descriptions and examples of activity-based intervention.

AB  - Several previous studies have investigated the use of questions to facilitate interactions in academic lectures in tertiary education. However, the issue of how disciplinary cultures influence the patterns of questions in lectures has received little attention. Therefore, this study aims to examine the interdisciplinary differences in professors' use of questions in terms of both their forms and functions. The corpus used in this study consists of 15 small-class lectures from three academic divisions: Humanities & Arts (HA), Social Sciences & Education (SS) and Physical Sciences & Engineering (PS). These data are a subset of the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English (MICASE). Previous studies on academic spoken English have reported that, compared with other contextual factors, the disciplinary culture seems to exert a more critical influence on the use of various linguistic features. However, the results of this study show far more similarities than differences across different disciplines. Based on the major findings pertaining to the use of question forms and functions across the three divisions, it is suggested that for questions in academic lectures at the tertiary level, the influence of genre seems to outweigh that of disciplinary culture.

AB  - Trends toward short-term academic service-learning abroad necessitate programs designed to maximize effectiveness and measurement of outcomes. The current study sought to strategically foster and measure increases in global mindedness during an immersive community-based global learning program abroad. University students studying either Computer Science or Spanish collaborated to design curriculum and host a technology summer camp for junior-high students in the Dominican Republic. The semester before the two-week travel experience included extensive pre-departure preparation, collaboration, reflection, and communication among students, program directors, on-site program coordinators, and stakeholders in the host community. Results of pre- and post-tests using the Global Mindedness Scale indicate perceptions of five dimensions of global mindedness (i.e., responsibility, cultural pluralism, efficacy, global centrism, and interconnectedness) were significantly increased after participating in this program. Pre-departure activities, curricular design, and logistical elements of the program are discussed, along with recommendations for future research.

AB  - In recent years, schools (as well as universities) have added cyber security to their computer science curricula. This topic is still new for most of the current teachers, who would normally have a standard computer science background. Therefore the teachers are trained and then teaching their students what they have just learned. In order to explore differences in both populations' learning, we compared measures of software quality and security between high-school teachers and students. We collected 109 source files, written in Python by 18 teachers and 31 students, and engineered 32 features, based on common standards for software quality (PEP 8) and security (derived from CERT Secure Coding Standards). We use a multi-view, data-driven approach, by (a) using hierarchical clustering to bottom-up partition the population into groups based on their code-related features and (b) building a decision tree model that predicts whether a student or a teacher wrote a given code (resulting with a LOOCV kappa of 0.751). Overall, our findings suggest that the teachers' codes have a better quality than the students'--with a sub-group of the teachers, mostly males, demonstrate better coding than their peers and the students--and that the students' codes are slightly better secured than the teachers' codes (although both populations show very low security levels). The findings imply that teachers might benefit from their prior knowledge and experience, but also emphasize the lack of continuous involvement of some of the teachers with code-writing. Therefore, findings shed light on computer science teachers as life-long learners. Findings also highlight the difference between quality and security in today's programming paradigms. Implications for these findings are discussed.

AB  - The Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside has developed and implemented an innovative, multidisciplinary undergraduate curriculum in Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics (MBB). The objective of the MBB program is to give students a hands-on facility with molecular biology theories and laboratory techniques, an understanding of mathematical and physical concepts, an ability to apply these concepts to MBB, and a proficiency with the computational tools and skills related to bioinformatics. We hypothesized that a greater exposure to bioinformatics methods, more rigorous requirements in math and computer science, and a constant demand for integrating information in hands-on laboratory courses would help students develop better analytical skills. Indeed, the assessment data support these predictions. Interestingly, 80% of MBB majors apply and are accepted into graduate schools. (Contains 3 tables and 1 footnote.)

AB  - This paper represents part of the author's experience, received during the seminar named "Practical Hermeneutics," moderated from 2006 to 2010 terms at the Institute for Philosophical Research--Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. The participants were from different field of knowledge and with different scientific status--from PhD students to professors and doctors of sciences. The main topic of the seminar was a particular kind of text, named "hyper-coded," because of superimposing of codes from different fields of human culture, science, practice, technology etc. The aim of the seminar was to reveal the variety of codes hidden by different authors in their texts. The multiformity of interweaved codes could be found even in small texts like surrealistic prose-poems. The analysis of texts containing diversity of codes can lead not only to a new theory and methodology of interpretation, it could become a basis for understanding of contemporary culture with its diversity and multiformity.

AB  - Teachers need to be able to design and implement problem-based learning (PBL) experiences to help students master the content and the processes in new mathematics and science education standards. Due to the changed population of learners within schools, it is also critically important that teachers in the elementary grades have the abilities to work effectively with English language learners (ELL). This article discusses the implementation of a major initiative by our teachers college to achieve both of these goals through Problem-Based Enhanced Language Learning (PBELL), which combines PBL, enhanced opportunities for language, and ELL methods. The implementation began with a small group of faculty members developing and piloting PBELL experiences, with coaching spread throughout the program. Our student-teachers are graduating with multiple opportunities to experience PBELL as learners and to design and implement PBELL experiences.

AB  - Community-based research and learning can never be prescribed. The study entitled "Intergenerational Learning in Indigenous Textile Communities of Practice," funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, illustrated this point in many ways. Although it was conceived as community-based research, it was not initially regarded as arts-based; this is what it became. Both the data-gathering and research-mobilization methods were arts-based. The study provided meaningful lessons in informal, Indigenous, and intergenerational learning within textile communities of practice of Indigenous beaders and weavers from Canada and Chile.

AB  - Critical reading of science-based media reports is an authentic context in which to explore the mutual interests of teachers of science and English, who want to use science in the media to promote their subject discipline while encouraging cross-curricular learning. This empirical study focused on 90 teachers of science and English to explore their aptitude and capability for critical reading of science-based news reports. The influences of specialist subject culture and the extent of classroom experience contributed to the distinctive nature of the responses. The study revealed features in critical reading that were characteristic of the subject background of the participants. It suggested approaches to initial teacher education and ongoing professional development that would be mutually beneficial to teachers from different disciplines in promoting among pupils a critical approach to science-related news media.

AB  - The field of gifted and talented studies has its origins in the intelligence quotient research of the late 19th and early 20th century. These psychological foundations remain a strong influence even though the field has since expanded to include other paradigms and greater diversity in conceptions of giftedness and talent. Some researchers argue that the field could benefit from greater interdisciplinary engagement, especially in studies of gifted and talented girls, which tend to include a focus on how gifted girls' external environments influence their emotional worlds. This article proposes that concepts developed by critical sociologist Pierre Bourdieu are useful for expanding and deepening understandings of the internal and external worlds of gifted and talented girls. It offers evidence from a recent qualitative study with academically gifted and talented teenaged girls in New Zealand. The results highlighted the marginalised position of the gifted and talented identity and the privileging of identities that were based on dispositions versus innate ability. The study also identified a hierarchy of valued forms of capital within the teenage girl social landscape and a resulting theorisation of an empowered gifted and talented girl habitus. This article demonstrates how Bourdieu's work is a constructive addition to the field.

AB  - ABSTRACT For some time, there has been a call for cross-disciplinary teaching within the business disciplines. With the rise of data and analytics, there is an opportunity for cross-disciplinary teaching by integrating technology throughout the business curriculum. However, many business professors have little experience in cross-disciplinary teaching. We hope to rectify this by introducing an approach that uses prelecture material to prepare students for learning concepts and terms that are not core to the focal class. In a study that combines Structured Query Language (SQL) coding with an audit principle called Benford's Law, we analyze the impact of adding prelecture material about Benford's Law on student's cognitive load, knowledge gained, and instructional efficiency. Results indicate that students who received a prelecture on Benford's Law outperformed the control group in performance measures related to Benford's Law, and that the instructional efficiency on Benford's Law was also higher for the treatment group. We did not find any significant differences in cognitive load between the two groups, nor did the treatment group perform significantly better when tested on the SQL concepts. We conclude that cross-discipline teaching is a fine balance between each discipline and communicating to students the importance of both disciplines is key.

AB  - The study of policy in comparative education has been approached using methods associated with the principal social science disciplines that have informed the field since its inception. In particular, the disciplines of history, political science, sociology, and anthropology have had a significant influence on determining the acceptable methods for comparative educational policy analysis, as evident by studies of policy published since the mid-1990s in "Comparative Education Review." Given the multidisciplinary orientation of comparative education, it is curious that the discipline of linguistics remains virtually absent from the pages of the field's flagship journal. This dearth is particularly anomalous today when one considers the interest in critical inquiry as a framework for interpreting the discursive aspects of knowledge production. Such interest makes it an opportune time to consider how one type of linguistic analysis--critical discourse analysis (CDA)--could enhance the comparative study of educational policy. In this article, the authors engage in a twofold analysis to "make transparent" an opaque element in contemporary international development discourse: "partnership." They use CDA as both framework and methodology to scrutinize the claims of partnership in the poverty reduction policies of the United Republic of Tanzania.

AB  - EU policies promote mobility as a part of contemporary doctoral education. EU-funded doctoral candidates are expected to move country, establish international research networks; travel for workshops, conferences and research stays abroad; and collaborate across disciplines as well as work in other sectors during their doctoral training. As far as EU policies are concerned, competence in all these 'mobilities' is essential for future knowledge workers in a competitive, global economy. But how do doctoral fellows themselves experience mobility? A survey of 3,410 EU-funded doctoral fellows shed light on their experiences of geographical, sectoral, interdisciplinary and social mobility. It showed that many PhD candidates are excited by the opportunities they see in their doctoral programmes, but they often experience tensions between their professional and personal desires.

AB  - Teacher education for sustainability is a central part of integrating sustainability into classrooms and schools. However, educating for sustainability is not limited to increased content knowledge; rather it encompasses different forms of knowledge that embrace the normative, dynamic and action-oriented nature of sustainability. Curriculum for a summer sustainability programme had previously been developed based on an interdisciplinary approach which incorporates research and practice from the fields of education pedagogy, sustainability and behaviour change. This article synthesises the insights provided by K-12 teachers who participated in this programme and another teacher who utilised the curriculum during a sustainability unit in her 8th form science class in Phoenix, AZ. Data was collected through surveys and interviews over the course of a year. The key findings indicate that one of the major barriers to moving away from traditional, didactic approaches to education is the importance placed on standardised tests. As long as external forces and incentive structures reinforce methods of lecture and assess, teachers will struggle transitioning to more experiential, real-world methods that enhance a multiplicity of knowledge. One important suggestion made by the teachers was for increased support by universities through pre-service and in-service programmes focused on educating for sustainability.

AB  - The purpose of this chapter is to contribute a cultural-historical analytical perspective on disability and its intersections. We assume that disability is socially, historically, and spatially constructed. This standpoint enables us to understand and disrupt disparities in education that affect students living at the intersection of disability with race and other identity markers. We trace the evolution of disability as an object of protection and injustice from before 1916 to 2016. The chapter is divided into three sections: disability constructions and intersections before 1960, consolidation of the intersections of difference with disabilities between 1960 and 1990, and the protean nature of disability intersections and fragmentations in contemporary history between 1990 and the present. We review legal, social, and academic discourses and offer interdisciplinary conceptual tools to understand the technical and sociopolitical anatomies of disabilities. We end with a brief discussion of future interdisciplinary research programs, including attention to a biocultural dimension in the study of this complex phenomenon.

AB  - Work in the new area of Mind, Brain, and Education (MBE) raises epistemological and ethical issues. With respect to epistemology, the norms of the component disciplines must be honored and the resulting amalgam must be more than a mere sum of the parts. With respect to ethics, the roles of scientist, educator, and practitioner each raise ethical dilemmas and the MBE worker must be cognizant of each set of dilemmas and the possible strains among them. Only if both of these spheres are confronted can good work be achieved in MBE.

AB  - This article will present an ongoing Erasmus + Innovative Academic Course on Integrative Interventions for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders, IACIIC-ASD, implemented betweeen 2017/2019 by the West University of Timisoara (WUT) Department of Educational Sciences, in partnership with Universita degli studi di Firenze (UNIFI), Universitatea Lucian Blaga din Sibiu (ULBS) and Sveuciliste u Zagrebu Edukacijsko-Rehabilitacijski Fakultet (ERF). The need for an internationaly developed course in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is high because all of us must stay in tune with current theoretical and methodological approaches to provide best quality training for the future specialists. The ASD is one of the most researched domain in special education and related fields and the parents and specialists feel a constant need to find new solutions and modern therapeutic methods for best addressing the children needs. By proposing a course that will present the most recent theories and findings in the field and will discuss the best options in educating the children with ASD we aim to train better professionals and increase the future specialists' competence. Also, this course will be accessible via an on-line platform so becoming an open/course for all interested parties. The virtual clinic for ASD will be a virtual scientific environment where students, academics, specialist and parents can exchange knowledge, expertise, experiences and good practices.

AB  - Students want to discuss each and everything related to the subject as well as the personal matters with their teacher. This shows that they trust their teachers so much than anyone else. So it is the duty of the teacher to teach the subject with more and more concrete examples and connections with the day to day life. They should connect the subject with all disciplines so that rather than opening the new memory location the information will store on the location which was already created on the brain. In the light of the above discussion researcher (authors) decided to carry out a research (article) on Cross Curricular Connections. Cross Curricular Connections to science instruction can result in rich and meaningful experience for students. The article that follows describes Cross-Curricular or interdisciplinary connections and their values to learners. Then, it lists specific considerations a Science teacher, or any other teacher, should consider before setting aside instructional time to make Cross Curricular Connections.

AB  - In eighth grade, students usually learn about forces in science class and linear relationships in math class, crucial topics that form the foundation for further study in science and engineering. An activity that links these two fundamental concepts involves measuring the distance a spring stretches as a function of how much weight is suspended from the spring. After students have collected data, they plot the data on graph paper and determine that the relationship is linear. Students then calculate the slope of a best-fit line and construct a linear model. This model is used by students to predict how far an additional weight will stretch the spring. Finally, students test their prediction and examine how accurate their model is. This activity requires two 40-minute classes to complete and should be conducted toward the end of a unit on force and motion. Because this activity is interdisciplinary and student centered, and yields excellent (reproducible) results, students remain engaged and interested as they learn about how math is used in the "real world" of science and engineering.

AB  - The Freshmen Research Initiative at Iowa State University promotes student interest and retention in science through introductory course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). Successful strategies for the implementation of CUREs on a large scale in an affordable manner included the use of a postdoctoral coordinator and affiliation with student learning communities. Across multiple disciplines, students in single-semester introductory research courses reported personal gains related to research, to thinking and working like scientists, to attitudes and behaviors of a scientist, and to gains in skills as reported on the Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment. Key outcomes related to persistence in STEM, including self-efficacy and project ownership, were also suggested as early gains due to course-based research.

AB  - The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Center for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) carried out the "Learning Sciences and Brain Research" project (1999-2007) to investigate how neuroscience research can inform education policy and practice. This transdisciplinary project brought many challenges. Within the political community, participation in the project varied, with some countries resisting approval of the project altogether, in the beginning. In the neuroscientific community, participants struggled to represent their knowledge in a way that would be meaningful and relevant to educators. Within the educational community, response to the project varied, with many educational researchers resisting it for fear that neuroscience research might make their work obsolete. Achieving dialogue among these communities was even more challenging. One clear obstacle was that participants had difficulty recognizing tacit knowledge in their own field and making this knowledge explicit for partners in other fields. This article analyzes these challenges through a knowledge management framework.

AB  - This mixed methods case study examined the implementation of a 1:1 iPad initiative in a suburban, co-educational, independent, preK-4th grade elementary school in the United States. This article focuses on how teachers used iPads to differentiate instruction and across multiple content areas. Findings show the processes by which teachers employed iPads demonstrated a myriad of teaching and learning opportunities. Overall, teachers integrated iPads into the existing curriculum to complement or enhance their lessons, provide different choices for students to engage with content, or for them to delve deeper into the content. Additionally, iPads were often used in interdisciplinary ways, involving a combination of at least two different content areas during one lesson.

AB  - Despite the long history of the study of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), two facts remain obvious. First, there are almost as many conceptions regarding the definition of PCK as there are researchers interested in it. Second, it is largely unclear which methods enable teacher educators to best prepare teacher candidates to use PCK. Recently, two themes have emerged strongly as mechanisms for helping teacher candidates become more accomplished practitioners. These two ideas, reflective practice and teacher as researcher, can be seen in a variety of teacher preparation programs. However, prevailing systems for preparing and accrediting teachers seem to have a strong enough hold over the process that completely different approaches to preparation, centered on these ideas, may have difficulty getting started. The authors offer a working model of a transferable teacher preparation program that is founded upon the concepts of reflective practitioner and teacher as researcher. They offer a study of the Graduate Program in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education (GMST) at their school as an example of one way in which the ideas can be used to reorganize teacher preparation programs with the explicit goal of preparing teachers to become reflective practitioners and creating teachers as researchers. The master's curriculum of GMST program is designed and organized around putting into practice educational theory and research relating to the ways that students learn mathematics, science, and technology. The mission of the program is to prepare teachers of grades 1-12 by endowing them with a strong background in the content of mathematics, science, and technology, as well as understanding of the particular needs of diverse learners with respect to teaching mathematics, science, and technology. The authors discuss the GMST program and its historical development.

AB  - Both majors and course enrollments in the liberal arts have been in decline since the recession of 2007. The College of Liberal Arts at Purdue University has sought to reverse this by offering a new outreach program to science, technology, engineering, and math, and management students called Cornerstone. Cornerstone is a 15-credit-hour certificate that pivots faculty from their departmental courses to a new first-year sequence for students across the university. The faculty created alternatives to the obligatory, skills-centered English composition and introductory speech courses at Purdue, primarily taught by graduate students. In designing Transformative Texts, they deliberately set out to create a course that all liberal arts faculty would want to teach. This would be a course that would do more than reinforce skills; it would also enrich the lives of students and inspire them with a love of learning and all its related virtues: empathy, perspective, wisdom, and joy. The faculty also wanted these classes to emphasize mentorship, giving first-year students across the campus a mentorship experience with a full-time faculty member, someone who could guide them, foster their talents and interests, and continue to be a resource throughout their college career. This new sequence, Transformative Texts I and II, marries written and oral communication skills with foundational readings and acts as a gateway to more advanced liberal arts courses. To complete that Cornerstone certificate, students take three more liberal arts courses that align with their interests, from science and technology to health care and medicine. Preparing faculty to teach Transformative Texts has reenergized liberal arts faculty and helped make them better teachers, helped them learn more about how their college and university work, and created partners with other units across campus, equally concerned about the liberal arts and the welfare of students.

AB  - Developing and implementing relevant, challenging, integrative, and exploratory curriculum is critical at all levels of schooling. This article describes one attempt to develop and implement an instance of interdisciplinary curriculum by using copy change with trade books to teach earth science. Specifically, it introduces trade books as a way to integrate science and literacy and address national science and literacy content standards. It also describes using copy change to teach earth science in a fifth-grade classroom and shares samples of student work that resulted from this engagement. It ends with reflections of the experience and final thoughts for integrating science and literacy at all levels of schooling. (Contains 7 figures and 4 tables.)

AB  - Amid calls for integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (iSTEM) in K-12 education, there is a pressing need to uncover productive methods of integration. Prior research has shown that increasing contextual linkages between science and mathematics is associated with student problem solving and conceptual understanding. However, few studies explicitly test the benefits of specific instructional mechanisms for fostering such linkages. We test the effect of students developing a modeled process mathematical equation of a scientific phenomenon. Links between mathematical variables and processes within the equation and fundamental entities and processes of the scientific phenomenon are embedded within the equation. These connections are made explicit as students participate in model development. Pre-post gains are tested in students from diverse high school classrooms studying inheritance. Students taught using this instructional approach are contrasted against students in matched classrooms implementing more traditional instruction (Study 1) or prior traditional instruction from the same teachers (Study 2). Students given modeled process instruction improved more in their ability to solve complex mathematical problems compared to traditionally instructed students. These modeled process students also show increased conceptual understanding of mathematically modeled processes. The observed effects are not due to differences in instructional time or teacher effects.

AB  - The relation between information science and library science has been debated for decades, and even attempts at utilizing methods generally acknowledged as robust for the purpose of mapping research fields have yielded results with large variations. Therefore, a set of citation analyses was performed, comparing the results of analyses on information science and library science separately but also as a joint library and information science (LIS) field. Although there are large differences, not the least in the author-level analyses, the patterns in the citation data support the concept of a joint LIS field with information science and library science being the two main subfields; many of the variations in the analyses are caused by the interdisciplinary nature of LIS, reflected in, for example, variations in citation practices in the different subfields.

AB  - There is widespread interest among discipline-based science education researchers to situate their research in the existing scholarly literature base. Unfortunately, traditional approaches to conducting a thorough literature review are unduly hindered in astronomy education research as the venues in which scholarship is reported are fragmented and widely dispersed across journals of varying disciplines. The international STudies of Astronomy education Research (iSTAR) online repository is the result of a concerted international community effort to collect and categorize existing research from peer-reviewed journal articles, dissertations/theses, and grey literature. In a "first light" survey of over 300 U.S. dissertations, we find: (i) work in AER dates back to 1923; (ii) the number of extant dissertations is far greater than anticipated; (iii) research methods definitions have evolved; and (iv) most work has studied participants' broad knowledge rather than specific learning targets. The surprisingly wide breadth of rarely cited research motivates us to collect more AER from across international and cross-disciplinary sources.

AB  - Cross-disciplinary (CD) learning experiences benefit student understanding of concepts and curriculum by offering opportunities to explore topics from the perspectives of alternate fields of study. This report involves a qualitative evaluation of CD health sciences undergraduate laboratory experiences in which concepts and students from two distinct disciplines [chemistry (CHEM) and exercise physiology (EPHE)] combined to study exercise thermoregulation and sweat analysis. Twenty-eight senior BSc Kinesiology (EPHE) students and 42 senior BSc CHEM students participated as part of their mutually exclusive, respective courses. The effectiveness of this laboratory environment was evaluated qualitatively using written comments collected from all students as well as from formal focus groups conducted after the CD laboratory with a representative cohort from each class (n = 16 CHEM students and 9 EPHE students). An open coding strategy was used to analyze the data from written feedback and focus group transcripts. Coding topics were generated and used to develop five themes found to be consistent for both groups of students. These themes reflected the common student perceptions that the CD experience was valuable and that students enjoyed being able to apply academic concepts to practical situations as well as the opportunity to interact with students from another discipline of study. However, students also reported some challenges throughout this experience that stemmed from the combination of laboratory groups from different disciplines with limited modification to the design of the original, pre-CD, learning environments. The results indicate that this laboratory created an effective learning opportunity that fostered student interest and enthusiasm for learning. The findings also provide information that could inform subsequent design and implementation of similar CD experiences to enhance engagement of all students and improve instructor efficacy.

AB  - In order to meet the challenges of sustainable development, our approach to education must be modified to equip students to evaluate alternatives and devise solutions that meet multi-faceted requirements. In 2009, faculty in the Departments of Civil, Industrial and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington began implementation of a project entitled "Engineering Sustainable Engineers" to infuse the departments' curricula with sustainability. The project, funded by the National Science Foundation, was designed to improve students' awareness of and ability to use sustainability in alternative analysis for engineering decision making. Key outcomes of the project are discussed. These include: (1) course modules for engineering courses that are common to most engineering curricula; (2) a sustainable design checklist, which is a tool that the team designed to facilitate alternative analysis on the basis of sustainability; and (3) models for implementing quality sustainable industry internships and multidisciplinary sustainability-related senior design projects. Engineering Sustainable Engineers is one of the many efforts at UT Arlington to emphasize sustainability, not only as a campus initiative, but also in teaching future engineers to consider the impacts of their design solutions on future generations and on the environment. The modules and tools that have been developed can serve as models for other institutions to implement. (Contains 2 tables and 7 figures.)

AB  - A Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) summer Bridge Program was developed for high school students. The program was designed to encourage students to consider choosing an engineering major in college and to explore STEM as a future career. This was accomplished through a 10-week program involving multidisciplinary research activities. The participants in the program included 33 high school students. Among former participants in position to make a choice in terms of attending college, 100% had chosen to continue on in college, and 86% had chosen to major in a STEM area. The results indicated that that the program had enhanced their confidence in STEM and motivated them in choosing careers in STEM areas. Overall, the participants were very positive about the program and expressed appreciation for the opportunity. (Contains 3 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of an integrated science and mathematics methods course on preservice early childhood teachers' efficacy beliefs for integrating these content areas. Thirty-four preservice teachers participated in this study, which utilized a quasi-experimental design with two treatment groups. Participants in two cohorts were tested to assess their efficacy beliefs for teaching science, mathematics, and integrated science and mathematics before and immediately after instruction that lasted 8 weeks. Results indicated a statistically significant change in preservice teachers' efficacy beliefs scores from pre- to posttest measures. These results provide evidence that the methods course utilized in the present study was effective in enhancing preservice teachers' efficacy beliefs for integrating science and mathematics.

AB  - Previous studies of author productivity in business and management education (BME) research have focused on single disciplinary areas, and even single journals. This study is the first to examine the productivity of BME scholars across multiple disciplinary areas (i.e., accounting, economics, finance, information systems, management, marketing, and operations/supply chain management). We analyzed a pool of 17 BME journals with the highest "hg"-index, by including the top three journals in the accounting and information systems areas, the top two journals in each of the other disciplinary areas, and an interdisciplinary BME journal. This examination covered a 10-year period (2005-2014), 4,464 articles and 9,617 article co-authors. We identified 7,209 unique authors in this pool and ranked their productivity to create a "Key Authors" list. Each of the top 99 authors had five or more articles in our database. Our findings indicate the potential for cross-disciplinary dissemination of research ideas and opportunities for scholars to enhance their research profile, because even a small increase in productivity can lead to substantial movement in the BME rankings of authors.

AB  - Seven years ago we were asked, as one of our first teaching duties at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), to teach a 5 ECTS point course on "Colloid and Surface Chemistry". The topic is itself at the same time exciting and demanding, largely due to its multidisciplinary nature. Several "local" requirements posed additional challenges. The course is part of the international program of the university, typically at the start of the M.Sc. studies (7th-8th semester) and can be followed by students of different M.Sc. programs (Advanced and Applied Chemistry, Chemical Engineering or Petroleum Engineering). B.Sc. students towards the end of their studies can also follow the course. Also due to the multidisciplinary nature of the course topic, a wide variety of industries in Denmark has shown interest in the course, which has led to a development of a separate industry course. In this article we report on our experience from the first years of teaching and how teaching methods and course material have been adapted in order to meet the aforementioned challenges, as well as feed back and course evaluation from students. First, we present the learning objectives of the course followed by a discussion of the teaching methods used over the years. The most challenging topics covered in our course are highlighted as well as a discussion of the textbooks employed. Supplementary initiatives e.g. link to a laboratory course are shortly presented followed by our assessment of the current status and some suggestions.

AB  - In addressing the nation's need for a more technologically-literate society, the Rutgers University Research Experience for Teachers in Engineering (RU RET-E) is designed to: (1) engage middle and high school math and science teachers in innovative "green" engineering research during the summer, and (2) support teachers in integrating their research experiences into their academic year, precollege classrooms. The current paper addresses the following two questions: (1) To what extent did RU RET-E impact participants? and (2) To what extent did participants implement resulting lesson plans? During the 2011 summer, seventeen math and science teachers (RU RET-E Fellows) engaged in "green" research alongside faculty and graduate students. Teachers were required to apply to the program in pairs as one math and one science teacher from the same school. The rationale was that the team would develop interdisciplinary lessons and that teachers would have a colleague at their school who shared the same experience as supports during the school year. The paper provides an overview of the summer experiences and the academic year follow-up activities. Data from the pre- and post-surveys and follow-up questionnaire about lesson implementation are presented. Preliminary data evidences that RU RET-E was successful in enhancing teachers' understanding of engineering and supporting them as they designed lessons for their precollege classrooms. Most notably, teachers' confidence in their ability to define engineering, describe what engineers do, generate challenging problems for advanced students and integrate engineering into their curriculum increased significantly.

AB  - This article considers how professional writing courses can prepare students in various disciplines for the workforce. Specifically, I argue for Writing in the Disciplines (WID) internships where students learn to write documents relevant for their careers while participating in practical work experiences. In the WID internships I describe, instructors collaborate with coordinators across campus to establish writing-intensive internships that focus on the needs of students and the community partner. This article illustrates the collaborative endeavors of three internships, highlighting the challenges and lessons learned from WID internships.

AB  - Concern regarding the secularization of Christian higher education has prompted researchers to investigate the extent that faith and learning is integrated at a faculty level and what factors might predict faculty integration (Lyon, Beaty, Parker, & Mencken, 2005). This research attempted to replicate Lyon et al.'s (2005) logistic regression model predicting faculty integration of faith using survey responses gathered as part of Phase II of the Council for Christian Colleges & Universities (CCCU) Denominational Study (Rine, Glanzer, & Davignon, 2013). Respondents included 2,074 faculty from 55 institutions. The first model used in this study suggested that the most powerful predictors of faculty integration are full-time employment status, earning a degree from an institution that shares the same denominational affiliation, and a match between the faculty member's religious denominational affiliation and the institutional affiliation. A second logistic regression model added faculty academic specialization as a predictor of integration to investigate if that model was a better fit. Results suggested that religion and philosophy instructors are the most likely to integrate faith into their teaching, and professors specializing in computer science, math, and engineering were the least likely. As faculty are considered the primary influence on the integration of faith and learning, existing faculty and institutional administrators concerned with maintaining faith in the classroom may want to consider the contributing factors discussed.

AB  - Purpose: The main goal of this article is to learning define and justify group problem solving as an approach to citizenship education. It is demonstrated that the choice of theoretical framework of democracy has consequences for the chosen learning goals, educational approach and learning activities. The framework used here is an epistemic theory of deliberative democracy. It is argued that such an approach enhances teachers' and pupils' autonomy. Design/methodology/approach: First, it was discussed what kind of theory of democracy lies behind the mainstream approach to citizenship education. Then, it was demonstrated how a chosen theory of democracy and citizenship leads to a specific translation into educational principles. In order to define and translate the chosen framework into educational principles and learning activities, different disciplines were drawn upon: political philosophy, cognitive and educational psychology. Findings: Group problem solving was defined as an alternative participatory educational approach to citizenship education and four educational principles were defined: argumentation, connected learning, decision making and thinking together. Practical implications: Educationalists, policy makers and researchers working on citizenship education should discuss their ideals of democracy and citizenship in order for these to become an object of scrutiny in the curriculum.

AB  - In the atmosphere or on the ground, snow provides students with unique opportunities to discover winter weather patterns. Traditionally, when students study weather, it is limited to the collection of data one would see on a weather report. However, the interdisciplinary Students Synthesizing Snow data in Natural Objective Ways (SSSNOW) project implemented with sixth-grade students involved the collection and synthesis of authentic winter weather data in their school courtyard. Through this, students discovered that the physical properties of snow can be altered due to temperature changes and physical pressure. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - Human resource development (HRD) is recognized as an interdisciplinary field covering the breadth of behavioral and social sciences. However, since its inception, instructional systems design (ISD), a methodology widely used in the HRD field, has been based on a narrow range of behavioral science. Grounded in general system's theory, the ISD framework has primarily been presented as asocial in orientation and application, drawing primarily on individual theories of learning. This manuscript considers the emergence and history of current ISD technologies, and presents a social ecological framework to facilitate the integration of behavioral and social science theory into the ISD process. Research and training initiatives using the social ecological framework are discussed as are implication for HRD research and practice. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - The understanding of complex physiological processes requires information from many different areas of knowledge. To meet this interdisciplinary scenario, the ability of integrating and articulating information is demanded. The difficulty of such approach arises because, more often than not, information is fragmented through under graduation education in Health Sciences. Shifting from a fragmentary and deep view of many topics to joining them horizontally in a global view is not a trivial task for teachers to implement. To attain that objective we proposed a course herein described--Biochemistry of the envenomation response--aimed at integrating previous contents of Health Sciences courses, following international recommendations of interdisciplinary model. The contents were organized by modules with increasing topic complexity. The full understanding of the envenoming pathophysiology of each module would be attained by the integration of knowledge from different disciplines. Active-learning strategy was employed focusing concept map drawing. Evaluation was obtained by a 30-item Likert-type survey answered by ninety students; 84% of the students considered that the number of relations that they were able to establish as seen by concept maps increased throughout the course. Similarly, 98% considered that both the theme and the strategy adopted in the course contributed to develop an interdisciplinary view. (Contains 2 tables and 1 box.)

AB  - This study considered how arts integration impacted preschoolers concerning the students' acquisition, understanding, and retention of information about animal habitats. This current investigation used control and experimental conditions to determine the effects of art integration during students' block building of animal habitats and their subsequent recollections of their work; this activity also incorporated the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and National Core Art Standards. The two NGSS standards utilized in the study are K-2-ETSI-1 and K-2-ETST-2. Overall, combined child-reported correct animal and habitat characteristics gain scores on the posttest and distal posttest showed significant differences between the two conditions, favoring the experimental arts-integrated condition with a medium effect size in both cases. These promising results from this study showed the increase not only in knowledge about animals and their habitats, but in creativity as the students integrated art materials into a traditional block center to create their animal habitats.

AB  - Written in response to criticism of our work by Fouad Abd-El-Khalick, this position paper reaffirms and reinforces our position about the need to broaden and enrich the scope of nature of science (NOS) oriented curricula by exposing students to the voices of practising scientists. While Abd-El-Khalick's motivation for promoting the so-called consensus view of NOS is rooted in issues of assessment (or "benchmarking", as he calls it), we argue that the major reason for teaching about NOS is its contribution to what Shen calls civic and cultural scientific literacy. We are critical of the consensus view for its philosophical naivety, failure to reflect contemporary scientific practice and potential for confusing students, and we re-state our view that it is important to expose students to a diversity of practice among the sub-disciplines of science. We argue that richer NOS understanding and a more authentic view of scientific practice can be achieved through direct and indirect contact with scientists at the cutting edge of research and development, which we characterise as learning about scientists, learning from scientists and learning with scientists.

AB  - Along with inquiry-based teaching, exploring the elements of art can guide students to view and represent objects realistically. Understanding line, shape, color, value, form, space, and texture helps bridge the gap between what students actually observe and what their preconceived ideas about the object may be. This type of explicit instruction prevents misconceptions. If teaching science process skills through an art venue presents a challenge, try collaborating with an art teacher or with other colleagues to introduce the art element activities. With the focus on language arts and math, elementary students have had little art instruction, so this is an appropriate lesson for elementary students of any age. In order to develop observational skills and perspective, it is imperative for children to understand art elements. Furthermore, facilitating a connection between science, art, and the familiar environment will enhance and strengthen children's learning. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - As the United States strives to achieve energy independence, students need to be literate about energy and environmental issues. In this article, the authors present a lesson about the nation's electricity resources that is part 1 of a free, comprehensive unit on coal and energy that is available online (http://tinyurl.com/coalenergyunit). The comprehensive unit, which was developed by graduate students supported by the Transforming Earth System Science Education project at Penn State University, contains inquiry-based lessons designed to deepen students' understanding of key Earth-science issues. Data on electricity-generation resources in the United States, including both renewable and nonrenewable types, are highlighted within the lesson of part 1. Part 2 of the comprehensive unit includes lessons that address more detail about coal. In both parts of the unit, students learn fundamental information about the development and use of domestic energy sources. The full lesson for part 1 is included here, but both parts of the comprehensive unit are also described. Completion of all or part of the unit will provide an interdisciplinary look at the nation's energy resources. (Contains 4 figures and 1 online resource.)

AB  - In an attempt to address perceived shortcomings in traditional content-area literacy preparation, an interdisciplinary group of teacher education faculty developed an approach called "content-driven literacy" (CDL), which was applied to the design of courses to prepare preservice secondary science and social studies teachers. This article describes the development and implementation of the CDL course work and its five elements: reading and writing embedded in subject matter, explicit instruction, planning and modification of literacy instruction, research-based instruction, and the use of diverse content-area texts. The types of knowledge the preservice teacher participants gained from this approach and implications for secondary content instruction are discussed. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Various changes in the spheres of education policy and school management over recent decades have sparked a renewed interest in the issue of school culture and its potential to understand processes of leadership and academic performance. What are the contributions and potentialities of organizational culture for understanding school organizations and their leadership processes? This article has two goals: (i) to identify trends and theoretical particularities inherent to the major approaches to organizational culture, focusing on research carried out in the school setting; (ii) to debate the heuristic usefulness of a theoretical proposal for studying organizational culture in the school setting. The article presents a multidimensional analysis of school organizational culture, considering political, social and educational factors, aiming to capture the unique nature of school cultures and their links to processes of leadership and management. By linking these to different leadership perspectives, this model may inspire further comparative study of educational management in an international context. This approach demonstrates the need to tailor models for analysing organizational culture to the school environment, to achieve a deeper and more solid understanding of school life and leadership and management phenomena.

AB  - General education requirements have long been a component of college and university baccalaureate programs. The courses have traditionally focused on the disciplines in the arts and sciences including mathematics, sciences, humanities, social sciences, and the arts. Family and consumer sciences (FCS) programs also offer courses in areas such as child development and nutrition that are included in many university general education offerings. Recently, courses under the rubric of cultural diversity have been added to general education core requirements. FCS programs offer global perspectives in their courses focus on individuals, families, and environments solely from a global perspective. Considering the interdisciplinary nature of the profession, FCS faculty are well positioned to offer courses focused on cultural diversity for university-wide credit. The Family and Consumer Sciences Department at a liberal arts college offers a course titled "Human Needs and Global Problems" in the World Perspectives component of the Common Core. The course uses a sustainable development paradigm to address human needs and issues in developing countries. The course objectives address knowledge of global issues, an appreciation for other cultures, and development of theoretical skills for considering global issues in the future. This course can be a model for FCS-sponsored university-wide cultural diversity courses. (Contains 1 resource.)

AB  - Intercultural education has arisen in the last two decades as an intersectional field of academic knowledge and professional development, located at the borders and in the confluence of the multicultural paradigm in the social sciences, the anthropology of education, and other interdisciplinary subfields commonly known as Intercultural Studies. As will be discussed throughout this article, the thematic range represented by the broad topos of interculturality-in-education is not limited to questions about minority groups, but is closely linked to core issues of national identity and broad societal identification processes. Therefore, in order to be able to critically engage in a fruitful, truly "intercultural" dialog between multicultural theorists and activists, on the one hand, and between academic and practitioners' knowledge on diversity, we need a particularly, and constantly, self-reflexive and mutually comparative hermeneutical approach. In this way, we can avoid the traps and bridge the biases of the underlying, but omnipresent, self-fulfilling, and self-essentializing identity discourses in broader national society as a whole.

AB  - Background: Educational neuroscience is a relatively new discipline. However, many obstacles persist in delaying the success of an interface between neuroscience and education. One such major obstacle has been the spread of neuromyths. Purpose: The main aim of this study was to verify whether Portuguese teachers are susceptible to misinterpreting neuroscientific findings and believe in neuromyths that might ultimately impair their teaching--or simply waste time investing in techniques that will not aid their students. Sample: A sample of 583 Portuguese teachers from different areas of expertise participated in this study. The participants were aged between 25 and 61 years (mean = 41; SD = 9) and taught at Preschool to High School levels. Design and methods: We designed a questionnaire to assess whether teachers believed in the neuromyths. Non-myth/myth statements were presented, alongside an open-ended question concerning the links between brain and education. Together, these queries afforded a database of the teachers' knowledge concerning neuroscientific facts and neuromyths. Results: Our results suggest that teachers fail to distinguish myths from facts, irrespective of the area taught and level of teaching. However, our findings also indicate that, although teachers have difficulties in untangling myths from facts, Portuguese teachers are interested in the workings of the brain and recognise the potential of neuroscientific information in education. Conclusions: Results from this study suggest that communication between neuroscientists and teachers must be improved through an open, interdisciplinary dialogue. This research raises questions that should help to develop educational neuroscience as a discipline. Namely, we highlight the need for a translation of the educational neuroscience facts into a language shared by teachers; and the need for specific training so that teachers might make adequate use of education-related neuroscientific findings in the classroom.

AB  - By modifying secret writing formulas uncovered from the archives of the East German Ministry of State Security (MfS or Stasi), a novel general chemistry secret writing laboratory was developed. The laboratory combines science and history that highlights several fundamental chemical principles related to the writing. These include catalysis, redox reactions, kinetics, complex formation-precipitation, and acid-base reactions. After a background historical presentation, students don the mantle of counterintelligence to discover the location of a terrorist bomb on campus. In the process of deciphering the secret message, they pull together the chemical concepts to "save the day". (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - A steward of the discipline was originally defined as "someone who will creatively generate new knowledge, critically conserve valuable and useful ideas, and responsibly transform those understandings through writing, teaching, and application". This construct was articulated to support and strengthen doctoral education. The purpose of this paper is to expand the construct of stewardship so that it can be applied to both scholars "and non-academic practitioners", and can be initiated earlier than doctoral education. To accomplish and justify this, we describe a general developmental trajectory supporting cross-curriculum teaching for stewardship of a discipline as well as of a profession. We argue that the most important features of stewardship, comprising the public trust for the future of their discipline or profession, are obtainable by all practitioners, and are not limited to those who have completed doctoral training. The developmental trajectory is defined using the Mastery Rubric construct, which requires articulating the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) to be targeted with a curriculum; recognizable stages of performance of these KSAs; and performance level descriptors of each KSA at each stage. Concrete KSAs of stewardship that can be taught and practiced throughout the career (professional or scholarly) were derived directly from the original definition. We used the European guild structure's stages of Novice, Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master for the trajectory, and through a consensus-based standard setting exercise, created performance level descriptors featuring development of Bloom's taxonometric cognitive abilities (see Appendix A) for each KSA. Together, these create the Mastery Rubric for Stewardship (MR-S). The MR-S articulates how stewardly behavior can be cultivated and documented for individuals in any disciplinary curriculum, whether research-intensive (preparing "scholars") or professional (preparing members of a profession or more generally for the work force). We qualitatively assess the validity of the MR-S by examining its applicability to, and concordance with professional practice standards in three diverse disciplinary examples: (1) History; (2) Statistics and Data Science; and (3) Neurosciences. These domains differ dramatically in terms of content and methodologies, but students in each discipline could either continue on to doctoral training and scholarship, "or" utilize doctoral or pre-doctoral training in other professions. The MR-S is highly aligned with the practice standards of all three of these domains, suggesting that stewardship can be meaningfully cultivated and utilized by those working in or outside of academia, supporting the initiation of stewardship prior to doctoral training and for "all" students, not only those who will earn PhDs or be scholars first and foremost. The MR-S can be used for curriculum development or revision in order to purposefully promote stewardship at all levels of higher education and beyond. The MR-S renders features of professional stewardship accessible to all practitioners, enabling formal and informal, as well as self-directed, development and refinement of a professional identity.

AB  - The role of peers in U.S. doctoral education is a topic that has been minimally researched and has received only passing attention. Yet peers are an important part of every doctoral learning community. One possible explanation for the lack of attention given to peers in doctoral education is that pedagogically, doctoral education is generally thought of as an apprenticeship in which doctoral students learn primarily from one master: their advisor. In this article, the authors argue that peers at the doctoral level are best understood as "learning partners." In support of this assertion, they present empirical evidence from two different studies that show the role that peers can play in the development of doctoral students into independent researchers and members of their academic community. The first study looks at the role of the apprenticeship model in doctoral education, and the second study is an evaluation of interdisciplinary doctoral initiatives funded by the National Science Foundation Integrated Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) programs. Finally, the authors conclude that additional research is needed to further understand the unique dynamics of peer learning in doctoral education.

AB  - To help students learn science concepts, Pharmacology Education Partnership (PEP)--a science education program that incorporates relevant topics related to drugs and drug abuse into standard biology and chemistry curricula was developed. The interdisciplinary PEP curriculum provides six modules to teach biology and chemistry principles within the context of pharmacology topics (e.g., drugs of abuse, nerve gas). Teaching modules include catchy names, such as "Acids, Bases, and Cocaine Addicts," "Steroids and Athletes: Genes Work Overtime," and "How Do Drugs Damage Neurons: It's Radical!". To date, PEP has provided professional development for 300 biology and chemistry teachers participating in the studies (and another 100 teachers at ongoing workshops). National field-testing of the curriculum in approximately 16,000 students reveals that the more PEP modules the teachers use, the better their students perform on tests of biology and chemistry concepts. An additional benefit of this approach might also be to students make intelligent decisions about drug use, although this remains to be tested. Substantial gains in achievement may be possible when high school students are taught science using topics that are interesting and relevant to their lives.

AB  - In response to the call of "BIO2010" for integrating quantitative skills into undergraduate biology education, 30 Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Program Directors at the 2006 HHMI Program Directors Meeting established a consortium to investigate, implement, develop, and disseminate best practices resulting from the integration of math and biology. With the assistance of an HHMI-funded mini-grant, led by Karl Joplin of East Tennessee State University, and support in institutional HHMI grants at Emory and University of Delaware, these institutions held a series of summer institutes and workshops to document progress toward and address the challenges of implementing a more quantitative approach to undergraduate biology education. This report summarizes the results of the four summer institutes (2007-2010). The group developed four draft white papers, a wiki site, and a listserv. One major outcome of these meetings is this issue of CBE--"Life Sciences Education", which resulted from proposals at our 2008 meeting and a January 2009 planning session. Many of the papers in this issue emerged from or were influenced by these meetings. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - In this article, we review the publications served by the "Canadian Journal of Science, Mathematics and Technology Education" in the past 15 years, specific to the field of mathematics education, and make connections with development of the field. In particular, we adopt current Editor-in-Chief John Wallace's (2009) approach of "looking back, looking forward," to reflect on the journal's development both qualitatively, by recapping significant moments of the journal and highlighting recurrent themes, and quantitatively, by reviewing the number of contributions in terms of country, language, and genre. In looking forward, we inform a discussion of future directions of the journal.

AB  - This article proposes that in addition to training teams of students to succeed in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling, the contest and the preparation for competition can be successfully used as a framework to teach an auxiliary skill set to undergraduate STEM majors through workshop-style modules. The skills emphasized are collaboration across disciplines to creatively approach a problem, scientific writing, and the visual display of quantitative information. These skills are highly valued in industry and graduate study, yet are not always explicitly taught in a traditional undergraduate curriculum. The contest experience gives students a realistic appreciation for collaborative science work. Moreover, the active learning aspect of the preparation is broadly linked with student success in STEM, particularly for traditionally underrepresented STEM students.

AB  - The relevance of the topic is due to the enhancing role of emotional intelligence in second language learning. The article aims to substantiate that emotional intelligence (EI) strengthens training quality of future professionals, gives it an emotional color, and thereby increases a variety of intellectual skills. The leading methodical approaches as analyses of electronic library documents and other scientific sources, empirical and experimental data, method of involved observation enabled to identify several parameters for creating a favorable emotional climate in the process of second language learning. The authors determine a set of conditions necessary for the formation of emotional intelligence, define and actualize obligatory interdisciplinary connections, which are expressed in the co-architecture of curricula, educational resources of the university faculty and in the choice of training and educational technology, as well as single out the prerequisites for emotional intelligence. Article is of interest to researchers and university professors dealing with Second Language Learning.

AB  - Background and Context: Non-traditional training grounds such as coding boot camps that attract a higher proportion of women are important sites for understanding how to broaden participation in computing. Objective: This work aims to help us better understand the women choosing boot camps and their pathways through these camps and into the computing workforce. Method: This paper reports on a longitudinal, qualitative study investigating female boot camp attendees. Findings: Findings show that women attending boot camps are career changers that develop an interest in software development too late to major in CS, discovering a post-college enjoyment of programming undertaken to support work goals at a current job or an aspirational job. Implications: Women at boot camps illustrate a missed opportunity to diversify postsecondary CS classrooms when not recruited early, not given interdisciplinary options, not exposed to enjoyable programming tasks, and not exposed to the array and number of job prospects.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify if wireless keypads could facilitate interprofessional interaction among undergraduate paramedic, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, health science, social work and midwifery students. Secondary research aims included the examination of students' perceptions of interprofessional education and how students perceived using wireless keypads in large lecture classes and smaller tutorials. The study used a mixed methodology approach via self-reporting questionnaires and focus groups that included (n = 210) students in week 1 and (n = 151) students in week 13 of an undergraduate unit. Overall, students were satisfied with the use of wireless keypads in their interprofessional undergraduate unit of study. While modest findings supported the use of wireless keypads in improving student interaction, other findings were statistically significant in understanding the roles of other health professions and why collaboration in health-care environments was important for professional growth. The following themes emerged from the qualitative data: engagement, satisfaction, use of educational technology, interprofessional education and learning environment. Integration of wireless keypads has assisted undergraduate students to better appreciate and understand other health-care disciplines within an interprofessional education setting. Students reported that they appreciated the alternative teaching and learning approach that wireless keypads offered, thus improving engagement and interactivity, and providing a broader understanding of other allied health-care professions.

AB  - Concept inventories, consisting of multiple-choice questions designed around common student misconceptions, are designed to reveal student thinking. However, students often have complex, heterogeneous ideas about scientific concepts. Constructed-response assessments, in which students must create their own answer, may better reveal students' thinking, but are time- and resource-intensive to evaluate. This report describes the initial meeting of a National Science Foundation-funded cross-institutional collaboration of interdisciplinary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education researchers interested in exploring the use of automated text analysis to evaluate constructed-response assessments. Participants at the meeting shared existing work on lexical analysis and concept inventories, participated in technology demonstrations and workshops, and discussed research goals. We are seeking interested collaborators to join our research community. (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.)

AB  - This paper describes a multidisciplinary teaching program, designed to provide students with the broad knowledge and skills required to practice product development in robotics and mechatronics. The curriculum was designed to prepare students for the senior capstone design project, in which they design and build a working mechatronic/robotic system. It consists of a basic program in mechanical engineering, augmented with courses and laboratories in electronics, microprocessors, control, and computer programming. The early introduction of the specialty courses and the ample hands-on experience offered in the accompanying laboratories allows students to gain intuitive understanding of concepts that are usually foreign to mechanical engineers. The capstone design project attracts students to the program and serves as a beacon for the entire program. The program is now in its 11th year, receiving positive feedback from students and graduates.

AB  - This article provides educators in business schools with a new interdisciplinary experiential lab game called Supply Chain-Marketing (SC-Mark) Shark Tank game, which can be implemented in both Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Marketing courses. The SC-Mark experiential lab game is a real-life business environment simulation that explores complexities in advertising industry service supply chains. One hundred sixty-one undergraduate students participated in the game at two business schools over two semesters. The effectiveness of the game was measured and analyzed, qualitatively and quantitatively, based on text analysis of the feedback received from participating students. The results revealed five themes that helped student teams understand how advertising companies integrate and improve their service supply chains--buyer-supplier relationships, supply chain functions and operations, consumer focus and orientation, community focus, and overall risk management.

AB  - Many changes in teaching practices (such as introduction of e-assessment) are initiated by school management, or by a lead teacher, but have direct impact on the learning designs of others. However, models of teachers as innovators, conducting evidence-based inquiry into their students' learning, view the teacher as initiator of change in their own practice (normally as individual). This paper addresses the question of whether such models can also be applied to change introduced by top-down processes. In this paper, we examine teacher inquiry in such a context. We discuss a case study in which we worked with the Head of Science (HoS) of a secondary school. The HoS designed a cross-curricular science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) project with 57 STEM teachers and introduced Google Forms as a tool for formative assessment. We supported the HoS to design and conduct an inquiry that involved all teachers. We examine the context and process of inquiry and how it was applied. Our findings provide insight into teachers' use of tools and representations when communicating about learning design, and the implications of this for the development of learning analytics tools. They also inform the development of a method for coordinating teacher inquiry in cross-curricular projects and, more generally, in the context of top-down introduction of change.

AB  - In 1999, the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science introduced a new kind of compulsory arts education in secondary school aimed at stimulating cultural participation among Dutch youth. This article examines whether the course, called "Cultural and Artistic Education," succeeds in doing so. Data on 3,851 secondary school students (ages 14-16) in the Netherlands reveal that enrollment in Cultural and Artistic Education stimulates participation in high culture and, to a smaller degree, popular culture. The effects apply equally to students with different gender, ethnic minority, and family background status. A positive effect on attitude toward art only partly holds and is less convincing. No effects were found on the complexity of the attended cultural activities. (Contains 5 tables, 2 figures, and 1 endnote.)

AB  - An interdisciplinary team of science and education faculty at the University of Illinois at Chicago and several Chicago-area community colleges developed and implemented a series of four integrated, inquiry-based science courses for preservice elementary school teachers. All four courses are based on guiding principles taken from the rich literature on constructivist teaching and learning of science developed in recent decades. Further, their content and pedagogy align with national and state standards (National Academy of Sciences 1997; NRC 1996, 1997). This article describes each course and elaborates on a particular principle, sharing representative examples of how this principle is enacted in that course. (Contains 8 figures and 1 table.)
