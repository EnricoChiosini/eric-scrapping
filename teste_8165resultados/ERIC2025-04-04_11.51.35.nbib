AB  - Instructionally supportive accountability tests (a) measure students' mastery of only a modest number of extraordinarily important curricular aims; (b) describe what is to be assessed in clear, teacher-palatable language; and (c) report each student's results for every curricular aim assessed. To determine the suitability of such assessments to serve as the upcoming federally mandated science tests in the United States, an analysis of the potential applicability of instructionally supportive accountability tests in the field of physical science was carried out. It was concluded that this genre of accountability tests constitutes a viable option to satisfy U.S. requirements for accountability assessment in science. Such tests, while providing accurate school-evaluation data, can also serve as catalysts for improved instruction. (Contains 5 figures and 2 footnotes.)

AB  - In this short paper, avowedly personal, partial and pointillist in nature, I (i) sketch the early days of (mainly Anglo-American) information studies and the field's gradual institutionalization, (ii) describe its maturation, as both an academic discipline and a domain of professional practice, and (iii) speculate on its future in the light of oft expressed predictions of its imminent demise as an autonomous enterprise within the academy. I invoke import-export data to demonstrate the newfound outer-directedness of the field and the growing attractiveness of its research to cognate disciplines. However, I also argue that the permeability of contemporary information studies' boundaries may in fact be the cause of its eventual undoing: in short, epistemic promiscuity comes at a price.

AB  - The existence of two distinct cultures within our society, the arts and the sciences, was introduced by physicist C. P. Snow in his 1959 Reed Lecture at Cambridge University and was further illuminated by Snow in "The Two Cultures, a Second Look" (1964). Lamenting the existence of the cultural chasm while also fearing a widening of the schism, Snow opened a dialogue with the hope of reconciliation between the cultures. Fifty years later, although the chasm still exists, numerous entities and individuals within the cultures work to formulate the means by which the cultures may be bridged, and, subsequently, the chasm narrowed and eliminated. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) is one such entity, and leaders of the group have worked since the council's establishment in 1920 to research, promote, and improve the teaching and learning of mathematics through innovative, reformative approaches. Reform-oriented curricula are built upon constructivist perspectives aimed at assisting students in utilizing their own unique backgrounds and experiences to develop a personal understanding of mathematical situations. One means of infusing personal experience into the mathematics curriculum, while also bridging the aforementioned cultures, is through the incorporation of children's literature, yet there exists great variance in the type, format, structure, and success of the methodology's implementation. Subsequently, while the reformative approach of mathematics literature integration presents as a means of building understanding by bridging the cultures of mathematics and the humanities, it is the educator's choices relevant to the approach which have the greatest impact on the outcomes of the approach.

AB  - Jory Brass and Leslie David Burns provide a useful and informative review of research appearing in the "English Journal" ("EJ") and "Research in the Teaching of English" ("RTE") over the past 100 years. It is a bit unfortunate, if understandable, to exclude books and articles in other journals, because such a restriction excludes many pieces of excellent research not published under what Brass and Burns call the NCTE imprint. This restriction also limits the questions that might be asked. More important questions than those about continuities and discontinuities in the published work appearing in "EJ" and "RTE" might have been the following: (1) What has been accomplished in the 100 years in which NCTE has nurtured research related to the teaching of English?; and (2) What impact has that research had on the teaching of English? In this article, the author turns his attention to these two questions and discusses several factors that account for the failure of teachers to take advantage of the research findings.

AB  - The origin of the Science-Humanities Program (NEXA) at San Francisco State University, California, is described. The overall goal of NEXA was to provide a model for reconciliation between the two cultures, science and humanities (philosophy, literature, history, and the arts). The first objective was to establish a sense of collegiality and common purpose among the faculty of these fields. A second objective was to derive its new curriculum. Beginning with a core of 10 courses, this curriculum has enlarged to 20 courses taught by humanist-scientist teams. These courses are designed to provide basic concepts, historical perspectives, and acquaintance with current issues involving mutually the sciences and the humanities. The NEXA curriculum may be used by students to satisfy  general education and elective requirements or to serve as the basis of major or minor programs. Additionally, a special master's curriculum is available for qualified students. The third objective of NEXA was to offer public events of high interest that brought to focus concerns shared by humanists and scientists, and the fourth was to disseminate the idea of science-humanities cooperation throughout a 19-campus system by means of consultations, conferences, and workshops. A historical summary is presented of the so-called "two-cultures" dilemma, whose origins are traced to the 17th century and whose consequences for the 19th and 20th century experience are examined in detail. Specific attention is paid to the new field of sociobiology as an example of scientific reductionism. The  present plight of the humanists, the role of logical positivism, and possible future alternatives for a rehumanized philosophy are also examined. Another area of concern is "the new humanities."

AB  - Context: Statewide studies indicate a continuing shortfall of personnel in several allied health disciplines in rural Georgia. National trends indicate lagging enrollment in allied health education programs, suggesting that the workforce shortages will worsen. Purpose: This article describes the efforts of the School of Allied Health Sciences at the Medical College of Georgia to increase allied health student participation in interdisciplinary health care services in rural areas of the state during fiscal years 2001-2003. Methods: Brief program description and results from survey data provided by the student participants, program administrators, and clinical site supervisors. Results: Three-year totals indicate that 98 students (70 female, 28 male) participated and 42% reported low-income status. In line with the goals of the grant, the proportion of minority student participants steadily increased from 5% to 12% over the 3-year period. Rotation locations included 62 designated Health Professional Shortage Area counties, 71 federally designated Rural Health Clinics, and 6 Community Health Clinics. At the conclusion of the students' rural health care experience, 76% (55/72) responded positively when asked: If you had the opportunity, would you accept employment at the rotation health care site? Conclusions: The project appears to be positively affecting allied health students perceptions and opinions of rural health practices and willingness to work in rural areas. Although long-term goals have yet to be accomplished, early indicators show benefits to the students and the community at-large, suggesting that the current program strategies are appropriate connectors between allied health students and rural communities.

AB  - The impacts that the lack of physical cues and non-verbal cues of emotional expression has on the student learning experience in text based online environments were targeted separately in this study. A questionnaire was constructed with separate items for non-verbal cues of emotional expression and cues to physical identity. The survey also included questions about students' previous experience with technology and collaboration, and their motivations for undertaking the course. Views about their interactions with other students were also sought. The responses of 256 students who had undertaken a text based online course where collaboration was a mandatory requirement were collected and subsequently analysed using cluster analysis. Four distinct cohorts of students were identified. Using a conceptual approach borrowed from neuroscience, modularity, it has been possible to encapsulate the effects of three distinct aspects of collaborating in text based online contexts, lack of cues to physical identity, lack of cues to emotional expression and interaction experience. These aspects were analysed alongside the student profiles for each of the four cohorts. The findings indicate that the external factors that an individual student brings to a learning context can impact on the learning experience. Neuroscientifically based knowledge that is relevant for the findings of the survey are identified and considered in terms of the questions raised from an interdisciplinary perspective.

AB  - In this article, the author describes a bike trip which marks the culmination of a unit reviewing map-reading capabilities. In seventh grade, students develop various map skills, including cardinal and intermediate directions, how to measure distance on a map using a scale of miles, how to interpret the legend of a map, and how to locate places using latitude and longitude. The bike trip brings several of these skills to life. Students have to use real maps of the Milwaukee area to plan the route of the bike trip from Maple Dale School in Fox Point, Wisconsin, to the lakefront. They need to be able to follow directions while using the map and to measure distance on it. There are some guidelines which students need to follow in planning the routes. Bikers travel from Maple Dale School to Veterans Park by Lake Michigan, which is about a 25-30 mile roundtrip route. Students who do not want to bike are offered an alternative that also requires planning with a map: a walk of about eight miles from Maple Dale to Klode Park in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin. To help students orient the map to the actual direction they are facing, the science teacher usually teaches a lesson on orienteering prior to the trip.

AB  - The research reported in this paper explores the applicability and efficacy of a variant of problem-based learning, the Preparation for Future Learning (PFL) approach, to teaching and learning within the context of a cross-curricular, middle school data literacy unit called "Thinking with Data" (TWD). A quasi-experimental design was used to compare pre-to-post-test data literacy gains of seventh grade students participating in the TWD unit with other seventh graders in two middle schools in northeast Ohio. Results show statistically significant differences between the two groups. Taken together with participant comments, the findings suggest that the PFL approach can be effectively implemented across subject areas to support the development of data literacy.

AB  - We developed, piloted, and evaluated a successful model for integrating other disciplinary perspectives while learning a specific discipline. Faculty who taught first-year biology and mathematics courses produced examples of how these disciplines complement each other. These faculty presented students with the connecting threads that integrate mathematics and biology within their own courses. Intervention group students (those exposed to the integration) were block scheduled in biology and mathematics sections taught by participating faculty to evaluate the outcomes. Compared to the control group students, who had not been exposed to integration, the intervention group students perceived that they understood the application and relatedness of mathematics and biology, and they appreciated this integration in their courses. Similar integrations could be achieved elsewhere using the model we present. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - This article describes teaching a course called Harry Potter and Politics. Focusing on aspects of political culture, the class tackled themes of identity, institutional behavior, and globalization. Teaching Harry Potter has several benefits. Students are both familiar with the wizarding world and yet have enough distance to examine it dispassionately. The book is driven by ethnic conflict, political power struggles, and dysfunctional bureaucracies. Finally, there is an academic literature on the books. Beyond Harry Potter, teaching politics through popular culture is not only natural for addressing political culture, but taps into the ways undergraduates are increasingly experiencing politics.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework to demonstrate the contribution of whole school approaches embodied by the health-promoting school approach, to the promotion of school connectedness, defined as the cohesiveness between diverse groups in the school community, including students, families, school staff and the wider community. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-disciplinary review of literature was conducted to identify strategies consistent with the health-promoting school approach and the values and principles that promote school connectedness. The review included peer-reviewed articles and published books and reports identified from the databases spanning the education, health, social science and science disciplines and used search terms encompassing health and mental health promotion, schools, social connectedness, belonging and attachment. The paper is also a framework of the contribution of the health-promoting school approach to promoting school connectedness and was developed drawing on health promotion strategies at the broader community level known to foster connectedness. Findings: The paper found that the framework developed illustrates how the health-promoting school approach has the potential to build school connectedness through two major mechanisms inclusive processes that involve the diversity of members that make up a community the active participation of community members and equal "power" relationships, or equal partnerships among community members and supportive structures such as school policies, the way the school is organised and its physical environment, that reflect the values of participation, democracy and inclusiveness and/or that promote processes based on these values. Practical implications--In this paper the detailed mechanisms outlined in the framework provide practical strategies for health promotion practitioners and educators to use in the everyday school setting to promote connectedness. Originality/value: This paper draws together substantial bodies of evidence and makes a persuasive case for the contribution of the health-promoting school approach to building school connectedness.

AB  - We have reached a moment in history when it is time to reenvision certain basic aspects of the existing models of teaching and research in higher education in order to foster a deeper knowledge of the nature of our existence as human beings in a world that is intricately interrelated on many levels. This article suggests that one way to accomplish this is to develop a new field of academic endeavor that takes account of the emerging scientific work on the neurological foundations of the concentrated and relaxed states of mind attained by meditation and by a variety of other human endeavors, and applies them directly to our lives. It is important that we do not study them only as objects divorced from our own experience, but bring our own subjectivities directly into the equation. The field I am proposing, "contemplative studies," would bridge the humanities, the sciences, and the creative arts in an effort to identify the varieties of contemplative experiences, to find meaningful scientific explanations for them, to cultivate firsthand knowledge of them, and to critically assess their nature and significance.

AB  - This paper focuses on the developments experienced by natural philosophy and mathematics in Bologna during a period of rapid change in the relationship of the various disciplines in the faculty of Arts and Medicine. Insisting that university science was characterized by a greater vitality than the traditional historiography usually concedes, this examination first offers some comments about the place of natural philosophy in the Italian universities, then discusses more specifically the University of Bologna. Changes that took place in the funding of natural philosophy, in the designation of astronomy and mathematics, and in the cycle of books read for natural science are all examined in turn and are complemented by a series of tables.

AB  - Like other literacies (textual literacy, numeracy), digital visual literacy (DVL) is the ability both to create and to understand certain types of information, in this case visual materials created with a computer. DVL is now essential in many daily life and workplace tasks, from looking critically at newspaper images or TV evening news to using a digital camera, making a Web site, creating presentations, and modeling and visualizing data in virtually all of the sciences. DVL is, of course, also now essential in all visually oriented disciplines. Defining the underlying principles of DVL and integrating it into established curricula presents many challenges. This article describes some of these and the authors' responses, using experiences from an innovative course at Brown University and a larger-scale community-college-based project, Digital Visual Literacy.

AB  - Highly interesting but unimportant seductive details are commonly added to scientific texts, harming reader comprehension and memory for important content while also potentially evoking a strong emotional response. In two experiments, the effects of seductive details on participants' memory and emotional responses to seductive and nonseductive scientific texts were explored. In Experiment 1, participants read two scientific texts on related scientific topics with embedded seductive details and rated the sentences for importance and interest. In Experiment 2, participants read and then recalled one seductive and one nonseductive scientific text and rated the emotional responses they experienced during one reading task and one recall task. Participants rated seductive details as more interesting than important and recalled fewer scientific concepts from seductive texts compared to nonseductive texts. Although negative emotions were predictive of better recall of scientific concepts, the presence of seductive details and positive emotions were predictive of a reduced recall performance.

AB  - Statistics is the art and science of gathering, analyzing, and making conclusions from data. However, many people do not fully understand how to interpret statistical results and conclusions. Placing students in a collaborative environment involving project-based learning may enable them to overcome misconceptions of probability and enhance the learning of statistics concepts. This type of structure may also encourage debate and discussion, which can promote student engagement and new thinking while cultivating social development. This article discusses "Our School as 100 Students," a project the authors completed in five of their sixth- to eighth-grade math classes. The cooperative-learning-group model allowed students to work together to learn and apply the statistics concepts of survey populations, survey questioning, and survey methods. Promoting cultural awareness was another goal. The project explores how the world would look with only 100 people, if proportionally scaled. The idea is based on work from the 100 People Village (100 People Foundation), which uses world statistics to "educate, entertain and inspire participants to learn more about world geography, culture, language, religion, music and resources." The "Our School as 100 Students" project replicated this work by exploring school statistics and showing how the school would look with only 100 students, maintaining proportions. It culminated with a video showcasing the school as 100 students, which displayed the results of a survey that the students designed and conducted. The project objectives involved both statistical understanding and social awareness. The primary goal was to enhance students' understanding of statistics by providing an engaging project that explored their world. The underlying goal was to illustrate to students how their world, in the form of middle school, encompassed students from different backgrounds. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)

AB  - In this article, the authors show how oceanography can enlighten and energize the teaching of middle- and high-school social studies on a grade-by-grade basis, and they describe "hooks" from oceanography that will heighten students' interest in various social studies topics. They base the article on their own experiences--as a university-level geography professor who teaches oceanography and world regional geography and as a middle- and high-school social studies teacher who is pursuing a Ph.D. in geography education. They focus on factors associated with the changing role of geography in U.S. schools. They review the professional literature to determine the amount of cross-over between oceanography and social studies and use the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) from the Texas Education Agency (2001), which is similar in many respects to other state standards, as a means to analyze social studies instruction and learning objectives on a grade-by-grade basis. They provide examples from each grade's curriculum to show how oceanography can enliven and complement instruction. They also show how such an approach can help students understand that local problems are often a part of larger world problems and how an understanding of science can help them better understand social science issues, such as environmental problems, which may be local or global in scale.

AB  - In the 1990s, fueled by the momentum of the inclusive schools movement, where students with disabilities were being encouraged to participate in their neighborhood schools and adults with disabilities were self-advocating for a chance at community independence, the collaboration model among professionals burgeoned as best practice for serving individuals with disabilities. However, although the concept of collaboration was recognized as a best practice initiative, most service providers were not prepared to make the leap to discipline reciprocity where professionals were required to actually practice cross-disciplinary skills in the workplace. With this historical framework and gap in the research in mind, the faculty of the Special Education Program at the Benerd School of Education, University of the Pacific, in collaboration with another faculty member from the Speech-Language Pathology Department, Long School of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, applied and were awarded a James Irvine Learning Assessment Grant to form an interprofessional, interdisciplinary working group. The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe the interprofessional collaborative group process, identify the outcomes of the collaborative working group and gather the perceptions of the faculty participants concerning their involvement in the group. The second component to the study was to measure the perceptions of students concerning their participation in the undergraduate course "Introduction to the Helping Professions." (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Data Day, an event that is the culmination of a multiple-week unit, is the perfect opportunity to work across disciplines and, in particular, aligns beautifully with skills and objectives geography teachers work on with their students. Bruce Jones at The Blake School in Hopkins, Minnesota, was the originator of Data Day. Jones described the project as a three-week unit on the scientific method in which Data Day is the focal point. On this day, students invite others in the school community to be the subjects of their experiments. This takes place in a carnival-like atmosphere as students ask other students, parents, and teachers to participate in taste tests, basketball shoots, memory games, video games, visual puzzles, song recognition activities, and other data-gathering experiments. Students are immersed in the scientific methods of planning and carrying out experiments, and gathering quantities of data, which are then analyzed, graphed, and presented orally and in published form. Bridget Williams, the dynamic fourth- and fifth-grade science teacher at National Cathedral School, established the annual Data Day at her school several years ago. Jones was her mentor, and Williams adapted his ideas to fit the schedule and needs of fifth-grade students. Before engaging in applying the scientific method for the Data Day project, Williams teaches students the scientific method and why each step is critical to the success of the experiment. The scientific method is: (1) observation; (2) statement of the problem/ask a question; (3) research; (4) hypothesis; (5) experiment; (6) record the data; (7) organize and analyze the data; (8) reach conclusion; and (9) share results. This Data Day model is a strong one for helping students see the interconnectedness of the different disciplines and for each discipline to achieve its desired objectives. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - The grocery store produce section used to be a familiar but rather dull place. There were bananas next to the oranges next to the limes. Broccoli was next to corn and lettuce. Apples and pears, radishes and onions, eggplants and zucchinis all lay in their appropriate bins. Those days are over. Now, broccoli may be next to bok choy, potatoes beside jicama, and the carambola, tomatillos, bitter melons, and tamarinds not far from cactus leaves, sapodillas, and pine nuts. The once dull and familiar produce section is no longer so dull and familiar. Instead of reinforcing the familiar, the produce section of most grocery stores has taken on a global flair with more and more international items arriving daily. The changes in the produce section make it a prime location for a lesson integrating science with social studies. That was the author's inspiration when she took a fifth-grade class to the grocery store. It ended up a recipe for success! Although our visit was part of a summer enrichment program, this "produce project" would be a great interdisciplinary adventure for any classroom.

AB  - Study of aeronautics is an interesting and motivating subject for students and educators alike. The activity described in this article--appropriate for upper elementary or middle school students--provides an excellent introduction to airplane design and the science of aerodynamics. It also gives students good experience applying knowledge from a variety of academic areas. After researching airplane design and aerodynamics, students will use graphic communication skills to draw a glider design. They will then build a glider using wood, lightweight paper or wax paper, and rubber bands. They will use language arts skills to document the design steps and manufacturing process. Finally, under instructor supervision, they will test their gliders, analyzing them for lift, drag, and overall performance. A section on research conducted by the authors on the evolution and current status of airplane flight and design is also included.

AB  - Changes in health care policy have led to an expansion of integrated care models that rely on collaboration among interprofessional health teams. Recent federal funding has encouraged the development of innovative training models to prepare social workers for integrated health practice. This article presents evidence from the first two MSW cohorts of the Integrated Mental and Behavioral Health Training Program funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration. Twelve students completing the program in 2014 (n = 5) and 2015 (n = 7) participated in evaluation activities at the time of program completion and at 1-year postgraduation. Findings highlight key components of the training program instrumental in student attainment of program goals and competencies. Implications for MSW education and training for practice in integrated care environments are discussed.

AB  - The rationale for the first-year seminar is to introduce freshmen to the university. The basic components of a first-year seminar are academic integrity, skill development, a sense of community, active and collaborative learning strategies, and technology. All freshmen must take a first-year seminar that consists primarily of freshmen, although upperclassmen may take the seminar depending on the course number. In this article, the authors present an interdisciplinary study of the SARS virus which provides opportunities for students in different disciplines to discuss the origin; spread; and global, economic, chemical, and biological aspects of the disease. Students benefit from these active discussions with each other and share their knowledge with others in a semester-end poster session. The authors conclude that teaching a first-year seminar on the SARS virus was exciting and enjoyable. Moreover, the academic and intellectual challenge of preparing to teach a new course is rewarded many times over by the sharing and learning that occurred with the students on a daily basis.

AB  - Piezoelectric actuators (or piezoactuators) are known for their nanoresolution and high-speed positioning capabilities. Therefore, they are used in scanning probe microscopes and in the design of innovative surgical tools and biomedical devices. The expected growth of engineering jobs in the nano- and bio-related fields, in which piezoactuators will play a significant role, motivated the development of a suite of teaching modules (lecture and laboratory materials) for the undergraduate mechanical engineering (ME) curriculum that focus on modeling and precision control of piezoactuators. Four laboratory exercises were designed to provide students with hands-on experience in data acquisition, sensors, and controller implementation. The developed modules were implemented in three undergraduate courses. The hypothesis being tested is that students who interact with these modules will gain a better understanding of piezoactuators and their application in nanotechnology and biotechnology. Through linked pre- to post-module comparisons, it is shown that students did, in fact, experience a positive change in their knowledge and understanding of the material.

AB  - Herein, we present an experience-based learning approach that uses the COVID-19 pandemics knowledge about virus spread and epidemics to establish an analogy between a simple epidemics model--the SIR model (susceptible--infected--removed), and a second-order autocatalytic reaction with subsequent catalyst deactivation. Our approach provides a simple and engaging way for students to learn chemical kinetics from a current situation (the pandemic) while presenting them with programming tools to numerically solve any system of differential equations that may result from more complex chemical kinetic schemes. We include the option to fit experimental data to extract meaningful rate constants. Following Kolb's cycle, we first establish the theoretical background of chemical kinetics and the SIR model and describe the analogy. Then, we propose the use of MATLAB and Python to numerically solve the system of differential equations associated with this model and plot the results showing the behavior of the system when changing the constants that describe the process, making the analogy with chemical kinetic constants. Finally, we fitted experimental data from the COVID-19 pandemic (up to early June 2020) to test the model and discuss the goodness of the fitting, the fitting parameters, and the utility of real kinetic data.

AB  - Collaborating with three university researchers, three seventh-grade teachers and their students worked on one component of a three-year NSF-funded research project examining the media messages about information technology and careers that middle school students receive from television, popular magazines, books, videotapes, movies, and Web sites. The overall national project examined whether the content of these media reinforces or hinders the development of gender and racial diversity in the information technology workforce. The component of the project discussed in this article was the pilot study for the development of a curriculum unit that could lead middle school students to an understanding of their media environment. The pilot study and the resulting curriculum unit sought the perspectives of the middle school students themselves while involving them as co-researchers. To this end, the seventh-grade teachers (a language arts, a math, and a science teacher) collaborated with the university researchers to develop and implement an interdisciplinary, project-based curriculum unit. This article describes the experiences of the teachers and their students and the meaning they gave their experiences.

AB  - The author asserts that something is wrong with university-based education for librarianship in Australia. Librarianship does not have a clear disciplinary identity in universities. The lack of differentiation between the roles of technicians and professionals clouds the issue. For these and other reasons, education for librarianship in Australia is suffering. Comparisons are made with the United States and Canada. Some suggestions for improving the quality of university-based education for librarianship, based on increased cooperation among departments of information studies, are made.

AB  - An Introductory Information System (IIS) course is an opportunity for Information System (IS) programs to clarify business students' understandings of IS disciplines and help them prepare for careers requiring IS skills. The course is also essential to attract students into the IS major and mitigate declines in IS enrollment. This paper provides a roadmap and description of implementing an IIS course as part of the business core curriculum at a public university in the Midwestern United States. The roadmap is rooted in both generalizable and institution-specific contexts and includes the identification of key stakeholders, institutional challenges, and nine course design principles. The core principles are outlined and recognized as the foundation of the success of the course. Following course implementation, we present the evaluation of the success of our roadmap and reflect on lessons learned in the process.

AB  - Because interest in catalysts is widespread, the kinetics of catalytic reactions have been investigated by widely diverse groups of individuals, including chemists, engineers, and biologists. This has lead to redundancy in theories, particularly with regard to the topics of homogeneous, heterogeneous, and enzyme catalysis. From a pedagogical perspective, it is useful to emphasize the common denominators that link these theories, which is an objective that is readily accomplished by deriving the rate laws for homogeneous, heterogeneous, and enzyme catalytic systems while using the vernacular of those disciplines. In doing so, one may translate the lexicon that is typically associated with those derivations, and this may be useful to individuals who study catalysis from an interdisciplinary perspective.

AB  - This study examined 57 learners' emotions (i.e., joy, anger, confusion, frustration) as they engaged with scientific content while learning about microbiology with Crystal Island, a game-based learning environment (GBLE). Measures of learners' prior knowledge, in-game text comprehension, facial expressions of emotion, and posttest reading comprehension were collected to examine the relationship between emotions and single- and multiple-text comprehension. Analyses found that both discrete and non-discrete emotions were expressed during reading and answering in-game assessments of single-text comprehension. Learners expressed greater joy during reading and greater expressions of anger, confusion, and frustration during in-game assessments. Further results found that learners who expressed a high number of different emotions throughout reading and completing in-game assessments tended to have lower in-game comprehension scores whereas a higher number of different expressed emotions while completing in-game assessments was associated with greater posttest comprehension. Finally, while increased prior knowledge was associated with higher single- and multiple-text comprehension, there was no interaction between prior knowledge and emotions on multiple-text comprehension. Overall, this study found that (1) learners often express more than one emotion during GBLE activities, (2) emotions expressed while learning with a GBLE shift across different activities, and (3) emotions are related to demonstrated comprehension, but the type of activity influences this relationship. Results from this study provide implications for how emotions can be examined as learners engage in GBLE activities as well as the design of GBLEs to support learners' emotions accounting for different activity demands to increase comprehension of single and multiple texts.

AB  - A central argument of this essay suggests that the truth of globalization is little known to the body politic as it is enmeshed in the dynamics of capitalist accumulation, avarice, and despotism. This project hopes to first locate, and then unmask the realities of globalization, warts and all. Gaining some knowledge of globalization, the discussion moves to reflect on how race and culture may be affected in the new era. Several questions propel this effort. Where is globalization located in the history and continuum of social, political, economic and cultural development? How can people define globalization? How is globalization reshaping the world and the nation? What are the implications for education in a globalized society? How might race and culture be impacted in a globalized environment? The study of globalization transcends many disciplines. As one who specializes in the political sociology of education and curriculum, the author typically draws from the social sciences, especially power analyses, focusing on knowledge selection (Apple, 1979, 1983) and knowledge sponsorship (Watkins, 2001). In this project the author employs the scholarship, literature, language, and analyses from political economy, modernization, development, and colonial theories. The aim is to offer a political economy of globalization and then move to social consequences. Because the literature is not widely known in the general academic or lay community, the author frequently offers background and definitional framework.

AB  - "We are on the eve of total contamination," said an eighth grade "toxicologist" at a mock town meeting at Mount Baker Middle School in Mount Vernon, Washington. The meeting was the culmination of a month-long investigation by students to determine why some of the townspeople were getting sick. During the unit, students used skills from several disciplines to pinpoint, assess, and address the environmental damage and health threat posed by a fictitious pesticide spill they uncovered. Students also gained insight into what it takes to respond to a community crisis and worked together to solve it. This article describes the details of the unit such as: the set up; researching the cause; water data; preparing to present; the town meeting; and assessment and conclusions. A brief list of resources is also included.

AB  - Environmental scientists warn that the health of the planet is rapidly deteriorating, and the primary cause of the crisis is human behavior. Psychology can contribute greatly to understanding and changing behaviors that negatively impact global ecosystems; however, environmental issues are not generally included in psychology curricula, and psychology is not often represented in environmental curricula. We describe the relevance of psychology to environmental problem solving; suggest how to integrate environmental issues into psychology courses; and urge psychology faculty to collaborate with environmental studies and science faculty to strengthen the training of future policy makers, conservation scientists, and activists. We conclude that psychology has a critical role to play in creating a sustainable society.

AB  - This paper explores how Engineering students and Work and Welfare students reflect upon their own engagement in a one-week cross-disciplinary project. To develop a better understanding of what unfolds during these activities we collected data through anonymous surveys two consecutive years. Data from these 141 respondents were analysed using a learning history approach and are presented as narratives. Results show major disruptions and conflicts driving the student projects, exposing inviting confrontations, social identity threats, managing diversity, and friction of ideas. Whereas this in many cases led to new and better project solutions, these real-world experiences raise awareness of the need for tools and methods for training students. The aim of the paper is to learn from students' experiences through narrative distance, and fill a gap in the literature between problem-based learning (PBL) and the learning history method. Discussing different experiences of cross-disciplinary teamwork through the explanations of these theories, we also lay out potential questions for future research on the topic.

AB  - Futurum in Sweden is described here as a school that does not have any classrooms, there is nothing like a timetable, no school bells can be heard, the students do not have any school bags, and teachers are without desks. Futurum is a radically new school that merges creative architecture with modern learning and teaching methods. This article describes student life at Futurum as a cooperative learning environment in which small teams made up of students of different levels of ability use different learning activities to develop their understanding of a particular subject. Pedagogical principles have been greatly improved, and subjects are not taught as facts. There is no learning by route. Subjects are integrated into a context and students approach them from a problem-oriented perspective. Chemistry and Maths are often interconnected using an overall theme. The combination of project work, group work, supported by a well equipped and caring environment, appears to create ideal preconditions for the declared pedagogical objectives of Futurum.
