AB  - In keeping with the scientific ideals and goals of actual practice, the concept of scientific literacy that drives the national science standards for elementary and middle school students also focuses on the process of science: observing, inferring, describing, asking questions, constructing explanations, and communicating ideas to others ("National Science Education Standards", 1996). In addition, the national standards emphasize the importance of social discourse within the classroom community and state that the ability to communicate a problem and design a solution, whether by oral, written, or pictorial means, is integral to scientific literacy. In this article, the authors discuss the value and importance of integrating writing into science classes, and the connections between science and poetry. They state that writing in science classes teaches students the language of science and how to engage in and guide scientific inquiry. They also state that writing poetry helps develop children's facility with figurative language, a precursor to the abstract thinking necessary for success in science. It also helps children to develop voice in their written work, a step toward writing like a scientist. The collaborative work that can be involved in writing poetry helps children function as "problem solvers rather than information receivers". (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - A review of United States-based two-year (82), four-year (38), and graduate (68) addictions professional preparation programs indicated that the discipline lacks consistency regarding name, whether preparation has a science or arts academic foundation, whether preparation has an academic or technical base, and what department or academic unit hosts the program. Educators, researchers and providers working in the substance abuse field who participated in informal discussions of the results of this study found this variation understandable and believed the emerging nature of the discipline, institutional politics, the variation in terminology used by state and local agencies, and the interdisciplinary nature of the field create these inconsistencies. These variations indicate that the addictions profession has not yet developed consensus on what terminology best describes the discipline, nor the curricular framework that leads to most consistent academic preparation. Further, this variation provides insights about the influence the discipline has on public policy and the perceptions of addictions studies held by the public, consumers, and other related health professionals. Moving to full recognition as a profession will require attention to the preparation of professionals, standards for credentialing, and expectations for professional conduct and continuing professional development.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review cross-disciplinary research on e-learning from workplace learning, educational technology, and instructional communication disciplines to identify relevant e-learning design principles. It aims to use these principles to propose an e-learning model that can guide the design of instructionally sound, usable, and interactive e-learning courses and programs for workplace learning. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is a review of empirical and conceptual e-learning literature from human resource development, workplace learning, educational technology and instructional communication. Findings: The paper presents a current review of e-learning design research, identifies convergent areas of e-learning design practices, and proposes a tripartite e-learning design model. Design principles identified in the literature review include adherence to instructional design principles based on adult learning principles, ensuring human-technology interface (usability) guidelines, and supporting online immediacy (social presence) attributes. Practical implications: An expanded view of e-learning design strategies grounded in a learning sciences perspective and encompassing research on behavioral, cognitive, constructivist and humanistic theories is offered. Originality/value: The study provides an integrated e-learning design model that represents main areas of e-learning research and suggests competencies for e-trainers. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - This article develops the concept of the "parental milieu" as a theoretical tool for biosocial research in environmental education and the emerging field of critical life studies. Using the concept of milieu as a catalyst for theoretical inquiry, we map several movements and variations of the term through the 20th century works of von Uexkull, Simondon, and Deleuze and Guattari. This results in the development of four propositions that connect the parental milieu with the territorial milieu of the animal world; the technical milieu of ubiquitous digital networks; the metabolic milieu of consumption; and the trans-qualitative milieu of fluid relations and queer kinships. We conclude with a call for transgenerational research that addresses the ways that the parental milieu intersects with children's environmental learning and ­ethico-aesthetic sensibilities.

AB  - Interaction between science and design and technology (D&T) in schools is seen by many educationalists and industrialists as being desirable. During the period 1970 to 1990 progress was made in the UK, however the advent of the national curriculum compartmentalised subjects thus hindering further progress. Bodies in the UK such as the Office for Standards in Education (OfSTED) and the Engineering Council have repeatedly promoted cooperation between these two subjects in schools and, since 2000, have renewed their support through several publications. Similar efforts, with varying degrees of success, have been made in other countries. Initially this article records progress made and identifies that, in the majority of cases, a "top-down approach" by educationalists has not produced significant change.This research reports on a "bottom-up", school-based case study facilitated and monitored by university researchers. The findings indicate that this can be fraught with difficulties unless approached in a carefully planned way to avoid situations where teachers challenge each others' subject knowledge and pedagogical culture. The outcome reports on how teachers in the science and design and technology departments of a school achieved a measure of success and concludes with a recommendation of a way forward in facilitating interaction between these two subjects.

AB  - The article reports on a one-year AHRB-funded Innovations project that was designed to evaluate the usefulness, or otherwise, of the application of real-time visual feedback technology in the singing studio. The basis for the research was a multi-disciplinary approach that drew on voice science and acoustics, the psychology of singing and voice education. Participants were based in two different singing studios, one in the north of England and the other in the south. They catered for two different adult singer client groups ranging from skilled amateur to advanced professional. An action-research methodology was adopted in which the two participant singing teachers and their adult students were seen as co-researchers in the research activity. The resultant research data consisted of research diaries, observations and interviews, supplemented by multimedia recordings (audio and video) of actual singing behaviours over time. Data analyses indicate that new technology can impact positively on teacher behaviours and student experiences by providing more meaningful feedback through an enriched pedagogy. This offers the possibility of expanding the professional knowledge and skill base of both groups.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to argue that emotion has a central role to play in rational decision making based on recent research in the neuroanatomy of emotion. As a result, traditional rational decision-making theories, including Herbert Simon's modified model of satisficing that sharply demarcates emotions and values from rationality and rational decision making, need substantial revision. The paper concludes by outlining some central features of a theory of emotional decisions that is biologically more realistic than the traditional rationalist-cognitive model. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs contemporary scientific as well as traditional philosophical criteria in its argumentation. Methodologically, it can be described as an example of applying naturalistic philosophy to a central issue of human thought and experience, and how humans are able to value things at all on the basis of their neuroanatomy. Findings: The paper presents some initial features of a new theory of emotional decisions that is biologically more realistic than the traditional rationalist-cognitive model. Originality/value: The significance and originality of this paper lies in the fact that it proposes causal investigations of the real bases for rational decision making as a central human feature which runs counter to conventional wisdom and has far reaching implications for education, to name just one discipline; it demonstrates the importance and necessity of interdisciplinary research; and it outlines an exciting new research agenda that promises to be more productive in terms of understanding and hence planning for, the way in which humans make decisions.

AB  - Traditionally, universities focus primarily on instructionist teaching. Such an understanding has been criticized from theoretical and practical points of view. We believe that "socio-cultural theories of learning" and the concepts of "social capital" and "social creativity" hold considerable promise as a theoretical base for the repositioning of universities in the knowledge society. To illustrate our assumption, we provide case studies from the University of Colorado and the University of Siegen. These cases indicate how approaches to community-based learning can be integrated into a curriculum of applied computer science. We also discuss the role these didactical concepts can play within a practice-oriented strategy of regional innovation.

AB  - The aim of this paper is two-fold. The first aim is to discuss some observations gained from teaching psychology to computing students, highlighting both the wide range of areas where psychology is relevant to computing education and the topics that are relevant at different stages of students' education. The second aim is to consider findings from research investigating the characteristics of computing and psychology students. It is proposed that this information could be considered in the design and use of psychology materials for computing students. The format for the paper is as follows. The first section will illustrate the many links between the disciplines of psychology and computing; highlighting these links helps to answer the question that many computing students ask, what can psychology offer to computing? The second section will then review some of the ways that psychologists have been involved in the teaching of psychology to computing students, from A/AS level to undergraduate and postgraduate level. The third section will compare the profiles of computing and psychology students (e.g. on age, gender and motivation to study), to highlight how an understanding of these factors can be used to adapt psychology teaching materials for computing students. The conclusions which cover some practical suggestions are presented in the fourth section. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - This article depicts the state of Humanities in post-apartheid South Africa by examining HEMIS enrolment and graduation data from 1999 to 2007. It demonstrates that although the decline in student enrolment and graduation in Humanities has not been severe; read in the context of substantial growth of all other disciplines, Humanities is in a crisis. The crisis is also more notable at undergraduate level. An interdisciplinary analysis of four traditional Humanities disciplines demonstrates that history, languages, linguistics and literature are the hardest hit. On the other hand, there is an evident increase in Arts (visual and performing) a discipline often associated with the potential for fame and wealth. Communication, journalism and related studies, a professional arm of the traditional Humanities discipline of Language, is also thriving. We are of the view that this trend may confirm the perception that the rising tide of consumerism underpins the overall decline in the popularity of the study of Humanities.

AB  - American Catholic universities and colleges are a large component of the global strength in Christian higher education and scholarship, but they currently do not participate in international collaboration in proportion to their capacity. The Roman Catholic hierarchy looks to the numerical, structural, and curricular strength of Catholic institutions in the USA to bring the wisdom of the Catholic intellectual tradition to bear on the economic, socio/cultural, and political problems of the contemporary world. Admittedly, among all the universities of the world, the Catholic universities do not have a competitive edge in the fields of the natural sciences where huge physical resources are required. However, it is the thesis of this paper that through scholarship in the humanities and a distinct approach to professional school training Catholic colleges and universities could easily have the edge in the areas of comprehensive theory and analysis because we have a commitment to multi-disciplinary approaches to the problems of our contemporary society and an integrating focus on the common good. In this paper I begin with a description of the range and variation in philosophy and practice of the colleges in the United States. Then I offer observations about core values that are shared among these diverse institutions. This is followed by institutional examples in Catholic higher education of the application of principles based on an ethic for the common good in response to the realities of globalization. Finally, I offer a general critique of the academic culture, academic profession, and professional schools in Catholic higher education in light of the challenges presented to us as a result of the outcomes of globalization.

AB  - Equipping engineering students with the skills and knowledge required to be successful global engineers in the 21st century is one of the primary objectives of undergraduate educators. Enabling students to practice self-directed learning, to find solutions to design problems that are sustainable and to recognize that they are part of a global community are just a few of our educational goals. Self-directed learning can define an individual's ability to practice life-long learning. It places the responsibility on the individual to initiate and direct the learning process and can enable an individual to adapt to change. Project-based learning provides the contextual environment that makes learning exciting and relevant. It provides an opportunity for students to explore technical problems from a systems-level perspective and to develop an appreciation for the inter-connectedness of science and engineering principles. In Materials Engineering, the model of a tetrahedron is often invoked to illustrate the bottoms-up principles associated with a material's processing, structure and properties, which must be optimized to reach a desired performance. In addition, a top-down tetrahedron can be envisioned with the need for sustainability guiding the balance between economic, societal and environmental factors, which also influence the choice of the optimum design solution for a project. For students to fully explore this paradigm, it is imperative that project-based learning experiences be integrated throughout their undergraduate education. This article will explore methodologies that we have adopted to implement project-based learning through our four year undergraduate curriculum. Significantly, our course evaluations indicate that students strongly feel that this is a better method for "learning" and believe that the projects provide a more realistic environment for applying the principles of engineering, science and mathematics towards solving practical problems.

AB  - Plagiarism by students is seen as an increasing problem. The fear is that students will use the internet to obtain analysis, interpretation or even complete assignments and then submit these as their own work. Electronic plagiarism detection services may help to prevent such unfair practice but, in doing so, they create a new problem: certifying the absence of plagiarism. This article reports the results of an evaluation of one such service within an interdisciplinary school of social sciences. The article describes how the system works and the experiences of staff and students in using the service, together with an evaluation of the data generated. The key findings are that the service did identify examples of poor scholarship and unfair practice that had been missed under the usual marking system but that rigorously checking every script for plagiarism was impractical. Trust and student honesty thus remain central to a successful academic system. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - The goal of this article is to analyze American foreign aid and whether it promotes environmental sustainability. A review of the significant literature was undertaken and some suggestions have been provided to make our foreign aid more effective. Our development agencies, mainly the United States Agency for International Development, while well-intentioned, are inefficient, and subject to interference by Congress and the Executive Branch. Some suggestions have been made to improve overseas development assistance (ODA) delivery, efficiency, and sustainability. This article stresses the need for environmental science, geography, and social science educators to incorporate foreign aid as a part of holistic, interdisciplinary curriculum. ODA should be only a small part of a larger focus, including debt and fair trade, to help developing countries become economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable. The United States is obliged to pay its fair share for use of the global environmental commons. Some options have been presented to redress America's use of the global commons including a proposal to triple ODA to 0.3% of GNP.

AB  - Interprofessional teams in health care are showing promise in achieving the triple aim--providing better care for the individual patient, reducing costs, and improving population health. To complement current changes in health care delivery in the United States, there is a growing consensus among health professions educators that students should be trained in interprofessional models prior to entering clinical practice. Current interprofessional education (IPE) efforts in anatomy education are producing positive results in enhancing professional respect, collaboration, and teamwork among health professions students. In spite of existing structural and cultural barriers to IPE, health professions educators must continue to lead and grow IPE efforts as a critical component to improving the health of our nation.

AB  - In many parts of the world the practice of medicine and medical education increasingly focus on providing patient care within context of the larger healthcare system. Our purpose is to solicit perceptions of all professional stakeholders (e.g. nurses) of the system regarding the U.S. ACGME competency Systems Based Practice to uncover the extent to which there is agreement or discrepancy among key system stakeholders. Eighty-eight multidisciplinary personnel (n = 88) from two academic medical centers were invited to participate in one of 14 nominal group process sessions. Participants generated and prioritized resident characteristics that they believed were important for effective System Based Practices. Through content analysis the prioritized attribute statements were coded to identify embedded themes of resident roles and behavior. From the themes, three major resident roles emerged: resident as "Self-Manager," "Team Collaborator," and "Patient Advocate." No one professional group (e.g., nurses, attending physicians, social workers) emphasized all of these roles. Some concepts that are emphasized in the ACGME definition like using cost-benefit analysis were conspicuously absent from the healthcare team generated list. We showed that there are gaps between the key stakeholders prioritizations about the ACGME definition of SBP and, more generally, the behaviors and roles identified by healthcare team stakeholders beyond the U.S. This suggests that within the process of developing a comprehensive working understanding of the Systems Based Practice competency (or other similar competencies, such as in CanMEDS), it is necessary to use multiple stakeholders in the system (perhaps including patients) to more accurately identify key resident roles and observable behaviors.

AB  - Many researchers from different disciplines have explained their views and interpretations and written about visual literacy from their various perspectives. Visual literacy may be applied in almost all areas such as advertising, anatomy, art, biology, business presentations, communication, education, engineering, etc. (Pettersson, 2002a). Despite all their combined efforts during the past 40 years, visual literacy has not been able to attract enough interest from society and enough interest from those responsible for school curricula around the world. A number of researchers have practically rejected the whole concept of visual literacy. An important reason for this may be a general lack of focus. In the author's view, individuals need to consider combined verbal and visual messages, not only text and not only visuals, when they study communication and communication-related issues. This is where message design and its different sub-areas may play an important role for visual literacists. The concepts visual literacy and message design partly overlap one another. In many situations it is, however, not enough to study visuals only. Individuals need to consider and study combined messages, not only text and not only visuals, when they study communication and communication situations. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - The Off-Campus Degree Program at Linfield College (Oregon) provides quality coursework to a group of part-time adult students who would not otherwise have access to a four-year degree program. In 1980, Linfield joined six other institutions to form the National University Consortium (NUC), the first national organization of colleges and universities, public broadcasting stations, and cable systems to offer television-assisted courses. NUC is governed and directed by all its member institutions and each plays an active role in determining NUC policy, curriculum offerings, and operations. Course materials, inspired by and adapted from the highly successful British Open University, are used. The Linfield courses can be used to satisfy major and elective requirements for the bachelor  of science in management degree and the bachelor of arts in liberal studies degree offered through the Official Campus Program. Most courses are interdisciplinary in three degree areas: (1) technology and management; (2) behavioral and social sciences; and (3) humanities. Linfield's membership in NUC offers advantages to students, faculty, and administrators, and has been cost-effective, showing a net financial gain. (JW)

AB  - Kyrgyzstan, like other countries of the former Soviet Union, traditionally occupied a relatively high position in the world from the standpoint of the average level of education of its population. Any gender inequality when it came to obtaining an education was insignificant by international standards. However, the conversion to market relations, the problem of poverty that has emerged in the past few decades, and cutbacks in state funds could hardly fail to set back advances in the field of education and increase gender inequality in this sphere. Comparing the distribution of students in various specialties by gender, this study finds that the proportion of women is substantially higher not only in such "female" spheres as education (80.4 percent of the total number of college and university students), the humanities (69.1 percent), and health care (62 percent), but also in the normally "male" specialties (65.2 percent). These have become less popular among men, but they are being successfully pursued by women. The proportion of women is also a bit higher among students majoring in economics (52 percent) and interdisciplinary sciences (50.6 percent). Men regularly lead in agriculture and forestry (84.2 percent), the service sphere (83.1 percent), architecture and construction (78.9 percent), technical specialties (77.1 percent), and law (72.7 percent). Having examined changes in education in the period of transition the authors find that women in Kyrgyzstan pursue an education more actively. (Contains 14 endnotes and 2 tables.)

AB  - This article describes an active learning method for the teaching of physical sciences and mathematics to engineers. After defining the challenges involved in the training of engineers, we shall describe the answers provided by our method, "learning by doing" (named "Apprentissage Par l"Action" in French), by introducing four key points: real-life simulation, the management of non-success, the result requirement and the different roles of the teachers. An assessment of this experience is carried out which emphasizes the factors paramount in the success of this pedagogical innovation. Similarities between our experience and other well-known methods such as problem-based learning, problem solving and, more generally, the concept of learning by doing coined by John Dewey in his philosophy of education, are mentioned.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the research base of engineering education in the "Journal of Engineering Education" ("JEE") through an analysis review of articles for a 12-year period, from 2000 to 2012. The research base review focuses on identifying five characteristics of engineering education: (a) temporal distribution, (b) frequently cited authors in JEE articles, (c) research areas involved in each article, (d) types of participant, and (e) methodological design employed. Published journals from web-based sources were selected aligned on the original author's discussion of engineering education in the articles. The findings summarize the core consistencies of engineering education literature across the globe over the years by identifying the engineering related content professionals addressed in their respective fields.

AB  - Realistic research experience is beneficial to undergraduate students, but it is often difficult for liberal arts colleges to offer this opportunity. We describe two approaches for developing and maintaining an interdisciplinary research program at small colleges. An active and continuing involvement of an individual with extensive research experience is an essential element in both. One model was developed by the faculty of Taylor University, Upland, IN and a research scientist who had retired from a major university to join the Taylor faculty as their first Research Professor. The school?s Science Research Training Program was initially funded by a modest endowment provided by interested alumni and by extramural grants awarded to the Research Professor and to the institution; the program now enjoys significant funding from diverse sources. Taylor is not located near any large research university and consequently supplies all resources required for the experiments and stipends for students pursuing projects full-time during the summer. The second model was developed by the faculty at Asbury College in Wilmore, KY, working with a scientist having a full-time appointment at the University of Kentucky and a part-time appointment at the college. In this approach, Asbury faculty may place their students for a period of training, often during the summer, in a laboratory of a cooperating host faculty at the University of Kentucky or other institution. The host faculty funds the research and pays a stipend to those students who work full-time during the summer. Relationships established between faculty at the College and at the University of Kentucky have been mutually beneficial. The success of both programs is evidenced by the students? presenting their data at state and national scientific meetings, by their publishing their results in national journals, and by the undergraduate school faculty developing independent research programs.

AB  - The population of the United States continues to become increasingly diverse, both culturally and linguistically. The increased diversity creates a challenge for middle school teachers as they are required not only to teach their content areas, but also to assist students learning English, including literacy skills. The majority of teachers at all levels of experience are novices at teaching a second language in the context of subject matter. At the middle level, teachers daily face many challenges in delivering instruction and enabling student learning. One instructional strategy that has been used with success in middle level science is the instructional congruence model. Instructional congruence occurs when "teachers mediate the nature of academic content and inquiry with language and cultural experiences of diverse students." According to this model, for teachers to provide effective science and literacy instruction they must integrate knowledge of: (a) students' language and cultural experiences; (b) science learning; and (c) literacy development. The components of the instructional congruence model include: helping students learn science concepts and vocabulary, engaging students in science investigations cooperatively, developing science-related thinking skills, and encouraging students to talk about science with other students, their parents, and their teachers. This article further discusses this model, which can be very successful at the middle school level, due to the environment of support and belonging that middle schools provide. Through instructional congruence, teachers make academic content and inquiry accessible, meaningful, and relevant for diverse students.

Using cognitive data, the team aimed to design an experience that fostered an environment implementing strategies that improve learning. The participants, 40 faculty members from 24 institutions who acted as teachers, students, or both, boarded the Seawolf, the vessel on which the course was situated. River's objectives included lessons for analyzing various aspects of and promoting awareness for the Hudson and its watershed as a natural and cultural environment. Most importantly, this paper illustrates River's incorporation of metacognitive strategies as an effective teaching and learning tool. (Contains 2 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - Background/Context: In an age of test-driven accountability, many schools are returning to banking pedagogies in which students passively take in content. Inquiry-based instruction offers one approach for actively involving students in meaningful learning activity, however, research on inquiry pedagogies often focuses on academic accomplishments. Our study examines how inquiry-based dialogue not only supports academic learning but also supports social learning as students and teachers negotiate, share ideas, collaborate, and problem-solve together. Purpose: This longitudinal study builds on conceptualizations of dialogic inquiry to examine how teachers and students coconstructed a discourse of inquiry in a public magnet school. We examine the processes and practices that make up this discourse of inquiry and study the function of teacher talk in supporting academic and social learning and agency among students. Setting: The Center for Inquiry is a public magnet elementary school located in an ethnically diverse suburban community that was formed in partnership with the University of South Carolina. Participants: Participants included teachers and 135 students (65% European American, 30% African American) studied during a 5-year period. Research Design: The two authors worked collaboratively with school members to collect two related ethnographic data sets. Data Set 1 captured classroom practices across all six classrooms, and Data Set 2 followed one cohort during the same 5-year period. Findings: Findings are presented in two sections. The first section presents a discourse of inquiry made up of six interacting practices of inquiry constructed by teachers and students across classrooms. This discourse of inquiry integrates academic and social practices that position inquiry as (1) dynamic and dialogic, (2) attentive, probing, and thoughtful, (3) agentive and socially responsible, (4) relational and compassionate, (5) reflective and reflexive, and (6) valuing multiple and interdisciplinary perspectives. The second section makes visible how these practices of inquiry were coconstructed through transcripts of classroom discourse drawn from both data sets that centered on discussions of life science. Conclusions/Recommendations: This discourse of inquiry supports students as active, thoughtful, engaged learners and community members and underscores the critical role of classroom talk, collaboration, and deliberation in meaningful learning engagements. Although teachers and students alike took multiple roles and responsibilities through inquiry, the teacher's discourse was critical in supporting and extending student learning. We recommend professional development opportunities that equip preservice and in-service teachers with resources, skills, and dispositions to become active inquirers of their own classroom and school practices who recognize the power of classroom talk to shape and limit possibilities.

AB  - Healthcare delivery is reliant on a team-based approach, and interprofessional education (IPE) provides a means by which such collaboration skills can be fostered prior to entering the workplace. IPE within healthcare programs has been associated with improved collaborative behavior, patient care and satisfaction, reduced clinical error, and diminished negative professional stereotypes. An intensive interprofessional gross anatomy dissection course was created in 2009 to facilitate IPE at McMaster University. Data were collected from five cohorts over five years to determine the influence of this IPE format on the attitudes and perceptions of students towards other health professions. Each year, 28 students from the medicine, midwifery, nursing, physician's assistant, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy programs were randomly assigned into interprofessional teams for 10 weeks. Sessions involved an anatomy and scope-of-practice presentation, a small-group case-based session, and a dissection. A before/after design measured changes in attitudes and perceptions, while focus group data elaborated on the student experience with the course. Pre- and postmatched data revealed significant improvements in positive professional identity, competency and autonomy, role clarity and attitudes toward other health professions. Qualitative analysis of intraprofessional focus group interviews revealed meaningful improvements in a number of areas including learning anatomy, role clarity, and attitudes towards other health professions.

AB  - This paper seeks to explain the epistemological bases for the two cultures and to show why this disciplinary divide continues to plague American academic culture. Next, we discuss strategies for bridging the two cultures through general education curricula which promote mutual understanding of the two cultures while educating students in basic skills. Evidence is presented which shows the efficacy of these integrative, interdisciplinary curricula. In conclusion, we briefly mention some collaborative research efforts which indicate the enduring effects that such an education may have.

AB  - Ruscio and colleagues (Ruscio, Seaman, D'Oriano, Stremlo, & Mahalchik, this issue) provide a thoughtful empirical analysis of 22 different measures of individual scholarly impact. The simplest metric is number of publications, which Simonton (1997) found to be a reasonable predictor of career trajectories. Although the assessment of the scholarly contribution of a candidate for tenure is unlikely to be favorable if there are no or very few scientific publications, the number of publications is a far-from-perfect index of scientific contribution. Moreover, the incentives created by a metric such as number of publications may not promote the quality, innovativeness, programmatic nature, and cumulative impact of the research. Ruscio et al. (this issue), therefore, used five criteria to evaluate metrics of science: (1) ease of understanding; (2) accuracy of calculation; (3) effects of incentives; (4) influence of extreme scores; and (5) validity. Given the computational aids available today, the first 2 metrics are perhaps the least important and the third and fifth are most important. One of the interesting results of the empirical analyses performed by Ruscio et al. is that self-citations have nominal impact on the outcomes, a finding that increases the confidence in the validity and simplifies the calculation of these metrics. Perhaps the best metric to emerge in Ruscio et al.'s (this issue) analysis is the "h" index (Hirsch, 2005). This metric provides a single number that balances the number of publications and the number of citations per publication. The "h" index has limitations, of course. Among them are that the "h" index tends to increase with years as a scientist; gratuitous authorship can contribute to inflated scores; the "h" index does not take into consideration the number or the role of the authors; different citation databases provide different "h" indexes as a result of differences in coverage; the "h" index is bounded by total number of publications; the "h" index does not consider the context of the citations (e.g., negative findings or retracted work); and individuals with the same "h" index may nevertheless differ dramatically in total citations or in number of publications.

AB  - In "International approaches to Science Assessment" Paul Black and Dylan Wiliam describe eight major elements of assessment systems and contrast some of the differences among these elements across seven countries. Of particular interest to the author is an issue that cuts across many of these elements, namely, what gets assessed as part of these systems. That is, how do countries manage the tradeoff between assessing the "facts" that student know versus the depth of their understanding for how these facts are interrelated? In science assessment this issue is especially important: can scientific inquiry be content free? Can or should process skills be assessed independently of content knowledge, or vice-versa? In this paper, the author illustrates this issue within the context of a United States history assessment that has recently been in the news.

AB  - We present a descriptive case study of Terrascope, an innovative, year-long, project-based learning community at MIT. Each year, Terrascope students study a particular environmental or Earth-system problem from a multidisciplinary perspective. Terrascope includes both academic and non-academic components; this paper focuses on the academic components. The objectives of the academic subjects, and of the program as a whole, involve helping students develop their team-building, communication, problem-solving, and self-regulatory learning skills. This study focuses on cohorts of students from the first and second years of the program (2002-2003 and 2003-2004); it is based on end-of-semester surveys and focus groups, and on additional focus groups conducted when these students were upperclassmen. Students felt Terrascope helped them make significant improvements in their ability to work in teams and to take on complex, multidisciplinary problems. They felt that the program's two-semester structure gave them an opportunity to develop and nurture these skills, and that the program prepared them well for their later work at MIT. They also felt that being engaged, as freshmen, in a distinct learning community, significantly eased their transition into MIT. We describe lessons learned in the development of Terrascope and offer suggestions for other institutions planning to develop similar programs.

AB  - A class in a Scientific-Technological Lyceum (age 17) decided to produce a PowerPoint presentation to introduce nanochemistry and nanotechnology to the students in lower grades. Because the subject is very new, there was nothing in the School textbooks and, therefore, the students had to cooperate in order to find materials, to use ICT sources and to take decisions, such as selecting information and choosing slide layouts. Furthermore, the Cooperative Learning methodology was employed to solve the problem of setting up the presentation. To make nanochemistry and nanotechnology a reality for the students, they used a link between these new frontiers of Chemistry and subjects currently tackled at the Secondary School level. This was the quantitative determination of Ca[superscript 2+] ions by using calcein, a luminescent chemosensor, in which well known concepts, such as chemical equilibrium and stability constants of coordination compounds, are involved. The educational aims of the project were to promote both content knowledge and social skills in Secondary School students. The activity created a good class atmosphere and also led to the retention of content knowledge. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Physical education departments are composed of diverse academic disciplines that may include physical education teacher education, exercise science, and athletic training programs. The complexity of each program and its individual demands often cause faculty and students to become disengaged from those outside of their own major and the happenings within a department. To help promote student and faculty engagement across interdepartmental disciplines, a physical education department implemented a departmental fitness challenge to build camaraderie through fun, fitness, and friendly competition. This article provides a template for the development of a fitness challenge, procedures used to engage students in the planning and implementation of an annual fitness challenge, generalized results of a fitness challenge, and tips on making it a successful event.

AB  - With the stricter environmental regulations and diminishing fossil-fuel reserves, there is now higher emphasis on exploiting various renewable sources of energy. These alternative sources of energy are usually environmentally friendly and emit no pollutants. However, the capital investments for those renewable sources of energy are normally high, and there are also maintenance cost differences to be considered. Furthermore, due to the intermittency of some of these power sources, reliability issues should be addressed when integrating different power sources. In this article, as an example, the design of hybrid generating systems comprising wind turbine generators, photovoltaic panels, and storage batteries is discussed based on multidisciplinary optimization. In this multisource generation system design, three design objectives are considered, that is, system cost, reliability, and pollutant emissions. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - As a music teacher, this author was always looking for good cross-curricular connections. Because music is something that all children enjoy to some degree, it is a great way to open new doors to a subject area. Music is an integral part of every culture, so it can be part of any unit of study on a foreign country or distant continent. Music can also serve as a motivating part of a lesson in geography, history, cultural anthropology, and many other aspects of social studies. In this article, the author describes how she has used music as the foundation for lessons about seven different cultures. These lessons included activities on geography, science, math, literature, art, physical education, and cultural foods. An example of an outline for an interdisciplinary unit of study of Native Americans, as well as a list of suggested books and online resources on Native Americans is included. (Contains 1 endnote.)

AB  - PhD supervision is increasingly embedded in frameworks that link research to issues of knowledge transfer involving the translation of knowledge to domains outside the university where it can be taken up and applied. This tends to require research that goes beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries and raises questions of the nature of knowledge relationships required in this context. This paper draws on the work of Basil Bernstein to identify the organisational, knowledge and interpersonal relationships that these changes now require, describing the nature of the work involved in weakening boundaries between disciplines and its implications for supervisor/student relationships. The paper then outlines the challenges this presents to universities, with specific reference to the humanities and social sciences, attempting to implement strategic programs reconciling pedagogic requirements with the quality, impact and completions they must attest to in order to secure public funding.

AB  - Extracurricular campus activities mirror the effects of associational life on political participation (Kuh 1995; Pascarella, Ethington, and Smart 1988; Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995). As encouraging student participation in such activities can be difficult (Kuh, Schuh, Whitt, Andreas, Lyons, Strange, Krehbiel, and MacKay 1991), this project describes an effort to promote peer enhancement of campus life. Students in a persuasion course developed a campaign to increase participation on campus. Pre- and postsemester questionnaires, as well as focus groups, reveal that students anticipated participating in more campus and community activities, and their attitudes toward the purpose of college broadened. Self-efficacy regarding several political tasks also improved. Students in a control group experienced no similar changes, suggesting that classroom activities can address current college students' political apathy. The conclusion calls for political scientists, who are the most familiar with declining political participation and the ameliorating effects of associational life, to initiate interdisciplinary interventions with the potential to reach the most alienated college students.

AB  - Engineering technology education (as distinguished from Engineering Technology education) is a design problem. In engineering, an important consideration is to determine the goal of the design. What is the desired result? For whom is it desirable? What are the unintended consequences? In this article, the author continues to raise the questions of what should the goal be for technology education and what are the design issues. He contends that technology educators can increase the opportunities for students to become more technologically literate by collaborating with teachers in other disciplines. What is to be learned in technology or engineering laboratories has been studied by engineering educators. Working with science educators is the greatest lever for increasing instruction for technological literacy in schools. Design and technology are part of the science standards and applications are tolerated in the mathematics standards. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - There is growing awareness of the need to equip students to think through the ethical implications of developments in biology. We describe an exercise in which students work in teams to produce websites about current controversial issues within the subject. Participants report a significant improvement in their knowledge of bioethics and acquisition of new generic skills. Additionally, we note not only a broadening of their consciousness about such issues, but also an increase in their use of appropriate scientific terminology. This web-authoring activity could readily be adapted for use with students in a broader range of disciplines at both tertiary and secondary level. (Contains 4 tables and 1 box.)

AB  - There are myriad understandings of design that have evolved over time and vary by the industries and disciplines that practice it. In the engineering context, design is often described as a process or problem-solving ability. Through interviews with 12 experienced engineers, it was found that there are diverse understandings of the relationship between design and engineering. This qualitative study presented a classification of their perspectives through three emergent categories: the relationship between design and engineering, the proportion of design tasks within a job, and the level or stage of development where design occurs. A synthesis of the data revealed that engineers demonstrate an ownership of design within engineering and there are diverse understandings of how design occurs within engineering. The implications of these findings were discussed and recommendations were offered for engineering educators, researchers, and industry. Engineering educators can help prepare designers as catalysts to produce a more inclusive, holistic, and sustainably minded profession.

AB  - In recent years, the topic of integrating history to mathematics lessons in teaching-learning processes has been frequently discussed among researchers. The main aim of this study is to present an example activity which enriched with history of mathematics and to take the views of students about teaching course in this way. In addition, to create awareness about the developmental stages of mathematics up to now is an implicit purpose. This research is a multiple case study. It was studied with twenty one students who continued eighth grade class in a private primary school. Worksheets containing two algorithms about calculating the square roots of numbers which were used in history were given to each student. In addition, after students reached the solution, they compared their results with results which they obtained from the calculator. Thus, they also saw that the calculator's operating system was similar to algorithms they used. Students' opinions about the integration of the history of mathematics to lessons were collected through an interview form. At the end of the activity, students stated that the chosen activities from the history of mathematics had attracted their interests. Also, they found an opportunity to compare different methods.

AB  - With the recent technological developments, an opportunity has emerged to introduce more efficient instruction into the classroom. The traditional blackboard approach is gradually giving way to more interaction between the instructor and students. Multimedia can be defined to be multiple forms of media (text, graphics, images, animation, audio and video) that work together. It is unparalleled in its ability to disseminate information quickly and accurately. Before the digital era, multimedia was delivered using one-way communication technologies such as books, magazines, radio, and television. The invention of the personal computer and the Internet, however, has introduced interactivity and created an engaging learning environment. Literature on learning and technology contains evidence that multimedia has the potential to transform every aspect of academic endeavor from instruction and learning to research and dissemination of knowledge. In this article, we will discuss why multimedia should be employed as the centerpiece for an emerging pattern of instruction. It can promote independent and cooperative learning, and improve performance of low achievers and special student populations, while heightening interest in learning, writing, and research.

AB  - Core curricula are designed, in part, to help undergraduate students become intellectually well-rounded. To merge core curricula with the components of the scholarship of teaching and learning movement, students engaged in core curricula need capstone courses designed to aid them in retaining information over the long term and synthesizing information from the various core areas. We used an existing core curriculum to delineate the congruency of core subject areas with topics covered in a history and systems of psychology course, which may be used as a capstone course for students across disciplines to unite the areas of a core curriculum.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to outline a partnership program that involved a local elementary school district, an institution of higher education, the local business community, and a state economic education advocacy group to integrate economics into math in grades K-5. The "Economics: Math in Real Life" program was provided in collaboration with a Title I program to integrate economics and personal finance content into mathematics instruction to demonstrate real-life applications of math concepts and increase students' knowledge in this content area. Pretests and posttests were administered to gauge effectiveness of the authentic instruction program in increasing student knowledge in math and economics and teacher knowledge in economics. Empirical results indicate learning occurred in both math and economics for students in grades 3-5 and in economics for teachers.

AB  - Certain aspects of European art music occupy a middle ground between the two cultures described by C. P. Snow almost fifty years ago. Analogies exist not only between mathematics and the ratios underlying musical notation and intervals (i.e., the distance between pitches) but also between computer science and counterpoint (simultaneous melodies): in both cases there is a precise syntax of individual parts within the whole. Music's relationship to the humanities and social sciences is also of considerable interest to bridging Snow's two cultures; trends in music, especially opera, have sometimes seemed to herald events in the social, political, and economic realms. These and other correspondences suggest that rigorous classroom instruction in music, with an emphasis on its links to other disciplines, should be required throughout the school years and on into the undergraduate core. Such a policy, if implemented, might well help future generations to bridge the divide between Snow's two cultures.

AB  - This paper describes a "learning community" designed for sophomore computer science majors who are simultaneously studying discrete mathematics. The learning community consists of three courses: Discrete Mathematics, Data Structures and an Integrative Seminar/Lab. The seminar functions as a link that integrates the two disciplines. Participation in the seminar enables students to study and appreciate the mutually beneficial relationship that exists between mathematics and computer science--a relationship that students often fail to see. Through carefully planned experimentation, students investigate how mathematics is used to formalize computer science, and how computer science can be used as a tool to explore mathematics.
