AB  - Experiential learning provides students the time and space to participate in the process of learning by engaging in real, modern situations. Via hands on activities and reflection, students are able to assimilate new experiences with previous ones, and it has been repeatedly shown to improve student learning. We assessed how ten days of experiential learning in Tanzania, Africa affected student understanding and retainment of fundamental concepts in evolution, ecology, and ethology. We assessed 25 college students (n = 12 biology majors, n = 13 non-biology majors) with a pre- and post-test. The pre-test was announced to the students and given before travel, and a nearly identical post-test was unannounced and given four weeks after travel. Non-biology majors performed at least ~15-30% higher on their post-exam compared to their pre-exam, and biology majors performed 5-10% higher on their post-exam compared to their pre-exam. The success of our interdisciplinary course can partially be attributed to experiential learning, and our results suggest that experiential learning has a particular value to non-majors.

AB  - The increasing importance of continuingly complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) challenges and encourages universities worldwide to organize up-to-date CPS oriented educational programs. The Erasmus+ project "CybPhys" aims to support CPS oriented educational programs in Belarus and Ukraine. We put forward a hypothesis that the educational situation, training opportunities, situation of the labor market, and general economic development are related to each other and can vary depending on the region. In order to validate our hypothesis and to provide input to curricula modernizations, an in-depth study in the form of surveys was conducted in the years 2019-2020. The results of the study showed that the differences between the perceptions of stakeholders in different regions of one country were more significant than the deviations between the global evaluation marks obtained from Belarusian and Ukrainian respondents. In order to increase the synergy of the CybPhys partners, the transdisciplinary and T-shape skills approaches are introduced to the education programs of the partner's universities. An innovative ICT based teaching and learning environment and associated teaching methodologies will be developed. The research provides valuable input to the development of industry and research-oriented cross-domain study programs in Cyber-Physical Systems focused on the needs of Belarusian and Ukrainian industries.

AB  - The aim of this study is to provide more knowledge on how outdoor time in Norwegian kindergartens is used as a resource for educational activities regarding science education and physical education. Through a questionnaire and a focus group interview, the study investigated early childhood teachers' perceptions of their work with these subjects and included twelve teachers representing nine kindergartens. According to the teachers, they work more often with these subjects by following up spontaneous situations than through planned activities. They emphasize different science themes and movement experiences depending on the environment they are in and highlight nature as an environment with many opportunities for spontaneous activities. A matter of concern is that one-fourth of the teachers reported that they work only occasionally with these subjects. In addition, the teachers seem to regard themselves less knowledgeable and less prepared to work with science education than physical education.

AB  - Although a large number of Spanish secondary schools have preserved an important scientific heritage, including large scientific instrument collections, this heritage has never been officially protected. Their current state is very diverse, and although several research projects have attempted to initiate their recovery and use, their lack of coordination and wide range of methodological approaches has limited their impact. This paper presents a case-study integrated in a new project supported by the Catalan Scientific Instrument Commission (COMIC) whose final aim is the establishment of a research hub for the preservation, study and use of Spanish scientific instrument collections. Major aims in this project are promoting a better coordination of Spanish projects in this field, and furthering international research on science pedagogy and the material culture of science. The major focus of COMIC is currently the recovery of secondary school collections. This paper provides first, a historical account of the development of secondary education in Spain, and the contemporary establishment of physics and chemistry school collections. Second, we focus on a case-study of three Spanish schools (Valencia, Castellon, and Alicante). Finally, we provide a brief overview of current projects to preserve Spanish school collections, and discuss how COMIC can contribute to help to coordinate them, and to take a step forward interdisciplinary research in this context.

AB  - This chronological overview of the development of interdisciplinary theory starts with the pre-cursors of theory: the development and elaboration of the definition of interdisciplinary studies, influential but problematic images of interdisciplinary studies proposed by Donald Campbell and Erich Jantsch, and best practices in interdisciplinary studies identified through AIS. It continues with a review of the motivation behind a theory of interdisciplinary studies, the controversy it engendered, and an assessment of what remains to be done. It concludes with the challenges to theory posed by new types of interdisciplinary studies, especially transdisciplinary studies and the science of team science.

AB  - K-12 science teachers in the United States are encouraged to teach their students engineering. When incorporating engineering into their science curricula, teachers commonly either focus on: (1) engineering and lace science throughout; or (2) science and lace engineering throughout. This study explores middle school students' nature of engineering understanding before and after instruction with different engineering foci through the collection and analysis of student surveys (n~200) and interviews (n = 16). Findings demonstrated centering science while lacing engineering throughout allowed for a slight increase in the understanding that engineers use science and math, however, centering engineering allowed students to understand many more attributes of engineers (i.e., engineers invent/design/create, improve things, fix, and solve problems) after instruction than they did prior to instruction. These findings and their limitations are discussed in relation to the developing Nature of Engineering framework and the new content demands of the U.S. Next Generation Science Standards.

AB  - The scientific and technological developments in today's world require countries to raise entrepreneurial, productive, critical, problem-solving, and entrepreneurial individuals. Therefore, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education has gained importance today. STEM education is defined as an approach that takes an interdisciplinary relationship and takes a holistic approach to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. STEM education includes the activities that will increase the students' interest and orientations towards science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields using the skills that should be possessed today. The aim of this study was to examine the STEM awareness and entrepreneurship levels of pre-service science teachers. The sample of the study consisted of 93 female and 20 male students studying in the Science Education Department at Afyon Kocatepe University. As a quantitative research type, survey method was used in this study. "STEM Awareness Scale" (SAS) developed by Buyruk and Korkmaz (2016) and "Entrepreneurship Scale for Teacher Candidates" developed by Deveci and Cepni (2015) were used as data collection tools. As a result of analyses, it was seen that science teachers' attitudes towards STEM education were positive. Females' STEM awareness was significantly higher than males' in both positive and negative sub-factors. STEM awareness of the first grade students was significantly lower than the other classes in the positive sub-factor, and significant differences were found between the first grade and second grade, and the second grade and the fourth grade in the negative sub-factor. There were no significant differences of entrepreneurship levels in terms of gender. Also, the entrepreneurship characteristics of the second grade were significantly higher than the other grade levels.

AB  - Students not familiar with chemistry tend to misinterpret analytical chemistry as some kind of the sorcery where analytical chemists working as modern wizards handle magical black boxes able to provide fascinating results. However, this approach is evidently improper and misleading. Therefore, the position of modern analytical chemistry among sciences and in the contemporary world is discussed. Its interdisciplinary character and the necessity of the collaboration between analytical chemists and other experts in order to effectively solve the actual problems of the human society and the environment are emphasized. The importance of the analytical method validation in order to obtain the accurate and precise results is highlighted. The invalid results are not only useless; they can often be even fatal (e.g., in clinical laboratories). The curriculum of analytical chemistry at schools and universities is discussed. It is referred to be much broader than traditional equilibrium chemistry coupled with a simple description of individual analytical methods. Actually, the schooling of analytical chemistry should closely connect theory and practice.

AB  - This paper answers the call for the importance of integrating the Islamic worldview into science classes. This research provides insights into science teachers' experiences of integrating science and Islam, as well as additional surveys to reveal gains in student understanding. This research consists of two stages. Study 1 used phenomenology and focused on the voice of science teachers through focus groups. This research involved five focus groups in five Islamic high schools providing information describing their experiences. Through thematic analysis techniques, several findings were obtained as follows: (1) the concept of integration emphasises more on the balance of compliance between vertical and horizontal; (2) the integration pattern places more emphasis on learning materials; and (3) in terms of benefits, this effort is focused on increasing understanding and followed by study 2 which aims to add to the evidence base by investigating the effect of integration patterns on student understanding. The results showed that there is evidence that the support of an overarching integration pattern contributes to students' understanding of the material. As a recommendation, it is necessary to strengthen integration at all stages of science learning, allowing students to take advantage of discussions in class to develop more relevant abilities.

AB  - Art and technology have always been very tightly intertwined, presenting strong influences on each other. On the other hand, technological evolution led to today's digital media landscape, elaborating mediated communication tools, thus providing new creative means of expression (i.e., new-media art). Rich-media interaction can expedite the whole process into an augmented schooling experience though art cannot be easily enclosed in classical teaching procedures. The current work focuses on the deployment of a modern-art web-guide, aiming at enhancing traditional approaches with machine-assisted blended-learning. In this perspective, "machine" has a two-folded goal: to offer highly-interdisciplinary multimedia services for both in-class demonstration and self-training support, and to crowdsource users' feedback, as to train artificial intelligence systems on painting movements semantics. The paper presents the implementation of the "Istoriart" website through the main phases of Analysis, Design, Development, and Evaluation, while also answering typical questions regarding its impact on the targeted audience. Hence, elaborating on this constructive case study, initial hypotheses on the multidisciplinary usefulness, and contribution of the new digital services are put into test and verified.

AB  - Nowadays one of the main focuses of the Spanish University system is achieving the active learning paradigm in the context of its integration into the European Higher Education Area. This goal is being addressed by means of the application of novel teaching mechanisms. Among a wide variety of learning approaches, the present work focuses on peer review, understood as a collaborative learning technique where students assess other student's work and provide their own feedback. In this way, peer review has the overarching goal of improving the student learning during this process. Peer review has been successfully applied and analyzed in the literature. Indeed, many authors also recommend improving the design and implementation of self and peer review, which has been our main goal. This paper presents an empirical study based on the application of peer review assessment in different higher education BSc and MSc courses. In this way, six courses from different studies at the University of Malaga in Spain are subject to the application of peer review strategies to promote student learning and develop cross-wise skills such as critical thinking, autonomy and responsibility. Based on these experiences, a deep analysis of the results is performed, showing that a proper application of the peer review methodology provides reliable reviews (with close scores to the ones from the teacher) as well as an improvement in the students' performance.

AB  - Collaboration between colleges of liberal arts and sciences and health professional schools provide fertile ground for undergraduate programs focused on health education, advocacy, and research. Complex collaboration can sometimes challenge disciplinary boundaries and traditional processes, which may need to be updated to maximize student learning. The urgency of the pandemic stirred creativity and accelerated planning for a multidisciplinary program in global health at the University of Pikeville (UPIKE). Ultimately, the planning coalesced around a program designed to help students: (1) recognize the importance of cultural belief systems and how they influence personal and communal health; (2) illustrate the different forms of health disparities and how social systems affect health outcomes; (3) recognize the relationship between economics, politics, and health policy and identify areas of health care change; (4) understand the research process and analyze data to promote evidence-informed health practices; and (5) incorporate principles of ethics and social responsibility through civic engagement.

AB  - This paper discusses the instructional design experiences and processes shared by a multi-disciplinary group--including more than a dozen faculty, staff, and students--while developing a series of online courses on Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) for professional engineers, a project sponsored by the National Science Foundation. The team size, the complexity and uniqueness of the subject matter, the targeted learners, and the pre-determined research questions created a rare situation in which the team members collaborated and/or negotiated outside the realm of the traditional instructional design process. Over time the team went through two different types of instructional design processes, beginning with a waterfall-type process where the communication between the subject matter experts (SME) and the design team was somewhat limited and finally evolving to a collaborative process where the interaction between the two teams was more direct and immediate. The evolution of the design process and the dynamics between the SMEs and the design team resulted in several major design revisions implemented to improve the quality of the online courses.

AB  - Pacific Lutheran University (Tacoma, WA) is renowned for the number of its courses that offer international and study-away opportunities. Inspired by the theme of sustainability, and my growing concern about the environmental impact of conventional fuels, I offered a course, Physics of Energy, for the first time during PLU's January 2011 term (a one-month semester). The two-week travel portion of the course took students on the Amtrak Coast Starlight train route from Tacoma, WA, to Los Angeles to study various forms of energy production. Students studied physics topics in the classroom, through hands-on activities, by traveling to energy research and production facilities, and while working on their interdisciplinary term projects. The course, which utilized local talent and focused on sustainability, provided a positive physics learning experience for majors and non-majors alike. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - A number of factors affect successful implementation of an integrated science curriculum, including various outputs and inputs related to teacher quality such as professional development experiences, adequate planning periods, and adequate content preparation of teachers with regard to content knowledge associated with the curriculum taught. This study examines factors related to teacher quality inputs (coursework, grade point average, and teacher test scores). Specifically, the focus is on teacher knowledge related to eighth grade science in Texas, which uses an interdisciplinary science curriculum consisting of topics in life science, chemistry, physics, and Earth science.

AB  - Spatial reasoning, an emerging transdisciplinary area of interest to mathematics education research, is proving integral to all human learning. It is particularly critical to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. This project will create an innovative knowledge framework based on spatial reasoning that identifies new pathways for mathematics learning, pedagogy and curriculum. Novel analytical tools will map the unknown complex systems linking spatial and mathematical concepts. It will involve the design, implementation and evaluation of a Spatial Reasoning Mathematics Program (SRMP) in Grades 3 to 5. Benefits will be seen through development of critical spatial skills for students, increased teacher capability and informed policy and curriculum across STEM education.

AB  - In this paper, I argue that contemporary accounts of nature of science (NoS) are limited in their depiction of "science" and that new perspectives are needed to broaden their characterisation and appeal for science education. In particular, I refer to the role of interdisciplinary characterisations of science in informing the theory and practice of science teaching and learning. After a brief review on the reconceptualization of NoS from a range of perspectives, namely philosophy of science, socio-political accounts of science (in the context of colonial science), linguistics and anthropology, I will focus on philosophical and economical characterisation of science, drawing out some implications for science education. A predominant part of my argument will be theoretical in nature with some pedagogical applications in the context of an empirical project conducted in Istanbul, Turkey and co-funded by TUBITAK and Marie Curie Co-fund Brain Circulation Scheme. I will conclude with broader implications of interdisciplinary studies on science for science education research and practice.

AB  - Introductory undergraduate science courses are traditionally offered as distinct units without formalized student interaction between classes. To bridge science courses, the authors used three Honors Organic Chemistry projects paired with other science courses. The honors students delivered presentations to mainstream organic course students and in the general chemistry laboratory course, and collaborations with computer science course students produced animations of organic reactions. Honors students were prepared for project work through weekly assignments designed to teach navigation and use of primary scientific literature.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the effect of the interdisciplinary (the disciplines of Turkish, Social Science, Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Public Administration) activities performed in the scope of the Community Service Practices Course on the air pollution awareness (APW). This study has been performed as a multiple case study. Participants consisted of 32 pre-service elementary school teachers and 122 elementary school students enrolled in a 4th grade. Data were collected using the Air Pollution Awareness Questionnaire, Know-Want-Learn forms and interviews. Content analysis was used for analysis of data. The APW of participants have increased. It has been determined that the pre-service elementary school teachers have evaluated the implementation as being generally successful. Also it has been seen that the implementation has served different purposes out of the study aim for the pre-service elementary school teachers like providing teaching experience and how to teach the interdisciplinary subjects.

AB  - The Parallel Curriculum Model (PCM) lends itself to considering curriculum development from different angles. It begins with a solid Core Curriculum and can then be extended through the Curriculum of Connections, Practice, and Identity. This article showcases a way of thinking about the creation of a PCM unit by providing examples from an Antarctic research expedition. The Curriculum of Connections is showcased through the practices of science and engineering and crosscutting concepts. The Curriculum of Practice is elaborated on through vignettes detailing collaborative activities on the ship. Finally, a special focus is placed on the Curriculum of Identity through profiles of people working on the ship who followed both traditional and nontraditional routes to their current careers.

AB  - We describe an inquiry-based course in physics and chemistry for preservice K-8 teachers developed at California State University Fullerton. The course is one of three developed primarily to enhance the science content understanding of prospective teachers. The course incorporates a number of innovative instructional strategies and is somewhat unusual for its interdisciplinary focus. We describe the course structure in detail, providing examples of course materials and assessment strategies. Finally, we provide research data illustrating both the need for the course and the effectiveness of the course in developing student understanding of selected topics. Student responses to various questions reflect a lack of understanding of many relatively simple physical science concepts, and a level of performance that is usually lower than that in comparable courses serving a general education audience. Additional data suggest that course activities improve student understanding of selected topics, often dramatically. (Contains 5 tables and 5 figures.)

AB  - This article of linked, short essays reflecting on the experiences of five female scholars across three disciplines--law, social work and political science--draws upon Britzman's (1991) notion of the "dialogic discourse" to explore how these professors' sense of self is constituted through interplay with colleagues and their perceptions of students within the classroom. The authors explore the teacher/learner relationship as a dialogue within which learners and educators shape each other as they come to understand how and what they know. What the collection makes explicit is what is often only implicit, that the ways in which professors understand their practices and subjective self is central to the identity of "a professor," which is never stable or certain, but is always a creative practice. Such practices, we argue, are best sustained through collegial reflective practices that help us make sense of ourselves and continue our work.

AB  - Photocatalytic hydrogen generation over semiconductor photocatalysts has attracted considerable attention over the past few decades. This experiment is designed for sophomore- and higher-level undergraduates who are in the majors of materials chemistry, analytical chemistry, catalysis, or chemical engineering. In this experiment, CdS nanoparticles and nanosheets were first fabricated with a one-step direct-precipitation reaction and a two-step precipitation--ion-exchange reaction, respectively, and then used as photocatalysts for visible-light hydrogen evolution from water, in the presence of noble-metal Pt nanoparticles as in situ cocatalysts and sodium sulfide and sulfite (Na[subscript 2]S/Na[subscript 2]SO[subscript 3]) as sacrificial reagents. A gas chromatograph with a thermal-conductivity detector (GC-TCD) was used to quantitatively monitor the produced hydrogen gas. This interdisciplinary experiment is expected to give students an introduction to nanomaterial synthesis, the general process of photocatalytic hydrogen generation, and the principles and use of instruments. Upon the completion of the experiment, students understand how chemistry can be utilized for renewable-energy applications.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: The increasingly growing number of virtual high schools around the world has engendered new modes for teaching and learning and a promising area of re-search. While research in this emerging field has mostly taken a comparative lens that highlights differences between traditional modes of teaching and online teaching, research on high school students' and teachers' perspectives has remained dearth. Background: This study identifies students' and teachers' perceptions of their learning and teaching advanced level mathematics and/or physics in the first Israeli virtual high school (VHS), which was launched five years ago. Methodology: A survey of 41 questions was disseminated to the first graduating cohort of 86 Grade-12 students as well as to 22 VHS teachers. Additional data sources include students' essays on what it means to be a student in a VHS and field notes from a pedagogical development day. Contribution: The purpose of this study is to highlight the workings of the Israeli VHS and in particular its important building blocks that include a teacher-tutor model, an ongoing gauging of students' work through a Learning Management System (LMS), and a continual teacher-developer interaction for the purpose of developing cutting-edge, technology-based course content. Findings: Given the unique features of the Israeli VHS, both teachers and students report on feelings of unit pride, motivation, and investment in teaching and learning in the VHS. Recommendations for Practitioners: The Israeli VHS uses a combination of a teacher-tutor format, together with tools for gauging students' work and ongoing interaction between the teachers and the course content designers. Such a context creates new, fertile ground for technology-based, fully online teaching and learning of school mathematics and physics that may contribute to alleviating the problem of decreasing numbers of learners who are interested in taking advanced-level courses. Recommendation for Researchers: Further exploration of aspects for improvement in the teaching model of the VHS, its design, and its support system and for finding out factors that impact attrition lay down important research trajectories that have not yet been trodden. Impact on Society: Issues of equity and the democratization of learning of advanced STEM subjects are now possible to be seriously considered in a principled manner within the context of the VHS. Future Research: Future research may focus on the affordances, possibilities, and limitations of learning within a VHS to ensure a more robust process that will allow more students to learn advanced mathematics and physics.

AB  - As computational methods are widely used in science disciplines, integrating computational thinking (CT) into classroom materials can create authentic science learning experiences for students. In this study, we classroom-tested a CT-integrated geoscience curriculum module designed for secondary students. The module consisted of three inquiry investigations that were age-appropriately translated from the computational practices of volcanologists who study tephra hazards and risks. We developed a domain-specific, block-code-based computational modeling environment where students carried out 1 of the 3 science practices in each inquiry investigation: experimentation, data visualization and interpretation, and modeling. We examined (1) student learning outcomes using pre- and post-tests and (2) student reflections on the computationally supported science practices surveyed at the end of each inquiry investigation during the module. Results indicate that students made statistically significant gains in science content as well as in computationally supported experimentation, data visualization and interpretation, and modeling practices. Over 80% of students identified different ways in which block coding supported their practices during inquiry investigations. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for the future development of computationally supported inquiry investigations in science.

AB  - Purpose: This study developed an interdisciplinary STEM module called the 'Malaysian-Biotechnology-STEM' (MBS) based on the proposed conceptual framework. In addition, this study demonstrated an interdisciplinary approach to teach biotechnology. Method: A two-week pilot test was conducted in Perak, Malaysia. The student questionnaire and biotechnology achievement test were administered to 12 secondary school students (16-18 years old) from a selected school that offered Additional Science. The data were analysed with descriptive statistics. Findings: The study found that the MBS module could improve students understanding in biotechnology and help to foster their 21st century skills such as digital era literacy skill and inventive skill. The study also found that the average mean score of the student achievement improved after the intervention with MBS module. Significance: It can be concluded that the implementation of interdisciplinary MBS module could improve student understanding in biotechnology. Thus, it could further enhance students' interest to pursue the field in higher learning institutions and produce sufficient future workforce for the biotechnology industry.

AB  - We present the "AI-Atlas" didactic concept as a coherent set of best practices for teaching Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to a technical audience in tertiary education, and report on its implementation and evaluation within a design-based research framework and two actual courses: an introduction to AI within the final year of an undergraduate computer science program, as well as an introduction to ML within an interdisciplinary graduate program in engineering. The concept was developed in reaction to the recent AI surge and corresponding demand for foundational teaching on the subject to a broad and diverse audience, with on-site teaching of small classes in mind and designed to build on the specific strengths in motivational public speaking of the lecturers. The research question and focus of our evaluation is to what extent the concept serves this purpose, specifically taking into account the necessary but unforeseen transfer to ongoing hybrid and fully online teaching since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our contribution is two-fold: besides (i) presenting a general didactic concept for tertiary engineering education in AI and ML, ready for adoption, we (ii) draw conclusions from the comparison of qualitative student evaluations (n = 24-30) and quantitative exam results (n = 62-113) of two full semesters under pandemic conditions with the result of previous years (participants from Zurich, Switzerland). This yields specific recommendations for the adoption of any technical curriculum under flexible teaching conditions--be it on-site, hybrid, or online.

AB  - The article presents our Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) activities in the project-based Science education of third graders (8--9-year-old pupils) in the Slovak Republic. Individual tasks of project assignment titled "Temperature Measurement" were conceived for "guided inquiry". We also supported the IBL of pupils by interactive education strategy--Integrated e-Learning (INTe-L). The strategy was built on the role of interactive simulations and experimenting at the knowledge acquisition. The following INTe-L components were used: (a) on-site and remote experiments, (b) interactive simulations and (c) electronic study materials. The research was based the hypothesis that the project-based teaching of the topic "Temperature Measurement" using the IBL activities is significantly more efficient than traditional (instructivist) way of teaching. To verify the hypothesis, we carried out a pedagogical experiment on a sample of 60 respondents. The third graders were divided into two parallel groups: an experimental group (EG, 30 pupils) and control group (CG, 30 pupils). To get a relevant feedback, pre-test and post-test were developed and applied. The results attained in the EG were statistically processed, evaluated, and subsequently compared with those in the CG. The analysis of the results attained by the EG showed that their knowledge acquisition has been increased by 24% compared to CG. We have created a methodology for making simple scientific project assignments with the implementation of all components of the new integrated e-learning education strategy (real and real remote experiment, e-simulation, e-learning material). On a specific example of the topic "Temperature Measurement" in primary education, we have presented the possibility of using a "guided inquiry" in the implementation of individual experimental tasks. We have introduced a form of teamwork that allows to harmonize the teaching requirements with individual learning approach and helps to prepare pupils for planned work and independent knowledge acquisition and problem solving. The study has shown that complex IBL activities can be successfully applied at primary school 3rd grade level already. Our form of education with the wider use of modern information and communication technologies (ICT) was attractive for the learners and helped them to develop interdisciplinary relationships. The integrated e-learning has helped third grades to develop a deeper conceptual understanding of temperature and allowed them to prepare presentations to demonstrate their conceptual knowledge. The approach allowed pupils to gain key competencies in Science (discussion and presentation of results). It has also increased the pupils' interest in Science in general and helped them to understand links between different subjects.

AB  - Reported herein is a multidisciplinary experiment for senior-level undergraduate teaching laboratories in the synthesis of the analytes acetaminophen and phenacetin; the fabrication of paper-based devices, using eyeliner, acrylic spray paint, or wax-printing, for sensing of those analytes; and the use of the newly fabricated devices for successful qualitative and quantitative analyte detection. This experiment includes elements of organic, analytical, and materials chemistry, as well as device engineering, and provides a strong pedagogical experience for the undergraduate student participants. The experiment was tested over two years in the Advanced Organic Laboratory, and 90% of students over the two years successfully completed all experimental objectives. The modular nature of the reported experiments and inexpensive costs of materials and instrumentation significantly enhance the practical applicability of this experiment and the likelihood of widespread adaptation.

AB  - Contribution: The information described in this study provides a starting point for discussing an effective robotics curriculum offered by any engineering university or institute. Background: Robotics is a multidisciplinary field that includes mechanical engineering, electrical and electronic engineering, and computer science. Several universities have established departments of robotics to teach their students robotics education; however, a comprehensive curriculum to deliver robotics education has not yet been fully developed. Research Questions: What are the significant component courses offered by existing departments of robotics? Methodology: This article investigates component courses among departments of robotics through a title-based aggregation of existing courses and textual analyses. Findings: From a title-based aggregation of robotics curricula from 19 departments established by 2018, control engineering, programming, technical drawing/design, and electronic engineering/electronic circuits were found to be the core courses. From textual analyses of the curricula, robotics departments' course titles were similar to those of mechanical engineering departments.

AB  - Research Findings: Educators declare their commitment to high-quality education for all children. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) has been increasingly included as critical topics, even for young children. However, there are exceptions, especially the provision of developmentally appropriate STEM experiences to children with disabilities (CWD). In this article, we review evidence concerning this equity gap, including the importance of STEM education to CWD. We find that the early years provide an exceptional opportunity to introduce STEM, but that this potential is often left unrealized, especially for young vulnerable children, who live in poverty, are members of linguistic and ethnic minority groups, or are CWD (some with particular disabilities in STEM domains). Research also indicates the success of some educational approaches. Practice or Policy: Research and development in each of the STEM domains, as well as interdisciplinary approaches provides directions for both policy and practice. For example, both need to change to reflect importance of STEM for all young children, especially CWD, the need to change harmful beliefs, and the positive effects of approaches based on learning trajectories. We conclude with an introduction of a new center to support inclusive innovation in early education in STEM.

AB  - With growing emphasis on data curation practice in both science and industry, there has been a call for information professionals to take on a substantial role in data curation. Library and information science (LIS) education has been responding to this call by offering various training opportunities from Master's education to professional development. The most recent effort to systematically review a data curation curriculum offered by ALA-accredited LIS schools was in 2012, so it is time to revisit the progress and evolution of data curation education. The main goal of this study is to analyze the course content from the syllabi of various programs to understand what is being taught in LIS schools throughout graduate-level education. Further, because the need for data curation is apparent across different disciplines, and thus not only LIS but also other disciplines have been offering data curation courses, this study also analyzed syllabi from other disciplines. A total of 80 syllabi were analyzed in this study: 15 syllabi from 9 ALA-accredited institutions and 65 syllabi from 53 institutions of Carnegie Classification (CC). Our findings suggest a notable growth in LIS education in data curation since 2012, but LIS education still provides less training in technical skills. There was also a distinctive difference in educational approach to teach data curation between LIS (user- and service-oriented) and other disciplines (technical skills-focused), which brought different strengths and weaknesses in curriculum.

AB  - This article describes advances in the behavioral self-management of chronic disease from the perspective of a 25-year trajectory of National Institute of Health-funded research in arthritis and cardiopulmonary diseases that has sought to develop a transdisciplinary understanding of how applied behavioral science can be used to improve health behaviors, functional status, and health outcomes. The article traces the arc of a novel research program--conducted in collaboration with physician-scientists at Columbia, Weill Cornell Medical College, and New York University School of Medicine--that runs through social cognitive theory, behavioral economics, and the emerging science of positive psychology in an effort to develop promising new approaches to fostering the adoption and maintenance of health-related behavioral change. The article concludes with what has been learned and what the implications of the work are for advancing behavioral self-management and patient education to improve patient outcomes and achieve the compression of morbidity.

AB  - Since the "Next Generation Science Standards" (NGSS) were released, K-12 science teachers have been figuring out how to extend related learning opportunities to all students, including multilingual learners (MLLs) who are new to speaking English. Elementary schools often prioritize math and English language arts, the subjects that are the primary focus of state testing, and may consequently pull students out of science for English language development. When MLLs are in the mainstream classroom, teachers may wonder how to support them in expansive forms of scientific sensemaking, including science practices (Bang et al. 2017). Without time and support to develop new pedagogical approaches, teachers may continue to use traditional strategies like structured language exercises, which often do not promote sensemaking. In this article, they demonstrate how the NGSS offer a new opportunity to see language development and science learning as mutually supportive, an approach that has the potential to support equity in science learning for MLLs (Reigh and Miller 2020). They present a sample activity structure for introducing phenomena that allows students to "simultaneously" develop language and engage in scientific sensemaking.

AB  - We report our progress on the "River Memorial Museum" didactic intervention project developed with schools, in the basin of the Atoyac River in Mexico, that are significantly impacted by the pollution produced through industrialisation. The teachers of the elementary schools in these communities, environmental scientists, educators, and community activists participated jointly in a "co-construction" process, designing "interdisciplinary" educational activities to study local environmental issues and recovering the principles of a "socio-critical perspective of mathematical modelling." In this paper, we centre on presenting the methodology of the didactic intervention with the teachers of one school of an Atoyac River basin community and the principles for designing educational activities we developed collaboratively with them. We believe this methodology could be helpful to support others in thinking about similar opportunities in their communities.

AB  - This article describes three interdisciplinary events held outside of the classroom to examine social psychological concepts in the criminal justice system, with undergraduate students enrolled in criminal justice and psychology courses. These events can most accurately be described as using a synthetic interdisciplinary approach, in which the disciplines of psychology and criminal justice remain clearly identifiable in looking at phenomena like occurrences of bystander apathy, while enabling a holistic view of these phenomena. First, 75 students celebrated the life of Kitty Genovese, a famous victim of bystander apathy. Later in the semester, the same students competed in a game-show-like review session. Finally, 45 students explored the intersection of the mental health and criminal justice systems with professionals from various fields. Overall, students enjoyed the social interaction with their peers across the majors, as well as with their professors and professionals in the field. Students also indicated that the interactive learning techniques enhanced their new understanding of the intersection of the disciplines. Future research should investigate the offering of interdisciplinary events to students within and across academic divisions to build community and enhance students' understanding of their educational and career opportunities.

AB  - One of the aims of Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) in Scotland is greater inclusion of interdisciplinary learning and teaching in school education. There is, arguably, a limited amount of guidance in the CfE literature to advise and support secondary teachers in the practical implications of the planning, preparation and implementation of interdisciplinary learning and teaching. This paper examines this guidance and insights from research literature and presents the findings from a research project, "Searching for Meaning," which focused on science and religious education teachers collaborating in planned interdisciplinary learning and teaching in secondary schools. The paper identifies some of the key factors for effective interdisciplinary learning and teaching between science and religious education. These include: support from the school leadership; openness to interdisciplinary work and willingness to learn about other disciplines; teamwork, dialogue and joint planning and the need for time and support for teachers. These findings are potentially significant for other forms of interdisciplinary learning and teaching.

AB  - To improve students' interdisciplinary learning, it is necessary to find ways to support teacher candidates' pedagogical preparation for STEAM practices during teacher education. Thereby, in this study, the influence of a 5-week collaborative cross-disciplinary STEAM module on secondary mathematics, science, and English language arts (ELA) pre-service teachers' (PSTs) views and lesson planning skills in the context of STEAM integration was studied. As ELA provides the foundation for students' learning of STEM subjects, a conceptualization of ELA as the arts component in our STEAM module was used. Preliminary findings indicated an improvement in PSTs' STEAM conception and showed slight evidence in their STEAM lesson planning skills. Based on these results, possible implications for pre-service teacher education emphasizing STEAM integration are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: This article contributes to the discussion of teaching migration in upper primary school by examining teachers' didactical choices concerning specialized knowledge and pupils' previous knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: The approach is practice-based design research, in which meetings with teachers and focus group interviews with ten- to twelve-year-old pupils are analysed in relation to educational practice and exemplary teaching. Findings: Teachers expanded concept of migration developed through discussions of specialized knowledge in relation to pupils' previous knowledge contributes to a more qualified migration education. Migration can be taught from a perspective or in thematic interdisciplinary projects. Migration biographies as well as using stories, pictures, and affective dimensions, can make the abstract concepts become concrete when reconstruction of migration in teaching. Practical implications: This addresses issues of continuous education in social studies for teachers and the need for collaborative platforms.

AB  - Although efforts are being made to bring science closer to secondary school students, science is still mostly perceived within stereotypic frameworks, hindering students' identification with it. In this paper, we claim the role that arts-based approaches can play in science education to break these biased views and understandings and generate a more motivating science learning experience. For that purpose, we analyse research conducted with students from two secondary schools in Barcelona participating in a science education project applying drama-based activities within an inquiry process with early-career researchers. More specifically, we explore students' perceptions of science and their attitudes towards learning science at school and pursuing scientific careers. We then evaluate and discuss how the triad 'researchers' interaction -- scientific inquiry -- artistic creation' can potentially challenge their storylines about science and bring science learning closer to them. Findings suggest that the evaluated approach contributed to progress in this direction through two mechanisms: creating new rapports with science by offering a creative, inclusive and interactive learning experience, and broadening students' perceptions in terms of what implies to do science and who can do it.

AB  - Competency Based Education (CBE) is becoming increasingly popular with Department of Defense (DoD) training and education. Air University, located at Maxwell Air Force Base (AFB) Alabama, recently identified CBE as a key factor for consideration in future training. This article discusses Air Force Competencies, analyzes the evaluation of competencies, and transfer of learning. The Civilian Associate's Degree, currently under beta testing, is discussed as an example of the need to consider transfer of learning with respect to institutional competencies. Beta testing of the Associate of Applied Science Degree in Air Force Leadership and Management Studies is meant to pave the way for the development and implementation of Civilian Airman training. Based on Civilian Associate's Degree (CAD) Beta Testing student data, our research examines how CAD faculty can best capture professional interdisciplinary knowledge and experiences present in incoming students. In turn, leadership and management theories will add to the student knowledge and experience. This paper is an effort to capture the utilization of previous professional student experiences while developing and updating course curriculum based upon research and Beta Test student data.

AB  - Educational approaches that enable students to actively and directly participate in "real-world" projects are increasingly recognized as valuable pedagogical tools and, as such, being incorporated into university curriculums worldwide. Though not traditionally associated with political science courses, project-based international service learning presents a tremendous opportunity to bring classroom concepts and theories to life, provide an active approach to addressing international challenges, and assist students in the development of the hands-on, problem-solving, team-based, critical-thinking skills that are increasingly important to employers across all sectors. This article seeks to encourage political science faculty to incorporate international service learning--and/or project-based approaches--into their educational offerings. Through examination of the course "Global Synthesis in Liberal Arts and Engineering Studies" at California Polytechnic State University, we have identified multiple factors that can help promote successful execution of project-based international service learning as a pedagogical tool, and provide additional suggestions for faculty interested in adopting specific aspects of these educational approaches, and/or in doing so closer to home.

AB  - This paper reports a comprehensive review of literature on personalised learning in STEM and STEAM (or STE(A)M) education, which involves the disciplinary integration of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, as well as Arts. The review covered the contexts of STE(A)M education where personalised learning was adopted, the objectives of personalised learning and research issues, and various aspects of practising personalisation. A total of 72 publications from 2011 to 2020 were collected from Scopus for review. The results reveal the widespread studies in this area across various countries/territories, levels of education, subject disciplines, and modes of education. The most common objective of personalised learning lied in catering for learning styles. The issue most frequently addressed focused on evaluating the effectiveness of technologies for personalised learning. Blended learning and learning analytics are the most popular means to achieve personalised learning. Among various aspects of learning, learning material is the one most frequently addressed. Also, the factors and criteria for personalising learning were summarised, which reveal the heterogeneous nature of learners who have their own learning ability, interest, style and progress. The results suggest more research on interdisciplinary and integrative approaches for STE(A)M learning to examine how personalisation can be applied effectively, as well as more investigation on integrating personalisation with the pedagogies and elements commonly introduced to STE(A)M education.

AB  - Problem-solving has been one of the major strands in science education research. But much of the problem-solving research has been conducted on discipline-based contexts; little research has been done on how students, especially individuals, solve interdisciplinary problems. To understand how individuals reason about interdisciplinary problems, we conducted an interview study with 16 graduate students coming from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. During the interviews, we asked participants to solve two interdisciplinary science problems on the topic of osmosis. We investigated participants' problem reasoning processes and probed in their attitudes toward general interdisciplinary approach and specific interdisciplinary problems. Through a careful inductive content analysis of their responses, we studied how disciplinary, cognitive, and affective factors influenced their interdisciplinary problems-solving. We found that participants' prior discipline-based science learning experiences had both positive and negative influences on their interdisciplinary problem-solving. These influences were embodied in their conceptualization of the interdisciplinary problems, the strategies they used to integrate different disciplinary knowledge, and the attitudes they had toward interdisciplinary approach in general and specific interdisciplinary problems. This study sheds light on interdisciplinary science education by revealing the complex relationship between disciplinary learning and interdisciplinary problem-solving.

AB  - We describe how faculty and staff used improvement science design Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles and engaged in interdisciplinary conversations in an effort to improve students' performance in introductory mathematics courses. This initiative started with College Algebra a course with a large enrollment of students that had a high failure rate. We engaged in PDSA cycles over a period of 4 years. From 2011-2015, we used data from student assessment scores, course evaluations, lab surveys, and instructors' observations to inform decisions to transform introductory mathematics courses. The transformative efforts positively enhanced students' performance. Furthermore, to reflect on our PDSA cycles and the broader implications of institutionalized change to mathematics courses, we engaged in frequent interdisciplinary conversations to discuss complexities and challenges. These meetings provided an opportunity to build a common vision about the nature and delivery of the mathematics taught to better serve students The themes of the conversations were on curriculum, assessment, instruction, the complexities of the change process, cultivating a growth mindset, and the need to engage in research in general education mathematics courses. Therefore, in this article we provide insights as to how interdisciplinary conversations were used to implement evidence-based teaching practices and also pedagogical approaches that can be used to facilitate students learning.

AB  - Biomimicry has been proposed as an important tool to reach key skills for the new century. It has taken its place as an essential resource for critical and creative thinking in design disciplines. However, as emphasized in many studies, bio-informed research requires interdisciplinary collaboration and systematic knowledge transfer. This article answers the question: "How can architects--who have limited knowledge in biology--develop biomimetic ideas and transfer this knowledge to architectural designs?" This research's hypothesis is that the "natural language approach," which is frequently used in engineering disciplines, can also be a knowledge transfer tool for the architectural discipline. To test the hypothesis, research was conducted with a group of graduate students taking the "ARCH5661--Parametric Approach to Nature-Inspired Architectures" course in the Department of Architecture, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey, in the fall semester of 2019. The results were evaluated based on term-long studies and feedback from the students. In light of the obtained data, this article proposes a method that can be used in architectural education and adapted to other design disciplines.

AB  - Evidence-informed, interprofessional education (IPE) programs in behavioral health are an important part of reform efforts to reduce fragmentation and increase quality of mental health and substance use disorder treatment. The aim of this study is to document an implementation science approach to translation of IPE, grounded in Interprofessional Education Collaborative competencies, to social work and other behavioral health graduate students and to evaluate selected implementation outcomes. Select implementation strategies from the "Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change" were used to guide implementation of our behavioral health IPE training. A mixed-methods design, including survey, observational, and focus group data, was used to evaluate select implementation outcomes of the IPE training program. Data indicate positive perceptions of feasibility, acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, and fidelity of the IPE training program, with mean scores ranging from 4.25 to 4.45 (5-point Likert scale) on items related to acceptability, appropriateness and adoption. Themes that emerged from qualitative data included recommendations of relational and experiential strategies to improve fidelity. Evaluation of implementation outcomes identifies additional strategies to enhance learning and fidelity to IPEC competencies. Implementation science offers a helpful framework for carrying-out trainings in higher education and beyond.

AB  - Coding is increasingly popular in schools around the world and is often taught by non-specialist teachers as an integrated task with other subject areas. In this article, we explore the relationship between computer science (CS) concepts and students' multimodal expression in a coding animated narrative (CAN) task in the context of an integrated English-Technology unit of learning. Through this collective case study, we explore how CS concepts underpin semiotic elements of an animated narrative, analyse the factors that influence the extent to which students exercise those concepts, and reveal the tensions and opportunities that a CAN task may present for learning computer science concepts in regular, non-specialist, cross-curricular classrooms. The findings suggest that CAN tasks are unique in presenting opportunities for students to learn challenging CS concepts such as synchronisation and parallelism. At the same time, CAN tasks present tensions for teaching CS concepts in non-specialist classrooms, where student projects are often judged on their visual qualities. In such settings, procedural, rather than conceptual knowledge, may be a more efficient route to creative outcomes. It also means that drawing skills need to be prioritised. Role specialisation often led to better quality projects but at the expense of individual students' conceptual development in computer science.

AB  - This article presents an experience of teaching innovation based on the application of active methodologies in economics and business education at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU). The proposal builds on a competency teaching approach, whose objectives were to verify the effectiveness of these methodologies in the area of economics in order to reconnect the university with its social environment and enhance the competency and student-learning values. During the 2019-2020 academic year, a multidisciplinary process based on the Problem-Based Learning methodology was developed in the Introduction to Economics II: Principles of Macroeconomics course. Various teaching techniques were applied to encourage participation, autonomous student work, group work, as well as elements of social responsibility and values education. The results of the process collected quantitatively and qualitatively show improvements in the acquisition of knowledge by students and greater appropriation levels linked to greater motivation. However, reluctance and misgivings about the process also arose, which would require further work in class and a leading role by students. Greater planning, time and coordination requirements were also limiting factors for the teaching staff; however, the relevance of applying the methodology sequentially is suggested.

AB  - James Madison University faculty team-teach an interdisciplinary mathematical modeling course for mathematics and biology students. We have used two different project-based approaches to emphasize the mathematical concepts taught in class, while also exposing students to new areas of mathematics not formally covered in class. The first method allows students to select projects based on their individual interests, which provided the class with an exposure to the breadth of applications of mathematical modeling to biology. The second method allows students to select projects that are focused around one common biological theme, which encouraged a remarkable cohesion among the whole class. These strategies could be extended to various applications-based mathematics courses. We present our observations and make recommendations for project-based courses using both methods.

AB  - Students face challenging texts and concepts across the disciplines in higher education, and many students lack the reading skills and strategies to make sense of them. The aim of the small study described in this article was to explore the benefits, if any, of the difficulty paper, a written formative assessment that asks students to explore their difficulties with challenging texts. An inductive analysis of student difficulty papers in a multidisciplinary "Great Works" course suggests that the paper encouraged students to address their confusion without dismissing it and helped students to model the processes of good reading. Findings also suggest that the assignment may be a useful tool to develop disciplinary habits of mind. The article concludes with an example of how educators might use the difficulty paper in science and mathematics courses.

AB  - Governments the world over require scientific knowledge to inform policy makers' decision-making processes. The recontextualization of this information for nonscientific audiences has received much attention, though it has primarily focused on publicly available texts. Little is known about the discursive nature of how science is transformed and repurposed and the confidential writing performed by boundary organizations that are working between science and policy. This ethnographic study explores the collaborative discursive activity involved in efforts by a boundary organization--the Council of Canadian Academies--to recontextualize science for policy makers. The analysis opens the discursive black box of the genre system and intermediary genre sets involved in one project, which led to the publication and distribution of the boundary object of an advisory report, "Older Canadians on the Move." I claim that the discursive boundary work involves a complex genre system containing several sequential genred activities through which science is transformed and a boundary object created.

AB  - Many findings from research as well as reports from teachers describe students' problem solving strategies as manipulation of formulas by rote. The resulting dissatisfaction with quantitative physical textbook problems seems to influence the attitude towards the role of mathematics in physics education in general. Mathematics is often seen as a tool for calculation which hinders a conceptual understanding of physical principles. However, the role of mathematics cannot be reduced to this technical aspect. Hence, instead of putting mathematics away we delve into the nature of physical science to reveal the strong conceptual relationship between mathematics and physics. Moreover, we suggest that, for both prospective teaching and further research, a focus on deeply exploring such interdependency can significantly improve the understanding of physics. To provide a suitable basis, we develop a new model which can be used for analysing different levels of mathematical reasoning within physics. It is also a guideline for shifting the attention from technical to structural mathematical skills while teaching physics. We demonstrate its applicability for analysing physical-mathematical reasoning processes with an example.

AB  - This paper explores the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on Russia's academic sector, relying on the limited evidence available. The invasion has triggered an academic exodus from Russia, with both immediate and far-reaching consequences. These consequences range from the interruption of ongoing research projects and the termination of international collaborations to the emergence of an intellectual void, raising concerns about the future of academic pursuits in Russia. Conventional models for understanding academic mobility, which primarily focus on professional and economic incentives, prove inadequate in accounting for the complexities introduced by geopolitical strife, international sanctions, and curtailed academic freedoms. This paper calls for an interdisciplinary approach incorporating perspectives from political science, sociology, and international relations for a richer understanding of academic migration in conflict-affected settings. The Russia-Ukraine war serves as an important case study, shedding light on the vulnerabilities of academic sectors, even in the aggressor country where the physical conflict is not occurring, and offering broader insights for the field of academic mobility.

AB  - Children and adolescents spend a large part of their day at school. Physical and mental problems result from physical inactivity, sitting positions at work and "indoor lifestyle" (WHO 2004). Therefore, health education is a major topic in school. Biology classes (scholastic) can make an important contribution in this context. Health as a person's state is composed by physical, mental and social aspects (WHO 1946, Hurrelmann 2010). The presence of nature can have positive effects on all components of the (subjective) well-being of humans at all ages. The fact has already been well proved by science (Ulrich 1984; Health Council of the Netherlands 2004; Barton/Pretty 2010). In the scholastic context environment or gardens hold various functions as (special) places for the contact between humans and nature: They are areas for explorative learning, they provide manifold sources for interdisciplinary teaching, they are spots to generate skills and recovery and they are places for nutritional and environmental education (Blair 2009; Jäckel 2010). Generally, school gardens may take over a significant function in view of health education and wellness of children and adolescents. As a consequence, practical work and other activities in a school garden let the place become a point for physical agitation, relaxation and stress reduction. School garden classes and school garden practice in most of the cases are only held in the lower age groups of pupils (primary school). An analysis shall show that school gardens also could be employed for the health education in higher grades (11th and 12th grade). Representative a course of pre-study students (teacher students and/or prospective teachers) of the second semester were interviewed and tested in the educational garden of the University of Rostock about their subjective well-being. As a result, it was proved that garden activities have highly positive effects on self-esteem.

AB  - As artist and social researchers working in health research, we work 'against the grain' in marginalised spaces to resist the marketisation of knowledge and related neoliberal practices. Our cross-disciplinary alliance, between theatre / performance studies and critical health science, is premised on engaging the humanities, arts, and social sciences to resist the subversion of both critical qualitative research and arts-based inquiries, and to interrogate structural inequalities that foster human injustices. Here we offer reflections on tensions we experienced with our interdisciplinary collaborations, how these tensions exposed limitations of our own disciplines/fields, and also enhanced the fruitfulness of our partnership.

AB  - This paper focuses on a design based research study about STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) learning by making through collaboration and production. This study examines learning by making by students to explore STEM using a constructionist approach with a particular focus on computer science and engineering. The use of IoT as a technology enhanced learning (TEL) tool created the learning conditions to be studied: (a) collaborative: no one person had the knowledge to complete the project alone, (b) problem-based: no off the shelf solution was used, and (c) multidisciplinary: the learning context pushed the boundaries across the subjects. The study investigated the learning conditions and indicators of collaboration and production taking place when learning about STEM. The results were used to inform the design of effective data analytics and visualization tools for the PELARS project to advance practice-based learning activities in STEM teaching. However, more specifically, the findings provide insight into the knowledge construction process when learning through making in complex environments. These insights illustrate the combined pedagogical value of collaboration and production supporting the multidisciplinary learning opportunities. The importance of community knowledge construction and its relationship to the pedagogical approach is examined. The significance of these findings in the context of IoT TEL tools in education is explored.

AB  - As interdisciplinary courses are developed, instructors and researchers have to grapple with questions of how students should make connections across disciplines. We explore the issue of interdisciplinary reconciliation (IDR): how students reconcile seemingly contradictory ideas from different disciplines. While IDR has elements in common with other frameworks for the reconciliation of ideas across contexts, it differs in that each disciplinary idea is considered canonically correct within its own discipline. The setting for the research is an introductory physics course for biology majors that seeks to build greater interdisciplinary coherence and therefore includes biologically relevant topics such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and chemical bond energy. In our case-study data, students grapple with the apparent contradiction between the energy released when the phosphate bond in ATP is broken and the idea that an energy input is required to break a bond. We see students justifying context-dependent modeling choices, showing nuance in articulating how system choices may be related to disciplinary problems of interest. This represents a desired end point of IDR, in which students can build coherent connections between concepts from different disciplines while understanding each concept in its own disciplinary context. Our case study also illustrates elements of the instructional environment that play roles in the process of IDR.

AB  - Researchers have demonstrated a correlation between personal value, enjoyment and interest, and sustained engagement in science (Ainley and Ainley 2011). This article presents pedagogical strategies that use drama and discussion to explore students' everyday encounters with science by engaging the body and emotion. Drama-based discussions in science classrooms can be far-ranging as students express feelings and describe experiences in ways not common in science education. Teachers should be patient as the students express themselves, being very attentive to the students' comments, repeating and seeking amplifications and clarifications until students are satisfied that they have clearly communicated their ideas. This article outlines four teaching strategies, each of which is 30 minutes to 1 hour long. These strategies can be used as diagnostic tools to support the design of future learning opportunities that take into account students' current understandings.

AB  - This paper provides the first review and illustration of technology-use strategies for supporting student learning in different integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning environments. An integrated STEM learning environment may focus on integrating and learning science and mathematics or integrating and learning engineering and technology simultaneously for multiple levels of learners. An integrated STEM learning environment breaks down disciplinary boundaries and allows students to apply multidisciplinary knowledge in solving problems. This study illustrates four technology-use strategies to support student learning in an integrated STEM learning environment: (a) providing authentic learning contexts, (b) offering web-based inquiry environments, (c) expanding learning through immersive and interactive technology, and (d) transforming students from consumers to creators. It also addresses the challenges that manifest in integrated STEM learning environments. The study provides practical implications and research directions for technology-supported learning in integrated STEM learning environments.

AB  - Project RESET engaged resettled Chin refugee teens in critical STEM literacy practices in a community-based afterschool STEM enrichment program in the United States. Over the course of nine months, the participants multimodally and multilinguistically communicated their learning about weather, climate, and climate change, while also developing English proficiency. In this paper, we define critical STEM literacy drawing on current scholarship on critical science literacy and interdisciplinary STEM learning. We then present our four design principles of the learning environment for supporting critical STEM literacy and English learning and share examples from the program that demonstrate how the principles were enacted to engage youth. Drawing on our learning in this work, we will discuss implications for science educators who work with displaced or resettled youth in Asia and the Pacific regions that provide new homes for many displaced children and teens.

AB  - In June 2019, the Vatican published its first-ever document on gender theory. This document was directed at Catholic educational institutions and draws on theology and philosophy, while excluding science on gender identity and testimonies from transgender people, to suggest gender theory is an ideology endangering the family. The case of Jane, a practicing Catholic and teacher-leader in a Catholic secondary school, contributing to cross-disciplinary curriculum development, school accreditation, and student mentorship, is used to anticipate problems of practice which may emerge as this document's guidance is applied at the school level. Ecological systems theory and communities of practice theory are used to analyze this case.

AB  - The image is the raw material of the twenty-first century. Images infiltrate all social and cultural spaces. Its digital-mediated realities drive communication, industry and knowledge. Images saturate life and adolescent learners are familiar with the participatory nature of image production and its social, educational and personal communicative realities. Vision and visibility, seeing and being now dominate how we inter-subjectively recognise ourselves and perform our world. We also find our aesthetic and embodied self increasingly constituted within imaging acts that are relational. Visual culture may have colonised the self and learning, but imagination is without borders. The current pictorial turn opens possibilities to explore truth in flux through visual artistic acts. This article embeds Deleuzian method, which is one of intuitions, going beyond the actual, or our limited forms of representing life, to recognising that life has future imaginative potential forms and is always becoming. The article discusses an arts-based inquiry project for gifted artist visualiser/learners at an Australian regional university who are given broad topics on science phenomena and asked to give them expression. It suggests that pedagogies of the visual with their performative acts can prise open curriculum where an art-science interchange between two disciplines is made difficult by the current siloed nature of curriculum knowledge. Drawing on an analysis of Anika's and Joel's artworks and visual diaries it aims to reveal how their learning events dwell and are performed in aesthetic borderlands and how visual pedagogies forge new fluid visual borderlands and new learning.

AB  - This paper explores Computational Thinking (CT) through the experiences and interactions of sixth-grade students as they were engaging in a science lesson utilizing robotics. This robotics unit institutes the shifting from traditional to engaging hands-on activities coupled with CT skills that are exciting, intriguing, and inviting to students. The constructionist philosophy, hands-on application learning, addresses social skills like collaboration, communication, and teamwork to provide an authentic, real-world learning experience. CT brings to the classroom exciting and innovative activities that infuse robotics with hands-on application platforms in the science and mathematics curriculum, but the education system has missed a core set of young open-minded eager students at the intermediate school level. With today's vision in education focusing on the 21st-Century learner, CT is emerging as a key component in the skill set necessary for the new generation of learners. CT poses a strong ideology based on problem-solving equally conveying an essential position in cross-curricular classroom activities. This session exposes CT through a study relating experiences and interactions by students when engaging in a science lesson utilizing robots. Focusing on how students engage the CT key concepts of: (1) abstraction; (2) decomposition; (3) pattern recognition; and (4) algorithm when participating in robotics activity.

AB  - For nearly 50 years, the Thomas Coram Research Unit (TCRU) has been integral to the IOE (Institute of Education), UCL's Faculty of Education and Society (University College London, UK). This article is written from the perspectives of four researchers who have served in the TCRU's formative years and over its lifetime. It chronicles the TCRU's history and meaning, situating these reflections within the wider and much changed context of academia, politics and society. It begins with an overview of the TCRU's origins as a dedicated government-funded research unit in 1973, the rationale and aims of its founder and first director, Jack Tizard, and the TCRU's subsequent evolution, and its work in the fields of childhood, families and children's services. This is followed by a consideration of some important features of the TCRU, which have created its distinct identity, for example multidisciplinarity, working with mixed methods, international collaborations, a convivial and collegiate environment and a continuing capacity to generate new ideas and directions for research. The article also reflects on some of the challenges faced by the TCRU and how it has responded to them. The article concludes by considering whether there is still a place today for a dedicated, university-based social research unit with a long-term and strategic orientation.

AB  - The current school system has an underrepresentation of People of Color teaching science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Presently, there is a lack of data gathering tools to explore the STEM experience of Students of Color. This article focuses on the development of a survey using a Critical Race Theory framework to better understand the impact of race on the STEM education pipeline for underrepresented, racially minoritized (URM) learners. This article will review the survey's development process consisting of (a) creation of initial survey; (b) pilot study using interviews to receive feedback; (c) modifying the survey based on the feedback from the pilot study; and (d) implementation of the revised survey. Ultimately this instrument will support inquiry around racial representation in STEM education.

AB  - The integrated STEAM approach arises when a contextualized problem's resolution requires different contributions (views) from each discipline. In this descriptive article we discuss the views needed from chemistry, technology, design skills, mathematical modelling and the artistic support necessary for constructing a scientific model that explains the pH of the mouth when chewing gum. To do this, we focus on describing the implementation of a short sequence of video-recorded inquiry-based contextualized activities (didactic innovation) in two classrooms with students in their third year of compulsory secondary education (14-15 years old). The scenes taken from the analysis of the implementation videos support the proposal of the connections needed in the STEAM contributions. The difficulties encountered from each discipline and the resolutions we propose shed light on how well-selected problems make STEAM views necessary, thus avoiding the usual summative multidisciplinary approach.

AB  - Students often struggle with the relationship between mathematical graphs and the data they represent. To truly understand types of evolutionary selection, students need to be proficient with several different skills in math, science, and literacy contexts. With math, students must be able to identify variables, design appropriate graphs based on those variables, and convert data to graphical format. With science, students must be able to relate identified variables to scientific classifications and interpret those classifications based on evaluation of the scenarios presented. With literacy, students must be able to comprehend, dissect, and interpret a given passage. This presentation provides a multifaceted approach to teaching about types of evolutionary selection by making and using graph modeling manipulatives. Though the examples provided in this presentation are primarily focused for biology teachers, anyone who teaches students to interpret graph data could find the graphing manipulatives to be a useful tool as well.

AB  - Evidence-based pedagogies to improve student success in STEM disciplines are now recognized, but their successful incorporation can be hampered by faculty wariness of novel pedagogical research. To support these pedagogies' effective implementation, a research team at a southeastern Historically Black College and University (HBCU) provided its faculty with long-term (2013-2020), incentivized professional development (PD) in STEM subjects, focused on faculty teaching development (TD). Over 6 years, PD/TD experts provided faculty participants with theoretical underpinnings and student outcome data, demonstrated hands-on strategies for under-prepared and differential learners, and addressed concerns that novel pedagogies could erode STEM-subject standards. Participants reflected on their teaching and learning foundations, examined their approaches and assumptions, and implemented new strategies. Interview and survey findings showed long-term, multidisciplinary STEM PD can help change faculty teaching views, even among those initially resistant. Although beyond our study window, ICFAIM collaborations yielded two DOE-funded faculty-developed interventions and team cohesiveness during the pandemic's shift to online instruction. ICFAIM evidence supports PD/TD that is: 1) designed to build on shared standards and knowledge; 2) provided incrementally over time; 3) focused on topics of concern to faculty alongside new ones; and 4) fairly incentivized.

AB  - Surface structures on the nanometer size scale can impart new and exciting properties to bulk materials. Nanoscopic structures on hydrophobic materials can result in superhydrophobicity and structural coloration. We present an interdisciplinary experiment that introduces undergraduate students to nanotechnology by manipulating the superhydrophobicity and structural coloration of blue "Morpho" butterfly wings. The use of detergents can change the surface of the wing from superhydrophobic to hydrophilic, while the use of common solvents can change the ambient index of refraction and shift coherently scattered light to longer wavelengths. Superhydrophobicity and alteration of the index of refraction are readily observable using "Morpho menelaus" and "Morpho rhetenor" butterflies: water beads up and rolls off untreated butterfly wings, while detergent-treated wings get wetted by water and change color from bright blue to green. This experiment is a fun and impactful introduction to fundamental physical principles involving solvation and properties of light that exposes students to materials science concepts that go beyond the solution-phase chemistry normally experienced in a general chemistry course.

AB  - In this article we introduce a synthesis of education "paradigms," adapted from a multi-disciplinary body of literature and tailored to health professions education (HPE). Each paradigm involves a particular perspective on the purpose of education, the nature of knowledge, what knowledge is valued and included in the curriculum, what it means to learn and how learning is assessed, and the roles of teachers and learners in the learning process. We aim to foster awareness of how these different paradigms look in practice and to illustrate the importance of alignment between teaching, learning and assessment practices with paradigmatic values and assumptions. Finally, we advocate for a pluralistic approach that purposefully and meaningfully integrates paradigms of education, enhancing our ability to drive quality in HPE.

AB  - This paper reflects on an undergraduate module at the University of Exeter (2018-2019) trialing a problem-based learning approach to the political ecologies of land. It found that this approach offers significant value for teaching and learning complex socio-ecological interdisciplinarity and instilling in learners a deep and reflective sense of the political in all considerations of land and nature. Team-based co-production of 'solutions' to 'problems' imbued learners with a sense of personal agency, though many found problem-based approaches an unfamiliar and challenging approach to path dependent modes of teaching and learning. The principal contribution is to show how problem-based pedagogies have the potential to empower learners as change agents, to better engage with socio-ecological complexity, and gain greater insights into the deep political in conceptions of nature. It offers environmental educators a pathway for replication of this approach, and for introducing learners to problem-based pedagogies for a political ecology of education.

AB  - To illuminate barriers to collaboration, this study examines who participates in cross-boundary scholarly collaboration most often and which types of boundary crossing (disciplinary, institutional, role) are engaged in most often. The data of this study came from an interdisciplinary consortium with five partner institutions, including one Historically Black College and University (HBCU). The core disciplines involved in the consortium are life sciences, computer science and math and engineering. Through statistical analysis, we determined that members of the consortium engaged more in interdisciplinary research than inter-institutional research. Participation in all boundary crossing collaborations was greater at the HBCU and students and postdocs were less likely than academics to cross-institutional boundaries.

AB  - This research contributes to the growing discussion on entrepreneurial competencies from a multidisciplinary point of view, integrating elements of entrepreneurship research, education sciences, and psychology. Despite many efforts to develop and utilize different entrepreneurial constructs in entrepreneurship education, there is still a lack of theoretical framework for systematic development and measurement validation related to entrepreneurial competencies. This paper aims to widen the theoretical and conceptual discussion on entrepreneurial competencies by stressing the roles of self-esteem and self-efficacy. The study aims to contribute to the academic discussion (1) by addressing this research gap through a literature-based analysis on how entrepreneurial competencies, self-efficacy and self-esteem relate to each other; and (2) by presenting a conceptual framework (ENTself) for further development of entrepreneurship education. The results of the study reflect how self-esteem and self-efficacy are connected, and how they can be aligned with entrepreneurial competencies. We argue that a systematic, theory-based approach to further research on entrepreneurial competencies, based on the proposed framework, is needed for a broader understanding and facilitation of entrepreneurship education. Also, the development of assessment tools adapted from ENTself is suggested for conducting future research of the framework and its validation.

AB  - Every university has many ways to make changes, and institutional transformation is one of the strategic choices to achieve excellence. However, the transformation of higher education is still dynamically defined and open. The practice also has many models and differences. This article examines the scientific paradigm shift to rethink the practice of transformation for higher education. Identifying new scientific paradigms, shifting processes, models used, practical steps, factors, and challenges is the primary concern of research work. This research was conducted qualitatively with a narrative approach. Multi-site studies at several State Islamic Universities (UIN) in Indonesia were reviewed to obtain findings about the different models applied. The results show that the transformation of higher education is simultaneously carried out by changing the institutional status and renewing the scientific paradigm. Science integration is used as a new scientific paradigm even though, in practice, each university has a different model. This new paradigm has wide-ranging impacts, such as eliminating scientific dichotomies that have long been practiced, expanding multidisciplinary scientific structures, and adding authority to develop faculties and study programs. Another impact is the existence of new awareness and enthusiasm for several changes in the aspects of it. Many challenges need to be anticipated to obtain better quality, such as the need for curriculum reformulation, changes in organizational behavior, a new image, and many other programs. We recommend this finding as an example of good practice in improving the quality and institutional system of higher education. To understand the wider impact of this transformation process, such as competency and graduate outcomes, changes in organizational behavior, the direction of research and community service programs, and their social impact in the future, more research on sustainability is needed.

AB  - In the context of enormous global challenges such as climate change, poverty, and the unequal distribution of wealth, sustainability education within higher education has gained momentum as a tool to train a new generation of change agents. Previous research has examined the relationship between sustainability education and entrepreneurship education. There is however a knowledge gap regarding course development strategies that can integrate entrepreneurship competencies into sustainability education. Following a classroom action research (AR) approach, we developed a three-week graduate course aimed at an interdisciplinary cohort of students in the social sciences from partner universities in Brazil and Norway. The course integrated a problem-based learning (PBL) framework. Working in groups of four to five members, the students provided business solutions framed in a post-oil development context. The results indicate tension points in the integration of the learning principles of PBL along the different phases of PBL, namely during the group formation and problem analysis phases. To tackle these tensions, we suggest early group formation and integrate formative feedback and progressive problem analysis. Our framework contributes to the debate on competence-based frameworks within the sustainability education literature. The framework can also serve as an inspiration for course designers in higher education.

AB  - Coding is increasingly recognized as a new literacy that should be encouraged at a young age. This understanding has recontextualized computer science as a compulsory school subject and has informed several developmentally appropriate approaches to computation, including for preschool children. This study focuses on the introduction of three approaches to computation in preschool (3-6 years), specifically computational thinking, programming, and robotics, from a cross-curricular perspective. This paper presents preliminary findings from one of the case studies currently being developed as part of project KML II-Laboratory of Technologies and Learning of Programming and Robotics for Preschool and Elementary School. The purpose of the KML II project is to characterize how approaches to computation can be integrated into preschool and elementary education, across different knowledge domains. The conclusions point to "expression and communication" as an initial framework for computational approaches in preschool, but also to multidisciplinary and more creative methodological activities that offer greater scope for the development of digital and computational competences, as well as for personal and social development.

AB  - Over the years, there have been various calls to increase and better represent astronomy in curricula. This is motivated by views within the astronomy and astronomy education communities that the awe, wonder, and interdisciplinary nature of astronomy has the potential to engage students in STEM across disciplines. Reviews of curricula have shown that astronomy topics are represented in most mandated curricula around the world and although there is a homogeneity of astronomy topics in most mandated curricula, this representation has its limitations. By using the Australian National Curriculum, the USA-based Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), and the Swedish National Curriculum as examples, this study unpacks ideas around "How much astronomy is enough?", the mismatches between astronomy topics in curricula and what constitutes astronomical literacy within the context of the Big Ideas in Astronomy document. The results identify that there is a significant gap at the galactic and extragalactic scales when considering the typical progression of astronomy topics when considering the conceptual, spatial, and temporal scales of the topics. Specifically, topics in curricula jump from tangible concepts within the student's immediate and Solar System spatial scales in primary school to cosmological spatial scales in upper high school, without reference to spatial and conceptual connecting topics at galactic scales. Potential sample curriculum statements drawn from the Big Ideas are presented as a suggested curriculum inclusion. This curricula gap is identified as a potential source of a similar gap in education research in these topics at these levels, which in turn perpetuates the problem by there being a lack of research-based evidence for inclusion in the curriculum.

AB  - When pressing societal challenges (e.g., COVID-19, access to clean water) are sidelined in science classrooms, science education fails to leverage the knowledge and experiences of minoritized students in school, thus reproducing injustices in society. Our conceptual framework for "justice-centered STEM education" engages all students in multiple STEM subjects, including data science and computer science, to explain and design solutions to pressing societal challenges and their disproportionate impact on minoritized groups. In the first part of this article, we extend our conceptual framework by articulating the affordances of justice-centered STEM education for one minoritized student group that has been traditionally denied meaningful STEM learning experiences: multilingual learners (MLs). Justice-centered STEM education with MLs leverages the assets that MLs bring to STEM learning, including their transnational knowledge and experiences as well as their rich repertoire of meaning-making resources, thus refuting deficit narratives of these students. To illustrate the affordances of justice-centered STEM education with MLs, we draw on examples from our instructional unit that engages students in the pressing societal challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the second part of the article, we report on an initial inquiry into how 14 undergraduate pre-service teachers made sense of our conceptual framework after participating in lessons from our COVID-19 instructional unit. Findings indicated that pre-service teachers perceived both opportunities and obstacles of justice-centered STEM education with MLs. We close by discussing what it might take to prepare the next generation of teachers to disrupt systemic injustices in and out of school.

AB  - Students need to think and work across disciplinary boundaries in the twenty-first century. However, it is unclear what interdisciplinary thinking means and how to analyze interdisciplinary interactions in teamwork. In this paper, drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives and empirical analysis of discourse contents, we formulate a theoretical framework that helps analyze interdisciplinary reasoning and communication (IRC) processes in interdisciplinary collaboration. Specifically, we propose four interrelated IRC processes--"integration," "translation," "transfer," and "transformation," and develop a corresponding analytic framework. We apply the framework to analyze two meetings of a project that aims to develop interdisciplinary science assessment items. The results illustrate that the framework can help interpret the interdisciplinary meeting dynamics and patterns. Our coding process and results also suggest that these IRC processes can be further examined in terms of interconnected sub-processes. We also discuss the implications of using the framework in conceptualizing, practicing, and researching interdisciplinary learning and teaching in science education.

AB  - In response to an invitation to integrate science and art pedagogy, science and dance students enrolled in specific disciplinary courses, collaboratively produced choreography based on scientific principles. This paper reports students' experience of this process. Science students reported an increased understanding of concepts, while dance students found inspiration for choreography within scientific concepts. Tensions and misconceptions were evident in the process with respect to disciplinary language, the notion of scientific thought, and the level of physical awareness. The relationship between movement and forms of knowledge production in science was investigated as well. The paper ends with recommendations for future classes.

AB  - The 'Future of Jobs' report from the World Economic Forum highlights that creativity is one of the most important skills needed by the workforce. One way of enhancing the creativity of students undertaking STEM subjects is by taking inspiration from design disciplines. The product design curriculum has creativity at its heart and follows a product oriented learning strategy, integrating ideas from the humanities and sciences, mixing theory and practice. The curriculum is structured to support multidisciplinary collaboration between students from different courses to bring in new ideas, perspectives and skills. Students are encouraged to explore new ideas, materials and technologies through play and experimentation. Teaching is undertaken in a studio environment rather than a lecture hall, enabling group discussions and practical activities to take place as part of teaching sessions. If ideas from the world of design are integrated into the STEM curricula, perhaps student creativity and engagement will improve?

AB  - Many undergraduate students will experience being taught by graduate teaching assistants (GTAs); therefore, focusing on GTA pedagogy is in the best interest of the students and university as a whole. Based on a Masters of Arts in Teaching program, a 5-week intensive summer training session for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) GTAs was created by an interdisciplinary group of faculty. This study investigates how the intensive summer program can improve STEM GTA pedagogy by revealing STEM GTAs' beliefs about their role as a teaching assistant. Understanding what GTAs believe about their role will provide insight as to how to better prepare GTAs and, hence, help to improve STEM undergraduate education. The results of the study showed that GTAs' beliefs on teaching were initially more narrow in scope and then shifted to a greater understanding of the role of "teacher" in the classroom. Additionally, skills that helped GTAs with their pedagogy reportedly helped the GTAs as graduate students as well. These findings are insightful as we continue to learn how to prepare and train STEM GTAs.

AB  - Microfabrication is a critical area to many branches of science and engineering. However, to many students accustomed to seeing transistors as things that come in a lab kit, it is an obscure subtopic of their discipline. Beginning in 2009, the authors undertook a broad multidisciplinary approach to bring microfabrication into all aspects of the Binghamton University science and engineering curriculum. This program was coupled with a comprehensive assessment activity to evaluate the program's effectiveness and continuously improve it year by year. This paper reports the details of the implementation process, the techniques that were found to bring a hands-on experience to large classes, and the lessons learned from the assessments of this program to make this topic a mainstream part of engineering and science education.

AB  - At the onset of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global pandemic, our interdisciplinary team hypothesized that a mathematical misconception--whole number bias (WNB)--contributed to beliefs that COVID-19 was less fatal than the flu. We created a brief online educational intervention for adults, leveraging evidence-based cognitive science research, to promote accurate understanding of rational numbers related to COVID-19. Participants from a Qualtrics panel (N = 1,297; 75% White) were randomly assigned to an intervention or control condition, solved health-related math problems, and subsequently completed 10 days of daily diaries in which health cognitions and affect were assessed. Participants who engaged with the intervention, relative to those in the control condition, were more accurate and less likely to explicitly mention WNB errors in their strategy reports as they solved COVID-19-related math problems. Math anxiety was positively associated with risk perceptions, worry, and negative affect immediately after the intervention and across the daily diaries. These results extend the benefits of worked examples in a practically relevant domain. Ameliorating WNB errors could not only help people think more accurately about COVID-19 statistics expressed as rational numbers, but also about novel future health crises, or any other context that involves information expressed as rational numbers.

AB  - We present an inquiry-based, aquatic science professional development (PD) for upper-elementary, middle, and high school teachers and examine changes in student outcomes in light of participating teachers' characteristics and the grade band of the students. Our study lends support to the assertion that inquiry- and content-focused PD, paired with classroom implementation, can effectively improve student learning. Our findings indicate that students improved in their nature of science (NOS) and aquatic science content knowledge and that these changes depended in some ways on the participating teachers' characteristics and adherence to the program. The students' improvements were amplified when their teachers adhered more closely to the PD activities during their classroom implementation. The teachers' previous science PD experience and pre-PD understanding of inquiry-based teaching also explained some of the variability in student growth. In both NOS and content, students of teachers with less prior science-PD experience benefited more. Grade band also explained variation in student outcomes through interactions with teacher-characteristic variables. In high school, students of teachers with lower pre-PD inquiry knowledge appeared to learn more about NOS. Our results suggest that inquiry and content training through PD may minimize disparities in teaching due to inexperience and lack of expertise. Our study also demonstrates the value of PD that teaches a flexible approach to inquiry and focuses on underrepresented, interdisciplinary content areas, like aquatic science.

AB  - In a collaboration between the University of North Florida College of Education and Human Services and Sandalwood High School in Duval County, Florida, social studies and science education professors and a science teacher worked together to develop student understanding about the limited use of diesel-fueled cars in the United States when compared to the countries of Europe. On the basis of discussions with a Sandalwood science faculty member and calls for subject matter integration from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Research Council, the National Science Teachers Association, and the National Council on the Social Studies, we developed a collaborative teaching experience to both enhance high school science instruction and build stronger professional connections between college and high school faculty. Through this instruction, high school chemistry students examined the costs and benefits of using diesel vehicles and used this analysis to explain the differences between countries. This article illustrates conceptual planning processes used in developing inquiry-based classroom activities within a standards-based curriculum.

AB  - This article presents case study findings about undeclared student experiences in a two-and-a-half-year interdisciplinary learning-living program that integrates the arts, humanities, and social science disciplines. The study examined how the program helped students make informed decisions about academic majors and vocational choices. Participants were a cohort of juniors who had begun the program as first-year undeclared (non-major) students, and who were interviewed one month after program completion. Findings revealed the program developed students' recognition of curricular connections and thereby positioned undeclared students for increased academic and vocational clarity. Findings also revealed the program contributed to participants' overall student development resulting from engagement in a tight-knit, intellectual learning-living community.

AB  - This paper gives four examples of the use of short speculative fiction for teaching different aspects of information privacy. Information privacy is multi-faceted; as an area of study it intersects with a number of fields. A non-exhaustive list could include: law, information systems, decision science, marketing, management, philosophy, psychology, and sociology. The multi-disciplinary character of information privacy poses a challenge to teaching about it. Although using legal cases for teaching about privacy is valuable, the cases often involve disagreeable characters resulting in a distraction from the underlying privacy issue. In contrast, speculative fiction can present a privacy problem in a relatable context with a more agreeable set of characters. Students can imagine themselves in situations similar to those of characters in a short narrative through cognitive processes of transportation (by becoming immersed in the action) and identification (finding the characters familiar and sympathetic). I give four examples (four short stories) where I have used speculative fiction to teach some different aspect pertaining to information privacy. For each example, there is a plot synopsis, some suggested assignment with possible discussion questions, and an analysis of the key points within the fictional work and how they relate to key issues relevant to information privacy. The four fictional pieces are: Business as Usual by Pat Cadigan, Scroogled by Cory Doctorow, The Perfect Match by Ken Liu, and Water by Ramez Naam.

AB  - This study reported the results of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analyses on 13 competing structural models on the inter-relationships among academic achievement and student- and course-related attributes. The samples were Malaysian pre-university students enrolled in two STEM courses (biology, n = 326; mathematics, n = 339; biology only, n = 92; mathematics only, n = 105; biology and mathematics, n = 234). For both courses, interdisciplinary cross-validation was observed for four models which hypothesized that current academic achievement could be predicted (1) directly by prior academic achievement (high school grades) and student approaches to learning (SAL), and (2) directly and/or indirectly by personality, intrinsic motivation and course experience (CE). For at least one course, all constructs (except intrinsic motivation, clear goals and standards, openness and conscientiousness) significantly and directly predicted current academic achievement. The strongest predictor of current academic achievement was prior (high school) academic achievement, with the largest effect sizes, followed by SAL. Current academic achievement was significantly and positively predicted by all CE constructs (except clear goals and standards) for only mathematics, with moderate and large effect sizes. Only one personality construct (neuroticism) significantly and moderately predicted current academic achievement (biology). SAL partially mediated relationships between current academic achievement with workload appropriateness, assessment for understanding and neuroticism for at least one course. Generally, the strongest predictors of SAL were assessment for understanding, workload appropriateness and intrinsic motivation. Multigroup invariance analysis revealed differences in five hypothesized paths, attributable almost entirely to significant paths found in mathematics but not biology (prior [high school] to current academic achievement, conscientiousness to surface approach to learning, intrinsic motivation to deep and surface approaches to learning). Therefore, this study is the first to report course-nuanced differences in the presence of reduced interpersonal differences. The implications of this study is that, besides the importance of prior high academic achievement which might not be within educators' control, factors in the teaching--learning ecosystem within educators' control which influence current academic achievement are strongly mediated by SAL, which is itself influenced most by assessment, workload and intrinsic motivation.

AB  - Background: Integrated STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education is crucial for teacher preparation programs that provide effective teaching in an interdisciplinary approach to teacher training. There is a need for a novel program to train pre-and in-service STEM teachers as STEM leaders who's moving a passive STEM teacher into an active STEM leader in their schools. The professional development of new STEM leaders in schools is critical so that the benchmarks of a new school program called STEM-LPP can be met. This program is intended to help develop existing STEM teachers to become more experienced and innovative in their usage of interdisciplinary ideas and team-working. An iSTEM approach (Rosicka, 2016) is more than just the skills, competencies, and knowledge of the four (STEM) domains. Methods: A content analysis method was conducted by benchmarking the top five university master programs and academic committee meetings. The survey method was applied to design a new STEM preparation program for pre-and in-service teachers. This paper reports the benchmark collection and evaluation as a form of meta-analysis by academic meeting processes and views from existing STEM teachers from various schools how do the top five university master programs factor into your considerations? Data was collected by benchmarking and investigating STEM frameworks, models, and principles called benchmarks. Data were discussed and evaluated with academic meeting members, including two experts, two specialists in the department of curriculum development, three STEM teachers, three stakeholders, three staff professors, and two STEM master students from Suleyman Demirel University located in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Besides, 14 STEM teachers participated in evaluating in various schools. Findings: benchmarks and obtained courses were correlated to determine the relations. Results: The six benchmarks--educational leadership, engineering/project design and integration, technology integration, multiple discipline integration, research-oriented instruction, and practice/experience-based teaching, were determined. Under these benchmarks, courses, competencies, and learning outcomes were also generated. The developing process of STEM-LPP was also confirmed by analyzing the findings from top university master programs with academic meeting studies and STEM teachers' evaluations. The correlations among the benchmarks and between benchmarks and courses were shown to have a strong correlation and their sufficiency for the criteria of LPP was displayed in the data. Implications: This type of teacher preparation program has two crucial purposes--at first, providing a way of determining benchmarks during the formation of the teacher preparation program for STEM education program designers and developers. Secondly, it was informative on integrating STEM disciplines with STEM student projects and activity work to develop teachers' knowledge and skills. This study contributed to the construction of teacher preparation programs in universities and assisted STEM teachers in developing their teaching skills in the educational sphere. In future, such studies should be re-analyzed and evaluated by a large sample size of STEM teachers, partners, and other contributors.

AB  - The emphasis on STEM disciplines in schools has caused advocates for art education to propose the addition of the arts to the study of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, transforming STEM into STEAM. However, it is important that the larger purposes of art and education that have traditionally been embraced by the liberal arts are not lost in STEAM education and that the arts are not reduced to a role of cognitive enhancer for other STEM subjects. STEAM education is closely linked to ideas and research about arts integration and is often implemented using the methods of 'design thinking'. The use of design thinking as a method for interdisciplinary collaboration has many connections to how STEAM education is practised in schools. Research describing arts integration is also relevant to how art is included in STEAM education. This article describes rationales for STEAM education and how the work of contemporary artists provides generative examples of how STEAM education might be put into practice. Both the affordances and limitations of STEAM education are explored. [Translation from English by Mercè Rius.]

AB  - In the research, the purpose was to implement and evaluate an interdisciplinary curriculum that aimed at developing social sciences pre-service teachers' understanding and knowledge about the nature of science. This research was based on case study design. In order to collect the research data, the methods of observation, interview and document analysis were used. For the analysis of the data, the inductive content analysis approach was applied. The results of the analysis demonstrated that the curriculum implemented had positive influence on the pre-service teachers' understanding and knowledge about the nature of science. In this respect, it was found that the curriculum helped develop the participants' lack of skills and knowledge about the subjects related to "nature of scientific models, nature of observations and values guiding scientists in their work and social lives" included in the content of nature of science. In addition, it was revealed that the pre-service teachers' lack of readiness made the implementation process difficult.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to raise awareness of problem-based learning (PBL) and more specifically the problem analysis as a set of learning principles and practices offering the potential to bridge higher education to the complexities and uncertainties of science and society. Literature on PBL often argues that PBL supports education aimed at developing students' competences in problem-solving. However, as we increasingly face complex and wicked problems, we cannot assume that problems can be solved based on existing methods and theories; the focus needs to shift from problem-solving to problem analysis and complexity navigation. This paper describes and discusses the need to focus on authenticity, exemplarity, and interdisciplinary as key educational concepts when developing competencies to analyze complex problems. In addressing these key concepts, the paper touches upon the didactical implications of problem analysis as the most important competence to achieve during higher education and as essential when moving beyond education and into a complex world where problems are always interrelated, as reflected in the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - With increased focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and STEAM, educators are looking for ways to integrate disciplines. Planning content around a common theme is an avenue for an interdisciplinary approach to teaching and learning in the middle grades. Middle grade educators must find ways to relate content to their students in meaningful ways. Cross-curricular integration of content areas is one way to do that. Providing opportunities for students to explore topics connected across content areas strengthens students' understanding and investigation of real-life applications. Middle-level students require ongoing, concrete, experiential learning in order to develop intellectually (AMLE, 2010) and an integrated curriculum that is more compatible with the way their brains work (Vars, 2001). Over 60 years of studies provide evidence that middle-level students perform better with an interdisciplinary or integrated curriculum than with departmentalized programs (Irvin, 1997). Historically, educators such as John Dewey, Howard Gardener, and Benjamin Bloom have emphasized the value of contextual learning. An integrated curriculum can provide students meaningful opportunities to connect learning in and out of school (Beane, 1997; Vars, 2001). Integration promotes the relevance of classroom learning by making the curriculum more meaningful to students' lives (Hargreaves & Moore, 2000). Implementing interdisciplinary unit planning will encourage teachers to move beyond their content areas and provide opportunities to create curriculum more relevant to adolescents (Stolle & Frambaugh-Kritzer, 2014). When teachers work together on teams to coordinate and integrate instruction, teaching and learning outcomes improve (Mertens & Flowers, 2003). The article examines the Center of Excellence in Middle-level Interdisciplinary Strategies for Teaching (CEMIST) which was established to develop and model state-of-the-art teacher training programs with an emphasis on interdisciplinary curriculum development and implementation at the middle school level. A partnership between CE-MIST, three middle schools, and the Aiken Writing Project resulted in the development of twenty-six Traveling Interdisciplinary Literacy Trunks (TILTs). The trunks' introduction was used as the catalyst to connect planning by teachers with activities for students. Ongoing, year-long professional development sessions built on the theme of interdisciplinary strategies for teaching and allowed grade level teachers focused time to collaborate in horizontal planning teams. The CE-MIST literacy trunks align standards from two or more content areas, are framed by essential questions, and are anchored by writing activities that are connected to learning goals. The trunks' unit plans include activities that allow for active student engagement and are easily adapted for students with different backgrounds and abilities.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is vital for success in numerous domains. However, the nature, definition, and scope of CT are ill-defined, and research on how best to develop CT is very limited. This study focused on how thinking styles and STEM attitudes have effects on computational thinking. Using a proportionate stratified random sampling procedure, 1195 students from two universities were surveyed. A structural equation modeling analysis showed that students' thinking styles and STEM attitudes directly predicted their computational thinking skills and that thinking styles mediated the relationship between STEM attitudes and computational thinking skills. Thinking styles and STEM attitudes are strong predictors of CT skills. Based on the results, we recommended that the conceptualization of CT be broadened to reflect its trans-disciplinary nature within the context of STEM education. This study adds to the limited theoretical understanding of CT and CT-predictors in higher education, which has been studied much less than in K-12 education.

AB  - Climate change as an instructional topic in K-12 schools is most frequently taught in the science classroom. However, it is a human issue requiring social as well as technological and scientific solutions. This study analyzes and evaluates a climate change curriculum implemented via an integrated social studies and language arts framework in a middle school classroom. The curriculum reflects collaboration between a private school, a climate education non-profit, and a government agency (NOAA). Following the first year of implementation, student surveys, teacher interviews, and classroom observations comprise the primary tools of data collection and evaluation. Based off these data, students demonstrate high levels of climate literacy, improvements in reading comprehension, and overall engagement with the topic. Teachers report successes and challenges of teaching the curriculum, and administrators offer opportunities for scaling and implementing the curriculum in other schools and contexts (including public schools). Findings from this study are relevant to climate change curriculum developers, researchers, and educators seeking to incorporate an interdisciplinary, socio-scientific approach to climate change education in their work.

AB  - While prior research has illustrated the strengths of collaborative teaching between sociology and English, less has examined the potential of cross-listed courses, instead largely focusing on how to bring writing instruction into the sociology classroom. Similarly, other work has explored the possible uses of literary examples "within" sociology lessons. We argue that a fully collaborative teaching model capitalizing on strengths from both sociology and English studies can be beneficial not only for students but also coteachers. Drawing from autoethnographic approaches, we reflect on our experience teaching a cross-listed sociology and English course in science fiction literature as well as the sociopolitical landscape that motivated our pedagogical decisions. We discuss our rationale for choosing the theme of the "alien" as "other" and the importance of low-stakes writing assignments. We offer practical ideas for integrating science fiction into sociology classes and provide insights for anyone thinking about cross-listed classes on any topic.

AB  - This article analyses Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in chemistry by reviewing existing challenges and future possibilities on the levels of the teacher and the student. Pedagogical frameworks that are found eligible in practice are reviewed. Lesson themes that are suitable for implementing socioscientific issues (SSI) related to ESD into basic chemistry education at schools are discussed. Based on this analysis, three new demonstrative pedagogical models for ESD in chemistry are presented to help guide the work of teachers. The models draw on an interdisciplinary reading of research in the field of SSI-based science education, sustainability science, green chemistry and environmental education. The current state of ESD in Finnish chemistry education is used as an example case throughout the article. Two tasks where future development is required were recognised. The first task concerns supporting chemistry teachers in overcoming the challenges with SSI and ESD they face in their work. The second task is to ensure that students are more often provided with more relevant and flexible chemistry content and studying methods.

AB  - Natural sciences can be difficult to grasp because physical and chemical phenomena can take place across time and length scales that are beyond the reach of human perception. This problem is particularly true for students attempting to learn about microfluidics, a discipline that involves intricate engineering methods and fluid phenomena that are unintuitive and unique to the microscopic scale. New learning paradigms that combine established principles from the learning sciences and mixed reality (MR) technologies may facilitate the understanding of microfluidics and help connect the experimental methods to the underlying physical and chemical processes. Yet only a few studies have implemented learning sciences principles into the design of MR experiences for university laboratory courses. We thus created AL"ETH"A, an interactive and immersive MR learning platform to help students learn about microfluidics and microfabrication techniques. We designed AL"ETH"A to include scaffolding, gamification, control-of-variables, and multimodal representation strategies that are known to enhance intuition building and learning. We hypothesized that MR will enhance student understanding of microfluidics and microfabrication and help them build intuitions about the processes involved at that scale. To test whether AL"ETH"A improved affective learning outcomes, we employed quizzes and surveys and compared the performance of students that participated in the course with MR to that of a cohort using traditional paper protocols. Overall, we measured a greater building of intuition and engagement for MR students. Our new learning platform provides a useful and practical example of how MR can be implemented to learn challenging interdisciplinary topics such as microfluidics.

AB  - Universities of applied sciences in Finland are higher education institutions with emphasis on practical working life skills and strong links with working life. Students typically study in field-specific groups where they receive language and communication instruction alongside their professional courses. The development of language and communication studies is the chief responsibility of "JAMK Language Centre" at "JAMK University of Applied Sciences." To create flexibility in language and communication teaching and to improve language and communication teachers' working practices, a two-year project was started at "JAMK Language Centre" in autumn 2017. In the experiment, JAMK´s students in Finnish degree programs began studying languages and communication in multidisciplinary groups instead of field-specific groups. There were administrative reasons as well as a pedagogical development aims behind the change. Two Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats (SWOT) analyses have been performed to find out about the experiences of the "JAMK Language Centre" staff members regarding the change. So far the experiment has been both challenging and rewarding and it continues until 2019 when the final results can be seen. The aim of this article is to present the first phase of the experimental project highlighting the experiences of the "JAMK Language Centre" staff.

AB  - When a pandemic outbreak occurs, it seems logical that related scientific production should increase substantially; however, it is important to recognize its interdisciplinary usefulness to find a solution to the problem. The main aim of this research is to analyse the main keywords of the scientific research about COVID-19, by subject area. To discover the influence of certain terms and their transferability, synergies, and future trends, a cluster analysis of the keywords was performed. The results show that Health Sciences dominate the publications with 88.23% of the total volume. As expected, the largest volume of research was dedicated to medical aspects of the disease, like experimental treatments, its physiopathology, or its respiratory syndrome. However, other fields, like Social Sciences (6.07%), Technology (2.68%), Physical Sciences (1.95%), and Arts and Humanities (1.08%), also played an important role in research on COVID-19.

AB  - In this field report from a STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) study abroad programme, the author describes how students came to see collaboration -- a key component of arts practice -- as a buzzword, rather than a set of specific, tested, vital practices productive to a wide range of situations. The author argues that the arts have much to offer as a 'mobile critical paradigm' (Gallagher, Kathleen, and Barry Freedman, eds. 2016. "In Defence of Theatre: Aesthetic Practices and Social Interventions." Toronto: University of Toronto Press), particularly in interdisciplinary situations, but only if educators are exacting and purposeful as they define and employ collaboration as one of the arts' most enduring lessons.

AB  - The first educational goal within scientific subjects is to acquire a sense of scientific literacy. In science lessons, methods of scientific inquiry provide the tools to achieve this. In this study, we based scientific inquiry on the SDDS-Model according to Klahr (2002). It is divided into three subareas: Search Hypothesis Space, Test Hypothesis, and Evaluate Hypothesis. A multiple-choice test, the NAW-test, was used to examine the extent to which the acquisition of competencies is promoted by attending Profile Classes. In contrast to common practice in Germany, scientific Profile Classes take an interdisciplinary approach to scientific subjects, with the aim to promote the acquisition of scientific competencies. For this purpose, Profile Class students (N=84) at two schools were questioned over the course of a school year at three different test times. Results show that competencies increase over time. A gender difference was not observed.

AB  - The aim of this study is to identify the faults in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education and to provide an approach to how these deficiencies can be eliminated. The STEM approach can provide students with an interdisciplinary point of view to gain creativity, critical thinking, high-level skills of thinking and problem-solving. STEM abbreviation consists of the initials of the words 'Science', 'Technology', 'Engineering' and 'Mathematics'. Conventional educational systems dictate student to learn specific topics separately and expect from them to make these knowledge and experience useful, functional in their life. In this research, a qualitative research method was used. This study was performed by using document analysis method. A novel, integrated education system called as the STEM is investigated with its methodology and problems in application outcoming so far. The importance of such an integrated programme is highlighted and some remedies to create an effective integrated education programme are emphasised.

AB  - Bioengineering represents an interdisciplinary field with the potential to engage young learners in science inquiry and engineering design in the context of real-world challenges. Although children encounter bioengineered products and solutions in their everyday lives, they are not introduced to bioengineering until much later in school, after stereotype threats about STEM engagement have crystallized. The purpose of this paper is to present an experimental tangible tool called CRISPEE and evidence from an intervention with young children who explored CRISPEE in the context of an informal bioengineering curriculum. In this design study, 25 children aged 4-7 years engaged in a 9-h workshop designed to introduce them to foundational bioengineering concepts of gene editing, engineering design, and bioethics. Children's attitudes and content knowledge about life science, engineering, and bioengineering were assessed pre- and post-interventions. Mixed quantitative and qualitative results show that most children entered the intervention with pre-existing ideas about genes and attitudes about engineering and science. Post intervention, children demonstrated increased positive STEM attitudes and content knowledge, especially in the area of science inquiry, and also demonstrated an emerging curiosity about the purpose and effectiveness of bioengineering work, including bioethics. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Undergraduate research experiences (UREs) that include interdisciplinary, engagement-oriented, and collaborative experiences have the potential to benefit students in unique ways. Through these innovative experiences, students are able to see the social impact and importance of their work--a factor known to strengthen the academic and career persistence of students traditionally underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. In the present study, students assumed simultaneous roles as students, interdisciplinary researchers, and community liaisons as they facilitated a community-engaged participatory research project. Using interpretive phenomenological analysis, we explore students' evolving perspectives of knowledge generation and social change processes before, during, and after the URE. Findings emphasize participants' altered views of the respective roles of academic researchers and community members in generating knowledge, the value of interdisciplinary research, and the potential of innovative UREs to foster positive change--in academic and community contexts.

AB  - Drawing on the experience of training graduate students and researchers in qualitative and mixed-methods analysis since the mid-1990s, the authors reflect on the evolution of a multidisciplinary graduate course developed in a Canadian university since 2007. The hands-on/hands-off course design based on the use of NVivo was developed in parallel with a conceptual and reflexive position on methodology and multidisciplinarity in the context of an action research supported by their institution. This article exposes the four basic components of the course and the constructivist assessment model based on a term-long team analysis of original data created specifically for this purpose. The balance between collective and individual work, in-class and online exchanges, hands-on experience with the software and hands-off reflection is described and compared to recent pedagogical literature on the subject. The interest of this blended approach in fostering the development of the methodological expertise expected from researchers and graduate students, as well as the main issues and challenges facing this type of training in a research environment characterised by new approaches and tools, are discussed.

AB  - The advent of integrated multidisciplinary research has given rise to some of the most important breakthroughs of our time, but has also set significant challenges to the current educational paradigm. Current academic education often limits cross-discipline discussion, depends on close-ended problems, and restricts utilization of interdisciplinary methods. "Advanced Methods in Mathematical Programming" is a new course developed at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. We used MATLAB as the course platform, exploiting the software's high levels of abstraction and modularity to teach network analysis, signal processing, module-oriented design, and mathematical modeling to students of all disciplines. Enrollment included students from different disciplines ranging from computer science to psychology. In their final projects, students presented novel ways of approaching classic disciplinary problems.

AB  - This book contains the full text of papers and posters presented at the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2019), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (WIARS). Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2019 received 547 submissions, from more than 50 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. The conference accepted for presentation 135 submissions (25% acceptance rate), from which, 114 submissions are published in full text in these volumes. The conference also includes a keynote presentation from an internationally distinguished researcher, Prof. Dr. Denise Whitelock, Professor of Technology Enhanced Assessment and Learning, Institute of Educational Technology, The Open University, UK, to whom we express our most gratitude. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. To develop the conference program, we have chosen four main broad-ranging categories, which also covers different interest areas: (1) In TEACHERS AND STUDENTS: Teachers and Staff training and education; Educational quality and standards; Curriculum and Pedagogy; Vocational education and Counseling; Ubiquitous and lifelong learning; Training programs and professional guidance; Teaching and learning relationship; Student affairs (learning, experiences and diversity; Extra-curricular activities; Assessment and measurements in Education. (2) In PROJECTS AND TRENDS: Pedagogic innovations; Challenges and transformations in Education; Technology in teaching and learning; Distance Education and eLearning; Global and sustainable developments for Education; New learning and teaching models; Multicultural and (inter)cultural communications; Inclusive and Special Education; Rural and indigenous Education; Educational projects. (3) In TEACHING AND LEARNING: Critical Thinking; Educational foundations; Research and development methodologies; Early childhood and Primary Education; Secondary Education; Higher Education; Science and technology Education; Literacy, languages and Linguistics (TESL/TEFL); Health Education; Religious Education; Sports Education. (4) In ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES: Educational policy and leadership; Human Resources development; Educational environment; Business, Administration, and Management in Education; Economics in Education; Institutional accreditations and rankings; International Education and Exchange programs; Equity, social justice and social change; Ethics and values; Organizational learning and change, Corporate Education. This is the Volume II of the book "Education and New Developments 2019" and it contains the results of the research and developments conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to promote growth in research methods intimately related to teaching, learning and applications in Education nowadays. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, who will extend our view in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues, by sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This second volume focus in the main areas of TEACHING AND LEARNING and ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES. We would like to express thanks to all the authors and participants, the members of the academic scientific committee, and of course, to our organizing and administration team for making and putting this conference together. [For Volume I, see ED604965. This document contains the proceedings of END 2019: International Conference on Education and New Developments (Porto, Portugal, June 22-24, 2019).]

AB  - Integrating knowledge across disciplines has been shown to be a challenging, and yet it is a necessary skill that university students need to develop. Students who are able to connect different concepts, perspectives, and angles of a given topic are generally more engaged and have better understanding. However, designing lesson plans or assignments that integrate knowledge across disciplines is a challenge to most instructors. This paper describes our effort to provide an interdisciplinary and independent assignment that couples topics from a Physical Chemistry course with skills taught in an Introductory Computing course. It was shown that such an interdisciplinary assignment, though done independently, can help to boost students' learning. However, it helps only in the understanding of certain aspects of the topics. We present the design of the assignment and the lessons learned for other instructors willing to adopt this kind of interdisciplinary approach.

AB  - Current cutting-edge biomedical investigation requires that the researcher have an operational understanding of several diverse disciplines. Biocatalysis is a field of science that operates at the crossroads of organic chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, and molecular biology, and provides an excellent model for interdisciplinary research. We have developed an inquiry-based module that uses the mutagenesis of the yeast reductase, YDL124w, to study the bioorganic synthesis of the taxol side-chain, a pharmacologically important molecule. Using related structures, students identify regions they think will affect enzyme stereoselective, design and generate site-specific mutants, and then characterize the effect of these changes on enzyme activity. This laboratory activity gives our students experience, working in a scientific discipline outside of biology and exposes them to techniques and equipment they do not normally work with in a molecular biology course. These inter-disciplinary experiences not only show the relevance of other sciences to biology, but also give our students the ability to communicate more effectively with scientists outside their discipline.

AB  - This article explores the impact of a science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) Access module on the progression of students to undergraduate Science. Drawing on the Widening Participation (WP) literature, this research investigated the experience of adult learners from disadvantaged backgrounds taking their first steps into higher education (HE). A mixed methods institutional case study was conducted, drawing on extensive survey data and interviews with students and tutors. Key findings included: enhanced student understanding of how to use tutor support; improvement in the skills and confidence of students in relation to maths, as a result of an embedded interdisciplinary curriculum; and an uplift in student study skills. This study was undertaken in a distance learning context, addressing issues in entry-level STEM, but the conclusions are applicable to other HE settings.

AB  - Background: Sustainable school buildings hold much promise to reducing operating costs, improve occupant well-being and, ultimately, teacher and student performance. However, there is a scarcity of evidence on the effects of sustainable school buildings on health and performance indicators. We sought to create a framework for a multidisciplinary research agenda that links school facilities, health, and educational outcomes. Methods: We conducted a non-systematic review of peer review publications, government documents, organizational documents, and school climate measurement instruments. Results: We found that studies on the impact of physical environmental factors (air, lighting, and thermal comfort) on health and occupant performance are largely independent of research on the social climate. The current literature precludes the formation of understanding the causal relation among school facilities, social climate, occupant health, and occupant performance. Conclusions: Given the average age of current school facilities in the United States, construction of new school facilities or retrofits of older facilities will be a major infrastructure investment for many municipalities over the next several decades. Multidisciplinary research that seeks to understand the impact of sustainable design on the health and performance of occupants will need to include both an environmental science and social science perspective to inform best practices and quantification of benefits that go beyond general measures of costs savings from energy efficiencies.

AB  - Maintaining an active research agenda while teaching full-time at a community college can be daunting, but with institutional support for scholarly research by way of course release it is possible. This personal reflection offers up evidence of institutional support from a variety of sources within the public university system of New York City, the City University of New York (CUNY), including that from LaGuardia Community College itself, senior colleges, NEH Grants, and contractually mandated course release by the faculty and staff union, PSC-CUNY. This reflection does not offer a comprehensive account of the working conditions of community colleges across the United States in general. I close my reflection with a brief description of how teaching at LaGuardia Community College has transformed by teaching and research from disciplinary to interdisciplinary. I also thank APSA's Committee on the Status of Community Colleges in the Profession for including and highlighting community college political science professors' contributions as an important part of the national organization.

AB  - Assessment and feedback are common sources of student dissatisfaction within higher education, and employers have shown dissatisfaction with graduates' communication skills. Authentic assessment, containing 'real-world' context and student collaboration, provides a means to address both issues simultaneously. We discuss how we used authentic assessment within a biological sciences degree programme, replacing an individually written essay coursework assignment with learner-generated podcasts. We outline our implementation strategy in line with existing theory on learner-generated digital media, assessment for learning and self-regulated learning. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of survey data (2020 and 2021) indicate students prefer podcast assignments over traditional essay coursework, perceiving them to be more enjoyable, authentic, allowing for greater creativity, and better for building their confidence as communicators. Podcasting as an assessment may have a positive influence on knowledge retention and promote deep learning too. Our assessment design provides opportunities for community building, formative peer review and enhancing assessment literacy, while also being flexible enough to be used across any discipline of study and/or as an inter-disciplinary assessment.

AB  - We describe a pair of fully integrated courses designed to teach biology to non-majors in a manner that connects authentically to the liberal arts. The co-taught courses were organized around the question: What does it mean to be human? Students investigated this question in the context of three topics: dis/ability, race, and sex and gender. In addition, a lab program was integrated in the courses to enhance student understanding of the scientific process and to underscore the necessity of evidence to support all claims and assertions. We also implemented a weekly afterschool science club with children from the Pomerleau Boys and Girls Club. Students, many of whom were science averse prior to taking these courses, thrived. Based on the quality of their writing and class discussion, it was clear that students became increasingly adept at connecting biology to other ways of knowing and to larger issues in their lives. Similarly, they became more skillful at "doing" science in laboratory. Not only did students design and implement interesting experiments, they effectively guided children in their own explorations.

AB  - In 2011, Sonoma State University developed a STEM first-year experience (supported by NSF STEP grant 1068445) that combines general education requirements in mathematics, biology, and critical thinking. The mathematics content includes topics from precalculus and elementary statistics, with a particular focus on using functions and modeling with mathematics, and serves as an alternative pathway to calculus. In this article, we share sample activities and student work to describe the philosophy, pedagogy, and mathematics content of the course. We also share pre- and post-survey results of student attitudes towards math, and data on student achievement in subsequent classes and persistence in pursuing STEM degrees. Coming up on its 8th iteration, the course serves 60 incoming freshmen each year and has become an integral part of the School of Science and Technology's recruitment and retention efforts.

AB  - Teachers involved in the implementation of a curriculum innovation can be prepared for this task through a professional development program. In this paper, we describe essential characteristics (identified empirically and theoretically) for such a professional development program that promotes the acquisition of competences by these teachers. The innovation deals with the introduction of modules from a new multidisciplinary subject, in which elements from physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and physical geography are integrated. A 3-step approach was used to identify the essential characteristics: (a) evidence from classroom practice, (b) characteristics of the new subject, and (c) theoretical and empirical evidence from curriculum implementation studies. Analysis of the data showed that 5 characteristics need particular attention in a professional development program.

AB  - Recent education policy designed to promote arts education tends to focus on how such curriculum supports "skills for innovation" required for success in the global economy. Emphasis on the transfer of arts-based learning to professional innovation and achievement, a dynamic that is difficult to determine, can undermine the value of teaching the arts for their own sake. Three professors at the State University of New York at New Paltz discuss curriculum they developed to take advantage of museum learning opportunities that promote critical thinking, foster innovation, support course content, and increase students' sense of citizenship and belonging. Jennifer Waldo, a professor of Biology, Dennis Doherty, a professor of English and Creative Writing, and Sarah Wyman, a professor of 20th century Comparative Literature, use their campus museum as an applied learning environment where they facilitate interdisciplinary, experiential educational activities that develop student agency and encourage imaginative inquiry. The professors comment on their curriculum, their cross-disciplinary conversations, student reactions, and indicators of transfer. In addition, they present a strategy for assessing student-learning outcomes within a context that values the visual arts as fundamental to liberal arts and sciences education.

AB  - Interdisciplinary teaching is a teaching method that is not as easy as other teaching methods to integrate into the everyday school schedule. This paper serves as an example and gives explanations on how this didactic approach can be applied. The lessons described were conducted successfully with a Year 11 class at a secondary school in which the subjects of physical education and biology were combined. Based on the performance of three athletic disciplines, namely sprinting, javelin throwing, and high jumping, the biological background, such as the identity and relationships of the muscles involved was discussed and elaborated on. As the curriculum for biology requires, the students were introduced to systems that explore biological phenomena by studying the relationships between structure and function. By combining the biological background with physical education, the students were able to evaluate their movement skills and learn more about concepts and strategies to perform their physical activities competently (consistent with ACARA, 2017a).

AB  - Automated writing evaluation (AWE) systems are developed based on interdisciplinary research and technological advances such as natural language processing, computer sciences, and latent semantic analysis. Despite a steady increase in research publications in this area, the results of AWE investigations are often mixed, and their validity may be questionable. To yield a deeper understanding of the validity of AWE systems, we conducted a systematic review of the empirical AWE research. Using Scopus, we identified 105 published papers on AWE scoring systems and coded them within an argument-based validation framework. The major findings are: (i) AWE scoring research had a rising trend, but was heterogeneous in terms of the language environments, ecological settings, and educational level; (ii) a disproportionate number of studies were carried out on each validity inference, with the evaluation inference receiving the most research attention, and the domain description inference being the neglected one, and (iii) most studies adopted quantitative methods and yielded positive results that backed each inference, while some studies also presented counterevidence. Lack of research on the domain description (i.e., the correspondence between the AWE systems and real-life writing tasks) combined with the heterogeneous contexts indicated that construct representation in the AWE scoring field needs extensive investigation. Implications and directions for future research are also discussed.

AB  - Chemistry has become increasingly multidisciplinary. Starting in middle school and high school, however, the different disciplines are taught as distinct subjects and little effort is made to emphasize overlapping concepts. Development of innovative approaches to teaching science through the integration of technology is needed to provide students with a better learning experience that embraces multiple disciplines. Here, we describe an outreach and mentoring program between college and 7th grade students to: (i) encourage 7th grade students to pursue science and engineering degrees; (ii) provide the college students with mentoring experience; and (iii) assist teachers with state-of-the-art educational tools that enhance their teaching.

AB  - Science is a great time to focus on language development in the elementary classroom. Participation in science requires that students use language to present claims, engage in argumentation, and partake in science and engineering process skills. Over the years, the authors have noted the importance of vocabulary in students' ability to participate in the language of science. Research also notes a clear link between children's early experiences, including exposure to rich vocabulary, and academic success (Duncan et al. 2007). The authors decided to examine ways to effectively integrate vocabulary instruction in science and set out to develop a list of core principles to help guide a cross-curricular integration. The goal was to support student vocabulary development, which in turn would support the development of science language and the ability of all students to fully participate in science.

AB  - The importance of STEAM education in preparing students to deal with societal challenges is nowadays an international recommendation. We may find different perspectives concerning STEAM education and the integration of its disciplines. A possible pathway to achieve a balanced integration is through Engineering Design (ED), starting from problems of reality that enable the articulated mobilization of concepts from various disciplinary areas, promoting interdisciplinary where teamwork and context play a fundamental role. This article reports a study with primary preservice teachers (6-12 years old) that aims to analyze the learning displayed and the difficulties underlying the usage of ED in solving STEAM problems. The participants were 45 preservice teachers. We adopted a qualitative methodology, and data were collected through observation, documents, artifacts, and photos. The preliminary results show a very positive reaction of the participants to the experience of solving real context problems collaboratively and mobilizing mathematical and physical science concepts in an integrated way. We identified active engagement, persistence, and motivation in the creation of a model that fulfilled the requested conditions. Difficulties were evidenced in the identification of some concepts and the mobilization of adequate scientific language in the argumentation of decisions.

AB  - Recently, the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) has produced several internationalisation policies to develop their notion of "guroubaru-jinzai" (global human resources). However, a lack of clear direction regarding theories and approaches about how to achieve these initiatives has created a gap in the research. Therefore, this paper seeks to fill that gap by introducing an interdisciplinary approach towards creating a foreign language and intercultural development framework. A case study results suggest that the framework can be useful to encourage students' attitudes and perceptions of foreign language and intercultural development towards developing global human resources.

AB  - Educating for sustainability has been a key principle underpinning the primary/middle undergraduate teacher education programme at an Australian University for the past decade. Educating for sustainability seeks to provide knowledge and understanding of the physical, biological, and human world, and involves students making decisions about a range of ethical, social, environmental and economic issues, and acting upon them. This study (a part of the ongoing evaluation of our courses) focuses on pre-service teachers (PSTs) who have selected a minor in science and mathematics. Participatory and inclusive learning processes, transdisciplinary collaborations, experiential learning, and the use of local environment and community as learning resources as outlined by Sterling (2001) have formed the basis of much of our practice to develop PSTs' confidence and competence to teach science. This paper explores one pedagogical practice, environmental pledges which the preservice teachers undertook for 15 weeks. The focus is on the impact that undertaking an environmental pledge has had on the personal and professional lives of two groups, first, four cohorts of final-year science and mathematics pathway PSTs, and second, a small group of early-career teachers who had completed the course in previous years. Data have been collected from final-year science and mathematics students and early-career teachers using ethnographic methods to provide insight into their experiences of using the pledge.

AB  - As a newcomer, the philosophical basis of systems biology seems intuitive and appealing, the underlying philosophy being that the whole of a living system cannot be completely understood by the study of its individual parts. Yet answers to the questions "What is systems biology?" and "What constitutes a systems biology approach in 2016?" are somewhat more elusive. This seems to be due largely to the diversity of disciplines involved and the varying emphasis placed on the computational modeling and experimental aspects of systems biology. As such, the education of systems biology would benefit from multidisciplinary collaboration with both instructors and students from a range of disciplines within the same course. This essay is the personal reflection of a graduate student trying to get an introductory overview of the field of systems biology and some thoughts about effective education of systems biology.

AB  - Building content knowledge alongside the task of increasing literacy skills has become a goal for many elementary classrooms. Selecting and implementing texts for the literacy block that both increase content knowledge and develop students' literacy skills alongside increasing motivation for reading is a daunting task. The authors share a strategic approach for selecting texts called the quad text set framework. This framework involves first selecting a target text, which is a challenging content-related text, and then selecting easier texts, including visuals, to build background knowledge and a hook text to garner interest in the topic. The teacher then decides how to implement the texts to best support students' content learning. The authors describe considerations for selecting and ordering texts for interdisciplinary units to maximize content learning and literacy and provide examples of how to implement quad text sets related to math, science, and social studies.

AB  - Collective training systems are based on the cooperation of multiple public and private stakeholders in order to work. However, such cooperation is not self-sustaining and depends, for instance, on public policies, capable intermediary organisations and shared logics of action. In this conceptual paper, we first review the political economy literature on cooperation in collective skill formation and find that it has given insufficient attention to the systematic comparative analysis of cooperation at the decentralised level as well as the actual social practices of cooperation. The paper then develops a multidisciplinary analytical framework that allows future research to examine decentralised cooperation at the regional, sectoral and occupational levels more systematically. This framework is grounded in a synthesis of three strands of empirical research on vocational education and training, namely the comparative political economy literature on governance, corporatism and coordination, institutional labour and societal economics as well as the educational science literature.

AB  - The integrative approach of teaching Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) has been advocated as a pedagogical means to advance education for the 21st century. However, there is a lack of validated instruments that are theoretically grounded to account for the various forms of knowledge that teachers need in order to effectively implement STEM education. This study adopts the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework to develop the Technological Pedagogical STEM Knowledge Survey to assess teachers' self-efficacies of the proposed dimensions of knowledge. It also investigates the interrelationships of the four knowledge dimensions (i.e., technological pedagogical science knowledge [TPSK], technological pedagogical mathematics knowledge [TPMK], technological pedagogical engineering knowledge [TPEK] and integrative STEM) proposed in this paper. A total of 314 science, mathematics and technology teachers from China responded to the online survey. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated adequate validity and reliability of the survey for measuring teachers' self-efficacies for STEM from the TPACK perspective. The structural equational model indicates that the teachers' efficacies of integrating technology into science, mathematics and engineering subject predict their efficacy of integrative STEM teaching. Moreover, teachers' TPEK is the strongest predictor of their efficacy for teaching integrative STEM. Overall, the findings support that the TPACK framework could be theoretically useful for promoting teachers' efficacies for STEM education. Practical implications were discussed in this study.

AB  - For decades, science policy has been promoting interdisciplinary research (IDR), but universities have not responded uniformly. To explain this variation, we integrate insights from the organizational literature, especially research on microfoundations, and highlight the role of both administrators and faculty. We collect and, with the help of machine learning, code vast amounts of textual data from 156 universities nationwide to measure universities' structural commitment to IDR as well as key explanatory variables, including top-down administrative support for, and bottom-up faculty engagement with, IDR. We integrate these measures with extant data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates, Higher Education R&D Expenditures Survey, NIH, NSF, and IPEDS to analyze how internal university dynamics influence the degree to which a university commits to IDR. Our results reveal that the level of structural commitment to IDR differs at universities with and without medical schools, as do the precursors to this commitment. At universities with medical schools, we find that bottom-up engagement is positively associated with structural commitment to IDR, and that status moderates the relationship between top-down administrative support and structural commitment to IDR. For universities with low levels of supportive administrative discourse status significantly impacted their structural commitment to IDR. At universities without medical schools, top-down support and bottom-up engagement are interrelated and mutually reinforcing such that universities with high levels of both administrative support and interdisciplinary research grants have higher levels of structural commitment to IDR. We discuss the implications of these findings for university administrators, policy makers, and researchers.

AB  - This article describes an interdisciplinary project that created awareness of female scientists in a public Montessori classroom. Every spring, the author's sixth-grade students write an educational play in which the entire class participates. Following an underwhelming response to asking students who are their favorite female scientists, the decision was made to combine writing about female and male scientists into a play with science demonstrations and songs to review science content. All students learned about female scientists' achievements and honed their writing skills. All the actors practiced their verbal fluency and reviewed literary elements such as setting, character change, foreshadowing, conflict, and theme. Through the integration of Greek mythology and science, students touched the classics and reinforced their understanding of science concepts such as water displacement and volume, light refraction, elements, and adaptations. Children connected on a socio-emotional level with the characters as they learned about their struggles and achievements, especially those of female scientists. Writing and performing the play enhanced the classroom community because students experienced a shared purpose.

AB  - The interdisciplinary National Science Foundation-funded research project "Teaching Critical Thinking Skills in Science with 'sInvestigator'" supports undergraduate students as they explore scientific topics and problems with the use of an intelligent computer system called "sInvestigator" (science Investigator). The research team will share results from the first year of this three-year project. "sInvestigator" creates a real-time graphical model of evidentiary reasoning based on student data entry and justifications. Preliminary findings indicate that integrating lecture-based instruction with collaborative use of "sInvestigator" to engage students in evidence-based reasoning builds information literacy within the content area. The research team also concluded that "sInvestigator" design principles have the potential to build argumentation skills in other disciplines.

AB  - The cyber security education market has grownup exponentially, with a CAGR of 13.9 % as reported by Data Intelo. The report published by the World Economic Forum 2023 indicates a shortfall of 2.27 million cyber security experts in 2021 across different roles and hence manifest that Skill-based cyber security education is the need of the hour. Cybersecurity as a field has evolved as a multi-discipline, multi-stakeholder and multi-role discipline. Therefore, the need to address formal education with an outcome-based philosophy is imperative to address for a wider audience with varied past training in their formal education. With the Internet becoming an essential part of human life, providing security of data passed over the Internet is becoming increasingly crucial. Therefore, the role in the organization which is quite demanding is to have expertise in handling and configuring network security, a subdomain of cyber security as a priority area. The rapid increase in the network attack landscape is constantly demanding monitoring of network attacks as well as a need to promote collaborative R&D and education in the sphere of cyber security due to a shortage of skilled resources. Platform-based education is a potential direction to achieve the objective and address the skill gap required in cyber security. The present research proposes a comprehensive web-based platform that can be used to communicate, collaborate and practice various use cases in the domain of network intrusion detection tools using machine learning algorithms and to evaluate user experience. The proposed platform CySecLearn is a collection of various functionalities and features that ensure experiential learning, will help the learner to develop critical thinking and expertise in network security and promote digital literacy in the domain of cyber security.

AB  - This paper is based on an online experiment, conducted with bachelor students of educational sciences during the COVID-19 lockdown period in the spring of 2020. The experiment, which took place on a daily basis for a whole workweek, consisted of a series of what we have come to call "artistic-scientific interventions". These constituted a pedagogical praxis in which over a longer period of time students are challenged to collect and 'think with' artistic media as alternative ways of experiencing, studying, and evaluating the corona crisis. Our paper describes the structure and proceedings of this experiment against the background of efforts to develop a new philosophical idea of what it means to "do pedagogy." This idea, inspired by philosophers of science like Bruno Latour, contests some of the classical "divides" that run through the educational sciences, and that we believe pose a great threat to their relevance in current times of crisis: empirical/speculative, quantitative/qualitative, natural/social, facts/meaning, object/subject, etc. What our experiment shows, beyond all obsession with validating hypotheses or consistency of results, is that art, as an "education of the senses," can afford science with a much needed platform for (re)creating and/or (re)arranging circumstances in which those problematic divides may be overcome. However, what it also shows is that often this only works when art is approached, not through the lens of predominantly respresentationalist aesthetics, but as a full-fledged part of a scientific (c.q. pedagogical) discipline. Especially in a diffuse digital environment, this entails a need for "transindividual," "impersonal protocols" which allow for both repetition, variation, and feedback, and instil a strong sense of transformative gathering and "study."

AB  - Mentorship has been shown to have a positive influence on mentees but less research is available on the impacts for mentors, particularly those involved in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) outreach. As we work to enhance STEM engagement through outreach programs that include mentoring, understanding the impact on mentors that participate in these programs has implications for program design and offers new avenues for effective mentor engagement. This study explored the impacts of mentoring on undergraduate film and graduate science students who served as mentors in an outreach program for middle and high school youth. In this outreach program, a participant-centered mentorship model was implemented, with mentors supporting students in creating films about local climate change impacts in their communities. The focus was put on interdisciplinary work and the development of communication and relationship building in teams of students and their mentors. Data were collected from the mentors through surveys and interviews. As a result of their participation, mentors experienced professional and personal benefits, such as building teaching and communication skills, developing relationships and networking connections, and personal satisfaction. Several mentors reported high, positive impacts that resulted in changes to their career paths towards STEM education. Mentors who reported moderate or low levels of impact may have had past mentoring experiences that moderated the impact. Based on these findings, we suggest that mentor career and skill development is considered in the development of outreach programs and mentor training to enhance the impact on mentors and their engagement in STEM.

AB  - While increased attention has been put on approaches to teaching science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), little has been reported on teachers' views, perceptions, and beliefs about teaching STEM. Such knowledge is needed to inform efforts to support innovative teaching of STEM subjects in classrooms. In this study, 154 in-service teachers of both STEM-related and non-STEM related subjects, were randomly selected from schools all over Thailand. Data on teachers' perceptions were captured through a three-part questionnaire including an open-ended question that asked for general background information and perceptions of STEM education and STEM integration. Descriptive statistics were used to analyzed data and content analysis was used to analyze open-ended responses. Research findings showed that the majority of teachers (85.5%) had never heard about STEM education and approximately 19% of in-service teachers could not provide a definition of STEM education, with 20.53% of the teachers viewing STEM as a transdisciplinary course or program. While teachers think that a STEM teaching approach is very interesting, both STEM and non-STEM in-service teachers have strong concerns about the engineering discipline within STEM disciplines.

AB  - This article discusses problems of reconstructing the recent development in the field of empirical research on education ("empirische Bildungsforschung"), especially problems resulting from its interdisciplinary character, its divergent institutional contexts and its multimethod approach. The article looks at the position of various disciplines--in particular, science of education ("Erziehungswissenschaft") and educational psychology--involved in research on education as an interdisciplinary field of study. Compared to previous times, important shifts concerning the relation between these two disciplines can currently be observed. The argument is about the notion of competence, about the right to define success criteria and about resources. Finally, this discussion focusing on Germany is then placed in the wider context of different cognitive and institutional forms of doing and organizing education studies and research in different countries.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the preliminary outcomes of a learning community intervention (LC), which was based on the performance pyramid theoretical model of student supports. The LC integrated college algebra into biology course work. We used a quasi-experimental design to compare LC students to separate General Biology I and College Algebra course control groups on respective measures of biology and algebra course knowledge, and an assessment of perceived performance pyramid supports. Participants included 198 students (LC, n = 22; biology control, n = 52; mathematics control, n = 124) at a Historically Black University in the Southern United States. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) indicated that the LC students had significantly greater performance from pre- to post-test on a measure of biology course knowledge (Cohen's d = 0.76) compared to the biology control group. An ANCOVA indicated that the LC and mathematics control students performed similarly on a measure of algebra course knowledge. Group differences from a multivariate analysis of covariance on perceived performance pyramid supports were mostly statistically non-significant. Overall, the LC increased biology course performance. Implications for improving biology course performance and better assessment of students' perceptions of support for academic success are discussed.

AB  - Computing in the Arts (CITA) is an interdisciplinary Bachelor of Arts degree program, which integrates computer science with art theory and practice. We present a 6-year study that explores the impact of the CITA degree on broadening participation. We find that CITA attracts a different student population than traditional computer science degrees. We find that it attracts and retains almost twice as many female students as a traditional computer science degree. Finally, we find that it graduates approximately equal numbers of female and male students. The CITA curriculum maintains its strong computer science character, as it contains several core computer science courses and traditional upper-level computer science courses. We introduce the CITA curriculum model, which combines computer science courses, art courses and several structured synthesis experiences. We show that creating a CITA-like degree is fairly inexpensive, as the curriculum mostly reuses existing courses.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to analyse the interdisciplinary media literacy activities in terms of the views of primary school students. The study was conducted in the spring semester of the 2015-2016 academic year. The participants of the study were 90 fourth-grade students. The study's implementation process conducted in the courses of social studies, science and Turkish Language as an interdisciplinary approach. For the gains of each course, various materials were developed. In addition to these materials, various media products were also used. The data of the study were collected through student diaries and interviews conducted with 20 participants. These data were analysed through descriptive analysis. The findings of the study showed that interdisciplinary media literacy activities were influential in improving the media literacy skills of students in the courses of science, social studies and Turkish language and that these activities contributed to students in terms of different domains.

AB  - Team teaching can be a valuable means of enabling cross-disciplinary collaboration, interdisciplinary study, and pedagogical innovation, but the logistical and intellectual challenges can seem too daunting to overcome. Here, we share the story of how four faculty members from professional writing, communications, and computing sciences developed a team teaching "family" as we imagined, created, launched, and ran an innovative experiential learning program at our university. The Design Thinking Studio in Social Innovation is a semester-long program worth four full courses of credit that brought us together with 14 students from disciplines across the university to learn and apply design thinking and social innovation theories to a large-scale civic engagement project. Here we explore the lived experience of the faculty during the pilot semester and how our team-teaching family was crucial to our personal and professional success supporting our "kids" in this high-stress environment. We then offer tips for creating your own team-teaching family.

AB  - Empirical social science research increasingly involves working collaboratively with organisations beyond the university. This paper contributes to the growing international literature on doctoral collaboration by exploring how UK doctoral students in the social sciences negotiate organisational collaborations. We draw on narrative interviews and administrative data to create a series of case-study vignettes. We juxtapose these with a theorisation of disciplinary knowledge practices to show how such collaborations are at once demanding and unpredictable, but also generative of new understanding and insights. We suggest that Burawoy's ("American Sociological Review," 70(1), 4-28, 2005) model of the 'antagonistic interdependence' of public, critical, professional and policy sociologies is helpful as a heuristic for conceptualising doctoral student experiences of a range of different (and often contradictory) forms of social scientific knowledge. Our analysis demonstrates that both instrumental and critical forms of social knowledge can emerge from organisational partnerships and placements. We call for further attention to the 'generative paradoxes' (Bartunek and Rynes "Journal of Management," 40(5), 1181-1201, 2014) and 'reflective entanglements' (Jagoda 2016) that result from doctoral collaborations, and for doctoral pedagogies that help students use these experiences to develop criticality and see it as a key skill in social research.

AB  - College science education needs to foster students' habit of mind beyond disciplinary constraints. However, little research has been devoted to assessing students' interdisciplinary understanding. To address this problem, we formed a team of experts from different disciplines to develop interdisciplinary assessments that target introductory college-level science. We started our project by focusing on osmosis, a topic that involves knowledge from multiple science disciplines. We developed an instrument focusing on this topic and administered it to 3 classes of college students. A Rasch partial credit analysis showed that the items demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties. The findings also revealed the differences between student's disciplinary and interdisciplinary understanding. The educational implications of the study were discussed.

AB  - A small undergraduate liberal arts college explored a model, grounded in the literature, to develop a shared vision for its science and math general education curriculum that focuses on scientific literacy skills. This process has allowed us to produce shared general education learning goals across our eight science and math departments, conduct voluntary "best practices" workshops with a broad swath of faculty, and assess students' science and math attitudes and scientific literacy. It has also fostered interdisciplinary grant-writing teams to solicit external funding. The initial work was conducted at low cost to the institution. Our collaborative efforts positioned us to submit an NSF-IUSE grant, which was ultimately funded. Although the pace is often slower and the path more uncertain than individuals might desire, the results of this work suggest that teams of faculty and administrators can work together to align institutional priorities and produce genuine institutional change.

AB  - The article is aimed at describing one of the possible interdisciplinary courses for students of the 7-9 classes of the basic school connecting mathematics with natural sciences and the study of such courses role in the formation and development of meta-subject competencies of students. The leading method for this is the modeling of interdisciplinary courses, the main tools for the development of meta-subject competence in which are the interdisciplinary character of the content, including open and partially open type tasks in the course structure and the organization of project activities of schoolchildren in the field of studying mathematics and related disciplines. As a result of the research conducted by the authors they worked out several author's interdisciplinary courses, among them a special place is taken by the course "Mathematics in Natural sciences" for the classes of the natural-science profile. It is suggested in it to consider mathematical questions when applying them to the material of related disciplines both through the study of theoretical material and in the process of solving problems, including the open type, and involving schoolchildren in the project of interdisciplinary activity. Practical use of the interdisciplinary courses allows to see the achievements of meta-subject results by schoolchildren and the successes of students both in mathematical preparation, expressed by high marks on the subject, and related disciplines, which indicates the improvement of mathematical education quality of students who received training using the proposed methodology.

AB  - What can we learn from K-5 science teachers who have integrated science and creative dance for a five-year period? In this paper, the preliminary findings of the qualitative research conducted by a constructivist elementary charter school principal, a university dance professor, and an educational researcher is presented.This research highlights the experiences of science teachers who were given professional development in science/creative dance integration each semester and implemented arts integration strategies in the science classroom. To conclude the five-year period, the six teachers completed a questionnaire and participated in a videotaped interview to document their reflections on the project, Dance of Science Project (DoS), which serves as the primary data source for this paper. An interpretive methodology is used as a framework for interpreting the interviews of the teachers. Of interest is how teachers developed arts integration practices on their own in the classroom without being in partnership with a dance educator, and how arts integration in the science class supported their constructivist teaching practices which include elements of co-operation, autonomy, experimentation, play, and interest. In addition, the article discusses how creative dance aligns with the elements of constructivism.

AB  - Despite the increasing interests and practices in interdisciplinary science education, little research has been documented to develop effective assessments targeting students' interdisciplinary learning. In response to this gap, a team of scientists and educators developed an interdisciplinary assessment instrument targeting osmosis, which was chosen because it involves concepts from multiple disciplines and was identified as one of the most important topics by college instructors from different disciplines.

AB  - Within higher education there is widespread support for developing students' interdisciplinary skills. Despite this, evidence for, and practice of, cross-faculty interdisciplinary sustainability learning remains in its infancy. Recent articles have shown that Australia is no exception. This article provides a case study of interdisciplinary learning and teaching within a cross-faculty Education for Sustainability (EfS) undergraduate subject involving science, arts, business, and health students at an Australian university. A description of the subject and its theoretical context provides a platform for presenting the findings of a mixed method enquiry into how pedagogy supports interdisciplinary sustainability learning. The sequential explanatory research design involved a post-subject quantitative survey analysed using SPSS, augmented by qualitative student journal data (n = 67) using phenomenological analysis within NVivo. The study found that students, regardless of discipline background, valued the processes and pedagogy used to promote interdisciplinary collaboration and awareness. The experience left students feeling more skilled and confident of their ability to contribute to future interdisciplinary sustainability collaboration. This case study, replete with a subject description, theoretical context for an innovative pedagogical approach and study results, provides higher education professionals with a template for deliberative curriculum and pedagogy that promote interdisciplinary knowledge, skills and confidence that may contribute to transformative learning that supports EfS goals. The article presents a strong case for future EfS curriculum frameworks and strategic education policy to include deliberative interdisciplinary pedagogy. It also challenges higher education institutions to create flexible systems that facilitate cross-faculty interdisciplinary learning that is necessary for preparing students for the future.

AB  - Paper to Plastics (P2P) is an interdisciplinary program that combines chemistry and biology in a research setting. The goal of this project is 2-fold: to engage students in scientific research and to educate them about sustainability and biodegradable materials. The scientific aim of the project is to recycle unwanted office paper to the useful biodegradable polymer poly(lactic acid) (PLA). Through this program, students learn firsthand how chemistry and biology interact to form useful materials from waste. Students combine biological techniques, such as enzymatic digestion and fermentation, with chemical techniques, such as distillation and catalysis, to accomplish the conversion of waste paper into PLA. Through this summer program, students ultimately become familiar with diverse laboratory techniques, while learning how their scientific interests can be used to address important social problems.

AB  - For 12 years, Denise Gillman has taught the course Science on the Stage at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia. The plays studied awaken intellectual curiosity and understanding of human nature and complex scientific ideas within the framework of a good story and can do so for students of every major. This article presents how science-themed plays build interdisciplinary bridges in the classroom, create collaborative inquiry-based learning models, and launch creative research pathways for undergraduates. It explores the use of these plays as an interdisciplinary springboard by sharing exercises and writing assignments that engage various learners. It also exemplifies, through student work and two case studies, how students' research and creative investigation of these plays have originated questions that explore urgent problems and led them into capstone experiences, research projects, and conference presentations.

AB  - Global education in China, particularly in the rural regions, has not been extensively investigated. This paper discussed Chinese schoolteachers' perceptions of and approaches to global education to address a gap in the Western discourses. A total of 12 in-service schoolteachers were identified by the snowball sampling method. All participants were interviewed in two-round semi-structured in-depth interviews. Data then were analysed based on an open coding system and phenomenological approach. Results show that rural schoolteachers held an integrated definition framework and systematic approach towards global education. Their perceptions of global education encompassed broad arrays of cultural awareness, competencies, environmental issues, and humanistic values in national and international contexts. Factors contributing to this conceptual framework included teachers' personal teaching experience, the students' social-economic status, and national and international policies. Additionally, sampled rural schools adopted a whole-school approach to conducting global education, i.e., embedding into formal curricula, using interdisciplinary and integrated studies, involving various school programs, and being part of the schools' philosophy. It further discussed the gap between teachers' conceptual framework and their concrete implementation of global education. Overall, this paper provided a distinctive perspective of global education from the rural schoolteachers to reveal global education remains marginalized in China.

AB  - This book contains the full text of papers and posters presented at the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2019), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (WIARS). Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2019 received 547 submissions, from more than 50 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. The conference accepted for presentation 135 submissions (25% acceptance rate), from which, 114 submissions are published in full text in these volumes. The conference also includes a keynote presentation from an internationally distinguished researcher, Prof. Dr. Denise Whitelock, Professor of Technology Enhanced Assessment and Learning, Institute of Educational Technology, The Open University, UK, to whom we express our most gratitude. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. To develop the conference program, we have chosen four main broad-ranging categories, which also covers different interest areas: (1) In TEACHERS AND STUDENTS: Teachers and Staff training and education; Educational quality and standards; Curriculum and Pedagogy; Vocational education and Counseling; Ubiquitous and lifelong learning; Training programs and professional guidance; Teaching and learning relationship; Student affairs (learning, experiences and diversity); Extra-curricular activities; Assessment and measurements in Education. (2) In PROJECTS AND TRENDS: Pedagogic innovations; Challenges and transformations in Education; Technology in teaching and learning; Distance Education and eLearning; Global and sustainable developments for Education; New learning and teaching models; Multicultural and (inter)cultural communications; Inclusive and Special Education; Rural and indigenous Education; Educational projects. (3) In TEACHING AND LEARNING: Critical Thinking; Educational foundations; Research and development methodologies; Early childhood and Primary Education; Secondary Education; Higher Education; Science and technology Education; Literacy, languages and Linguistics (TESL/TEFL); Health Education; Religious Education; Sports Education. (4) In ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES: Educational policy and leadership; Human Resources development; Educational environment; Business, Administration, and Management in Education; Economics in Education; Institutional accreditations and rankings; International Education and Exchange programs; Equity, social justice and social change; Ethics and values; Organizational learning and change, Corporate Education. This is the Volume I of the book "Education and New Developments 2019" and it contains the results of the research and developments conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to promote growth in research methods intimately related to teaching, learning and applications in Education nowadays. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, who will extend our view in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues, by sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This first volume focus in the main areas of TEACHERS AND STUDENTS and PROJECTS AND TRENDS. We would like to express thanks to all the authors and participants, the members of the academic scientific committee, and of course, to our organizing and administration team for making and putting this conference together.

AB  - An eGroup mentoring model developed by three Finnish universities of applied sciences is examined in this article. The model is part of a more extensive eMentoring programme. In the operational model higher university of applied sciences degree students act as eMentors for undergraduate students in cross-disciplinary groups with the aim of enhancing the latter's transition to working life. The groups primarily work virtually. The reports of ten groups and individual reflections of eMentors and eActors provide a picture of successful eGroup mentoring principles. These principles are establishment of a structured eGroup mentoring process and promotion of dialogue interaction through diverse and participatory mentoring methods, employing enabling digital tools, appropriate for virtual teamwork. Furthermore eGroup mentoring on the interface of education and working life requires a multi-disciplinary implementation so that it supports the 21st century skills needed in working life.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate an interdisciplinary international service learning program and its impact on student sense of cultural awareness and competence using the Campinha-Bacote's (2002) framework of cultural competency model. Seven undergraduate and one graduate student from Human Development and Nutrition Science disciplines participated in the program. Reflections from a synthesis paper post-travel were analyzed using an inductive approach. Six themes emerged from the reflective journals and were applied to Campinha-Bacote's cultural competency constructs. Participating and learning together while reflecting helped deepen and progress this process for ISL students. Overall, the experience proved to be an effective educational tool for sensitizing students towards cultural competency within interdisciplinary programs.

AB  - An interdisciplinary approach to education has become more important in the development of science and technology, which requires universities to have graduates with broad knowledge and skills and to apply these skills in solving real-world problems. An interdisciplinary experimental series has been developed for the laboratories in cell and molecular biology and advanced inorganic chemistry. Students performed the synthesis and characterization of a Ru(II) monoarene anticancer complex in the advanced inorganic chemistry laboratory, followed by testing its DNA-binding properties in the cell and molecular biology laboratory. The objectives of this experimental series are to introduce the students to the connections between different scientific subjects and to the importance of an interdisciplinary approach in solving practical scientific problems. Students learn important techniques such as synthesis and purification, [superscript 1]H NMR and IR spectroscopy, and electrophoresis that are used collectively in the development of pharmaceuticals.

AB  - In an article written by Matthew Randazzo (2017) titled "Students Shouldn't Live in STEM Deserts," he revealed that a limited number of educational opportunities exist for students to gain essential STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) skills. This need for more STEM minds is bolstered by a widespread economic shift toward increases in the STEM workforce and a push from the neoliberal agenda. Randazzo goes on to state that secondary schools do not have the resources to provide a practical STEM education and this may be linked to the way the public education system is funded within a neoliberal economy. Nevertheless, higher education institutions are uniquely positioned to meet this need. Colleges and universities can provide students with authentic STEM experiences because they have access to innovative technologies. These experiences have the potential to route students to STEM degrees and careers while encouraging the innovations of tomorrow. Morehouse College, a historic leader among minority-serving institutions, chose to implement high-altitude research with pre-freshman from an interdisciplinary perspective. The aim was to engage students in advanced, high-altitude research through an early STEM immersion summer program, in hopes of broadly influencing their confidence as a scientist and their path to a STEM profession.

AB  - Background: China has great student participation in STEM education. Chinese society has a progressive and positive attitude towards STEM as it is considered to provide more opportunities in life. Teachers play a vital role in the success of any STEM program in K-12 schools. However, teachers are facing instructional challenges because of the interdisciplinary nature of the STEM curriculum and the current typical school structure. The success of the STEM programs depends on teachers' beliefs and their knowledge in adapting to instructional implementation of STEM concepts. Results: The data (n = 216) was collected from STEM primary and secondary teachers from 25 provinces in mainland China. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was applied, and Pearson's correlation analysis was used to examine the correlation between Chinese STEM teachers' beliefs, knowledge, implementation, and the intrinsic challenges of STEM education; "t" tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to ascertain whether there were differences. The structural equation model (SEM) was applied to identify interrelationships. The results indicated that Chinese STEM teachers encounter higher-level intrinsic challenges to instructional implementations based on their beliefs and knowledge. Teachers who utilize their experience of teaching science as their main discipline and then attempt to integrate STEM using mathematics and engineering are likely to encounter higher-level intrinsic challenges in implementation. Conclusion: The intrinsic challenges perceived by Chinese teachers in the practice of STEM education can be predicted by their beliefs and knowledge base. Teachers who understand the nature and pedagogy of STEM education are more likely to encounter lower-level intrinsic challenges of STEM teaching, while teachers who utilize their main discipline when conducting integrated STEM learning activities through modeling based on science, technology, engineering, and mathematical problem situations are more likely to encounter higher-level intrinsic challenges. This study also reveals that there are some significant differences in the level of STEM teachers' beliefs, knowledge base, instructional practice, and their intrinsic challenges based on their teaching grade, seniority, and experience of STEM training and teaching.

AB  - Anatomical education is pivotal for medical students, and innovative technologies like augmented reality (AR) are transforming the field. This study aimed to enhance the interactive features of the "AEducAR" prototype, an AR tool developed by the University of Bologna, and explore its impact on human anatomy learning process in 130 second-year medical students at the International School of Medicine and Surgery of the University of Bologna. An interdisciplinary team of anatomists, maxillofacial surgeons, biomedical engineers, and educational scientists collaborated to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the study's objectives. Students used the updated version of "AEducAR," named "AEducAR 2.0," to study three anatomical topics, specifically the orbit zone, facial bones, and mimic muscles. "AEducAR 2.0" offered two learning activities: one explorative and one interactive. Following each activity, students took a test to assess learning outcomes. Students also completed an anonymous questionnaire to provide background information and offer their perceptions of the activity. Additionally, 10 students participated in interviews for further insights. The results demonstrated that "AEducAR 2.0" effectively facilitated learning and students' engagement. Students totalized high scores in both quizzes and declared to have appreciated the interactive features that were implemented. Moreover, interviews shed light on the interesting topic of blended learning. In particular, the present study suggests that incorporating AR into medical education alongside traditional methods might prove advantageous for students' academic and future professional endeavors. In this light, this study contributes to the growing research emphasizing the potential role of AR in shaping the future of medical education.

AB  - There is a knowledge gap in best practices for incorporating performance arts into science instructions. The study focused on the design and implementation of the Performance Arts Enhanced 3-Stage Instructional Model (PAEIM), which incorporated drama, dance and music. The PAEIM was implemented in mixed factorial quasi-experimental research during the learning of the ecology unit in the secondary school biology curriculum. Empirical findings from the study exemplified PAEIM as an effective instructional model that significantly enhanced the conceptual understanding of ecology and impacted students' self-determination and intrinsic motivation. The reports of the findings also indicated that PAEIM enhanced the students' learning outcomes regardless of their gender. The result from the multivariate analysis revealed a significant main effect of treatment on combined motivation and the conceptual understanding of ecology. The study thereafter provided recommendations for scalability in the implementation of PAEIM in future research.

AB  - This study explores the influence of an afterschool program involving high needs elementary-aged students at community-based sites and elementary preservice teachers (EPSTs) enrolled in a final sequence of methods courses at a local university. Data collection involved surveys, interviews, and reflections with EPSTs and interviews with elementary-aged children. Results indicated a significant positive correlation between EPTSs' science perceptions and science teaching self-efficacy. A series of Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests indicate significant growth from pre to post in participating EPSTs' self-efficacy with the NGSS and the Engineering Standards within the NGSS. Interviews and reflections provided evidence that EPSTs benefited from the program by teaching in an unfamiliar setting that changed their beliefs and helped strengthen their teaching skills. Interview results for elementary-aged children revealed a hands-on, although somewhat limited, perspective of science, technology, and engineering. Perceptions of mathematics were primarily focused on computation.

AB  - Teachers often struggle to utilize reform-based teaching strategies in their first few years of teaching for many reasons (Ball, Thames & Phelps, Journal of Teacher Education 59, 389-407, 2008; Berlin & White, "International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education" 8, 97-115, 2010; Frykholm & Glasson, "School Science and Mathematics" 105, 127-141, 2005; Lederman & Lederman, Science Teacher Education 24, 1237-1240, 2013). An important part of teachers' learning to implement these pedagogically ambitious strategies is for teachers to experience learning themselves through an immersive experience in the new strategy (Louks-Horsley, Stiles, Mundry, Love & Hewson, "Designing professional development for teachers of science and mathematics," 2010). Building on this body of research and a host of recent national education standards documents, this paper explores the various dispositions early career high school science and math teachers from across the USA demonstrate when engaging together as learners in integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) tasks. Embedded within a multi-year professional development program, teachers were engaged in two integrated STEM tasks during two separate professional development experiences. Following the tasks, teachers responded to writing prompts asking them to reflect on their experience during the tasks. Analysis of the reflections about the integrated STEM tasks fell into two broad categories of dispositions: engager and observer. The data suggest various strategies for professional development providers who are interested in providing professional development focused on integrated STEM instruction.

AB  - Though today's problems are interconnected, complicated, and unpredictable, students continue to gain knowledge in discrete, standardized disciplinary silos. When subject integration is discussed in STEM and STEAM (STEM + Arts) literature, there is little consensus on what constitutes or should constitute integration of the disciplines. Pre-service teachers have been shown to teach in ways that combine the methods and skills they gained during their education with an imitation of the manner in which they were taught. This highlights one of the major institutional barriers underlying integrated STEAM education, as most pre-service teachers are taught, and therefore expect to teach, specialized subjects. This case study used a transdisciplinary approach to problem-based learning and invited pre-service teachers to apply integrated STEAM and practices of making to provide solutions addressing student dropout rates in their local district. Findings show the group struggled to move beyond their initial solution, even though it did not adequately address the problem. Further, this research indicates that students need constructive criticism from an outside voice in addition to support from a mentor to increase their engagement and success.

AB  - This project report presents a multidisciplinary Faculty Learning Community model to foster civic engagement in STEM classes. It focused on first-year Chemistry, Math, and Scientific Inquiry courses and incorporated Academic Service Learning in a project to build solar cell phone chargers for a school in Puerto Rico recovering from the effects of Hurricane Maria in 2017. The project provided hands-on experiences for the students, with the tangible outcome of building the solar chargers for people in need. Student engagement was measured through surveys and reflective assignments; the students responded positively to their work and their sense of fulfilling the St. John's University mission. The members of the Faculty Learning Community have engaged in ongoing collaborative relationships.

AB  - Integrated science is a ubiquitous school subject that is found in primary and middle-school levels around the world. Being a hybrid subject comprising several science disciplines, it poses many challenges to teachers as they are obliged to teach beyond their disciplinary comfort zones. In addition, this subject is prone to a lack of coherence, which helps people see how a small number of key ideas in a discipline can build upon each other to deepen understanding. Using integrated science textbooks from mainland China since 1990 as a case study, their (i) disciplinary emphasis (i.e. which topics & disciplines were emphasised) and, (ii) coherence of topics were therefore examined. The results showed that physical science topics were heavily and consistently emphasised in these textbooks, which likewise corresponded with the high number of buttress topics found in this discipline. Life science topics were the next most emphasised followed by earth science ones, a trend present since the 1990s in this country. We conclude with implications for improving science teacher training/professional development as well as student scientific literacy from this study of disciplinary emphasis and coherence in integrated science textbooks.

AB  - Purpose: This paper exemplifies Search for SEAMEO Young Scientist (SSYS) project-based programme that was initiated since 1997 with themes reflecting sustainable development and were in line with SDGs. Method: Qualitative research with 'dominant model' of 'mixed-research design matrix' was implemented with mixed-mode of data analysis and reports on exemplars using 'Type 4' multiple case analysis. Findings: The analysis of data revealed that students who participated in the 11th SSYS 2018 congress were able to present research outputs integrating transdisciplinary studies which were in line with SDGs as reflected in set theme. Apart from fulfilling SEAMEO Education Agenda Priority Areas No. 7 (Adopting 21st century curriculum) to ensure sustainable living through quality education (i.e. SDG No. 4), exemplary projects that integrate SDGs were also showcased through within-case analysis. Significance: SSYS biennially held congress served as excellent platform for networking and dissemination of transdisciplinary project outputs that reflect SDGs. The organisation of 11th SSYS 2018 congress integrating e-forum for networking sessions showed the needs to incorporate blended-mode platform that proved to be an important practice in the new normal.

AB  - Given the growing evidence of academic language demands embodied in science practices, this study aimed to design and evaluate the effectiveness of a literacy-science integrated program that emphasized the incorporation of academic vocabulary instruction and collaborative discussion of a socio-scientific issue in sixth-grade science classrooms in an urban school. The treatment students (n = 73) who participated in the intervention had significantly higher academic vocabulary knowledge and scientific argumentation posttest scores than the control students (n = 62). The effect on academic vocabulary knowledge was particularly greater for bilingual students than their monolingual peers. Mediation analyses revealed that the intervention effects on science content knowledge and scientific argumentation were mediated by academic vocabulary knowledge. Findings indicate that science teachers' instructional scaffolding for academic vocabulary and authentic discourse can not only improve students' academic vocabulary knowledge but also indirectly affect science content knowledge and scientific argumentation via academic vocabulary knowledge.

AB  - This article argues that Education Studies needs to develop its existing interdisciplinarity understanding of structures and agencies by giving greater attention to the modern process theories of self-organisation in the physical, biological, psychological and social sciences, sometimes given the umbrella term "complexity theory". The relation of humans to the biosphere is topicalised, including the social role of the emotions presented by evolutionary psychology and learning theory. Further, Education Studies is seen as a suitable discipline for bringing these concerns into the broader intellectual culture and the curriculum. A number of proposals for reform are presented in the conclusion.

AB  - Much has been written and debated on the importance of including moral, character or values education in school curricula. In line with this, teachers' views with regard to values education have often been sought. However, a search into the literature on values in science education has revealed little on this domain. In an attempt to close this gap, this study explored the views of teachers with regard to values infusion in the teaching of science. The aim was to investigate teachers' perceptions on two broad areas: (i) how values were infused or addressed in lower secondary science and (ii) how values-infused science lessons influenced their students' dispositions and actions. The participants who took part in the interviews were lower secondary science teachers teaching Grade 8 in selected Singapore and New Delhi schools. The findings showed that values inherent in the discipline of science, such as validity, fairness, honesty, rigour, predominated in the lessons conducted by the teachers in both contexts. Furthermore, in Singapore, equal numbers of teachers made references to values upheld and practised by scientists and values arising from the interplay between people and scientific processes and products. In New Delhi however, the emphasis was higher on the latter category of values than on the former. Generally, in both contexts, values infusion in science lessons was not planned but occurred spontaneously as values issues surfaced in class. Teachers in both Singapore and New Delhi used strategies such as questioning, discussion, activities and direct instructions to carry out values infusion, although they experienced challenges that included content and time constraints, lack of student readiness and of teacher competency. Nevertheless, the teachers interviewed perceived that values in science lessons brought about changes in students' personal attributes, affect and behaviour, such as greater interest and prosocial engagement.

AB  - The critical question for cognitive scientists is what does cognitive science do, if anything, for people? Cognitive science is primarily concerned with human cognition but has fallen short in continuously and critically assessing the "who" in human cognition. This complacency in a world where white supremacist and patriarchal structures leave cognitive science in the unfortunate position of potentially "supporting" those structures. We take it that many cognitive scientists operate on the assumption that the study of human cognition is both interesting and important. We want to invoke that importance to note that cognitive scientists must continue to work to show how the field is useful to all of humanity and reflects a humanity that is not white by default. We wonder how much the field has done, and can do, to show that it is useful not only in the sense that we might make connections with researchers in other fields, win grants and write papers, even of the highest quality, but useful in some material way to the billions of non-cognitive scientists across the globe.

AB  - Multi-disciplinary programs are growing, and serve an integral role in fostering knowledge transfer among disciplines and the community. Despite their importance, relatively little has been written on how to foster success in multidisciplinary higher education engagement initiatives, particularly in ways that encompass service-learning. The current work highlights unique multi-disciplinary needs for knowledge transfer, critical and creative thinking, and building bridges between academia and practice. The SOLL model, a sustainable, integrative framework that encompasses lecture, operative, and service-learning, is summarized as one way in which to meet such multi-disciplinary needs. The current work discusses two applications of this model in graduate and undergraduate consumer science engagement initiatives.

AB  - The automated water filtration design challenge integrates computer programming and basic electronics concepts through the SIMILAR systems engineering design process. The SIMILAR systems design process is to state the problem, investigate alternatives, model the system, integrate the system, launch the system, assess performance, and reevaluate (SIMILAR). The modeling, integration, and launching steps of the design process require specific skill sets related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) concepts. These concepts are significant when addressing the various national standards related to "Standards for Technological Literacy" ("STL"), "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS"), Common Core State Standards (CCSS), and The K-12 Computer Science Framework. The integration of these concepts reinforces how they can be utilized together to increase the understanding of systems and systems design. This article describes how an automated water filtration design challenge can be used as an interdisciplinary approach to solve a real-world problem while addressing various national standards and frameworks.

AB  - This study implements a design-based research approach to design and evaluate different scaffolding strategies for supporting student learning as well as promoting student agency within a computational science course. The course introduces computational methods and tools in the context of disciplinary problems for materials science and engineering students. Initial course offerings suggested that students were overwhelmed by the interdisciplinary nature of the course. Therefore, the research team evaluated different scaffolding strategies for supporting students' learning, and how those may have provided students with agency to self-scaffold when needed. Three rounds of data collection included 17 students who participated in individual semi-structured interviews to explore how they used (or not) different scaffolds. Five of the participants were recruited for the first iteration; six of them were recruited in the second iteration, and six more in the third one. The iterative process allowed us to adapt the scaffolding procedures for the third iteration from the data collected in iterations 1 and 2. The purpose of this study is to understand how students used different scaffolds, and what implementation strategies were effective according to student uses of these scaffolds in the context of computational science. The results suggest that students developed agency to self-scaffold when needed, as they benefited from multiple scaffolds at different steps of the problem-solving process. Moreover, providing worked examples without engaging students in their active exploration can be ineffective, but this engagement can be achieved using written explanations. Additional support may be needed at an early stage of skill development, so students have an idea of how to validate their model.

AB  - Despite efforts to integrate science and mathematics learning in elementary school through carefully designed activities, students' cognitive processes remain relatively untapped as a possible place of intersection. We believe "reasoning" is a productive co-curricular concept that could lead to meaningful integration. We conducted a systematic literature review of empirical research published over the past 20 years on students' reasoning in both science education and mathematics education. Articles were summarized and examined for their: (1) methodological approach and experimental design; (2) social dimension in the classroom; (3) definition of reasoning and associated structures; and (4) evidence of students' engagement in reasoning. For each theme, relationships between scientific and mathematical reasoning research were examined for the purposes of finding intersections and discrepancies between the two subject areas. As a result, we suggest the term "STEM reasoning" that embodies the core skills and thought processes across both subject areas to provide an authentic approach to integrating elementary school science and mathematics learning.

AB  - For more than a century the notion of a pre-established harmony between the mathematical and physical sciences has played an important role not only in the rhetoric of mathematicians and theoretical physicists, but also as a doctrine guiding much of their research. Strongly mathematized branches of physics, such as the vortex theory of atoms popular in Victorian Britain, were not unknown in the nineteenth century, but it was only in the environment of fin-de-siècle Germany that the idea of a pre-established harmony really took off and became part of the mathematicians' ideology. Important historical figures were in this respect David Hilbert, Hermann Minkowski and, somewhat later, Albert Einstein. Roughly similar ideas can be found also among British theorists, among whom Arthur Eddington, Arthur Milne, and Paul Dirac are singled out. Although largely limited to the period 1870-1940, the paper also considers Max Tegmark's recent hypothesis of the universe (or multiverse) being a one-to-one reflection of mathematical structures.

AB  - Existing tensions within and between the discourses permeating doctoral candidature are being exacerbated by those of interdisciplinarity and industry collaboration. Drawing on the author's experience as a doctoral candidate within a cooperative research centre, this article interrogates the conflicting and challenging pressures placed on candidates and their supervisors in interdisciplinary and industry collaborative environments in the humanities, arts and social sciences. The article questions the common assumption that "more (disciplines) is better" to address complex social, economic and environmental problems. It highlights the ways in which interdisciplinary and industry-led projects can inadvertently silo the doctoral candidate and the problem to be "solved" within dominant ontological, epistemological and political frameworks. The article calls on supervisors and candidates to adopt the role of negotiators and translators in complex research relationships. It concludes that in some cases, discipline-specific, independent research may provide the novel and innovative answers required to address "real-world" problems.

AB  - During the 2016 election season, the authors--a collection of staff, faculty, and students at a rural, four-year comprehensive college--piloted a new format for a student-driven, campus-wide, nonpartisan voter mobilization campaign anchored in a political science course and supported by a credit-bearing internship and advanced graphic design course. We argue that this project offers a model for how collaboration between student affairs and academic affairs can transform the nonpartisan voter mobilization campaign into a site for interdisciplinary, cross-campus service-learning projects that benefit the student participants and the campus community. This article outlines the advantages and challenges of the project and concludes with recommendations for those interested in implementing a similar program.

AB  - Predicting student success in a data science degree program is a challenging task due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field, the diverse backgrounds of the students, and an incomplete understanding of the precise skills that are most critical to success. In this study, the applicant's future academic performance in a Master of Data Science program is assessed using information from the admission application, such as standardized test scores, undergraduate grade point average, declared major, and school ranking. Simple data analysis methods and visualization techniques are used to gain a better understanding of how these variables impact student performance, and several classification algorithms are used to induce models to distinguish between students that will perform very well and those that will perform very poorly. Historical admissions and grading data are used to perform these analyses and build the classification models. The analyses and predictive models that are generated provide insight into the factors that identify good and poor candidates, and can aid in future admissions decisions.

AB  - Reflective thinking (RT) is one of the higher-order thinking skills which have been of great importance to the researchers from a variety of disciplines for years. Although the significance of RT has been discussed in many studies and many different forms, there are no bibliometric studies conducted on this topic. This study aims to examine the current state and development of research in RT based on the data available in the Web of Science (WoS). To do this, a bibliometric approach was adopted to map the research literature on RT using the metadata from the WoS between 1986 and 2023 in terms of the distribution of the articles by year of publication and average citation status, the most productive journals publishing on RT and number of RT-related citations, the most cited RT articles and authors, top countries in which the articles about RT were cited most, the authors who have produced the most articles on RT, their publications and corresponding author(s)' countries, and the trend of words associated with RT in the articles. Our main contribution is the quantitative methodological design for examining the evolution of reflective thinking research, which is highly multidisciplinary and covers a large volume of publications. We believe that this study provides a comprehensive review of the studies on RT and provides interesting insights about the development of the field for future research.

AB  - In the undergraduate curriculum, chemistry and sustainability connect easily and well. Topics in chemistry provide instructors with opportunities to engage students in learning about sustainability; similarly, topics in sustainability provide instructors with opportunities to engage students in learning chemistry. One's own college or university campus is a useful source of content related both to sustainability and to chemistry. To obtain this content, instructors must seek out and learn from those working in campus facilities and operations. For the past five years, the approach of utilizing campus-based content was employed by the authors in teaching an introductory environmental science course. This paper describes three topics from this course that general chemistry instructors can use to help students make connections to sustainability: the carbon cycle, the carbon footprint, and the energy required to heat water. These topics are presented with the hope that instructors will use them with data from their institutions, utilizing their own campus as a "living laboratory" for sustainability.

AB  - In this article, we discuss conflict between law and science relative to the presumption in special education law that multidisciplinary teams and others identify the causes of problems giving rise to special education needs. First, we explain eligibility criteria, highlighting ambiguities therein and why criteria constitute a mandate for causal inference, and present illustrative examples of how judges have interpreted this mandate. Second, we discuss as a counterpoint school psychologists' ethical duties to conduct evaluations based on the best available science, and highlight the clear conflicts between the law, ethics, and research. We present the biopsychosocial model of development as a potential framework for reconciling one's legal duty to infer causation with the current evidence base. We conclude with implications for policy and practice and suggestions for future research.

AB  - The implementation of an integrated approach to upper-level undergraduate chemistry laboratory instruction that incorporates student choice both in the selection and sequencing of the experimental work is presented. The approach involves combining laboratory work in several traditional subdisciplinary areas of chemistry in a single course. Experimental work in emerging areas of chemistry is also incorporated, as are experiences intended to capture an interdisciplinary approach. Logistical affordances, the nature of the resulting learning environment, student responses, and faculty experiences are explored through analysis of curriculum documents and the use of student surveys. The work reveals several strengths and weaknesses in terms of logistics and learning environment, insights into how students engaged with the course and the aspect of choice, and associated benefits and challenges for faculty members. Implications for practice are presented with the aim of informing educators and institutions considering or adopting a similar approach.

AB  - Purpose: Innovation in education is one of the alternative approaches in education to promote creative and higher-order thinking skills, providing hands-on learning and learning in context experience. However, there is a need to combine the ability to produce a commercialised innovation instead, as not many studies have combined innovation and entrepreneurship in an educational approach. This study seeks to examine the pattern of publication, key concepts, citations, and authorship in innovation and entrepreneurship educational research and their collaborations. Methods: This study employed a bibliometric analysis of 1,941 scholarly works related to innovation and entrepreneurship as recorded in the Scopus database on June 20th, 2021, for the past 10 years, starting in 2011. Findings: The findings indicate that since 2011, innovation and entrepreneurship have caught the attention of scholars from both the East and the West, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, and China, and the number of publications has grown consistently over the 10 years after that. Based on the findings, both innovation and entrepreneurship do rely on each other, and a proper curriculum design structure and management must be considered to assimilate these two elements together in any academic subject. Significance: According to the findings, these two elements are best applied at the tertiary level, and if they work together and blend well, they will aid not only in preparing future generations with good entrepreneurial skills but also in economic and sustainable development. However, while this transdisciplinary approach to educational research has been well received in the West, it has yet to be adequately encouraged in the East. There has been healthy cross-country collaboration, but there is a gap in combining innovation and entrepreneurship in educational research from certain countries vis a vis western countries. The findings of this study may have contributed significantly to increasing the inclusivity and global reach of innovation and entrepreneurship in educational research.

AB  - In an increasingly data-driven world, facility with statistics is more important than ever for our students. At institutions without a statistician, it often falls to the mathematics faculty to teach statistics courses. This paper presents a model that a mathematician asked to teach statistics can follow. This model entails connecting with faculty from numerous departments on campus to develop a list of topics, building a repository of real-world datasets from these faculty, and creating projects where students interface with these datasets to write lab reports aimed at consumers of statistics in other disciplines. The end result is students who are well prepared for interdisciplinary research, who are accustomed to coping with the idiosyncrasies of real data, and who have sharpened their technical writing and speaking skills.

AB  - The recent implementation of The Victorian Curriculum F-10: EAL requires content teachers who teach EAL students to be familiar with the revised EAL curriculum for the purposes of planning and developing approaches to assist learners' development in English. In the literature and in curriculum frameworks, word knowledge is considered an important aspect of EAL students' learning. However, little is known about what pedagogical practices teachers across the curriculum perceive as being important, and use, in developing EAL students' vocabulary. In this study, we investigated linguistically responsive vocabulary teaching in a Year 7 science class. Our aim was to elucidate teachers' perceptions and practices in teaching vocabulary in science. The qualitative case study drew on principles of linguistically responsive instruction (LRI), which refers to practices for meeting the needs of students in culturally and linguistically diverse classrooms. Analysis of interview and classroom data from an EAL teacher and a science teacher revealed a range of LRI practices for developing word knowledge based on understanding the distinction between conversational and academic language, language learning principles, responsive teacher talk, plurilingual awareness, and the importance of social interaction for learners. We offer recommendations for a whole school approach to LRI, adaptation to online LRI, and curriculum development.

AB  - Purpose: In a socio-educational context impregnated by social networks, feminist organizations and individuals have turned to social media to spread their knowledge. This paper aims to approach how feminist tweets are produced to ignite meaningful informal learning (IL) processes. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an interdisciplinary mixed methodology. By using Twitter tracking tools, a database has been enabled to catalogue feminist hashtags into topics and categories for further analysis. These data have been contrasted with surveys to the managers of the most followed feminist accounts in Spain and Catalonia. Findings: From an educational perspective, the analysed feminist hashtags have been organized in 13 different topic categories. The different propagation processes on Twitter -- tweeting and retweeting -- imply diverse learning processes. Moreover, tweets with complementary information such as images or links generate the most interaction, being the preferred format for IL. Research limitations/implications: Researching with Big Data in educational sciences is a field in development, and Twitter data collection tools are mostly addressed to marketing and economic sectors; thus, free tools with limited services were used, offering the analysis of a brief and concrete situation of a platform in constant change. Although this ephemeral data and its relevance does not prevail over time, it has an impact on citizens' learning. Originality/value: It is the first study in Spain that illustrates the informal education that feminism offers to the community, facing the complexity of measuring Twitter with an educational perspective through the use of marketing tools.

AB  - In this article, I comment on the prospect of integrating an intersectionality perspective into the developmental sciences. I do this by sharing impressions, insights, and questions that have emerged whilst attempting to look at and to look through an intersectionality lens. My comments focus on three main topics. First, I speculate what forms such an integration could take and argue that an integration that productively contributes to shaping developmental science into a transdisciplinary field is likely to change intersectionality research itself. I then reflect on the perceived ambiguity in terms of the unit of analysis (e.g., social systems vs. individuals) and the focus of research questions (i.e., description vs. explanation vs. intervention) in intersectionality research. Clarity and transparency in this regard is instrumental to productively identifying conceptual and methodological overlaps or intersections with other subdisciplines in developmental sciences. Finally, I highlight the importance of development being more comprehensively reflected in the conceptualizations, the research questions, and the subsequently employed methodologies in intersectionality research. I conclude with a plea for allowing our expertise to intersect to transdisciplinarily work toward creating systemic and perpetual progress in the developmental sciences--something, I believe to resonate strongly with intersectionality researchers.

AB  - Background: A growing number of educators have started exploring student-centered approaches to improve students' learning and satisfaction with courses and programs. While prior research shows a positive impact of such strategies on student learning, further exploration of the perceptions of traditional, lecture-based and other more inquiry-based active learning as experienced by students within the same university is needed. Purpose: To compare students' perceptions of the learning environment in studio-type courses within an innovative pilot student-centered transdisciplinary learning experience to the environment in traditional lecture or lecture-and-lab courses. Program description: An innovative learning experience that employs student-centered teaching strategies to engage students in the transdisciplinary exploration of technology and liberal arts within a technology-focused college in a large land-grant university. Sample: At the end of the first semester, eight students who chose to leave the program were interviewed. At the end of the second semester, eight students who chose to remain in the program and four students who left after the first semester were interviewed. Design/Method: Student were interviewed individually during the end of either their Fall 2014 semester or Spring 2015 semester. A thematic analysis was conducted. Frequency of occurrence was counted and compared for each theme. Results: The most frequently mentioned differences between traditional courses and this learning experience regarded instruction, assessment, and uncertainty. Students enjoyed the flexibility of a more student-centered approach, but struggled with understanding assessment and time management within self-directed transdisciplinary coursework. Student learning preferences appeared to influence their perceptions of each teaching method. Conclusions: Although results seemed to be influenced by personal preferences, time management and dealing with uncertainty were sources of frustration across both groups of students. Scaffolding students in these two areas may help students make an easier transition toward more student-centered learning environments.

AB  - As educators, we are becoming increasingly aware that delivering effective education will likely change after the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, we have an opportunity to frame teaching differently and bring innovation to the forefront. In doing so, educators explored online tools and creative ways to connect with students and found new ways to teach.Using an exploratory case study methodology and working within a theoretical framework of symbolic interactionism (SI), I investigated how virtual teaching visual arts integration and biology are more favorable or challenging for emergent bi/multilingual high schoolers. The lesson titled Using Depiction to Illustrate the Interdependent Functions of a Plant Cell was implemented. I implemented a series of visual arts integration activities with ten ninth-grade emergent bi/multilingual students at a mid-sized high school in the United States' southeastern region. Research activities took place, via zoom, in a communication skills class. The findings reveal that learning new content mediums and skills during visual arts integration activities enhances students' learning process. Moreover, emergent bi/multilingual students can benefit from face-to-face classes because they receive more practice speaking and benefit from their teacher's advice on their tasks. Nevertheless, more flexible class times and delivery methods may help students meet the many challenges created by the need to help provide for their families.

AB  - In recent years, the integration of science and mathematics has become popular among educators because of its potential benefits for student learning. The purpose of this study is to introduce a two-day interdisciplinary lesson that brings science and mathematics concepts together, actively engaging students in working with percentages of the ingredients in mixtures with the concept of torque. Participation in this Grade 7-9 lesson provides opportunities for students to learn from both content areas as they progress through a variety of science process skills.

AB  - Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education has become an international focus of science education curricular reforms. However, few K-12 teachers have the background to authentically teach STEM in an integrated way. This is especially true of elementary teachers, who are often less confident or prepared to teach STEM disciplines independently. Most methods courses for preservice elementary teachers are taught independently by content area (math, science, language arts, and social studies), and seldom model integrated teaching strategies. Preservice teachers should have opportunities to experience and create developmentally appropriate curricula that integrate STEM disciplines. This study sought to bridge elementary preservice math and science methods courses through the modeling of integrated STEM lessons. The researchers who served as course instructors codesigned a STEM unit and collaborated throughout the semester. After explicit modeling and practice, surveys and lesson plans were used to determine the preservice elementary teachers' understandings of STEM and their ability to plan integrated STEM lessons. In both the science and mathematics methods courses, the month-long unit on STEM education included explicitly modeled STEM lessons and culminated with preservice teachers planning, teaching, and reflecting on their own integrated lessons. Although misconceptions that a STEM lesson needed to address every discipline remained, the teachers' ability to recognize and design lessons improved. This study supports the value of collaboratively taught elementary math and science methods courses to provide the experiences teachers will need to deliver STEM instruction in their classrooms.

AB  - Numerous case studies suggest that integrating art and science education could engage students with creative projects and encourage students to express science in multitude of ways. However, little is known about art integration practices in everyday science teaching. With a qualitative e-survey, this study explores the art integration of science teachers (n = 66). A pedagogical model for science teachers' art integration emerged from a qualitative content analysis conducted on examples of art integration. In the model, art integration is characterised as integration through content and activities. Whilst the links in the content were facilitated either directly between concepts and ideas or indirectly through themes or artefacts, the integration through activity often connected an activity in one domain and a concept, idea or artefact in the other domain with the exception of some activities that could belong to both domains. Moreover, the examples of art integration in everyday classroom did not include expression of emotions often associated with art. In addition, quantitative part of the survey confirmed that integration is infrequent in all mapped areas. The findings of this study have implications for science teacher education that should offer opportunities for more consistent art integration.

AB  - An interdisciplinary approach to teaching involves leveraging the different perspectives of each discipline to better understand an issue or problem. The most ideal topics for interdisciplinary study are those whose very nature is also interdisciplinary. Nanoscience--which combines biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, and mathematics--is one such topic. This article presents the use of nanoscience as a theme for the interdisciplinary study of science and mathematics. An example curriculum and thoughts about an inquiry instructional method are included. (Contains 3 figures.)
