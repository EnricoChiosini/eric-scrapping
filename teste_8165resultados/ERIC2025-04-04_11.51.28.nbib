AB  - Project-based learning (PBL) is a highly effective means of motivating students to learn independently. However, training or encouraging teachers to practice PBL in their classrooms is challenging, especially if the educational system does not accommodate creative teaching practices. In particular, in a test-driven educational system, time constraints and an excess of teaching content makes it difficult to practice PBL at the high school level. This work presents a novel team-teaching model that is based on collaboration between subject teachers and the computer teacher to facilitate PBL in the classroom. A two-year experiment was conducted to study the feasibility of the proposed model, in which the school computer teacher conducts PBL with the 10th grade students in the first year, and subject teachers conduct PBL with the 11th grade students in the second year. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model is feasible in the given educational setting. No class time was lost, and the subject teacher successfully conducted PBL activities. Furthermore, a follow-up survey indicated that the students enjoyed the PBL activities in both classes. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - In this paper Vincent Cee provides a synthesis of ideas published by several authors who wrote in the late 1960s through the early 1980s. Remarkably, these authors arrived at similar conclusions in disparate ways and disciplines, all of which hold rich implications for music education. The works examined include Neil Postman's and Charles Weingartner's "Teaching as a Subversive Activity," Christopher Alexander's "A Pattern Language," "Music Society Education," by Christopher Small, Marilyn Ferguson's "The Aquarian Conspiracy," Morris Berman's "The Reenchantment of the World," and "The Turning Point" by Fritjof Capra. The author suggests that reading obliquely across disciplines yields themes that allow music educators to renew, recast, and redirect their narratives (Postman 1995). Put another way, Vincent Cee's contention is that the profession has overlooked and/or lost a generation of valuable insights published between 1969 and 1985.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to test a hypothesized model that specified direct and indirect effects of textual and individual factors on readers' ability to integrate information about sources and content when reading multiple conflicting texts on a controversial socio-scientific issue. Using a path analytic approach with a sample of 140 Norwegian upper secondary school students, it was found that the textual factor of presentation format, specifically whether they read about the conflicting issue in multiple texts or in a single text, affected source-content integration directly as well as indirectly through memory for textual conflicts. Thus, compared to interacting with a single text, interacting with multiple texts improved students' sourcing performance directly as well as indirectly. Further, the individual factors of prior knowledge and gender affected source-content integration directly, with prior knowledge also having an indirect effect that was mediated by memory for textual conflicts. Specifically, students with higher prior knowledge and girls were likely to display better sourcing performance than were students with lower prior knowledge and boys, and prior knowledge also had an indirect positive effect on sourcing via memory for textual conflicts. Theoretical as well as educational implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Purpose--Environmental assessment (EA) is a proactive planning tool designed to consider the ecological, cultural, socio-political and economic impacts of potential projects, making it a major tool for achieving sustainable development. Meaningful EA requires a bridging of the natural sciences with the social sciences to broaden understanding of the overall environmental impacts of development projects on humans, the natural environment and other organisms. As a result of this complexity, education and training needs are great. The purpose of this paper was to consider EA educational opportunities at Canadian universities and to test a model for the analysis of the state of such education. Design/methodology/approach--The research design used a qualitative interactive approach, including a survey of 2001 university course calendars, participant observation and semi-structured interviews. Findings--Results indicate that the number of universities offering EA courses has tripled to 40 since the mid-1980?s. While this is a positive finding, data illustrate that the bulk of the courses offered are survey-oriented and introductory in nature, with little opportunity to specialize. This cursory approach is exacerbated by a lack of teaching resources and instructor development. Despite the nature of the courses offered, many professors encourage critical thinking and use innovative teaching techniques, including role-playing, to promote self-reflection. In fact, the interdisciplinary approach to the curricula and the promotion of critical thinking outside disciplinary boundaries are two strengths of current EA programming. Originality/value--In light of this state of formal EA education in Canada, more research and international level dialogue are warranted. (Contains 4 tables and 1 note.)

AB  - Critical thinking is a graduate attribute that many courses, including engineering courses, claim to produce in students. As a graduate attribute it is seen by academics as a particularly desirable outcome of student learning and is said by researchers to be a defining characteristic of university education. However, how critical thinking is understood and defined varies quite significantly between disciplines. The paper describes a series of in-depth, semi-structured interviews with academics involved in teaching and learning in a number of disciplines, including engineering. The objective of these interviews is to look at how different disciplines define critical thinking and how they teach critical thinking in their courses. The paper also describes how an analysis of student work and module descriptors has led to the development of a model of critical thinking that can be used across disciplines. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - This study examines the similarities and differences in perceptions of preservice and induction physical education teachers regarding their level of career preparedness and curricular preferences. Findings are based on interviews with 23 participants (12 preservice and 11 induction) from two Midwestern universities. Qualitative data from the structured interview questions designed for the study were collected and analyzed using content analysis and compared with the guiding theory. Trustworthiness for data collection and analysis was followed and validated by guidelines and recommendations (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Patton, 2002). In addition, 39 individuals from the two universities were surveyed regarding teacher attitudes by utilizing a validated survey (Kulinna & Silverman, 1999). Qualitative data analysis revealed the following themes: a) Physical Education Teacher Education (PETE) programs may not adequately prepare induction teachers for the realities of the classroom environment; b) cross-curricular integrations are valued; and c) physical activity for a lifetime is a primary curricular outcome. Results suggest that PETE curriculum may need to be modified to provide increased fidelity in the induction years of physical educators. In addition, these themes signify the influence of the socialization process and its relevance to the realities of induction physical educators.

AB  - Improving the reading ability of young students could hardly be a more urgent priority for our elementary schools. Two thirds of American fourth and eighth graders are not able to read proficiently--and the outcomes are far worse for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The National Assessment of Educational Progress in 2019 showed that only 35% of fourth graders and 34% of eighth graders were proficient in reading, and among students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, only 21% of fourth graders and 19% of eight graders were proficient. Schools have invested ever more time in reading instruction and often provide a "literacy block" that can stretch to two hours or more per day. By often mandating annual state testing in just reading and math--which many educators and commentators blame for narrowing the curriculum to the tested subjects--federal and state policies have contributed to this focus and to the marginalization of subjects like social studies. In this article, the authors analyzed nationally representative data from the federal Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010--11, which samples over 18,000 students in their kindergarten year and follows them through fifth grade. This longitudinal, nationally representative study collects semiannual or annual measures on students, their parents, teachers, and schools, including annual assessments in reading and math. It enables them to assess reading progress associated with school experiences from kindergarten through fifth grade. In the analysis, the authors focused on students for whom there was information on all student-level measures, as well as information on teacher-reported classroom time spent on different subjects. The analytic sample included 6,829 students. According to the the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, social studies was the only subject with a clear, positive, and statistically significant effect on reading improvement. In contrast, extra time spent on English Language Arts (ELA) instruction has no significant relationship with reading improvement. These results confirm that growing students' knowledge of the world through subjects other than ELA may be more effective in developing literacy than additional reading instruction.

AB  - A significant challenge in the field of early childhood special education is providing qualified personnel to serve young children with special needs and their families. Though many personnel development programs acknowledge the need for interdisciplinary preparation of diverse students who are culturally competent, faculty and trainees continue to search for strategies to address these recommended practices. The purpose of this article is to share practical ideas and specific features that can help personnel development programs prepare students in an interdisciplinary, multicultural context. Specific strategies presented were identified and successfully implemented through a special program at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, the "Diverse Urban Interdisciplinary Teams (DUIT)" project. The primary components of the model were: (1) a seminar that included activities for interdisciplinary teaming and a family mentoring experience; and (2) an interdisciplinary course with a fieldwork placement. The activities and content for each component were developed by faculty from early childhood special education, communication sciences and disorders, occupational therapy, and a parent of a child with a disability.

AB  - This article describes an experiential learning activity designed to promote the development of decision-making skills in international management students at the undergraduate level. Students from an undergraduate management science course in decision analysis served as consultants on a case assigned to teams in an international management class. Communication between groups and consultants was facilitated by the use of an Internet-based Web conferencing system. Surveys completed by international management students indicated that the exercise enhanced their understanding of the role of quantitative analysis in an important business decision and increased their confidence in the group's final recommendation in the case.

AB  - The aim of the 2018 International Association for Development of the Information Society (IADIS) Cognition and Exploratory Learning in the Digital Age (CELDA) conference was to address the main issues concerned with evolving learning processes and supporting pedagogies and applications in the digital age. There have been advances in both cognitive psychology and computing that have affected the educational arena. The convergence of these two disciplines is increasing at a fast pace and affecting academia and professional practice in many ways. Paradigms such as just-in-time learning, constructivism, student-centered learning and collaborative approaches have emerged and are being supported by technological advancements such as simulations, virtual reality and multi-agent systems. These developments have created both opportunities and areas of serious concerns. This conference aims to cover both technological as well as pedagogical issues related to these developments. Main tracks have been identified. However innovative contributions that do not easily fit into these areas will also be considered as long as they are directly related to the overall theme of the conference -- cognition and exploratory learning in the digital age. The CELDA 2018 Conference received 85 submissions from more than 31 countries. Each submission was reviewed in a double-blind review process by at least two independent reviewers to ensure quality and maintain high standards. Out of the papers submitted, 37 were accepted as full papers, 20 were accepted as short papers, and 5 were accepted as reflection papers. In addition to the presentation of full, short and reflection papers, the conference also includes one keynote presentation from internationally distinguished researcher, Professor Tobias Ley, Professor for Learning Analytics and Educational Innovation, Head of the Center of Excellence in Educational Innovation, Tallinn University, Estonia. Individual papers contain figures, tables, and references. An author index is provided.

AB  - The requirements engineering course is a core component of the curriculum for the Master's in Software Engineering programme, at Monmouth University (MU). It covers the process, methods and tools specific to this area, together with the corresponding software quality issues. The need to produce software engineers with strong teamwork and communication skills, capable of working in multidisciplinary teams, has been stressed repeatedly by industry world-wide. This paper reports on the multidisciplinary and active/collaborative approaches used in teaching requirements engineering at MU. To reinforce the concepts learned, students actively participate in their learning as they play different roles for eliciting requirements, or share their particular expertise with their teams when performing object-oriented analysis. The multidisciplinary experiment brought together software engineering and business management students. They collaborated to produce a software requirements specification for managerial processes involved in hiring and performance evaluation of employees within a firm. A description of the synchronization of the lectures with project deliverables in the two courses, different types of communication needed by students, positive interdependence of the teams across disciplines, and how they contributed to the success of the project will be discussed among other multidisciplinary issues encountered during this experiment.

AB  - Since 2005, the first-year engineering program at Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, has been significantly restructured to include more hands-on learning. A major grant (2004-2009) under the department level reform (DLR) program of the National Science Foundation (NSF) facilitated this restructuring. A number of hands-on learning modules were developed and implemented within a required first-semester undergraduate course. One of the modules introduced mechatronics. The goal of this module is to introduce first-year engineering students to a portion of the mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer engineering disciplines within a collaborative setting. Interestingly, while the largest portion of engineering students in the United States are enrolled in electrical and mechanical engineering programs, there is a disparity between the percentage of male engineering students and female engineering students within those disciplines relative to the overall distribution of all students among the various engineering disciplines. By introducing all engineering students to mechatronics before students declare their specific discipline, the college hopes to attract more females to programs that suffer from a greater gender disparity than is already found within the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. This paper discusses the details of the implementation of the mechatronics initiative and gives student feedback that includes overall perception of the initiative and perception by gender.

AB  - At Tecumseh Middle School in Indiana the technology education teachers are part of a team consisting of language arts, math, social studies, and science teachers who work together on items of common interest and student needs. There is a scheduled period each day for instructors to meet to develop plans and activities to help students become more productive. Science teacher Doug Hauser wanted to develop an activity that would provide the students with hands-on, inquiry-based learning. He studied the Indiana State Science Standards and determined that the area least covered was physical science, specifically forces and motion. He remembered producing a Pinewood Derby Car when he was younger, and really liked its possibilities. He purchased two of the kits and started looking for grants to purchase kits for the students. This article describes the different activities that the students were able to perform with these car kits. The purpose of this article is to provide some ideas or methods to encourage students to try harder and learn more as they participate in class.

AB  - This article discusses the results of an exploratory research project in which library and information studies (LIS) faculty and education faculty were asked about their views on teaching pre-service school librarians and teachers 21st Century Skills (as defined by the Partnership for 21st Century Skills) and librarian-teacher collaboration. Researchers used a case-study approach to investigate and compare the views and experiences of LIS faculty and education faculty at a research institution. Participants indicated their sense of which skills were taught in each discipline. In addition, they described their own experiences in collaborating with teachers and/or librarians, as well as their views on where collaboration was taught in their respective curricula, where it could be taught, and how it might be taught most effectively. Findings indicate that while education faculty members tend to have a broader view of LIS than do LIS faculty and see education and LIS as having largely overlapping concerns, collaboration is more likely to be a topic of discussion in LIS classes than in education classes. Faculty in both disciplines acknowledged that, while collaboration is desirable, it is often difficult to achieve in practice. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - Background: Empathy is an individual's capacity to understand the behavior of others, to experience their feelings, and to express that understanding to them. Empathic ability is an asset professionally for individuals, such as teachers, physicians and social workers, who work with people.  Being empathetic is also critical to our being able to live with others in general, and ultimately to leading happier lives. Subsequently it seems imperative to examine if and how it is possible to enhance people's empathic ability. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to use narrative review method to analyze studies of empathy training in human service and social science disciplines over the past thirty years to address the questions: "How have people been trained in empathy and what are the findings?" and "How was empathy training evaluated and how valid are these evaluation findings?" Setting: Not applicable. Intervention: Not applicable. Research Design: Not applicable. Data Collection and Analysis: Narrative review. Findings: Twenty-nine articles pertaining to empathy training evaluation research were identified based on an advanced computer search on the following databases: "Education Full Text," "ProQuest Education Journals," "Web of Knowledge" and "Educational Resources Information Center" (ERIC). Seven types of training methods were noted in these 29 evaluations with the most popular being didactic related (42%). All but two studies (93%) reported positive findings, mainly in regard to learning (86%), or the cognitive component of empathy. These findings suggest that regardless of the training method, individuals can learn about the concept of empathy. Unfortunately, information pertaining to the effects of training on individuals' feeling for others, and their ability and propensity to take the perspective of others and to demonstrate it in the natural environments is lacking. Consequently, very little is known about the trainability of the affective and behavioral components of empathy. Also, some of the findings were moderated by gender, age, education level, and time of measurement. Regarding evaluation research designs, most of the studies used self-reporting to collect trainees' knowledge about empathy and most of the quantitative studies used a control group and pretesting to examine training impact. Construct validity of both empathy measurement and training is very problematic. A majority of the studies did not clearly define empathy, provide training as defined, and/or measure what is being trained; conceptualization of empathy across studies was not consistent either.  In sum, data from the studies reviewed were neither complete nor valid enough to provide a clear and full understanding of the trainability of empathy. More research is apparently needed and hopefully lessons learned from our review will be considered in designing future studies. (Contains 9 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - The old division of labour between fundamental and applied or problem-oriented research has almost disappeared, and with it, the functional distinctions between universities, public labs and industrial and other private research. Doctoral research training can then also become diversified in terms of its content and its location. Closer analysis of ongoing changes, in particular, the emergence of a regime of strategic science, is necessary to specify requirements for a career in science in the coming decades. Disciplines as we know them may not be of major importance, but interdisciplinarity as such is not the answer. For universities, the key challenge is to diversify and recombine, both cognitively and institutionally, into what I call a post-modern university, which includes overlaps and alliances with centres (of excellence and relevance), public labs and various private organizations. In such a university, a doctoral student can wend his or her way through the types of locations, just as is to be expected of his or her later career.

AB  - In contemporary life and education, the local is marginalized in favor of large-scale economies of consumption that are indifferent to ecological concerns. The consequences of neglecting local human and natural communities include a degraded habitat, loss of wilderness, alienation, rootlessness, and lack of connection to communities. Place-based education responds to this indifference to local ecological concerns by grounding student learning in the experiences of their own lives, communities, and regions. Critical place-based pedagogy broadens the scope of place-based learning by incorporating critical theory into the curriculum of the local. This article describes a critical pedagogy of place as a prelude to describing contemporary art that is involved with ecological and social issues. Works of contemporary artists that are responsive to the ecology of local places and culture will be explored as examples of collaboration between artistic and scientific approaches. These artists suggest possibilities for the educator to create a critical pedagogy about place and to resist the isolation of the classroom from vital issues of community and ecology. The intersection of critical theory, place-based learning, and art education provides a robust framework for the theory and practice of education concerned with ecological issues.

AB  - In many western countries attention is currently being given to the participation of students in tertiary Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education. This is a result of internationally competing economic ambitions, coupled with acute shortages on the STEM labour market, a declining interest among students for STEM education and a long-lasting under-representation of women. However, despite similarities concerning policy attitudes and identified problems, western countries differ considerably from each other concerning the percentages of students that choose STEM education and the proportion of female students included here. Based on an indepth study in Sweden, the UK, the US and the Netherlands, this article investigates the reasons for these cross-national differences. At the heart of the explanations lie the accessibility of the STEM pipeline, the level of broad-based interdisciplinary studies as opposed to compartmentalization and early specialization, labour market characteristics, social traditions and government policies.

AB  - Dual degree programmes are becoming increasingly common at universities, especially in the USA. A dual degree programme at the University of Arizona now includes the additional and systematic study of the critical field of entrepreneurship by students studying for dual degree qualifications in business and science or engineering. All participants in the programme undertake formal studies and training in entrepreneurship, leading to the award of a certificate. Thus the programme offers students the opportunity to acquire a regular MBA degree, another Master's degree in a specific domain of science or technology and a certificate in entrepreneurship, all in under two years.

AB  - At the first-year Joint Course, supervisors from both Tromsø University College and the University of Tromsø participated. Supervisors represented two institutions with different educational outlooks and different approaches to the task at hand. In my view, deep-seated professional disagreement was allowed to affect the course throughout without being properly dealt with. The disagreement applied not only to the methods used, the themes and learning objectives, but to the very justification of the first-year Joint Course.

AB  - This article describes how an interdisciplinary science class uses visuals in ways that can be adapted across disciplines and academic levels. The key to the use of visuals is that they are integral to the learning of the students, whether we begin with visuals to improve writing and thinking or use written texts as the basis for visual interpretation. The article is based on our research and teaching of "Oceans: Past and Present" as a core senior course at The McCallie School. Through specific projects and learning activities we argue that visuals, "seeing," and revisioning all become tools to advance understanding, to improve writing and learning, and to promote synthesis and evaluation of written texts. Through collaboration, connections between visuals and music, or visuals and metaphorical language to reinforce concepts, we learn right along with our students, a risky but rewarding experience.

AB  - Schools should offer a programmed course to orient its pupils to current developments in the field of science; a course which will generate an appreciation and awareness of existing improvements in health education. Colleges must provide a graduate level inservice course to train teachers as well as an undergraduate interdisciplinary academic course. The intent of the course would be to educate nonprofessionals about the most commonly known and frequently occurring medical Problems. (Author)

AB  - Many approaches to make mathematics relevant to first-year engineering students have been described. These include teaching practical engineering applications, or a close collaboration between engineering and mathematics teaching staff on unit design and teaching. In this paper, we report on a novel approach where we gave higher year engineering and multimedia students the task to "make maths relevant" for first-year students. This approach is novel as we moved away from the traditional thinking that staff should produce these resources to students producing the same. These students have more recently undertaken first-year mathematical study themselves and can also provide a more mature student perspective to the task than first-year students. Two final-year engineering students and three final-year multimedia students worked on this project over the Australian summer term and produced two animated videos showing where concepts taught in first-year mathematics are applied by professional engineers. It is this student perspective on how to make mathematics relevant to first-year students that we investigate in this paper. We analyse interviews with higher year students as well as focus groups with first-year students who had been shown the videos in class, with a focus on answering the following three research questions: (1) How would students demonstrate the relevance of mathematics in engineering? (2) What are first-year students' views on the resources produced for them? (3) Who should produce resources to demonstrate the relevance of mathematics? There seemed to be some disagreement between first- and final-year students as to how the importance of mathematics should be demonstrated in a video. We therefore argue that it should ideally be a collaboration between higher year students and first-year students, with advice from lecturers, to produce such resources.

AB  - This article presents the author's response to "Evolution, Biology, and Society: A Conversation for the 21st-Century Sociology Classroom" by Richard Machalek and Michael Martin. Their work serves as a reminder that the discipline is diverse and dynamic. The author appreciates the effort to urge sociology teachers to include genetic concepts in lower-division courses, but he does not share the enthusiasm for sociobiology. The author suggests that the call to include genetic principles in the sociology curriculum is part of a historic effort to discuss social patterns in terms that are individualistic. He offers his views on the role of freshman-level courses in an academy where the boundaries of fields are shifting.

AB  - The two main statements of the second law of thermodynamics were given by Clausius, and Kelvin and Planck. Other statements followed well into the 20th century. It is known that the two main statements are not exactly equivalent, although their differences may never show outside academic environments or very specific areas of science. At negative absolute temperatures, a phenomenon studied mainly in connection to the constitution of matter and to its behavior under specific electromagnetic conditions, the non-equivalence of the two major statements, appears. Whereas the Kelvin-Planck statement must be modified to remain true, the Clausius statement remains true unaltered. This article proposes a deduction of the Clausius equality and inequality from the Clausius statement only, thus, inheriting its validity in the domain of negative absolute temperatures. The deduction developed here uses a simple arrangement of Carnot engines and a conceptualization of a system with very loose constraints. As a result, the level of generality achieved is high and includes both positive and negative absolute temperatures. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - As elementary social science methods instructors, the authors observed a need in their student population for instructional methods that would engage students in the content, process, and values of geography instruction. Their initial purpose was to create an instructional model that pre-service teachers could adapt and use in their future classrooms. In this article, they discuss an activity they created, the Dog Tales Project--a student-centered project that encompasses a multi-disciplinary approach to learning mapping strategies, technological media literacy skills, and cross-curricular instruction--to meet their students' needs as elementary classroom teachers. They present steps on how to create a Dog Tales Project. (Contains 1 figure and 3 notes.)

AB  - The aim of this article is to encourage a greater emphasis on creativity across and between varied fields of endeavour. It has been written to underline the interdisciplinary significance of creativity and the role of creativity in truly enhancing achievement. There is a reinvigorated awareness of the need for "big thinking", a global concern that the Australian Government (April 2008) profiled in its 2020 Summit. Essentially, "big thinking" involves being a connection-maker together with being a creative problem-finder and problem-solver. It is imagination and originality valued within a social context. While welcoming and exploring the powerful vision of the 2020 summit, the article also aims to encourage its application to daily life. While creativity is included as one of the 'General Capabilities" in the new National Curriculum for Australia (ACARA, 2010), it needs to be kept in focus to ensure that creativity is pervasive throughout the curriculum, and not just an 'add-on" activity.

AB  - The purposes of this study were to develop instruments that assess public knowledge of nanotechnology (PKNT), public attitudes toward nanotechnology (PANT) and conduct a pilot study for exploring the relationship between PKNT and PANT. The PKNT test was composed of six scales involving major nanotechnology concepts, including size and scale, structure of matter, size-dependent properties, forces and interactions, tools and instrumentation, as well as science, technology, and society. After item analysis, 26 multiple-choice questions were selected for the PKNT test with a KR-20 reliability of 0.91. Twenty items were developed in the PANT questionnaire which can be classified as scales of trust in government and industry, trust in scientists, and perception of benefit and risk. Cronbach alpha for the PANT questionnaire was 0.70. In a pilot study, 209 citizens, varying in age, were selected to respond to the instruments. Results indicated that about 70% of respondents did not understand most of the six major concepts involving nanotechnology. The public tended to distrust government and industry and their levels of trust showed no relationship to their levels of knowledge about nanotechnology. However, people perceived that nanotechnology provided high benefits and high risks. Their perceptions of the benefits and risks were positively related with their knowledge level of nanotechnology. People's trust showed a negative relationship to their risk perception. Implications for using these instruments in research are discussed in this paper.

AB  - All schools are located in "watersheds," land that drains into bodies of water. Some watersheds, like the one which encompasses the school discussed in this article, include bodies of water that are walking distance from the school. The watershed cited in this article has a brook and wetland within a several-block walk from the school. This watershed was used as a hands-on research cite during the school year. In the process, students and their teachers explored Earth, life, and physical science concepts, learned about the local environment, and became engaged in a truly interdisciplinary study that hasn't stopped yet. A description of the ongoing adventure is included in this article. (Contains 4 figures, 1 resource and 3 online resources.)

AB  - University art and design programs are branching out and creating cross-disciplinary programs and research centers that connect design students and faculty across various disciplines such as business, engineering, architecture, information studies, health sciences and education. A human-centered, problem-based approach to design research looks to position industry and academic leaders to work alongside students, community leaders, artists and non-profits to develop creative and innovative solutions to the challenges facing contemporary society. But, as these challenges become more global in scope, participatory design research and the Internet become critical tools in addressing cultural differences in visual and verbal messages. This paper looks at the role of social networking tools and participatory research in addressing cross-cultural and multicultural challenges. It addresses the question: can the use of classroom collaboration, participatory design research and online critique and workspaces encourage creativity, innovation and critical thinking in student and professional designers?

AB  - The author is skeptical about the implications of neuroscience for education currently and into the near future. His skepticism derives from several concerns, but a common theme runs through all of them: attempts to link neuroscience with education pay insufficient attention to psychology. In this article, the author presents four variations on this theme. First, for those who are committed to developing a science-based pedagogy and solving existing instructional problems, cognitive psychology offers a mother-lode of still largely untapped knowledge. Second, attempts to link developmental neurobiology to brain development and education ignore, or are inconsistent with, what cognitive psychology tells individuals about teaching and learning. Third, cognitive neuroscience is the brain-based discipline that is most likely to generate educationally relevant insights, but cognitive neuroscience presupposes cognitive psychology and, to date, rarely constrains existing cognitive models. And fourth, the methods of cellular and molecular neuroscience are powerful, but it is not always clear that the concepts of learning and memory used by neuroscientists are the same as those used by psychologists, let alone by classroom teachers.

AB  - It is essential that the roots of the division in western culture presented by CP Snow's "Two Cultures" be examined in order to view their many present day ramifications and solutions. The purpose of this paper is to explore the dichotomy of our artistic and scientific origins biologically, socially, economically, spiritually and emotionally. This will also bring into question the validity of these preferential attitudes. Is this division an empirical shared realty or more of a perceived orchestrated reality? By examining these origins and the subsequent paths leading to the contemporary state in western culture one may perhaps be able to focus on the benefits of striking a balance between the arts and sciences in our educational systems as well as in our daily lives. This reflection on our dual nature hopes to shed some light on the principals of our universal connections and solutions in our multi-layered human existence. As a visual artist and art educator, I will also illustrate this division or lack thereof throughout past and contemporary art examples. The culture that Snow talks about carries itself many questions as to exactly who he is talking about. The multiplicity in our society is so diverse that it is hard to classify Snow's definition of culture. For the sake of this paper I will try to loosely target the mainstream of western culture. A familiar eastern axiom speaks of the parts of a whole as being crucial aspects to a complete unity. It is prefaced by the prudent warning that no part is greater than their sum. If the arts and the sciences analogously are the parts to a complete scope of humanity, segmenting and elevating one over the other will fragment our perspective and render humanity's heirs unfortunately incomplete.

AB  - Whether it is "e-research" in Australia, "cyberinfrastructure" in the United States, the "grid" in Europe, or "e-science" in the United Kingdom, a transformation is clearly occurring in research practice, a transformation that will have a profound impact on the roles of information professionals within higher education. Research is becoming more multidisciplinary, more collaborative, more global, and more dependent on the capabilities offered through advanced networks and large data storage. "E-science" is described as a large-scale, distributed, collaborative science enabled by the Internet and related technologies. "E-research" is a broader term that includes nonscientific research, but also refers to large-scale, distributed, national, or global collaboration in research. This article discusses how these changes can provide new opportunities and challenges for information professionals within higher education, who must bring their know-how forward and actively engage in strengthening partnerships with each other and with the researchers within their own institutions if they are to continue to be a relevant and important part of the research endeavors of their institutions.

AB  - This article describes a visual approach to integrating observational data into self-evaluation and peer review of teaching, practices that can lead to adoption of evidence-based active-learning strategies in STEM. This approach was designed to be implemented for undergraduate courses across disciplines. The presentation of observational data in a timeline provides a "big-picture" view of an observed class that captures the sequencing of instructional strategies and the "ebbs and flows" of student participation--in a chronological format that coheres with how instructors often visualize a class session.

AB  - John Swales's 1986 article "Citation analysis and discourse analysis" was written by a discourse analyst to introduce citation research from other fields, mainly sociology of science, to his own discipline. Here, I introduce applied linguists and discourse analysts to citation studies from information science, a complementary tradition not emphasized by Swales. Using replicable biblio-metric techniques, I show that interdisciplinary ties have grown among citation researchers from discourse analysis, sociology of science, and information science in the years since Swales wrote. Key authors, journals, articles, and books are  presented in tables based on cocitation data from the Institute for Scientific Information. While theoretical integration of the different strands of research is far from complete, this article carries the effort forward by reviewing contributions from the 1970s to the present in three major lines of research: citation classification, content analysis of citation contexts, and studies of citer motivations. I pay particular attention to ideas that bear on teaching the art of citing--for example, in courses in English for research purposes--and to controversies in citation research of interest to discourse analysts.

AB  - Learning communities gained attention in 1984 after the publication of the "Involvement in Learning" report, which was sponsored by the U.S. Education Department. The authors of the report stated that active engagement in learning processes enhances learning and leads to two fundamental principles: (1) The amount of student learning and personal development associated with any educational program is directly proportional to the quality and quantity of student involvement; and (2) The effectiveness of any educational policy or practice is directly related to the capacity of that policy or practice to increase student involvement in learning (NIE 1984). In order to address these limitations, a mobile learning environment (MLE) is being developed. This MLE will provide communication and collaboration tools that enable virtual interactions to take place which are independent of time and location--replacing the need for common residence halls and face-to- face meetings outside of the classroom. MLE makes it possible to create virtual learning communities (VLCs) that incorporate all of the positive aspects of traditional LCs, but without their time and space limitations. This article presents an MLE to support VLCs in science and mathematics in its early stages of a multidisciplinary research project.

AB  - Investigating the field of engineering offers the opportunity for interdisciplinary, hands-on, inquiry-based units that integrate real-world applications. However, many K-12 students are not exposed to engineering until they enter college. Get a Grip! is a problem-based unit that places middle school students in the role of engineers who are challenged to design and construct prosthetic arms for amputees in a war-torn country. The students use common materials to build arms that accomplish tasks requiring fine motor control and strength. A critical component of the unit is its ability to demonstrate to middle school students that strong, interdisciplinary knowledge is required to solve engineering problems. As such, it is a practical and efficient mode of interdisciplinary instruction meeting state and national standards in science, math, reading, and social studies. This article discusses the structure of Get a Grip! (Contains 2 figures and 1 online resource.)

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to generate both a theoretical and an empirical basis for a research model that serves in further research as an analytical tool for understanding the complex phenomenon of learning at different levels in a work organisation. The key concept in this model is the routine concept of Nelson and Winter. Design/methodology/approach: A review of the literature in the academic fields of educational sciences, industrial sciences, economics, social psychology and sociology is used to develop a conceptual model that could serve as an analytical instrument to describe the ongoing dynamics, i.e. learning processes at different levels. The theoretical findings were tested against empirical data of an industrial bakery in order to evaluate if the theoretical concepts help to identify possible mechanisms that account for parallel learning processes at different levels. Findings: The paper gives an overview of possible key concepts that helps in explaining what happens at the intersection between individual and team, and team and organisation. This paper concludes that the concept of routines is the most sufficient for understanding the coordinating mechanism between the different aggregation levels in an organisation. Research limitations/implications: As organisations are modelled as a set of interlocking routines, innovation can be understood as the change of routines. The central question in future research is: "How do routines change?". Originality/value: By taking a multi-disciplinary approach, economic theories on innovation and educational theories on learning are combined. Such combination seems fruitful to bridge individual and organisational learning. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)

AB  - In "The two cultures and the scientific revolution," C.P. Snow (1959) described the chasm between pure and applied science, on the one hand, and the arts and humanities, on the other. Snow was concerned that the complete lack of understanding between these "two cultures" would hamper the spread of the scientific/industrial revolution from rich nations to poor. Because of his conviction that this revolution had made lives longer and more comfortable for people of developed nations, he forcefully argued that the two intellectual cultures must be bridged--the sooner the better. The gap between these two cultures, of course, still exists. Meanwhile, the arts are neglected in primary and secondary schools. Further, the science vocabulary of adults in the U.S. appears to be so poor that a scientific theory is considered suspect simply because it is "just a theory". Such problems may create increased competition between the two cultures. A probable result would be short-sighted prescriptive measures that are at best worthless and at worst dangerous to the mission of bridging the two cultures. A better approach may be to examine interdisciplinary fields where this gap seems less wide, for clues to a bridge.

AB  - The communication skills of reading and writing go hand in hand with science as natural partners for fostering students' understandings of the world. The similarities that exist between reading and writing strategies and science-process skills add depth to instruction when these subject areas are brought together. In the following unit of study, students use science-process skills as they observe and record changes in the Moon's appearance. Their growing knowledge of the Moon and its phases is strengthened through reading and writing strategies. (Contains 1 figure and 5 resources.)

AB  - Practice-based interprofessional education (IPE), a key feature in developing a collaboration-ready workforce, is poorly integrated in healthcare curriculums. This study aimed to synthesise educator perspectives on implementing practice-based IPE and develop recommendations to inform sustainable practice-based IPE. An ethnographic case study was carried out at a school of allied health. Data collection involved six observations, 11 interviews and a review of eight documents. Reflexive thematic analysis, informed by Normalisation Process Theory, established two key themes. First, we found that strategic planning is needed, with a coherent implementation agenda and planned reflection on activities. Second, building partnerships with placement partners was identified as essential. This can be achieved by supporting and championing practice-based IPE activities developed by placement sites and establishing how university and clinical educators can work collaboratively to deliver sustainable practice-based IPE. These conditions create a favourable environment for normalising practice-based IPE in healthcare curriculums, benefitting students, patients, and the overall healthcare service.

AB  - In a discussion about architecture, the author's students learned that architects must consider their client's needs when designing a home. To complement their study of bird migration in science class, the author decided to ask students to "think like a bird" in order to design wooden birdhouses that they could take home and actually use. This article presents a project which gives students the opportunity to use their knowledge of bird migration and architecture to design and build a better birdhouse and provide a place for neighborhood birds to enjoy as well.

AB  - The paper addresses the apparent lack of impact of "history in mathematics education" in mathematics education research in general, and proposes new avenues for research. We identify two general scenarios of integrating history in mathematics education that each gives rise to different problems. The first scenario occurs when history is used as a "tool" for the learning and teaching of mathematics, the second when history of mathematics as a "goal" is pursued as an integral part of mathematics education. We introduce a multiple-perspective approach to history, and suggest that research on history in mathematics education follows one of two different avenues in dealing with these scenarios. The first is to focus on students' development of mathematical competencies when history is used a tool for the learning of curriculum-dictated mathematical in-issues. A framework for this is described. Secondly, when using history as a goal it is argued that an anchoring of the meta-issues in the related in-issues is essential, and a framework for this is given. Both frameworks are illustrated through empirical examples.

AB  - Australia holds some of the most unique, diverse and vulnerable ecosystems in the world, ranging from marine, coral reefs, to the arid and semi-arid outback, to tropical rainforests. Young children's perceptions of, and attitudes to their environment carry with them into adulthood, determining their capacity to learn about and interact with their world. To sustain Australia's unique landscapes it is essential that these future adults have an informed knowledge of the role, value and function of the country's environment. To ensure that we are helping the youth of today understand the natural environment we must first determine their current perceptions of it. This research describes an Arts/Science nexus; while traditional data collection methods, such as surveys, interviews and focus groups are often used to determine children's understandings, these methods are limited by their reliance on words. Children, particularly young children, do not always have the words to describe what they see, think or feel. The Arts, however, can be used as tools to help children express their ideas and feelings. So our research question was: how can we use an arts-based methodology to determine children's perceptions of their environment? To answer this question, five arts-based strategies were trialled, tested and refined. This article elucidates these different strategies, including the methods used and the impact of these methods on children's expression of their environmental understandings. It concludes with a description of the researchers' key learnings relating to arts-based data collection methods to determine children's environmental perceptions.

AB  - Genomics profoundly affects society, because genome sequence information is widely used in such areas as genetic testing, genomic medicine/vaccine development, and so forth. Therefore, a responsibility to modernize science curricula exists for "post-genome era" educators. At my university, we developed a BS biotechnology program within a liberal arts framework, without major cost or radical curriculum revision. Outcomes have included enrollment growth, interdisciplinary opportunities, enhanced faculty-student research, and modern science laboratories that benefit biotechnology majors and nonscience students.

AB  - Over the past fifty years, federal and state governments, colleges and universities, and other organizations have developed and supported numerous policies and practices that are designed to promote student success. Among the most extensive and visible efforts are the federally sponsored programs established under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, including the federal Pell grant program, Stafford student loan program, and TRIO programs. Despite the substantial investment in these and other programs, gaps in student success persist. Based on its review of student success research, the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) noted the need "for a more conceptual and reflective approach to notions of access, retention, success, and opportunity that takes into account the multiple pathways that individuals take to postsecondary attainment and acknowledges the variability of how these terms are defined by different consumers, communities, and policymakers" (2005, p. 21). This monograph addresses this need by proposing an overarching conceptual framework that policymakers, practitioners, and researchers may use to guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of policies and practices for improving success for all students and reducing persisting racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic gaps in student success. The framework does not provide a model for understanding any specific student success outcome or stage, but it is designed to bring order to the wide array of theoretical and methodological approaches that, only when considered together, provide a comprehensive understanding of the ways that policymakers and practitioners may more usefully intervene to effectively promote student success. After describing the authors' approach and procedures, the monograph presents the results of a multidisciplinary examination of the theoretical and methodological approaches that researchers have used to inform knowledge and understanding of student success. Then, the monograph presents and describes a conceptual model for tying these perspectives together. The monograph concludes with recommended uses of the proposed model for policy, practice, and further research. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - Discusses science education in the United States, which is in the midst of an unprecedented reform movement driven by national standards developed with support from the federal government. These standards are redefining the character of science education from kindergarten to the post-graduate education of scientists and science teachers. The new vision for science education is science literacy for all. (Author/VWL)

AB  - The study of mentoring has generally been conducted within disciplinary silos with a specific type of mentoring relationship as a focus. The purpose of this article is to quantitatively review the three major areas of mentoring research (youth, academic, workplace) to determine the overall effect size associated with mentoring outcomes for proteges. We also explored whether the relationship between mentoring and protege outcomes varied by the type of mentoring relationship (youth, academic, workplace). Results demonstrate that mentoring is associated with a wide range of favorable behavioral, attitudinal, health-related, relational, motivational, and career outcomes, although the effect size is generally small. Some differences were also found across type of mentoring. Generally, larger effect sizes were detected for academic and workplace mentoring compared to youth mentoring. Implications for future research, theory, and applied practice are provided.

AB  - This article presents research concerning the way in which primary school pupils in southern Spain interpret the concepts of population and species. The results show that, for the concept of population, there was an intense anthropocentrism in pupils' responses, while for the concept of species, only animals were considered as living creatures. These interpretations influence the vision that the students will develop of ecosystems and biodiversity, as well as their respect and care for living beings. We propose some suggestions in order to improve the teaching of these concepts in primary education.

AB  - This article draws on Gee's notions of Discourse and specifically Discourse Models to explore Engineering Problem Solving1 and the different ways in which it can be understood in an engineering context. After Gee we attempt to identify aspects of doing, being and valuing that underpin people's Problem Solving Discourse Models. Interviews with three engineering lecturers reveal that they draw extensively on two different Discourse Models of Engineering Problem Solving. The more highly valued Model (Integrated Design Model) reflects engineering practice, is located in engineering design and dependant on judgement. The other is located in the classroom and involves the algorithmic resolution of mathematical models, (Knowledge Construction Model). These Discourse Models form a backdrop to interviews with three students entering an engineering degree programme for the first time. The three students each draw different Discourse Models of Problem Solving, and display characteristics (such as the level of confidence) that align more or less with Engineering Problem Solving, sometimes obscuring their understanding. The implications of these findings in terms of an introductory engineering course are discussed. These include recognising the potential diversity of Problem Solving Discourse Models our students bring to tertiary education, as well as the difficulty of introducing a legitimate design project requiring the level of judgement needed to interpret open-ended, ill-defined problems and then integrate multiple quantitative models with multidisciplinary qualitative judgements in a rigorous manner.

AB  - For more than 20 years, Joel Michell has explicated the properties and requirements of quantitative measurement, in books, papers, conference papers, and workshops. In 1997, he published "Quantitative Science and the Definition of Measurement in Psychology." In his paper, Michell deals with facts about measurement. The author of this article contends that Michell's thesis has real-world consequences and people are living through them now. The most important of these is that while psychometricians have advanced their thinking and technical sophistication over the past 40 years, the practical consequences have been almost nonexistent except in the domain of educational testing and various examination scenarios. In this article, the author provides his views on Michell's target article.

AB  - Drawing upon Lacanian psychoanalytic theory, neuroscience brain research, and the practices of contemporary artists Ann Hamilton, Jasper Johns, Elizabeth Murray, and Oliver Herring, this article argues for the relevance of conscious and unconscious knowledge in artistic practice. Parallels drawn between Lacanian psychoanalytic clinical practice and artistic practice demonstrate a meaningful interdisciplinary alliance forged through a shared interest in conferring agency on the unconscious. The description of a recent graduate art education course, designed around artistic practices with conscious and unconscious knowledge, strongly exemplifies the pedagogical implications of the foregoing investigation.

The first article examines the place of the argumentation and debate course in the speech communication curriculum and suggests cognitive and behavioral objectives and assignments for use in such a course. The second article discusses teaching debate within the philosophy department. It suggests that philosophical reflection can be of great assistance to debate students and their coaches, and contends that making debate part of an interdisciplinary course will stress the unity of human knowledge by showing students how evidence is used to support conclusions in the physical, biological, and social sciences, as well as the humanities.

AB  - Much of the research on students' understanding of the greenhouse effect and global warming reports poor results. Students are claimed to hold misconceptions and naive beliefs, and the impact of teaching on their conceptions is also low. In the present study, these results are called into question, and it is argued that they may to a large extent be seen as artifacts of the research methods deployed, in particular when written questionnaires are used. When following students' project work in school over a long period, many of the misunderstandings reported in the literature do not appear. It is argued that the appropriation and use of scientific language when discussing complex socioscientific issues is a gradual process. When observing the language and mediational means students use over time, it is obvious that they are able to identify and use central distinctions in their interactions. They are also able to make productive use of texts and other materials that allow them to successively approximate scientific modes of reasoning. Thus, what students know emerges in communicative practices where they interact with others and with cultural tools in a focused activity. It is argued that students' knowledge of complex multidisciplinary phenomena of this kind may be particularly ill-suited to conventional questionnaire types of testing.

AB  - Interprofessional education (IPE) is on today's agenda in medical education as a response to advances in medicine, the changes that have taken place in healthcare delivery, and pressures from the public and the profession. Although attention has focused on IPE in the later stages of the education program, there are benefits to be gained from the introduction of IPE in the early years. Curriculum developments supporting this include the adoption of outcome-based education and vertical integration. There is also a recognition that students' attitudes and biases are formed early in their education and the appropriate learning environment in the early years is important. Interprofessional education in the early years can also be seen as a part of a more general trend to greater collaboration in the delivery of an education program in the healthcare professions. Anatomy by incorporating IPE can help shape the future of medical education as well as being shaped by it. The possibility of success or failure with IPE can be captured with the equation IPE?=?(V × I)/N, where V?=?the IPE vision, I?=?the implementation strategy and N?=?negative perceptions of the approach. Success is more likely where there is a well thought out and shared vision for what is to be achieved, an appropriate implementation strategy and a plan to counteract a negative mind-set.

AB  - Several years ago, after a career of teaching biochemistry and introductory biology, the author decided to offer a course for biology majors on biological explanations of social phenomena (Biosocial Problems in Contemporary America). His goal in examining these topics was to help students develop critical-thinking skills that would allow them to consider the truth of these explanations. In reading any scientific paper, students need to understand the nature of evidence, assess the reliability of data, and recognize how an argument is being presented; in addition they need to assess how political or social dimensions influence what people perceive to be truth. In this article, the author describes Biosocial Problems in Contemporary America, a course on the use and misuse of scientific knowledge. His effort in this course is not primarily to arrive at any final judgments as to the validity of the arguments presented, but rather to explore the criteria for studies that might help to answer the complex issues at the nexus of biology and social issues.

AB  - I argue that there is potential for collaborative work between science educators and citizenship educators. However, following comments about that potential, I raise a number of challenges. Those challenges relate to the public perception of science, narrow academic perspectives of some science educators, and problematic attempts to develop a form of science education that, at times, some have claimed is relevant to--or, even, a form of--citizenship education. The latter point is considered with reference to some science educators' perceptions concerning the nature of citizenship and citizenship education. I argue that the perceptions of some science educators seem to suggest significant differences in understanding from at least some of those who would regard themselves as citizenship education specialists. In the final main section of the article, I suggest, briefly, some ways in which further work to develop collaboration between science educators and citizenship educators could be considered.

AB  - A database of 406 articles published in 2000 in 17 specialist higher education journals, based outside North America, is analysed in terms of whether a theoretical perspective is adopted. In the majority of cases, any theoretical perspective is only implicit, and broader engagement with theory is absent. Where theory is explicit, the authors appear more likely to be based in a social science department or academic development unit, rather than an education department or higher education research centre. The implications of this analysis for the development of higher education research as an interdisciplinary field of study are explored.

AB  - The purpose of the current research was to examine the effects of a sequence of classroom activities that integrated mathematics content with music elements aimed at providing teachers an alternative approach for teaching mathematics. Two classes of third grade students (n = 56) from an elementary school in the west coast of the United States participated in the research. A random assignment pretest-posttest control group design was used to examine students' changes in mathematical ability between the two groups. A quasi-experiment time series design with multiple pretests, midtests and posttests was utilized for investigating the effects of music-mathematics lessons on students' mathematics process ability level. The results demonstrated that the intervention of music-mathematics integrated lessons had statistically significant improvement on the music group students' mathematical abilities.

AB  - E-learning experiences are widely becoming common practice in many schools, tertiary institutions and other organisations. However despite this increased use of technology to enhance learning and the associated investment involved the result does not always equate to more engaged, knowledgeable and skilled learners. We have observed two key prevalences. The first is an ingrained, and often unquestioned, set of beliefs and expectations held by the majority of people who have experienced formal education, and who are involved in the development of eLearning and blended learning experiences. These beliefs tend to impact the overall design of what a blended type of learning experience might consist of. The second prevalence is for educational institutions to embark on large-scale eLearning developments, which by their scale can prove problematic. In part because it is a long time before the school or organisation sees any benefit and there is an up-front cost before any learning value is realised. In this paper we will be discussing our experiences of the implementation of a large-scale blended-learning project at Unitec, a tertiary institution in Aotearoa, New Zealand. Approaches taken to implement the development were iterative and based on a phased rollout, with each subsequent stage being informed by the ones before it. Our discussion draws on personal reflections associated with three different perspectives and a variety of roles during the three initial phases of the change making process. Our overall aim is to share our contextualised experiences, to add to the knowledge base on blended learning, and to provide some general, practical recommendations.

AB  - Leading institutions of higher education are increasingly utilizing the campus as a laboratory not only for implementing "green projects" but also for developing the skill set of students to lead the deep organizational change necessary for sustainability. This case study of "Sustainability and the Campus" at the University of Michigan, one of the most established and largest interdisciplinary campus sustainability courses, assesses this skill building through surveys, participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and focus groups. The sample includes 64 current and former students and 11 staff who served as project sponsors. The results reveal that while student learning and project "success" are not directly correlated, students gain a deep understanding of change management complexity and build leadership skills as well as confidence while bolstering their resumes. From a staff perspective, benefits flow as much from the interaction with students, in terms of building mutual respect and shared understanding, as from the direct outcomes. While student labor is not "free" in terms of time and energy, there is no substitute for the enthusiasm, creativity, and perspective that students bring to campus sustainability projects when coupled with the appropriate scope, expectations, and communication. Key factors for project and course success include: active instructor engagement in group dynamics and project management, carefully managing student and staff expectations, and designing projects while simultaneously planning follow-up. Using systems thinking for organizational change as the linking concept between class sessions and group projects provides intellectual continuity and an opportunity for expansive thinking about leadership and change management.

AB  - A straightforward procedure for the synthesis of (Ph[subscript 3]P)[subscript 3]CuCF[subscript 3], a robust, air-stable trifluoromethylating agent, is reported herein. This preparation can be completed in a single 3 h laboratory session and typically provides ample yields (~79--86%) and high purity (>90%). The target complex is characterized by students primarily using heteronuclear ([superscript 19]F, [superscript 31]P) NMR methods. A 30 min application experiment, using this product, has also been developed in which students are able to trifluoromethylate an aryl iodide on an NMR scale and monitor their reaction progress using [superscript 19]F NMR.

AB  - In recent years, bio-inspired approach to design has gained considerable interest between designers, engineers and end-users. However, there are difficulties in introducing bio-inspiration concepts in the university curriculum in that they involve multi-disciplinary work, which can only possibly be successfully delivered by a team with integrated competencies. The aim of this work is summarising the results of the first workshop on bio-inspired design carried out at the Hybrid Design Lab of Seconda Universita di Napoli, involving Year 2 students of the BSc in Industrial Design. The common theme proposed for their projects was "Bio-inspired design of sport". Ideally, a sport item would need to respond to a number of exigencies, including safety, comfort, zero-energy balance and/or use of renewable energy sources, multi-functionality. The common aim of the projects was investigating in which cases bio-inspiration can assist in the fulfilment of the above exigencies. The students were asked to present examples from nature and, via an abstraction process, to apply them to the design of sport items. Finally, they were required to clarify the nature and the extent of bio-inspiration in their projects. Some of the projects, which were considered more interesting and realisable, are reported and briefly commented, especially on the nature, extent and appropriateness of their bio-inspiration. A test for feedback has been given to the students, whose scope, structure and general outcome is also discussed.

AB  - Each of the presenters of the invitational symposium, State of the Science: Nurses and Social Workers Supporting Family Caregivers, identified the saliency of family caregiving issues for practice, research, and the education of professional social workers, caregivers, the business community, and the public to enhance support of family caregivers. Numerous suggestions for curriculum and training were put forth, such as creating interdisciplinary caregiving curricula for nurses and social workers and including caregivers in the training. As concluding comments to this supplemental issue, the author's focus is on the implications for professional BSW and MSW social work education. She concurs with the presenters' recommendations that changes in doctoral education; in policy, research, and practice; in training with family caregivers; and in alliances with direct care workers are all critical to supporting family caregivers. In the short term there is a compelling need to address the continuum of social work education, beginning with preparing human service graduates in community colleges; then BSW, MSW, and doctoral programs; and lastly, lifelong learning opportunities of continuing education and licensure and certification requirements. As noted by several presenters, certification or licensure in key elements of family care such as assessment and care coordination, and national competency standards for care managers would help ensure that nurses and social workers have an appropriate foundation of knowledge and, over time, influence what and how competencies are taught in social work field and classroom curricula. The author fully endorses the symposium recommendations that nurses and social work students need to acquire competencies for effective practice with family caregivers of older adults. At the same time, as a long-time social work educator, she is realistic about the challenges of adding new competencies and content to professional degree curricula that inherently have to address a wide range of practice interventions, populations, and fields of practice along with the intersections of practice and policy. Drawing on her 10 years of experience with Hartford-funded curricular development projects, the author briefly suggests some change strategies and lessons learned to promote the education of social workers to be competent in their work with family caregivers.

AB  - This twenty-first century study serves as an umbrella that incorporates history, ethnography, languages, mathematics, geography, art, and of course, astronomy. Obviously, archaeoastronomy is a deeply interdisciplinary pursuit and clearly adapts to modern-day science curriculum content standards. From extensive educational research, the authors know the effective way to learn is to actually perform scientific investigation. The intent is to expose students to the astronomical practices of the ancients; therefore, the most sensible activity they can offer them is an actual hands-on outdoor star-watch. Several preparation activities will help prime students for this culminating evening observation.

AB  - The purpose of this manuscript is to describe how elementary teachers used their experiences in a storytelling inservice training to teach lessons in language arts, science, social studies, and bilingual education. Qualitative research methods were used in simultaneously collecting and analyzing data. Storytelling was found to be a valuable tool for motivating students to listen and engage in content area lessons, improve reading skills in the content areas, and as a springboard for beginning units and skill development. Teachers' understandings and implementation of classroom storytelling were heightened as a result of their participation in the inservice training and subsequent qualitative study. The teachers described in this manuscript were involved in a one-day storytelling inservice and participated in a subsequent qualitative study of their experiences with the storytelling training session and the implementation of storytelling in their classrooms. Storytelling was found to be effective in creating interest and improving reading skills in activities associated with social studies, science, language arts, and bilingual education.

AB  - Technology education has the means of becoming the catalyst for integrated content and curricula, especially in core academic areas, such as science and mathematics, where it has been found difficult to incorporate other subject matter. Technology is diverse enough in nature that it can be addressed by a variety of content areas, serving as a true integrator. The study of technology and associated systems, paired with relevant hands-on experience based on real-world application, has great potential for students to learn about as well as apply technological solutions. This article aims to provide content and reasoning for the purposes of kinesthetic learning applications. Foundational information necessary for expanded investigational practices permits students to research, formulate, and evaluate solutions associated with technological and scientific problems. The information presented in this article will provide instructors with authentic content to serve as a knowledge base for activities. This content will assist in implementing Standard 15 of "Standards for Technological Literacy: Content for the Study of Technology (STL)" into technology education classes. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - In this article, changes in "Mathematics for Informatics" at the Faculty of Organisation and Informatics in the University of Zagreb are described, and correlated with students pass rates. Students at the Faculty work in an interdisciplinary field, studying Informatics within a business context. The main reason for introducing the changes in the curriculum and its delivery, reflecting internal pressures, was the very low student pass rate in mathematics. The second reason, reflecting external pressure, was to address the requirements of the Bologna declaration in higher education in Croatia. The innovations were introduced in the following areas: content, methodology of teaching and learning, examination methods and support for students. The changes resulted in a significant increase in student pass rates and levels of student satisfaction. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure. Student Survey Results are appended.)
