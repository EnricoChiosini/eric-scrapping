AB  - The authors describe a model for embedding science communication into the science curriculum without displacing science content. They describe the rationale, development, design, and implementation of two courses taught by science faculty addressing these criteria. They also outline the evaluation plan for these courses, which emphasize broad communication skills taught in a scientific context by multidisciplinary teams. Small class sizes permit frequent and detailed feedback from peers and instructors allowing students to receive valuable and transferable communication training that is relevant across all scientific disciplines. This approach addresses a curricular gap and results in a positive learning experience for students.

AB  - Biostatisticians apply statistical methods to solve problems in the biological sciences. Successful practioners of biostatistics have advanced technical knowledge, are skilled communicators, and can seamlesslessly integrate with interdisciplinary scientific teams. Despite the breadth of skills required for success in this field, most biostatistics education programs place heavier emphasis on development of technical skills than skills necessary for collaborative work, including critical thinking, writing, and public speaking. Our master's degree program in biostatistics aims for stronger integration of education in collaborative work alongside development of technical knowledge in biostatistics. Toward that end, we propose a model that provides students with a mental map for practicing biostatistics, and that can serve as a tool for faculty to create hands-on learning experiences for biostatistics students. The model helps students organize their knowledge of biostatistics, unifying the technical and collaborative aspects of the discipline in a single framework that can be applied across the broad array of activities that biostatisticians engage in. In this article we describe the model in detail and provide an initial assessment of whether the model might meet its intended purpose by applying the model to a common task for practicing biostatisticians and biostatistics students: describing the results of a medical research study.

AB  - The iSchool movement is a controversial topic within the library and information science (LIS) community. While some argue that the movement isolates small size schools and splits the LIS community others insist it will broaden the field of LIS and form an open and boundaryless iField. This study investigates the evolution of the iSchool movement by analyzing the trends of subject terms in LIS doctoral dissertations since 1970s. The results indicate that the iSchool movement reflects the trend of LIS in terms of the change of the dominant research topics and the degree of interdisciplinarity.

AB  - Educational neuroscience represents a concerted interdisciplinary effort to bring the fields of cognitive science, neuroscience and education to bear on classroom practice. This article draws attention to the current and potential implications of importing biological ideas, language and imagery into education. By analysing examples of brain-based consumer products and services, we express a concern that neuroscience discourse can promote reductive and deterministic ways of understanding the developing child, masking phenomenological, psychosocial, or cultural influences. Moreover, a lack of neuroscience literacy and the appeal of neuroscience explanations may leave this field especially vulnerable to misunderstanding and misappropriation. We conclude by suggesting some opportunities to mitigate these problems, thereby facilitating constructive interdisciplinary dialogue.

AB  - An experimental protocol that provides an excellent way to discuss concepts at the crossroads of organic chemistry and biochemistry employing biocatalysis is presented. By evaluating several reaction parameters (enzyme source, organic solvent, and acyl donor), it was possible to conduct an enzymatic kinetic resolution experiment using 1-phenylethanol as a model compound. Students were then challenged to revisit and explore a variety of basic principles already addressed in previous organic chemistry or biochemistry courses to stimulate interdisciplinary research.

AB  - The Garden Team at Washington State University is a transdisciplinary group of faculty, staff, and students with expertise in applied plant and soil sciences and an interest in Extension education. The team's primary mission is to create current, relevant, and peer-reviewed materials as Extension publications for home gardeners. The average yearly Extension publication rate per member increased from 0.03 prior to team formation to 0.85 after team formation. An unexpected benefit emerged when team members acted cooperatively to submit successful competitive grants. These quantifiable measures of productivity benefit both the individual team members and the university in terms of overall competitiveness among land-grant institutions.

AB  - Today, engineers are expected to face challenges that involve complicated social elements related to new technological developments and their adoption. In this scenario, there needs to be a renewed attention to the instilment of general epistemic beliefs that facilitate multidisciplinary collaboration and the incorporation of social science practices. In other words, there is a need for a "social turn" in engineering education. In the following case study, we examine the learning process of 45 undergraduate engineering students enrolled in an Anthro-Design course at a private university in Chile. This course teaches students to use cultural anthropology and design tools to generate an applied qualitative research project for real-life counterparts. Under a socio-constructivist approach, we developed a sequential explanatory design, with an emphasis on qualitative data [quant- > QUAL]. We used the three factor Epistemic Beliefs Inventory (EBI) to conduct pre-post assessment. Semi-structured interviews were conducted at the end of the course to explore representations of key epistemic notions such as objectivity and validity. This study identifies a significant diversity in how epistemic notions such as validity and objectivity are represented by students after undertaking a course that embraces the social turn. This diversity can also be observed in non-epistemic notions related to the learning experience. We argue that a better understanding of the research process and the handling of qualitative information under rigorous theoretical frameworks are key to changing beliefs about the nature of knowledge within the engineering-design students' context.

AB  - In this paper, we consider the perceived effectiveness of using industry-based transdisciplinary, complex problems as a vehicle for final year undergraduate mathematics students to apply their knowledge and skills in realistic settings, preparing them for the world of work. The discussion centres on a recently designed, implemented and evaluated model for a capstone subject incorporating a work integrated learning project in a Bachelor of Mathematics degree. To provide background for the discussion, we present the motivation for introducing such learning activities into the programme as well as the design of the model itself. We also report on the outcomes of implementation of the Work Integrated Learning experiences, discussing participant perspectives and describing lessons learnt over the two years. We conclude with a set of identified characteristics of capstone experiences in mathematics, and with a call to re-conceptualize the ways design teams collaborate to support academics.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: This study aimed to develop a model for using social media content to promote 3D thinking of sustainability among students in integrated Mathematics, Language, Arts, and Technology (MLAT) classrooms. Background: Social media is one of the most relevant platforms among students of the 21st century to the extent that connecting it to classroom learning becomes interesting to the learners. Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) requires teachers to implement an interdisciplinary teaching approach while promoting skills for dealing with sustainability issues. ESD enables students to think about three aspects (economics, environment, and society) of sustainability. In this paper, the ability to think about the environment, society, and economics simultaneously was termed "3D thinking of sustainability." Social media content can be a catalyst for promoting students' application of 3D thinking of sustainability if integrated into the classroom. However, teachers fail to use social media content in their classrooms because they lack the know-how to integrate them. Therefore, providing teachers with a model for using social media content in their teaching can help them integrate it into their classes. Methodology: Design-based research was adopted by the researchers (two mathematics teachers and one curriculum expert) who were selected through purposive sampling, and twenty students who were selected through convenience sampling. Data were collected from the teachers' interviews with twenty students through observation and reflective journals and from students' assignments through document analysis. Contribution: The major contribution of the study is the development of the model for facilitating students' application of skills from the domains of mathematics, language, arts, and technology to understand sustainability issues. Furthermore, the study shows the value of social media in learning from the point of view of using them as context for applying interdisciplinary skills rather than media for teacher-student interaction. Findings: The model with eight interactive phases was developed. The proposed model requires the teachers to be knowledgeable content-wise in various disciplines or to collaborate with teachers from other disciplines. Recommendations for Practitioners: Practitioners are encouraged to adopt this model in the implementation of ESD. Recommendation for Researchers: Researchers may test the application of this model in other integrated subjects and levels of education. Impact on Society: The standard of living of any society is related to people's awareness of threats to sustainability. Therefore, the more education promotes 3D thinking of sustainability, the more the standard of living is guaranteed in our societies. Future Research: To evaluate the applicability of the model in various educational contexts.

AB  - Information and communication technology (ICT) has become an inseparable part of schoolwork and a goal of education to prepare scientifically literate and digitally competent citizens. Yet the introduction of computers into school work has been much slower than its introduction in other spheres of life. Teachers' lack of knowledge/skills and difficulty in integrating ICT into instruction affect the realization of computer-related goals in schools. Another hidden obstacle that can affect the introduction of computers into the Biology laboratory can be discomfort with the interpretation of graphs obtained by data-loggers. We can group these difficulties with graph outcomes into 4 areas: (1) Explanations of the curves that lie beyond the domain of Biology, in Physics, Chemistry or some other discipline; (2) Hardware properties; (3) Unknown properties of experimental components; (4) Occasional equipment breakdowns or crashes. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - This article describes findings and evolution of a teacher-training program based on a partnership of knowledge domains (technology, content, and pedagogy), teaching staff (college faculty and school teachers), educational institutions (colleges and K-12), and local communities (urban and suburban). Within 5 years, more than 180 teachers from 15 secondary schools attended a 3-tier summer institute and follow-up activities. Summer trainees were offered stipends, laptop computers, advanced graphing calculators, smart boards, LCD projectors, mentorship, and technical support during the academic year. While teachers were initially frustrated to learn outside their subject areas, they all completed the initial workshop and more than half returned in subsequent years for advance and expert level training. External evaluators collected data and conducted longitudinal analysis of performance indicators for teaching quality and student learning. Teachers reported increased level of student engagement in and comprehension of mathematics and science topics. Graduation rates and student achievement scores in partnering school districts increased noticeably during the initiative. Comparison of target and control groups showed that treatment students consistently outperformed non-treatment students.

AB  - With the rollout of edTPA, Common Core Standards (CCS), and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), there is renewed interest in teacher education programs providing an interdisciplinary approach to curriculum. Yet, future teachers are under increased pressure to pass standardized exams, such as the MTEL, WIFOR and PRAXIS, with a focus on content-specific instruction. Curriculum and assessment policy initiatives present contradictory messages regarding best practice. This research study examines an interdisciplinary approach to teaching content in one early childhood education teacher preparation program. Teaching that crosses disciplines and honors the content and epistemology of each discipline is complex and challenging to convey. Data for this yearlong study exploring student and faculty understanding of teaching from an interdisciplinary perspective at a small liberal arts college included semester-end surveys, focal student interviews, final projects, and faculty surveys. Based on this research, we suggest that integration of content area specialists in college curriculum courses, cross-institutional attention to effective integration strategies, and purposeful interdisciplinary field placements are needed as early childhood educators face continued policy reform.

AB  - Drawing on past and current scholarship on digitally mediated communication in language learning, this review article examines the evolution of identity research in computer-assisted language learning (CALL) from the 1990s to the present day. The article offers an in-depth overview of critical issues and topics associated with language learner identification in educational digital settings and non-institutionally situated online cultures. A chronological approach is followed, addressing three main historical periods broadly related to the major conceptual shifts in applied linguistics: early developments and the communicative turn (1995-2000), the social and intercultural turns (2000-2010), and the critical and multilingual turns (2010-2020). Thus, this paper seeks to link the research on digital identity in CALL to second language acquisition (SLA) theories and highlight key studies and their importance for the field and the shifting paradigm. The article concludes with a summary of newly emerging themes in digital identity studies and outlines new directions for research on language learner identity in digital spaces. Singling out identity research within the discipline of CALL as a historically evolving topic that reflects the ever-changing realms of the digital world contributes to strengthening interdisciplinary ties between broadly conceptualized digital humanities, digital humanistic pedagogies, and computer-assisted language learning sciences.

AB  - Many secondary math and science teachers don't understand the nature and application of engineering adequately to transfer that understanding to their students. Research is needed that investigates and illuminates the process and characteristics of development that addresses this gap. This mixed-method study examines the developmental experiences of 16 public math and science teachers in a yearlong engineering experience. Teachers partnered with university engineering professor-mentors for six weeks on campus followed by ongoing support for transfer to their secondary classes (grades 9-12). Teachers gained engineering knowledge and skills, and an understanding of engineering's diversity and interdisciplinary nature, plus integrative applied strategies for math and science instruction. They developed productive perceptions (of value, utility, benefits, feasibility and fit) of engineering for their grade 9-12 students, along with efficacy and intent to use what they had learned. Teachers identified positive, profound shifts in their perceptions of engineering and engineers. All teachers integrated engineering principles into their classrooms, but the process was more challenging for math teachers than for science teachers. This developmental experience may help bridge gaps of school-to-life and disciplinary boundaries that separate formal educational environments from authentic life experience.

AB  - The "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS") emphasize integrating engineering design into the science classroom (NGSS Lead States 2013). Inventing is an authentic and relevant classroom approach, regardless of content area, located at one end of a design continuum opposite from routine problem solving. Invention, at the other end of the continuum, represents authentic, creative, and unique solutions (Committee for Study of Invention 2004). This article examines how invention activities are a fantastic way to integrate a variety of disciplinary core ideas and to increase student engagement. Many inventions start with identifying a need in the local community. When students work to solve local, authentic problems, engagement increases and they can draw upon disciplinary core ideas (Sarkar and Frazier 2008) across content areas. Invention can also make engineering design relevant and interdisciplinary, and frames engineering as a process that can improve the lives of others, rather than reinforcing the notion of engineering as a stale, technocentric field lacking an ethic of care (Gunckel and Tolbert 2018). Reframing engineering design as an activity that helps others can increase student interest for women and traditionally underrepresented people in the science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) fields.

AB  - As science teachers continue preparing for implementation of the "Next Generation Science Standards," one recommendation is to use computer programming as a promising context to efficiently integrate science and engineering. In this article, a interdisciplinary team of educational researchers and computer scientists describe how to use programming as one way to teach engineering design using tasks like creating a digital story to describe science phenomena or a "how-to" animation that demonstrates how to replicate a science experiment or activity in a fourth-grade classroom. In the activity, students used the Scratch programming language to create programs about science phenomena and science activities by using the engineering design stages of defining problems, developing solutions, and optimizing solutions.

AB  - The Korean STEAM education pursues a convergent human resources education, but there are shortcomings associated with it due to the fact that it excludes the Humanities in its curriculum. This study embodies the accomplishments from the design and field application of the STEAM education model that has added Humanities fields (history, geography, and bibliography) to the five areas of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics). The core principle of STEAM education is to utilize the traditional sciences as a medium that connects STEAM and the Humanities. It is designed to incorporate the eight core subjects as discipline studies of eight subjects and be implemented through the wheel model, developing into a multidisciplinary system. The STEAM education model was applied at two high schools over a two-year period as pilot programs. Both cases have undergone verification by the academia and have been reported in the news by the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS).

AB  - Since 2005 we have pursued a formal research program called the BRAID (Bringing Relationships Alive through Interdisciplinary Discourse), which is designed to develop and test strategies for training first- and second-year undergraduate science students to bridge scientific disciplines. The BRAID's ongoing multiyear investigation points to preliminary conclusions about what does and does not promote student interdisciplinary thinking. Perhaps not surprisingly, our research suggested the most effective technique for helping introductory students see science in integrated terms has been the most direct: explicitly discussing and engaging in debate about the connections found in the real world in a seminar setting. On the other hand, adding a thin gilding of interdisciplinarity to existing courses accomplishes little. Our goal is not to devise the "ideal" interdisciplinary educational experience, but one that is efficient and sustainable in a wide range of existing curricular structures. We are particularly sensitive to the need to avoid creating eclectic models dependent on our particular institutional setting. (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.)

AB  - In this study, we analyzed the perceptions of treatment teachers who participated in a randomized controlled trial study which targeted a science-infused literacy intervention, "Let's Talk Science," for first grade English language learner students. Three aspects, including the effectiveness of the intervention, details of instructional practice, and recommendations of teachers, were investigated. We used the qualitative approach of content analysis. Results suggested that (a) the intervention had a positive result for both treatment students and teachers and (b) four core strengths contributed to the successful effect of the intervention related to science-infused literacy -- professional development, time-scripted teaching materials, effective questioning strategies, and visuals and hands-on activities. We advocate that special consideration be given to English language instructors' ongoing professional development, as well as to the learning environment with a lowered affective filter using effective instructional strategies.

AB  - Recent calls for reform in undergraduate biology education have emphasized integrating research experiences into the learning experiences of all undergraduates. Contemporary science research increasingly demands collaboration across disciplines and institutions to investigate complex research questions, providing new contexts and models for involving undergraduates in research. In this study, we examined the experiences of undergraduates participating in a multi-institution and interdisciplinary biology research network. Unlike the traditional apprenticeship model of research, in which a student participates in research under the guidance of a single faculty member, students participating in networked research have the opportunity to develop relationships with additional faculty and students working in other areas of the project, at their own and at other institutions. We examined how students in this network develop social ties and to what extent a networked research experience affords opportunities for students to develop social, cultural, and human capital. Most studies of undergraduate involvement in science research have focused on documenting student outcomes rather than elucidating how students gain access to research experiences or how elements of research participation lead to desired student outcomes. By taking a qualitative approach framed by capital theories, we have identified ways that undergraduates utilize and further develop various forms of capital important for success in science research. In our study of the first 16 months of a biology research network, we found that undergraduates drew upon a combination of human, cultural, and social capital to gain access to the network. Within their immediate research groups, students built multidimensional social ties with faculty, peers, and others, yielding social capital that can be drawn upon for information, resources, and support. They reported developing cultural capital in the form of learning to think and work like a scientist--a scientific "habitus." They reported developing human capital in the forms of technical, analytical, and communication skills in scientific research. Most of the students had little, direct interaction with network members in other research groups and thus developed little cross-institutional capital. The exception to this trend was at one institution that housed three research groups. Because proximity facilitated shared activities, students across research groups at this institution developed cross-lab ties with faculty and peers through which they developed social, cultural, and human capital. An important long-term concern is whether the capital students have developed will help them access opportunities in science beyond the network. At this point, many undergraduates have had limited opportunities to actually draw on capital beyond the network. Nevertheless, a number of students demonstrated awareness that they had developed resources that they could use in other scientific contexts.

AB  - There has been a growing interest in incorporating CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) methodology in the Sri Lankan national education system. CLIL refers to methods where subjects, or parts of subjects, are taught through a foreign language to improve both academic subject knowledge and foreign language skills. The 4C's model of Coyle et al (2010) is a popular model for the implementation of CLIL and Sri Lankan system has encouraged using this CLIL model. The main objective of this study was to inquire how CLIL is implemented in secondary science classrooms and to support the teachers. The study was action research. The collaborative action research group comprised a faculty member, a postgraduate research student and ten secondary science teachers from five schools. Arising from the factfinding needs analysis, the intervention designed included researcher-led teacher workshops to support teachers to plan CLIL lessons. The lessons were implemented in the respective schools by the sample of teachers during school two terms with the support of the researchers. The study concluded that curriculum materials were not focused on CLIL and teachers needed heavy support for content and language integrating for the teaching of science in secondary classes. Preparation of teacher instructional manuals addressing CLIL and in-service teacher development for CLIL lesson planning is recommended.

AB  - In an upper-division interdisciplinary laboratory experiment, students use Raman spectroscopy to highlight how the overall structure and conformational order of lipid bilayers can be influenced by their individual phospholipid composition. Students prepare a supported lipid bilayer, as a model cell membrane, by spreading liposomes made of various phospholipids on a solid support. The characterization of phospholipid bilayers, a major component of cellular membranes, can advance our fundamental understanding of important biological phenomena, with significant implications in various fields including drug delivery and development. We use Raman spectroscopy as an analytical tool to investigate the structural and packing properties of model cell membranes. The spectral frequency, intensity, and line-width of lipid Raman bands are extremely sensitive to structural alterations. This experimental module effectively exposes students to the fundamentals of Raman spectroscopy and teaches students the importance of interdisciplinary education as they integrate concepts from chemical structure, molecular interactions, and analytical spectroscopic techniques to gain a more holistic understanding of biological membrane properties.

AB  - Sociology and History, as consolidated scientific and academic projects, have maintained an unusual and paradoxical relationship. The growing disciplinary and sub-disciplinary specialisation of these two sciences poses relevant epistemological and methodological challenges in addressing potential situations of isolation, fragmentation, and in enabling the defence of an interdisciplinary perspective characterised by the historicity of social structures, actions and meanings. Several kinds of reasons shape this diffuse process of approximation/detachment between Sociology and History, namely epistemological and methodological, disciplinary closure, academic and professional reasons, forming what may be called contained dialogues. This paper, starting from the sociological stance of the authors, seeks to add to the reflection on the relevance of a scientific project that aims to affirm an interdisciplinary perspective that may foster the heuristic potentialities of both Sociology and History in the analysis of the complexity of social reality and human action.

AB  - In response to a request from a campus student organization, faculty from three fields came together to develop and teach an integrated interdisciplinary course on water issues and social activism. This course, "Water as Life, Death, and Power," brought together issues from the fields of anthropology, biology and chemistry to explore water rights, access to clean water, and water treatment methods. Students enrolled in the course developed interdisciplinary projects related to a variety of local and global water issues to present real-world solutions at a university-wide student research showcase. This article reports the assessment outcomes of the course, measuring changes in both interdisciplinary learning and levels of student activism.

AB  - We report on the development of an after-school and summer-based science, technology, engineering, and mathematics curriculum infused with the arts and social emotional learning content (STEAM SEL). Its design was motivated by theory and research that suggest that STEM education is well-suited for teaching empathy and other emotion-related skills. In this paper, we describe the activities associated with the development and design of the program and the curriculum. We provide expert-ratings of the STEAM and social emotional elements of the program and present instructor and participant feedback about the program's content and its delivery. Our results revealed that infusing the arts and social emotional learning content into science education created a holistic STEM-related curriculum that holds potential for enhancing young children's interest in and appreciation for science and its applications. The data also suggested that the program was well-developed and, generally well-executed. However, experts rated the STEAM elements of the program more positively than the SEL elements, especially with regard to sequencing of lessons and integration among the lessons and hands-on activities, indicating that program revisions are warranted.

AB  - The seafood industry in Florida is complex, with more than 80 varieties of Florida seafood commodities and an increasing number of imported products. This variety increases consumer confusion, especially with the growing concern about the origin, sustainability, and safety of seafood products. The objective of the Florida Seafood At Your Fingertips program is to provide Florida Extension agents with updated, science-based information regarding seafood, which will result in increased consumer awareness and consumption. Combining a survey instrument, curriculum modules, public displays, and a mobile application with the teaching expertise of Extension has allowed this program to reach consumers throughout Florida.

AB  - Current visions for the education of young people propose learning in meaningful contexts, relevant for citizens of a modern society. Inquiry-based teaching is one such approach in science education, but its potential can best be realised through constructive collaboration between teachers and across subjects. This chapter presents a case of school-based development resulting in a major cross-curricular technology project. It shows how inquiry can form part of a creative process where students design and build technological products of high quality and how this reflects authentic inquiry in science. The teaching project is run by teachers at a lower secondary school in Norway, where students in Grade 9 (age 14-15) spend 2 entire weeks combining a range of subjects in designing and building individual car models. Project authenticity is achieved by allowing for students' creativity, setting high expectations for product quality and providing enough time for students to participate in creative inquiry processes. Based on this case, it is argued that inquiry-based teaching calls for autonomy for schools and teachers just as meaningful inquiry learning requires a certain level of autonomy for learners. The success of the project is discussed in terms of how it represents an exception to normal curriculum structure, adopts alternative standards and reallocates resources in order to achieve goals set by the school. These goals transcend the narrower goals of the formal curriculum for school subjects and contribute to combating current trends of increased rigidity and narrow focus on testable knowledge in schools.

AB  - Chemical kinetics is a highly quantitative content area that involves the use of multiple mathematical representations to model processes and is a context that is under-investigated in the literature. This qualitative study explored undergraduate student integration of chemistry and mathematics during problem solving in the context of chemical kinetics. Using semi-structured interviews, participants were asked to make their reasoning and thinking explicit as they described provided equations and as they worked though chemical kinetics problems. Here we describe the results from our study, which included thirty-six general chemistry students, five physical chemistry students, and three chemical engineering students. Analysis and findings are framed in terms of blended processing, a theory from cognitive science that characterizes human knowledge integration. Themes emerged relating to contexts that were commonly discussed when blending occurred. Variation in the depth and directionality of blending was also observed and characterized. Results provide implications for supporting student problem solving and the modeling of chemical processes.

AB  - Undergraduate-level laboratory experiments that involve the synthesis of nanomaterials with well-defined/controlled shapes are very attractive under the umbrella of nanotechnology education. Herein we describe a low-cost and facile experiment for the synthesis of Cu(OH)[subscript 2] and CuO nanowires comprising three main parts: (i) synthesis of Cu(OH)[subscript 2] nanowires by a precipitation approach followed by a calcination step that converts Cu(OH)[subscript 2] to CuO; (ii) use of Cu(OH)[subscript 2] and CuO nanowires as model systems to explore a variety of characterization techniques relevant in the context of solid-state chemistry, materials chemistry, and nanoscience; and (iii) presentation/discussion of the data. Other learning objectives include probing of chemical transformations at the nanoscale and the use of concepts borrowed from coordination chemistry to understand the formation mechanism of Cu(OH)[subscript 2] and CuO nanowires from a Cu[superscript 2+](aq) precursor. This experiment can be performed with a relatively simple laboratory infrastructure and with instrumentation that is generally widely available. Moreover, students are able to integrate multidisciplinary concepts in a single activity and become introduced to/familiarized with a currently active research field (nanoscience) and its associated literature.

AB  - Ann Oakley, pioneering social researcher for nearly 60 years, is Professor of Sociology and Social Policy at IOE (Institute of Education), UCL's Faculty of Education and Society (University College London, UK). This article explores the innovation and influence of her work and the work of her close colleagues at the Social Science Research Unit (SSRU) and its Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Coordinating Centre (EPPI-Centre). It describes advances in research and knowledge that have their roots in listening to what women have to say about their lives. The resulting novel research methods have straddled academic boundaries--between qualitative and quantitative methodologies, between disciplines, and between academia and wider society--to enhance understanding of complex social issues and approaches to addressing them within the public sector. The impact of this work is seen in terms of influencing science, knowledge management, policy decisions, professional practice and the general public. These achievements come from approaches that are outward looking and straddle academic disciplines to produce evidence that is relevant to policymaking and to practice, with the ultimate aim being to improve day-to-day life.

AB  - This study demonstrates the generalization of previous laboratory results showing the benefits of Self-Explanation Reading Training (SERT) to college students' course exam performance. The participants were 265 students enrolled in an Introductory Biology course, 59 of whom were provided with SERT. The results showed that SERT benefited students who began the course with less knowledge about science but did not benefit students with greater prior science knowledge. Moreover, across the three exams in the course, low-knowledge students who received SERT performed as well as high-knowledge students, whereas low-knowledge students without SERT performed more poorly than high-knowledge students. Hence, instruction on how to self-explain and use comprehension strategies allowed low-knowledge students to overcome their knowledge deficits. These results provide further evidence that self-explanation in combination with instruction and practice using comprehension strategies helps students to more effectively process and understand science.

AB  - This study makes use of a pre-test/post-test design (with a control group) to test the effect of an interdisciplinary energy course on student attitudes and values related to energy issues. The interdisciplinary energy course was co-taught by engineering, political science, economics, and oceanography professors at the United States Naval Academy during the fall of 2015. The study finds that students in the interdisciplinary energy course experienced significant changes in their energy attitudes on half the categories tested, while students in the control group did not experience similar changes. The changes were greatest among female students, politically moderate students, and engineering students. The findings suggest that interdisciplinary instruction can have a powerful impact on student values, but that the impact works through existing demographic and ideological factors.

AB  - We report on the use of bilingual constructed response science assessments in the context of a research and development partnership with secondary school science teachers. Given the power that assessments have in today's education systems, our project provided a series of workshops for teachers where they explored students' emergent reform-oriented science meaning-making in our project-designed assessments. Within the context of these workshops, we used discourse analysis to explore how three different groups grappled with the new reform-oriented relationship between science and language: (1) the research team's emergent understandings of how to create improved resources for teachers to better integrate science and language; (2) students' emergent understandings as expressed in their assessment responses; and (3) teachers' emergent understandings of how to integrate science and language in their instruction as expressed in interviews in the teacher writing workshops. Implications for curriculum designers, assessment developers, and professional learning facilitators are discussed.

AB  - This research methods Essay details the usefulness of critical theoretical frameworks and critical mixed-methodological approaches for life sciences education research on broadening participation in the life sciences. First, I draw on multidisciplinary research to discuss critical theory and methodologies. Then, I demonstrate the benefits of these approaches for researchers who study diversity and inclusion issues in the life sciences through examples from two critical mixed-methods studies of prominent issues in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) participation and recognition. The first study pairs critical discourse analysis of the STEM workforce literature, data, and underlying surveys with quantitative analyses of STEM pathways into the workforce. This example illustrates the necessity of questioning popular models of retention. It also demonstrates the importance of intersecting demographic categories to reveal patterns of experience both within and between groups whose access to and participation in STEM we aim to improve. The second study's critical approach applies research on inequities in prizes awarded by STEM professional societies toward organizational change. This example uses data from the life sciences professional societies to show the importance of placing data within context to broaden participation and understand challenges in creating sustainable change.

AB  - In this study we explored the experiences of students who completed a project-based, interdisciplinary capstone course that was offered at a large university in Southern Ontario, Canada. To do so, we interviewed students after they completed the course, adopting a constructivist perspective and a phenomenological approach. Interview transcripts were analyzed, resulting in four themes: (1) communication, (2) group dynamics, (3) successes, (4) differences between program requirements. In addition to revealing tension between fostering student autonomy and providing students with support, our findings also demonstrate that students valued the capstone course for the knowledge and experience gained from learning to work as an interdisciplinary unit rather than the tangible output of a given project.

AB  - In this article we describe current educational research underlying a comprehensive model for building a scientific classroom discourse community. We offer a professional development activity for a school-based professional learning community, providing specific science instructional strategies within this interactive teaching model. This design activity provides a quick and practical means of transforming science lessons to be more engaging for students. Through this activity teachers can redesign any science lesson by focusing on each of the five core components of a scientific classroom discourse community: (a) scientific inquiry, (b) oral discourse, (c) written discourse, (d) academic language development, and (e) learning principles. By using this structure teachers will be better able to meet the "Next Generation Science Standards" and facilitate greater interdisciplinary learning. An example of a redesigned water cycle lesson is provided.

AB  - GeoHumanities is an interdisciplinary field, which combines geography, arts, and humanities. At the intersection of these three disciplines, GeoHumanities' purpose is to use space, place, landscape, and environment to tell the stories of cultures, nature, and heritage of various ethnic groups. The GeoHumanities Forum at the Royal Holloway University (2021), GeoHumanities is a relatively new field of study. It incorporates similar humanities fields, such as environmental humanities, spatial humanities, and urban humanities under its umbrella. At its core, GeoHumanities uses geographic information to address of the questions posed in the humanities fields. As geographical information systems (GIS) and data visualization tools advance they become an integral part of scholarly research endeavors. GeoHumanities is also evolving into a field where data-driven approaches are commonly used by scholars. This paper is a review of digital tools available to the GeoHumanities scholars and to evaluate what degree these digital tools may support the investigation of various social science, humanities questions, and issues via visualization techniques.

AB  - Integrated STEM learning is an appropriate approach to improve students' abilities and skills needed in the 21st century. Therefore, this literature study aims to discuss the effectiveness of integrated STEM implementation in science learning. The focus of this research includes integrated STEM implementation, effectiveness, and analysis of abilities and skills that can be improved through STEM integration. The method used in this literature study is a Systematic Literature Review, which includes several stages, namely Identification, Screening, and Included. The databases used include Springer, Taylor & Francis, ERIC, and Google Scholar. This literature review article is limited to the last 8 years, from 2016 to 2023. After screening, 35 articles were obtained, which were used as literature material regarding the effectiveness of integrated STEM learning in science. The results of the study show that STEM implementation can be integrated with various learning models such as PjBL, PBL, Jigsaw, 5E-EDP, and 6E-Cycle. In addition, it can also be integrated with media, including interactive video, virtual labs, and mobile augmented reality. Integrated STEM has proven to be effective in improving students' abilities and skills. The student's abilities and skills include 4C skills, concept understanding and cognitive abilities, motivation, ICT and computational literacy, spatial and geographic thinking skills, and mathematical thinking skills.

AB  - This study proposes a narrative pedagogical model for creating and developing case studies that highlight the challenges and issues surrounding the megatrends of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, specifically "People and the Internet." This proposal, framed in an online learning environment, represents the second stage of an educational platform to guide university students in facilitating an ideathon to address the megatrends of the 4th Industrial Revolution. Designing a model for case study creation related to the megatrends aims to foster complex thinking in university students, especially innovative thinking, a sub-competency of complex thinking. Fostering complex thinking highlights the importance of cognitive, practical, and adaptive skills to address interdisciplinary challenges. The Design Process and Practice Methodology and the case study methodology facilitated the narrative case study design model. The outcome of this study is a tangible product that enriches the debates on education and complex systems thinking in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

AB  - This paper investigates Lebanese grade 7 biology teachers' mathematical knowledge and skills, by exploring how they explain a visual representation in an activity depending on the mathematical concept "Function". Twenty Lebanese in-service biology teachers participated in the study, and were interviewed about their explanation for the designed activity. The data analysis reveals that teachers refer to different entities as constituting models, and express different way far away from the mathematical concept "Function". Based on the collected data, the findings could not be generalized to all biology teachers, but it is safe to conclude that it would be enriching for students if biology teachers had a background in mathematics and mathematics education, in order to deal with situations of exploration and analysis of the different constraints that might affect biology activities. In addition, the results highlight the need to review the teachers' preparation programs in a way that considers integrating mathematics into sciences, as well as a need to introduce a reform to the Lebanese Biology curriculum, in order to explicitly include all the mathematical competencies required to build up scientific knowledge.

AB  - In this conceptual paper, I put forward an argument about the conceptualization of science identity as a landscape of becoming by placing emphasis on "recognition" and "emotions," as core features of identity, through an intersectionality lens. These constructs intertwined, I argue, can give meaning to the process of becoming a science person or forming a science identity, and at the same time shed light on issues related to power, inequality, racism, and exclusion. In the context of these bigger issues, I argue that forming a science identity is not only personal, but also political. The need for intersectionality as a conceptual framework for studying science identity is underscored by the dearth of theory and empirical evidence that addresses classroom inequalities, as well as the multiple and interlocking influence of systems of privilege and oppression in science, such as racism and sexism. Recognition, which refers to how individuals are recognized by others as certain kinds of people, is an ineradicable part of our social world; it is bound within sociopolitical contexts and tied to specific cultural norms, values, beliefs, and stereotypes. Hence, recognition becomes of paramount importance in science identity research. However, critical questions still remain unanswered, such as who is allowed in the world of science and who is recognized as a science person in specific contexts? Directly linked to recognition, I argue, are different types of emotions which can offer a valuable lens for studying inequalities within the process of forming a science identity. What this means for science identity research is how important it is to explore the emotionality of science identity given that emotions are not just dialectically related but inextricably bound with (mis)recognition as well as with various systems of oppression.

AB  - Today, more than 23 million children and adolescents are obese or overweight in the United States. Physical educators strive to find appropriate, yet fun activities to encourage and increase physical activity. Introducing students to a variety of activities can promote family involvement in physical activity and create lifelong physical activity habits in children outside of school. Activities of mutual interest (such as roller skating) for girls and boys presented in a coeducational setting can accomplish these goals. Roller skating can be fun and can provide health-related fitness benefits. A roller skating curriculum may spark interest in lifelong physical activity and create an opportunity to incorporate various subject areas such as mathematics, science, health, etc. This article describes an interdisciplinary skating unit that was taught and implemented in a fourth-grade physical education class.

AB  - The study of learning environments involves describing educational contexts and identifying empirical relationships among subject matter (curriculum), teaching practices and other environmental variables. In recent years, this has become a growing field of academic inquiry within elementary, secondary and post-secondary research. Investigations of this relationship between the environment and learning encompasses science education, environmental psychology, campus ecology and architecture, as well as inter- or multi-disciplinary fields of study such as environmental or place-based forms of education. Learning environment studies attempt to acknowledge and account for factors in both the physical and social realm, as well as describing how these socio-environmental conditions can influence the process and experience of learning. Our project at the Chilliwack Secondary School (CSS) aimed to further the study and investigation of student perceptions of both informal and formal learning environments within a high-school context. This study describes, refines and validates a new instrument for the measurement of perceptions of the physical environment at school. It also describes other qualitative methods that corroborate the selection of physical factors included in the survey. Together, these data provide rich descriptions of the factors in the learning environment at the CSS and describe the interaction of these factors in supporting learning.

AB  - Scientific undergraduate research in higher education often yields positive outcomes for student and faculty member participants alike, with underrepresented students often showing even more substantial gains (academic, professional, and personal) as a result of the experience. Significant success can be realized when involving deaf and hard-of-hearing (d/hh) undergraduate students, who are also vastly underrepresented in the sciences, in interdisciplinary research projects. Even d/hh Associate degree level students and those in the first two years of their postsecondary careers can contribute to, and benefit from, the research process when faculty mentors properly plan/design projects. We discuss strategies, including the dissemination/communication of research results, for involving these students in research groups with different communication dynamics and share both findings of our research program and examples of successful chemical and biological research projects that have involved d/hh undergraduate students. We hope to stimulate a renewed interest in encouraging diversity and involving students with disabilities into higher education research experiences globally and across multiple scientific disciplines, thus strengthening the education and career pipeline of these students.

AB  - In the context of the Bologna reform, the Environmental Sciences programme at ETH Zurich was transformed from a Diploma to a Master's degree programme. In a comparative secondary analysis of graduate surveys of the last homogeneous cohort of Diploma graduates (N = 85) and two Master's cohorts after the reform (N = 108), this study investigated the qualifications required by graduates in their professional activities and matched them with the level of qualification acquired at university. It concluded that graduates' general skills meet professional requirements better after the reform. However, for two out of five domain-specific skills (knowledge of legal aspects, interdisciplinary knowledge) ratings of skill acquisition declined significantly. Nonetheless, Master's graduates showed a slight or substantial knowledge and skills advantage for seven of the eight skills of the programme's qualification profile that were addressed in the survey. The basic quality of the sustainability oriented programme has thus been maintained.

AB  - Background/Context: There were over 500,000 open computing jobs across the country in 2018, but only 35% of U.S. high schools offer computer science classes, and only 8-10% of STEM graduates study computer science (Code.org, 2018). In 2021, only 5.1% of all Bachelor's degrees conferred were in Computer and Information Sciences (IPEDS, 2018). STEM is the future, but the present pipeline is insufficient to meet demand. K-12 Computer Science course participation is the leading indicator of what happens in university. The College Board found that students who try AP Computer Science courses in high school are 6 times more likely to study Computer Science in college, and participation is 7 to 10 times higher for minority and female students, respectively (Wyatt, Feng, & Ewing, 2020). Purpose/Objective Research Questions: This study evaluates the impact of an intervention that integrates increased access to Computer Science Principles (CSP) with curriculum and professional development support for CSP teachers. Specifically, we examine how the design of a computer science-integrated math curriculum, the Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC), affects students' participation and performance in computer science in high school and in college. Sharing this knowledge will contribute significantly to the field, helping other secondary schools improve STEM preparation for underrepresented students nationwide. We aim to address three questions: what is the impact of enrollment in BJC Advanced Placement (AP) CSP curriculum on: 1) student AP CSP test scores, 2) student computer science attitudes and engagement, and 3) AP CSP enrollment at the school? Setting: This intervention was implemented at IDEA Public Schools, a network of charter schools based in Texas. Since 2000, IDEA has grown from a single campus serving 150 students in the Rio Grande Valley to its current enrollment of 44,653 students across 79 schools in two states and is the fastest- growing network of tuition-free, Pre-K-12 public charter schools in the United States. In spring 2021, IDEA high schools were randomly assigned to one of two AP CSP curricula in the 2021-2022 academic year, 15 schools to receive Code.org, the usual curriculum, and 15 schools to receive the Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC). Population/Participants/Subjects: IDEA's current student population across all schools is 89.2% Hispanic, 5.5% African American, 88.6% economically disadvantaged, and 32.9% English-language learners. Additionally, 45.9% are considered at-risk for dropping out of school due to multiple academic, social, and economic factors. Our target population is comprised of students, between the 9th and 12th grade, who requested to take the AP CSP course in the spring before randomization, students who did not make a spring course request, even if they enrolled into the course later, are not included in the evaluation. Intervention/Program/Practice: After randomization, teachers in schools that were assigned the BJC curriculum participated in a one- week training at the beginning of the school year. Throughout the year, teachers attended bi-weekly webinars facilitated by the CS curriculum manager at each school. Teachers were also able to collaborate and communicate through online communication channels. Teachers primarily taught with their school's adopted materials in fall 2021, but frequently used other supplementary materials in spring of 2021. Research Design: This study utilizes a Randomized Controlled Trail (RCT) design to estimate the impacts of the BJC AP CSP curriculum. Specifically, we first conduct school-level randomization blocks and then conduct a constrained randomization to balance covariates. This is to ensure that the treated and comparison schools are statistically similar at baseline. The school blocks are created based on schools' prior history of offering an AP CSP curriculum. We then implement procedures described by Morgan and Rubin (2012) to further constrain the set of possible randomizations and achieve optimal balance for two key continuous covariates: (a) prior mathematics standardized achievement and (b) prior overall grade point average (GPA). Based on the district's historical data, these two covariates emerged as the strongest predictors of our key outcome (i.e., AP CSP scores). Our main impact model is a two-level mixed-effects model estimating treatment-control differences for continuous AP CSP scores, controlling for baseline covariates and fixed effects of randomization blocks. We also conduct exploratory subgroup analyses based on student-level characteristics, such as student grade level, gender, or prior mathematics achievement. Data Collection in Analysis: We collect administrative records from IDEA public schools that include information on student enrollment, demographic characteristics, student test scores, as well as school-level demographics and prior achievement. We also conduct a survey in both the fall of 2021 and spring of 2022. In the survey, we collect data from students on their computer science engagement, computer science confidence and interests, and computer science postsecondary and career intentions. Findings/Results: About half of students initially enrolled in spring 2021 did not remain in the course or otherwise did not take the AP CSP test in spring 2022. Our baseline equivalence analyses focus on student who did remain in the AP CSP course (i.e., those with AP CSP test scores as outcomes). The main concern with attrition is that different types of students might have left the BJC and Code.org conditions, however, findings from our baseline equivalence tests provide evidence that the two groups overall remain comparable. Also, where there are some slight differences (e.g., limited English proficiency rates), we statistically control for them by including those variables as covariates in our regression model. The average AP CSP scores were low in both conditions (compared to the national average of 2.91). About one-quarter of test takers (25%) earned a passing score of 3 or higher (compared to national average of 64%). The results of our main model show that there were no statistically significant differences between the BJC and Code.org groups, nor do we find statistically significant differences for subgroups. Although the study survey response rates were low, the results of analyzing the survey data show that students in the treatment group responded more favorably on all student engagement constructs than comparison students, the size of the differences between the treatment and comparison condition were small and none were statistically significant. There were also no statistically significant differences for CS interests, confidence, or postsecondary and career intentions.

AB  - In pursuit of more mindful notions of hybridity, this review essay provides a series of reflections on Mathew Weinstein's representations of Street Medics and "sciences for the red zones of neoliberalism". My analysis draws on three popular ways of thinking with boundaries to offer a critical reading of the boundary-work that the essay performs with respect to three dialectics: (1) technical and political; (2) disciplinarily and multidisciplinarities; and (3) structures and agencies. I conclude with reflections on my boundary labour as a researcher, writer and pedagogue and how such cultural work might learn to live better with difference, ambiguities, hybrids and cross-hybrid learning.

AB  - Most of the previous problem-based learning (PBL) studies have been conducted with gifted or regular education students and have shown successes. However, little research on PBL exists for disadvantaged middle school students, especially students who are considered to be at risk of failing academically. In this study, we examined the use of a multimedia-enriched PBL science environment by at-risk middle school students. The results, using a mixed-methods design, showed that these students significantly improved their science knowledge and attitude toward science after they engaged in PBL learning. While there were no differences in the scores between the genders, the gain scores from pre- to post-tests in science knowledge and attitude toward science for the girls were larger. A strong positive relationship between attitude toward science and science knowledge was also found. Such research should provide much needed insights on the effect of PBL for all students, not only the gifted but also the underrepresented populations.

AB  - Integrating mathematics content into science usually plays a supporting role, where students use their existing mathematical knowledge for solving science tasks without exhibiting any new mathematical meanings during the process. To help students explore the reciprocal relationship between math and science, we designed an instructional module that prompted them to reason covariationally about the quantities involved in the phenomenon of the gravitational force. The results of a whole-class design experiment with sixth-grade students showed that covariational reasoning supported students' understanding of the phenomenon of gravity. Also, the examination of the phenomenon of gravity provided a constructive space for students to construct meanings about co-varying quantities. Specifically, students reasoned about the change in the magnitudes and values of mass, distance, and gravity as those changed simultaneously as well as the multiplicative change of these quantities as they changed in relation to each other. They also reasoned multivariationally illustrating that they coordinated mass and distance working together to define the gravitational force. Their interactions with the design, which included the tool, tasks, representations, and questioning, showed to be a structuring factor in the formation and reorganization of meanings that students exhibited. Thus, this study illustrates the type of design activity that provided a constructive space for students' forms of covariational reasoning in the context of gravity. This design can be used to develop other STEM modules that integrate scientific phenomena with covariational reasoning through technology.

AB  - This volume brings together both political and educational scientists. While educational research literature has so far not systematically addressed the tool of simulations of decision-making, political scientists have hardly used insights from research on assessment or on motivation and interest of students. Almost all political science publications on simulations merely discuss how to implement the tool in class and fall short of providing evidence of the effects on student outcomes such as increased interest and performance. Combining the two disciplines is mutually enriching. Political science benefits from state of the art educational science measuring and testing of the claims made by the proponents of simulations, while educational sciences adds the systematic analysis of simulations of decision-making to their list of empirical objects, which also adds insights to the theories on the affective component of student learning. It is the explicit aim of the volume to address how simulating decision-making environments fosters learning. Implications for research and practice regarding student learning are addressed in all chapters.

AB  - Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is widely used in many different disciplines in order to analyze problems that involve uncertainty. Simulation decomposition has recently provided a simple, but powerful, advancement to the standard Monte Carlo approach. Its value for better informing decision making has been previously shown in the investment-analysis field. In this paper, we demonstrate that simulation decomposition can enhance problem analysis in a wide array of domains by applying it to three very different disciplines: geology, business, and environmental science. Further extensions to such disciplines as engineering, natural sciences, and social sciences are discussed. We propose that by incorporating simulation decomposition into pedagogical practices, we expect students to significantly advance their problem-understanding and problem-solving skills.

AB  - In the last few years, adoption of service learning in higher educational institutions has emerged as a modern teaching and learning strategy. This study is aimed to offer a systematic literature review of service learning implementation in higher education. There is a lack of research on the role of service learning in higher education sector. Moreover, a comprehensive systematic literature review of service learning in higher education is also overlooked in previous studies. Therefore, this study covers an in-depth systematic literature review, which reflects the utilisation approach and outcomes of service learning in higher education. By employing a rigorous exploratory approach, this study offers four major findings: (1) Acceptance and use of service learning in different academic disciplines, which covers a detailed discussion of up to what extent service learning pedagogy practice exists in each discipline. (2) Emerging issues regarding the integration of service learning in different academic disciplines. (3) Comparative analysis of previous service learning frameworks, which includes theoretical foundation, main findings and limitations of each framework. (4) Potential benefits of service learning for all participants. Service learning presents diverse benefits for all stakeholders; we identified the list of potential outcomes in the light of emerging service learning literature. These findings show that service learning is frequently employed in some academic disciplines, i.e. medical and nursing sciences; business and economics; computer science and information system; social studies; teacher education; linguistic and environmental disciplines. Moreover, comparison of previous service learning frameworks revealed that most of them are subject-oriented, specifically focused on institutionalising and practical aspects.

AB  - Probably owing to the prejudice that gold is a metal too noble to be used much in chemistry, the chemistry of this element has developed much later than that of its congeners and neighbors in the periodic table. In fact, before and after the time of alchemists, and up to the 20th century, all chemistry of gold was mainly performed in attempts to provide humans with more gold metal for jewelry and coinage. The potential of the chemistry of gold was left largely unexplored. Now, within only a quarter of a century, gold chemistry has become one of the most popular areas of research and technology. In mostly interdisciplinary endeavors, gold and its alloys and compounds have become the focus of projects in quantum chemistry, homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, surface science, metal clusters, nanotechnology, photophysics, and medicine. As a particular benefit, these application-oriented studies have further promoted investigations into the fundamentals of the chemistry of this element. Gold exhibits some extreme properties owing to particularly strong relativistic effects. This review summarizes several recent exciting advances in gold chemistry.

AB  - Anatomy is one of the leading subjects in health science, and students need a strong anatomy background in these fields. Traditional lecturer-oriented anatomy education is based predominantly on passive learning methods. In recent years, alternative educational methods like hands-on art and 3D atlas-based education methods have become more popular as competitive alternatives to traditional approaches. This is a prospective, randomized, longitudinal, interventional study, and a total of 181 undergraduate students participated in this study. A comparative design was used with two groups: Artwork and Atlas. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of creative and artistic approaches in improving undergraduate students' attitudes and self-efficacy toward anatomy courses. A Pearson correlation, an independent t-test, and a paired t-test were used to analyze the results. Both groups experienced a negative mean score on the anatomy self-efficacy scale, suggesting an increase in anatomy self-efficacy, and showed significant self-efficacy improvements (p < 0.005). An independent t-test analysis found no statistically significant difference between the Atlas group and the Artwork group on the anatomy self-efficacy scales (pretest and posttest) and the anatomy attitudes scale (p > 0.005). Artwork-based education and learning methods can be used as active learning methods to improve students' self-efficacy toward anatomy. This method allows learners to employ their creative abilities in order to express their ideas visually, making complex concepts easier to comprehend. It can also help students develop practical, problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork skills. It is cost-effective and engaging since it does not need any expensive equipment.

AB  - Undergraduate research experience has been shown to enhance student learning and improve persistence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Researchers studying undergraduate research experiences have largely focused on student outcomes and have seldom investigated the outcomes of graduate and postdoctoral mentors. Here, we report a non-credit, year-long mentor professional development program designed for graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and research staff in STEM. Mentors attended a series of six interactive and discussion-based workshops and mentored first-year undergraduate students in independent summer research projects. We report evaluation findings for three mentor cohorts using a combination of qualitative analysis of mentoring philosophies and quantitative assessment of pre- and post-surveys about mentoring objectives and skills. Results indicate that mentors gained self-efficacy in some objectives and skills. However, many other objectives and skills remained unchanged. We explore possible explanations for the lack of more broad-scale gains across survey items and present ideas for program improvement.

AB  - The structure of many science programs at the college level assumes that students are able to draw on and integrate ideas from multiple disciplinary contexts. However, most assessment tools focus on learning in the context of a single discipline. We describe the development and validation of an instrument to measure how well students are able to combine energy ideas from different disciplines into a coherent understanding of a phenomenon. The final version of the instrument consists of a pair of multiple-choice online assessments, along with a metric calculated from the assessment scores: the cross disciplinary learning index (CDLI). The items on both assessments were found to have satisfactory psychometric properties for our sample. Furthermore, CDLI scores correlated with other relevant factors such as amount of science coursework. The CDLI is an easy-to-use metric that could be a useful component of program-level assessment for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics majors. Furthermore, the broader measurement approach, involving a pair of assessments set in different disciplinary contexts, provides a model for assessing cross-disciplinary learning that could be utilized for other cross-cutting scientific concepts.

AB  - An increased public knowledge of the health benefits of unsaturated fats has resulted in a surge of different cooking oils. Intense advertising of various oil brands claiming to provide the best dietary recommendations often leaves buyers unclear of what their best choices are. Herein, we describe a research-based project for upper-level undergraduate students, where they can use interdisciplinary concepts in organic chemistry, biochemistry, analytical chemistry, and instrumental analysis to integrate them in a nutrition lab. The experiment was tested over two years in the Instrumental Analysis class, where each student analyzed a liquid oil used for cooking or salad dressings. Ten cooking oils were selected: sunflower, safflower, avocado, sesame, peanut, corn, canola, grapeseed, soybean, and a mixture of sunflower and coconut oils. Six different olive oil products were also compared according to their country of origin, fertilizer used (organic or regular), and type of oil (extra virgin, extra light, 100% pure). The fatty acids (FAs) were first derivatized to their volatile methyl esters (FAMEs) using a microwave-assisted, base-mediated transesterification reaction and then quantified by GC-MS. After pooling the class data, students were exposed to the practical aspects of food analysis while gaining more understanding of their dietary choices.

AB  - Purpose: Science education literature has indicated that teachers do not always feel comfortable teaching socioscientific issues (SSI) that are infused with several social domains. In order to address this problem in teaching SSI, this study is designed to understand and describe the experiences of a science teacher and a social studies teacher, who collaboratively designed and taught an SSI-based environmental ethics class. Research Methods: The purpose of this descriptive case study was to portray how a science and a social studies teacher co-design and co-teach an environmental ethics class. The data collection instruments were interviews, observations, and reflective journals. Thematic analysis of the data was made via a qualitative data analysis software. Findings: The findings indicated that both participants criticized the science curriculum for not being able to address every dimension of SSI. Therefore, they structured their environmental ethics class based on the "triple bottom idea" in order to look at those issues from social, economic, and environmental points of view. One of the highlights of their environmental ethics class was the opportunity given to the students to work on projects they felt passionate about. The participants described their role in the environmental ethics class as a consultant, which was different from traditional settings. Therefore, they no longer provided the content, but rather consulted with their students to explore their vested interests. Implications for Research and Practice: Giving students power to choose their own project topics, the teachers aimed at enhancing the motivation of students in taking pro-environmental actions, as well as developing their own perspective about controversial SSI. Considering the community involvement of the students, this missing piece of students' community involvement and agency in most educational settings was strongly present in the environmental ethics class.

AB  - The need to manage, analyze, and extract knowledge from data is pervasive across industry, government, and academia. Scientists, engineers, and executives routinely encounter enormous volumes of data, and new techniques and tools are emerging to create knowledge out of these data, some of them capable of working with real-time streams of data. The nation's ability to make use of these data depends on the availability of an educated workforce with necessary expertise. With these new capabilities have come novel ethical challenges regarding the effectiveness and appropriateness of broad applications of data analyses. The field of data science has emerged to address the proliferation of data and the need to manage and understand it. Data science is a hybrid of multiple disciplines and skill sets, draws on diverse fields (including computer science, statistics, and mathematics), encompasses topics in ethics and privacy, and depends on specifics of the domains to which it is applied. Fueled by the explosion of data, jobs that involve data science have proliferated and an array of data science programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels have been established. Nevertheless, data science is still in its infancy, which suggests the importance of envisioning what the field might look like in the future and what key steps can be taken now to move data science education in that direction. This study will set forth a vision for the emerging discipline of data science at the undergraduate level. This interim report lays out some of the information and comments that the committee has gathered and heard during the first half of its study, offers perspectives on the current state of data science education, and poses some questions that may shape the way data science education evolves in the future. The study will conclude in early 2018 with a final report that lays out a vision for future data science education.

AB  - The development of transferrable skillsets, articulated in statements of graduate learning outcomes, is emphasised in undergraduate science degree programmes. Science students enrolled in dual (double) degrees comprise a significant minority of Australian science undergraduates. Research comparing perceptions of single and dual degree students on their science learning outcomes has rarely been explored. The Science Students Skills Inventory was used to compare the perceptions of single (n = 640) and dual (n = 266) degree undergraduate science students. The instrument explored science graduate learning outcomes across six indicators: importance; the extent to which outcomes were included; the extent to which they were assessed; improvement; confidence; and likely future use. Analysis of findings, employing the "planned-enacted-experienced" curricula framework, offers insight into potential avenues towards coherence of the "experienced" curriculum by arguing the need for shared perceptions of graduate learning outcomes for single and dual degree science students. The key contribution of this study is a shift towards progressive curriculum development that draws on both single and dual degree student perspectives to achieve graduate learning outcomes. Recommendations include: whole-of-programmes curricular pathways premised on progressive development of learning outcomes that are inclusive of dual degree students, explicit interdisciplinary learning opportunities, and adoption of dual/single status as a demographic variable reported in future research.

AB  - This article presents the combination of three enhanced educational approaches for training future scientists. These methods incorporate skills generally not introduced in the freshman year: student-led blackboard introductions; the writing of scientific papers; and the design, execution, and presentation of an independent lab module. We tested these methods in an interdisciplinary science laboratory course at Princeton University and summarize 2 years of qualitative and quantitative data on the basis of students' evaluations of our approach. In addition to details on our implementation, we show that students mastered all of the requirements and embraced our expectations for greater creativity, independent thinking, and problem solving. The integration of these teaching methods early in their education can help them develop into more successful scientists, and the methods can be broadly applied across the natural sciences. Resources for implementation of our methods are provided.

AB  - As the new generation of designers face more complex design issues, the forms of design research start to shift towards a user-centred approach to problem-solving. The cooperation and communication among various fields and specialisations are becoming more complex; in many practical design cases, in particular, technology developers face challenges in deciphering the creative ideas of designers and the needs and restraints of users, society, law and science. The emergence of integrative design based on a wide range of disciplines has prompted discussion and exploration among various participants. The direction of contemporary design research has already transformed from one based on production of artefact to one focused on the integration of varied knowledge and fields at different stages. We examine such design research based on a problem-driven approach in two case studies characterised by interdisciplinary collaboration for solving complex problems. We focus on the transformation and implementation of integrative design research methods and suggest a "reflection-in-action" problem-solving process for strengthening the capabilities of multidisciplinary design research.

AB  - In this article, the relatively new phenomenon of integrating coding and computer science (CS) related concepts and skills into the K-8 grades is analysed through a comparative analysis of related provincial curriculum initiatives in Canada. First, provincial K-8 curricula that include coding and CS related concepts and skills are identified, as well as the placement of these components within the provincial policy documents. This is followed by a comparative analysis of stated aims and objectives of the curriculum components, and an analysis of the selected concepts and skills themselves. Throughout this analysis, context is provided by theory in the field, as well as the general approaches from jurisdictions outside of Canada, which have been found in the literature. What results is a comparative analysis of this nascent curriculum topic as well as important insights for educators, policy makers, and researchers alike.

AB  - Health Science students at the University of KwaZulu-Natal perform better in their professional modules compared with their physiology modules. The pass rates of physiology service modules have steadily declined over the years. While a system is in place to identify "at-risk" students, it is only activated after the first semester. As a result, it is only from the second semester of their first year studies onward that at-risk students can be formally assisted. The challenge is thus to devise an appropriate strategy to identify struggling students earlier in the semester. Using questionnaires, students were asked about attendance, financing of their studies, and relevance of physiology. After the first class test, failing students were invited to complete a second questionnaire. In addition, demographic data were also collected and analyzed. Correlation analyses were undertaken of performance indicators based on the demographical data collected. The 2011 class comprised mainly sport science students (57%). The pass rate of sport science students was lower than the pass rates of other students (42% vs. 70%, P < 0.001). Most students were positive about physiology and recognized its relevance. Key issues identified were problems understanding concepts and terminology, poor study environment and skills, and lack of matriculation biology. The results of the first class test and final module marks correlated well. It is clear from this study that student performance in the first class test is a valuable tool to identify struggling students and that appropriate testing should be held as early as possible.

AB  - Spatial reasoning plays a vital role in choice of and success in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers, yet the topic is scarce in grade school curricula. We conjecture that this absence may be due to limited knowledge of how spatial reasoning is discussed and engaged across STEM professions. This study aimed to address that gap by asking 19 professionals to comment on a video that documented children's progression through 5 days of building and programming robots. Their written opinions on the skills relevant to their careers demonstrated by the children revealed that spatial thinking and design thinking are central to what they see.

AB  - This book contains a compilation of papers presented at the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2017), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (W.I.A.R.S.). Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2017 received 581 submissions, from 55 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. The conference accepted for presentation 176 submissions (30% acceptance rate). The conference also includes a keynote presentation from an internationally distinguished researcher, Professor Lizbeth Goodman, Chair of Creative Technology Innovation and Professor of Inclusive Design for Learning at University College Dublin; Founder/Director of SMARTlab, Director of the Inclusive Design Research Centre of Ireland, Founder of The MAGIC Multimedia and Games Innovation Centre, Ireland, to whom we express our most gratitude. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. To develop the conference program we have chosen four main broad-ranging categories, which also covers different interest areas: (1) In TEACHERS AND STUDENTS: Teachers and Staff training and education; Educational quality and standards; Curriculum and Pedagogy; Vocational education and Counseling; Ubiquitous and lifelong learning; Training programs and professional guidance; Teaching and learning relationship; Student affairs (learning, experiences and diversity; Extra-curricular activities; Assessment and measurements in Education. (2) In PROJECTS AND TRENDS: Pedagogic innovations; Challenges and transformations in Education; Technology in teaching and learning; Distance Education and eLearning; Global and sustainable developments for Education; New learning and teaching models; Multicultural and (inter)cultural communications; Inclusive and Special Education; Rural and indigenous Education; Educational projects. (3) In TEACHING AND LEARNING: Educational foundations; Research and development methodologies; Early childhood and Primary Education; Secondary Education; Higher Education; Science and technology Education; Literacy, languages and Linguistics (TESL/TEFL); Health Education; Religious Education; Sports Education. (4) In ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES: Educational policy and leadership; Human Resources development; Educational environment; Business, Administration, and Management in Education; Economics in Education; Institutional accreditations and rankings; International Education and Exchange programs; Equity, social justice and social change; Ethics and values; Organizational learning and change, Corporate Education. This book contains the results of the research and developments conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to promote growth in research methods intimately related to teaching, learning and applications in Education nowadays. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, who will extend our view in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues, by sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. We would like to express thanks to all the authors and participants, the members of the academic scientific committee, and of course, to our organizing and administration team for making and putting this conference together.

AB  - We live in a designed world. STEAM by Design presents a transdisciplinary approach to learning that challenges young minds with the task of making a better world. Learning today, like life, is dynamic, connected and engaging. STEAM (Science, Technology, Environment, Engineering, Art, and Math) teaching and learning integrates information in place-based projects accessing everyday technology of virtual field trips, digital interactives, apps, and contemporary art, science and design practices. STEAM by Design develops designing minds. Designing minds work across STEAM fields developing social, cultural, technological, environmental and economical responses to existing and future conditions. Design adds Art and the environment to the STEM equation to contribute site specific, culturally connected, contributions to creative economies. Documented case studies at the elementary, middle and high school level demonstrate the ease of delivering STEAM by Design opportunities and reveal the inherent creativity of students if encouraged. Design cultivates new knowledge, skills and values derived from becoming aware, developing understanding, and testing ideas through making. Designing place-based projects, K- 16 students acquire STEAM aptitude and better understand the use of STEM fields in solving contemporary problems. Access to everyday technologies cultivate ways to create,communicate and collaborate. STEAM by Design is supported by the ELearning Designopedia, NEXT.cc, aligned with newly released NEXT Generation Science Standards, North American Association for Environmental Education Standards and Art and Design Standards. STEAM by Design positions designing as world pedagogy that connects students as citizen activists in the communities in which they live and learn.

AB  - Embedded within ongoing university-community partnerships, participatory action research experiences for undergraduates -- or PAR-based UREs -- are multi-disciplinary, action-oriented research opportunities that engage undergraduates in collaborative research to address community-defined challenges. PAR-based UREs integrate participatory action research (PAR), a practice of social scientists, with undergraduate research experiences (UREs), a widespread and well-funded tradition in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields. PAR-based UREs offer a promising avenue towards fostering constructive university-community relations, while positioning undergraduate students to be competent researchers and critical change agents in collaboration with communities. This theoretical discussion introduces the concept and practice of PAR-based UREs by: (1) reviewing 'traditional' PAR and URE arrangements as separate entities; (2) offering a theoretical rationale for their integration; and (3) describing the formation, organization, and outcomes of a PAR-based URE pilot program, which underscores the need for a coordinated approach towards benefiting -- and reconnecting -- students, communities, universities, and the public.

AB  - As part of a university-wide project to explore Shakespeare's classic play, "Romeo and Juliet," from a variety of perspectives, an interdisciplinary talk was presented to the university community on the chemistry of the potions and poisons referenced in "Romeo and Juliet." To draw the multidisciplinary audience in and to teach about forensics as well as pharmaceutical herbs and chemicals, the presentation was given from the perspective of how a modern crime scene investigator would approach the famous play's final death scene without any prior knowledge of the situation. An autopsy of Juliet's body might have revealed the presence of the chemicals, hyoscine and atropine, that come from the plant "Atropa belladonna." The autopsy could reveal whether the Friar had set out to sedate Juliet or if he had attempted to kill her. An autopsy of Romeo's body might have revealed the presence of aconitine from the plant "Aconitum napellus." Using a classic story to teach about chemistry, basic ideas were introduced about forensics and pharmacology, emphasizing the importance of dose when determining the effect of a drug on the human body.

AB  - In an attempt to address declining persistence rates of university STEM majors (Science, Teaching, Engineering, and Math), concerns regarding retention rates and waning STEM faculty participation in faculty development, we report on a year-long professional development program called the STEM Professional Academy to Reinvigorate the Culture of Teaching (SPARCT) that focuses on evidence-based teaching practices. Expected SPARCT outcomes include: (1) improving evidence-based practices in the introductory STEM classroom, (2) developing professional peer-observation strategies for the STEM classroom, (3) enhancing scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) by SPARCT faculty, (4) developing long-term Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs) in STEM instruction, and (5) enhancing student learning in introductory STEM courses. In this article, we describe the features of SPARCT and discuss findings from our first three years as aligned with the outcomes over three cohorts of SPARCT participants (2014-2016). By engaging at least 25% of Florida Gulf Coast University's STEM faculty during the three years, SPARCT is creating a community of STEM scholars with self-efficacy in using evidence-based teaching practices, reinvigorating interdisciplinary connections, developing learning threads, and increasing the community's potential to transform the teaching culture of the university.

AB  - Course and subject development teams are increasingly seen in the tertiary online teaching environment and they face a unique set of challenges. The purpose of this study was to synthesise and share learnings of 12 academics involved in the development of subjects with an external partner for a new multidisciplinary online health science course at an Australian university, in order to improve ongoing development within the course and inform new course development. In this case study, thematic analysis of focus group discussions and qualitative survey data identified five key themes related to the development process: time management, setting expectations, communication, the development team, and ownership. Barriers to productive subject development included unrealistic timelines, unclear lines of communication, unmet or unrealistic expectations and lack of recognition of team members' expertise, and lack of support for genuine collaboration. Team-based development of an online course has the potential to be a rewarding experience for academics. In order for the benefits to be realised, approaches to development underpinned by a community-centred framework, observing core values such as collaboration, shared sense of purpose and expectations, would address a number of the issues identified in this study.

AB  - In 2012, the United Nations General Assembly declared 2014 the International Year of Crystallography. Throughout the year 2014 and beyond, all the crystallographic associations and societies active all over the world are organizing events to attract the wider public toward crystallography and the numerous topics to which it is deeply interlinked. To increase awareness of modern crystallography and to diminish its halo of exoticism, the present commentary focuses on the fundamental contributions of X-ray crystallography during the last century in chemistry, physics, and medicine, as witnessed by the numerous Nobel Prizes that involved it.

AB  - This article describes an interdisciplinary unit in which students explore biological "ice nucleation"--by particles that cause water to freeze at temperatures above -38°C--through the lens of the microbial ice nucleator "Pseudomonas syringae." Such This activity, which aligns with the "Next Generation Science Standards", exposes students to the global water cycle, highlighting the importance of critical and ethical thinking at the intersection of biology and engineering. Furthermore, the activity is designed to: (1) introduce students to principles of ice nucleation and allow them to recognize the diversity of ice-nucleating particles; (2) allow students to recognize how interdisciplinary research can address complex problems across multiple fields of study, using ice nucleation and its relationship to atmospheric processes as an example; (3) have students consider principles of experimental design, including the formulation of testable hypotheses and the inclusion of appropriate positive and negative controls in developing an ice nucleation test; (4) have students design and conduct an ice nucleation experiment with known and unknown samples of undetermined ice nucleation activity; and (5) highlight connections between systems of different scale such as microbiology (ice nucleation) and the global water cycle (bioprecipitation).

AB  - Speech-language pathology graduate programs do not reflect equity across racial and ethnic groups. Training programs must adopt an anti-racist stance and intentionally and strategically plan for equity and inclusion of students and professionals who are Black, Indigenous and Persons of Color (BIPOC). Retention of minoritized students must be supported by inclusion efforts. The authors review systems of support essential to the recruitment and retention of BIPOC students in graduate programs. Through funding support from a grant, the authors developed a model of training bilingual SLP students to work with dual language learners through an inclusive model of interprofessional education. Finally, the authors conclude with a discussion of questions faculty should consider to create institutional change. The authors are hopeful that this article provides SLP programs a best practice framework to build a diverse pipeline of speech-language pathologists better equipped to deliver effective culturally and linguistically responsive interventions for the clients served within our field and across our transdisciplinary work.

AB  - Inorganic phosphors are the main component of light emitting diodes which have caused the revolution in lighting industry as an energy-efficient and long-lasting replacement of traditional incandescent light bulbs and fluorescent tubes. They are also used in various consumer products and displays and can potentially find applications in photocatalysis, solar cells, optical thermometers, and stress indicators. Long-afterglow phosphors provide an opportunity to visually observe and test different phenomena in solid-state materials and can be used as an effective teaching tool at the undergraduate level. We developed an upper-level undergraduate laboratory experiment that integrates the synthesis, processing, structural and spectroscopic characterization, and applications of strontium-aluminate-based phosphors. Observation of the intensity and duration of the phosphor afterglow under different conditions reinforces students' learning of various concepts related to materials structure and properties, and spectroscopic principles, in an engaging and impactful way. The phenomena of thermoluminescence and mechanoluminescence, and their potential applications in thermal sensors and ballistics, respectively, are also introduced. Depending on the instructor's goals, the described laboratory experiment can be used in a modified form in inorganic or physical chemistry laboratory courses, but we believe it is particularly well-suited as a module for advanced laboratory courses in interdisciplinary programs.

AB  - This paper shows a method for integrating computer programming into a standard physical chemistry laboratory sequence to augment student data analysis abilities and allow them to carry programming skills forward to other courses. The Python programming language is used, taking advantage of the pedagogical benefits of Jupyter notebooks, primarily the ability to intersperse instructions and interactive code cells. A series of five notebooks, plus one traditional script exercise, are designed to teach basic techniques (e.g., loops, assignments, data types), instrument interfacing, model fitting, and introductory quantum chemistry. The skills are directly applicable to laboratories the students perform during the hands-on portion of the courses. A survey of students who have completed the course show high confidence in their ability to learn new skills, and student comments reveal they have used these skills in a variety of other contexts.

AB  - Radiation oncologists require an in-depth understanding of anatomical relationships for modern clinical practice, although most do not receive formal anatomy training during residency. To fulfill the need for instruction in relevant anatomy, a series of four multidisciplinary, interactive learning modules were developed for a cohort of radiation oncology and medical physics residents. Instructional design was based on established learning theories, with the intent of integrating knowledge of specific anatomical regions with radiology and radiation oncology practice. Each session included presentations by a radiologist and a radiation oncologist, as well as hands-on exploration of anatomical specimens with guidance from anatomists. Pre- and post-tests distributed during each session showed significant short-term knowledge retention. According to qualitative surveys and exit interviews, participants felt more comfort with delineating structures, gross anatomy, and radiograph interpretation at the end of each session. Overall participant experience was positive, and the modules were considered effective for learning radiologic anatomy. Suggestions for future interventions include more time, increased clinical application, additional contouring practice and feedback, and improved coordination between each of the three disciplines. Results and conclusions from this study will be used to inform the design of a future multi-day national workshop for Canadian radiation oncology residents.

AB  - A study was conducted on the cognitive processes involved in the steps of problem-based learning and the way this pedagogical approach is applied in the health sciences. The objective was to understand more deeply the cognitive process related to student comprehension and its connection with the work done when studying a medical discipline through problem-based learning (PBL). A case study was undertaken with a total of 30 students and an interdisciplinary team composed of a physician and two professionals in the field of education. After a video analysis process of face-to-face teamwork on PBL, it was decided to design and use an advanced organizer to systematize and ease the comprehension process while working with problem scenarios. From its initial application, the students were satisfied with its usefulness, and they provided feedback to improve its format and extend its applicability to other disciplines. It was concluded that not only is it possible to integrate hybrid models in problem-based learning, but also to include variants and auxiliary tools that arise from the cognitive demands and the information management needs of the students, thus favoring the study and the preservation of knowledge.

AB  - As nonrenewable resources deplete and educators seek relevant interdisciplinary content for organic chemistry instruction, biobased laboratory experiments present themselves as potential alternatives to petroleum-based transformations, which offer themselves as sustainable variations on important themes. Following the principles of green chemistry and the powerful biorefinery model it is possible to create pedagogically sound and modern laboratory experiments employing readily available renewable reactants and reagents to convey important organic chemistry principles. In a reverse approach compared to total synthesis, these experiments should serve to not only make the undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory more green and sustainable but also educate the next generation with both historically important developments and cutting-edge research.

AB  - Earth Science and Geography teacher preparation has developed to some degree along different lines, despite sharing many of the same issues, especially with regard to challenges in teacher education. The conference "International Perspectives on Geography and Earth Science Teacher Education 2016" wanted to bring together educators from both sciences from around the world together to move the debate about these challenges forward. From the research presentations and the discussion during and after the conference, several issues emerged: (1) the importance of the two subjects not losing sight of each other; (2) the need to overcome language barriers; (3) the question of standards/objectives for geography teacher education (e.g. with regard to teachers' (P)CK); (4) media used in teacher education (including ways to improve them); (5) ways to improve learners' geography and earth science content knowledge; and (6) strategies to increase teachers' professionalism. We already suggest some specific steps teacher educators in the two fields can take to improve teacher education. Yet, it also became clear that more research and strengthening international collaborations are needed, as well as better communication of the results of these efforts to practitioners.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore knowledge in the context of creating a shared curriculum between research-intensive and vocationally oriented universities of applied sciences. Curriculum knowledge was explored from the accounts of 26 teachers from four institutions in Finland. Shared curriculum initiatives created an environment in which teachers were obliged to negotiate and make explicit their approaches to curriculum knowledge and knowledge practices. The phenomenon of blurring boundaries is approached with Bernstein's sociology of education. The present findings show that institutions have a distinct foundation for curriculum knowledge, but cross-curricular initiatives brought pressure to change towards the knowledge practices of the other institution. Discrepancies were found between knowledge and learning outcomes, and between knowledge as a negotiated artefact and knowledge as enacted in curriculum implementation. Curriculum knowledge emerged with symbolic boundaries and an invisible pedagogic order. This resulted in practices where the official discourse appears to have similar learning outcomes, which are not similar from the perspective of knowledge. Focus on a harmonised degree, as stated in the European qualification framework, obscures the question of knowledge and requires more attention. This is especially the case if the boundaries between degrees and institutions are purposely weakened. If the rationale to weaken the boundaries is on the streamlined educational processes and their efficacy, there is a risk of gaps in knowledge provided for students in the higher education.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine whether students' self-assessment (SSA) could be used as a significant attribute to predict students' future academic achievement. Design/methodology/approach: The authors address how well students can assess their abilities and study the relationship between this ability and demographic properties and previous study performance. The authors present the study results by measuring the relationship between the SSA across five different topics and comparing them with the students' performance in these topics using short tests. The test has been voluntarily taken by more than 300 students planning to enroll in the School of Business Informatics and Mathematics master's programs at the University of Mannheim. Findings: The study results reveal which attributes are mostly associated with the accuracy level of SSA in higher education. The authors conclude that SSA, it can be valuable in predicting master's students' academic achievement when taking specific measures when designing the predictive module. Research limitations/implications: Due to time constraints, the study was restricted only to students applying to master's programs at the Faculty of Business Informatics and Mathematics at the University of Mannheim. This resulted in collecting a limited data set. Also, the scope of this study was restricted to testing the accuracy of SSA and did not test using it as an attribute for predicting students' academic achievement. Originality/value: Predicting students' academic performance in higher education is beneficial from different perspectives. The literature reveals that a considerable amount of work is published to analyze and predict academic performance in higher education. However, most of the published work relies on attributes such as demographics, teachers' assessment, and examination scores for performing their prediction while neglecting the use of other forms of evaluation such as SSA or self-evaluation.

AB  - Quality of healthcare delivery is dependent on collaboration between professional disciplines. Integrating opportunities for interprofessional learning in health science education programs prepares future clinicians to function as effective members of a multi-disciplinary care team. This study aimed to create a modified team-based learning (TBL) environment utilizing ultrasound technology during an interprofessional learning activity to enhance musculoskeletal anatomy knowledge of first year medical (MD) and physical therapy (PT) students. An ultrasound demonstration of structures of the upper limb was incorporated into the gross anatomy courses for first-year MD (n = 53) and PT (n = 28) students. Immediately before the learning experience, all students took an individual readiness assurance test (iRAT) based on clinical concepts regarding the assigned study material. Students observed while a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician demonstrated the use of ultrasound as a diagnostic and procedural tool for the shoulder and elbow. Following the demonstration, students worked within interprofessional teams (n = 14 teams, 5--6 students per team) to review the related anatomy on dissected specimens. At the end of the session, students worked within interprofessional teams to complete a collaborative clinical case-based multiple choice post-test. Team scores were compared to the mean individual score within each team with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Students scored higher on the collaborative post-test (95.2 ±10.2%) than on the iRAT (66.1 ± 13.9% for MD students and 76.2 ±14.2% for PT students, P < 0.0001). Results suggest that this interprofessional team activity facilitated an improved understanding and clinical application of anatomy.

AB  - Today, the number of researches about STEM education, which is brought to the forefront by innovative interdisciplinary approaches, has been increasing over the years and each research is carried out in different areas, regions for different purposes. When these studies are examined, it is thought that the studies can be gathered under certain headings and themes and a broad perspective about the studies can be presented. We reached 186 works in the framework of STEM and other innovative approaches worldwide, except for Turkey. 48 of these studies from 21 different countries, written in 4 different languages, were selected between 2009-2019. These studies were evaluated in 9 different themes and 24 sub-concepts. These studies include all partners (students, teachers, parents and others) of the education system. The impact of innovative interdisciplinary practices on students' academic achievement, scientific process skills and career awareness is positive. Gender is an important factor in perception and attitudes. In-school and out-of-school activities are effective in acquiring 21st century skills. Education partner's attitude towards innovative interdisciplinary approaches is positive. In some studies, limitations such as physical space, time and cost disrupted the realization of activities and sometimes it was a negative situation that the teachers did not have the necessary training formation and felt inadequate for these activities. Existing curricula, which are shaped within the framework of knowledge-based examination system, were also seen as another limiting factor. At the end of the research, suggestions were made to all partners of the education system for the research and applications to be carried out in innovative interdisciplinary fields.

AB  - Purpose: The integrated science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education has been reported to improve students' science achievement. Nevertheless, few studies have focused on how this approach affected different ability groups. Lack of equity or the presence of achievement gap can be detrimental because they can reduce medium and low-ability students' interest in science, which in turn can affect national development. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the main and the interaction effects of integrated science, technology, engineering and mathematics (ISTEMA) on students' science achievement and how this approach affects students with different academic abilities. Methodology: The research adopted a 2x3 factorial design. The sample size consisted of 100 Nigerian science students from Year 11. A total of 51 students with different academic abilities (low, medium and high) were assigned randomly to an experimental group. The experimental group was taught genetics using a five-phased iterative ISTEMA process. Pre-test and post-test data were collected using 40 multiple-choice questions adopted from a national high-stakes examination. Analysis of covariance, paired sample t-test and one-way analysis of variance were utilised in the data analysis. Findings: Findings for research question one revealed a main significant difference in science achievement between year 11 students who learned using ISTEMA and those using traditional methods. No significant interaction effect was observed between the instructional approach and students' academic abilities, that is, students' academic abilities and the instructional approach did not interact to enhance students' achievement. The findings for research question two indicated that high, medium and low academic-ability students benefitted; however, students with low academic abilities had the highest mean gain. Significance: Findings in this study have revealed empirically that the ISTEMA, as an instructional approach, has the potential to close the academic achievement gap. The findings may also serve as a guide for policymakers to promote STEM education in schools.

AB  - Gifted children are often highly sensitive to their surroundings and are able to readily identify potential solutions to challenges that imperil the environment in which they live. Many gifted children are strong advocates of sustainable living, caring deeply about the world around them and its health in the future. For this reason, parents and families interested in helping their gifted children fully develop their talents would do well to support guided investigations into the environment and sustainability. Environmental science represents an interdisciplinary academic field that integrates physical, biological, and information technology sciences to the study of the environment and the development of potential solutions to problems facing the local, national, or global community. A variety of organizations, associations, museums, and other groups provide programs that are ideal for a gifted child interested in the environment. In addition, a plethora of print and electronic resources make it easy for parents to create such programming at home. Examinations of real-life problems in the gifted children's surroundings often provide an ideal way to expose them to environmental science and the many ways this discipline seeks to foster solutions to conundrums facing individuals, industries, and communities.

AB  - A traditional classroom usually focuses on concepts from a specific discipline. However, solving complex real-world problems requires integration and application of knowledge from various fields. Here, we describe a 4-hr undergraduate-level laboratory exercise that utilizes concepts of extraction and biological property, bridging between chemistry and microbiology courses. In the first half of this exercise, students performed hydrodistillation to extract essential oil from a locally available herb, lemongrass ("Cymbopogon citratus," Stapf). In the second half, students investigated the potential antimicrobial activity of the extracted oil against various microorganisms using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Students also developed their own experimental questions based on the extracted oil and the antimicrobial testing technique. Self-assessment questionnaire shows students' appreciation of the experiments and substantial learning gains in the extraction process, properties of the extracts, and antimicrobial activity testing. This laboratory exercise prompts students to formulate their own experimental questions and engages students in interdisciplinary experimentation.

AB  - The idea and practice of liberal education has been shaped in two forms in its historical development: the American traditions and British traditions. The idea of liberal education in the United States was borrowed from the United Kingdom and it was deeply influenced by British traditions in terms of highlighting classics and intellectual training. Over more than one hundred years from its Independence to the First World War, Americans began criticizing the aristocracy of British liberal education and gradually developed their own traditions, which were innovative in the idea, interpretation, courses and structure. In terms of the idea of liberal education, Americans highlighted the purpose of liberal education to train free citizens and to meet the demands of the civil society. In terms of the meaning of liberal education, American traditions tended to interpret "liberal" as "free" or "liberating" other than "gentlemanly" or "learned". In course design, British traditions rarely emphasized broader range and multi-disciplinary. In contrast, course design in American liberal education is more encyclopedic, valuing both liberal arts and sciences and later developing a liberal arts course model combining humanities, social sciences and natural sciences.

AB  - This paper discusses investigations in science education addressing the nonlinear dynamical hypothesis. Learning science is a suitable field for applying interdisciplinary research and predominately for testing psychological theories. It was demonstrated that in this area the paradigm of complexity and nonlinear dynamics have offered theoretical advances and better interpretations of empirical data. Research showed that besides linear modes of behavior, sudden transitions occur in cognitive performance and this has questioned basic theoretical and epistemological assumptions. The neo-Piagetian framework and motivational theories offering constructs for serving as predictors in various model are the local theories which are embraced by the CDS meta-theory. Sudden transitions are modeled by catastrophe theory (CT) the analyses of which reveal the crucial role of certain variables, namely the bifurcation factors. Beyond a critical value of the bifurcation factor, the state variable splits into two-attractor regions and becomes bimodal. The bifurcation effect induces uncertainty and unpredictability in the system, which oscillates between two states entering the regime of chaos. Then in state variables such as learning outcomes and achievement, sudden transitions from success to failure are expected. Catastrophe theory explains unexpected phenomena associated with school failure, dropouts, illicit behaviors, sudden attitude change, and creativity. Moreover CT could contribute in elucidating theoretical debates and conflicting empirical evidences.

AB  - This article provides an introduction for the special issue of the "Journal of Science Education and Technology" focused on computational thinking (CT) from a disciplinary perspective. The special issue connects earlier research on what K-12 students can learn and be able to do using CT with the CT skills and habits of mind needed to productively participate in professional CT-integrated STEM fields. In this context, the phrase "disciplinary perspective" simultaneously holds two meanings: it refers to and aims to make connections between established K-12 STEM subject areas (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and newer CT-integrated disciplines such as computational sciences. The special issue presents a framework for CT integration and includes articles that illuminate what CT looks like from a disciplinary perspective, the challenges inherent in integrating CT into K-12 STEM education, and new ways of measuring CT aligned more closely with disciplinary practices. The aim of this special issue is to offer research-based and practitioner-grounded insights into recent work in CT integration and provoke new ways of thinking about CT integration from researchers, practitioners, and research-practitioner partnerships.

AB  - In the United States, broad study in an array of different disciplines--arts, humanities, science, mathematics, engineering--as well as an in-depth study within a special area of interest, have been defining characteristics of a higher education. But over time, in-depth study in a major discipline has come to dominate the curricula at many institutions. This evolution of the curriculum has been driven, in part, by increasing specialization in the academic disciplines. There is little doubt that disciplinary specialization has helped produce many of the achievement of the past century. Researchers in all academic disciplines have been able to delve more deeply into their areas of expertise, grappling with ever more specialized and fundamental problems. The report examines the evidence behind the assertion that educational programs that mutually integrate learning experiences in the humanities and arts with science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) lead to improved educational and career outcomes for undergraduate and graduate students. It explores evidence regarding the value of integrating more STEMM curricula and labs into the academic programs of students majoring in the humanities and arts and evidence regarding the value of integrating curricula and experiences in the arts and humanities into college and university STEMM education programs.

AB  - This column presents ideas and techniques to enhance science teaching. In this month's issue an upper elementary Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) challenge brings an engineer into the classroom while emphasizing cooperation, communication, and creativity. STEM activities come in various shapes and sizes. Some are quite involved and require students to possess some degree of prior knowledge and skills, while others are relatively simple and can be accomplished with minimal prior knowledge and skills. In this article, the authors provide an inexpensive, multi-day STEM task that brings a local engineer into the classroom. This spaghetti structure challenge is multidisciplinary, integrating STEM disciplines with reading and writing literacy. The spaghetti structure challenge engages students in problem-solving strategies and structural design processes in science and engineering. Problem solving enables students to assume ownership and responsibility of the task. Problem solving is a form of both active learning and discovery learning--a combination of hands-on and minds-on education. In this example, the authors chose to describe the task to students as a challenge rather than a competition to emphasize the 3 "Cs"-- cooperation, communication, and creativity. However, the decision to introduce the task as a challenge or a competition rests with the classroom teacher and whether his or her students are motivated by in-classroom peer competitions.

AB  - Massive open online courses (MOOCs) provide hundreds of students with teaching materials, assessment tools, and collaborative instruments. The assessment activity, in particular, is demanding in terms of both time and effort; thus, the use of artificial intelligence can be useful to address and reduce the time and effort required. This paper reports on a system and related experiments finalised to improve both the performance and quality of formative and summative assessments in specific data science courses. The system is developed to automatically grade assignments composed of R commands commented with short sentences written in natural language. In our opinion, the use of the system can: (1) shorten the correction times and reduce the possibility of errors; and (2) support the students while solving the exercises assigned during the course through automated feedback. To investigate these aims, an ad-hoc experiment was conducted in three courses containing the specific topic of statistical analysis of health data. Our evaluation demonstrated that automated grading has an acceptable correlation with human grading. Furthermore, the students who used the tool did not report usability issues, and those that used it for more than half of the exercises obtained (on average) higher grades in the exam. Finally, the use of the system reduced the correction time and assisted the professor in identifying correction errors.

AB  - This paper describes the design of an industrial informatics course, following the project-based learning methodology, and reports the experience of four academic years (from 2012-13 to 2015-16). Industrial Informatics is a compulsory course taught in the third year of the B.Sc. degree in industrial electronics and automation engineering at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Spain. The course had students develop an embedded controller for a 2DoF SCARA robot that drew a specific trajectory. The robot was built with the LEGO Mindstorms kit and the controller was implemented with NXC, a C-like programming language for the NXT brick. In this activity, students became aware of their learning needs and had to work proactively, both autonomously and in teams. The course design achieved several objectives: 1) students learned the course material; 2) soft skills demanded by employers were reinforced; and 3) the material was structured into project tasks for students to perform. The article analyses two indicators: 1) qualification marks and 2) student satisfaction.

AB  - This article explores a multidisciplinary lesson on nanotechnology that can provide an effective means for teaching about both STEM and social studies topics. This approach encourages students to consider the "role that science and technology play in our lives and in our cultures." The extraordinary promise of nanotechnology, however, is tempered by concerns about its social and ethical ramifications, providing a case study about the interconnected relationship between the sciences, technology, and our democratic society. In this lesson, students create digital documentaries that address social issues related to nanotechnology. Ideally, social studies teachers would collaborate with science and technology teachers in their schools to simulate the work of multidisciplinary teams. The student-created documentaries should explore the affordances and limitations of nanotechnology to address various issues while focusing on relevant ethical, economic, social, and cultural issues. The multidisciplinary approach to nanotechnology featured in this lesson plan emphasizes the important role of science within a democracy. Nanotechnology is one example of the myriad ways that scientific advancement can positively impact our society. As teachers approach STEM education they should collaborate to promote student understanding of the complex and multidisciplinary nature of scientific innovation.

AB  - We present ideas about how to incorporate discussion of a paintings collection in chemistry classrooms. Specifically, it is a collection of paintings that have illustrated calendars since 1900, from a traditional Spanish explosives company (founded by Alfred Nobel and now known as Maxam). The case is discussed in relation to the "chemistry in context" literature. Through suggested activities, students are encouraged to discuss a wide variety of topics of general chemistry (nomenclature, chemical reactions, stoichiometry, etc.) and other topics, such as chemistry of explosives, history and ethics of science and technology, the origin of the Nobel prizes, introduction to the chemical industry, chemistry of fireworks, and environmental chemistry, among others.

AB  - Using findings from a 4-year research and development effort, we propose an updated model of sheltered instruction for science classrooms that leverages the opportunities provided by the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) to better support multilingual learners in middle and high school science. Using data from teacher implementation logs and interviews, we examine how secondary grades science teachers' participation in our professional learning framework and subsequent enactments of an initial set of project instructional practices led these teachers to articulate nuanced and strategic adaptations to the initial practices to better meet the needs of the multilingual learners in their classrooms. We found that teachers moved away from implementing sheltered instruction practices based on general principles or formal classifications, such as students' English language proficiency level, instead taking a more nuanced approach to adopting, adapting and rejecting practices based on perceived needs, assets, and personal knowledge about individual multilingual students in the specific disciplinary context of science. Based on this analysis, we conceptualize and refine what we now see as a new and exploratory set of Next Generation Sheltered Instruction practices for integrating science and language to support multilingual learners in secondary science classrooms in the age of the NGSS.

AB  - The Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter (LRSM), University of Pennsylvania, was built in 1965 as part of the Advanced Research Projects Agency's (ARPA) Interdisciplinary Laboratories (IDL) program intended to foster interdisciplinary research and training in materials science. The process that led to the construction of the four-story structure served as the focus of intense debates over the meaning and process of interdisciplinary research in universities. The location of the building, its size, internal design, and functionalities were all subject to heated negotiations among patrons, scientists, and university administrators, to find the proper place of interdisciplinary materials science on the University of Pennsylvania's campus. Building on the recent work on laboratory architecture, this paper argues that the negotiations and controversies over the LRSM building were concrete representations of the broader struggle over the appropriate place of interdisciplinary research and training within a university.

AB  - Recent advances in brain science show that adult native Japanese speakers utilize a different balance of language processing routes in the brain as compared to native English speakers. Biologically this represents the remarkable flexibility of the human brain to adapt universal human cognitive processes to fit the specific needs of linguistic and cultural environments. For language teaching, however, and because of nearly three decades of globalization and English language programming in the Japanese education system, this represents a key theoretical and practical issue that cannot be overlooked. Using a range of contemporary interdisciplinary research findings, this theoretical article opens a discussion of these cognitive routes, the mechanisms by which they might occur, and ideas regarding how they might be accommodated in planning future English as a foreign language (EFL) programs for Japanese speakers.

AB  - Curricular demands and best practices for middle school require interdisciplinary units. Arts integration can provide motivation and a new pathway to learning. This unit focused on inquiry into the natural history of artifacts and rocks recovered from the exposed subsoil of an area near Cedar Falls, Iowa that had been bulldozed as part of subdivision development. The described unit involved preservice teachers in exploration of all subject areas (language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies) with arts-integrated projects (agate watercolor painting, stone tool graphing, acrylic polymer clay agate keyring making, and stone tool drawings). The content area activities for social studies included identification and lifestyle interpretation of stone tools found intermixed with rocks and sand in the subsoil of the site. Science content activities included identification of rocks (igneous and metamorphic rocks; quartz nodules, geodes, and agates; and iron ore specimens) from the site along with interpretation of basalt cobbles that had been ground flat as glacially transported, and interpretation of maps and diagrams of glaciation, iron ore deposits, and agate deposits. Language arts activities involved word study through morpheme analysis of words such as "anthropology" and "artifact" along with matching a set of descriptive adjectives to objects related to agates. Mathematics content activities focused on graphing. Preservice teachers were highly engaged in the activities, remarking that they learned new content and pedagogy. Some expressed lack of confidence regarding artistic ability because of little experience and the desire to complete everything in the correct manner. At the end of the lessons, preservice teachers expressed that teaching the content through themes allowed for a great number of connections between subject areas, increased real-life connections, and deeper understandings of the topics.

AB  - Interdisciplinary experiments are being offered in upper-division chemistry laboratory courses in an attempt to encourage students to make a connection between techniques learned in one discipline to affirm chemical principles that form the basis of chemical reactions in another chemistry discipline. A new interdisciplinary experiment is described in which students synthesize bis(lutidine)silver(I) nitrate complexes, where the position of the methyl groups on the pyridine ring varies. The stability of these metal complexes is evaluated as a function of basicity of the ligand by studying the rate of decomposition of the metal complex through isothermal thermogravimetric analysis. An Arrhenius plot is used to determine activation energies for the decomposition reaction, and the data are used to establish the positive correlation between the activation energy with the basicity of the lutidine ligand.

AB  - Background: Laboratory studies explore the norms and characteristics of scientific practice and explain the constructive nature of knowledge production. However, how learning and research are sustained in engineering research laboratories at the graduate level requires further investigation. Purpose: We explored the cultural characteristics of an interdisciplinary engineering research center and documented how its members interacted and sustained both research and learning activities. Design/Method: We employed ethnographic data collection strategies to document the process of developing expertise (i.e., learning) and meaningfully contributing (i.e., research) at the center. Participant observations, field notes, and interviews were conducted. Results: The center did not resemble the research laboratories described in prior ethnographic studies in terms of physical space; however, it is an organizational system that demonstrates various dimensions of human activity. We present our results in four subsections: (1) configurations of the research groups, (2) the roles and responsibilities of the engineering researchers, (3) characterization of the research center as a community of practice, and (4) authentic engineering practices. Mentoring as a tacit rule played a central role in sustaining engineering learning and research activities. It was dependent on the managerial preferences of lead engineering researchers as they developed different identities over time. Meetings, cultural transformation, shared repertoire, and tools characterized the center as a community of practice. Conclusions: Our findings inform how people learn. Educational settings should foster similar characteristics (e.g., mentoring to sustain engineering research, learning, and building a community of practice) to better portray authentic engineering and science practices to students.

AB  - This article explores the ways in which the quantitative and qualitative tools used by risk managers can help students think critically about issues. In particular, it identifies some of the quantitative skills used for risk assessment that can be taught and used in mathematics and science classes. It also examines the qualitative knowledge of governance structures, primarily acquired in social studies classes, and how these can be applied in analyzing solutions to the complex issues of this century and our future. Examples are given of the application of these diverse skill sets to such controversial issues as the use of nuclear technology, disaster response, and preservation of the environment. An interdisciplinary approach to the teaching of controversial issues is encouraged.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present an example of pedagogical strategy, called innovation pedagogy, and study whether its learning environments (activating teaching and learning methods, working life orientation and research, development and innovation (RDI) integration, multidisciplinary learning environments, flexible curricula, entrepreneurship and internationalization) can be associated with students' innovation competences (creativity, critical thinking, initiative, teamwork and networking). Design/methodology/approach: In this case study, the electronic self-assessment questionnaire was distributed to third- and fourth-year bachelor students (n=236) from one Finnish university of applied sciences at the end of the Spring semester in 2017. Findings: Two profiles of students concerning their level of innovation competences can be identified. The level of students' innovation competences is associated with all the six elements of learning environments. The more students have experience with learning environments of innovation pedagogy, the higher they scored when assessed for their innovation competences. Research limitations/implications Because of the case study setting and a limited sample, there are limitations to the generalizability of the findings. Originality/value: Focusing on different levels of innovation competences of students and approaching their study path in more detail, it could be better understood how to develop more effective education, and thus, respond to the demands of an innovation society. This study extends approaches on research in education and innovation and strengthens the understanding that learning environments should be versatile and include many-sided learning opportunities. It also shows that implementing pedagogical strategy needs lot of work to be revealed in practice.

AB  - For more than 40 years, the international community has acknowledged the role education might play in environmental awareness and conservation. The last major initiative came when the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed a Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005-2014). In the final year of the decade, teachers still struggle to realise education for sustainable development (ESD). One of the challenges teachers face with respect to ESD is the inclusion of even more content into an already overloaded curriculum. In response, it has been suggested that ESD should be introduced as an integrated perspective across the content of all existing subjects. This paper offers a model for how ESD can be realised in chemistry education. The model has been developed to support chemistry teachers in their educational planning and consists of 5 categories: chemical content knowledge, chemistry in context, the distinctiveness and methodological character of chemistry, ESD competences and lived ESD. The ESD model is illustrated through 5 ellipses, visualising the hierarchy of the categories, as they exist in different levels. All 5 ESD categories need to be considered in a holistic ESD approach.

AB  - Disruptive events such as economic recessions, natural disasters, job loss, and divorce are highly prevalent among American families. These events can have a long-lasting impact when experienced during childhood, potentially altering academic achievement, socioemotional well-being, health and development, and later life socioeconomic status. Much research has considered the overall impact of disruptive events on children's lives, but the consequences of disruption also vary across groups. The same event may have profound negative consequences for some groups, minor or no impact for others, and even be a generative or positive turning point for other groups. This issue focuses on the disparate consequences of disruptive events on children. We consider theoretical approaches accounting for effect heterogeneity and methodological challenges in identifying unequal impacts. We also review an emerging multidisciplinary literature accounting for variation in the impact of disruption across several widely studied domains that affect children's life chances, including economic, household, educational, health, and environmental events.

AB  - Practitioners in the field of pharmacy are often confronted with ill-structured problems. Specifically, pharmacists are tasked with making patient-specific recommendations that are both safe and effective, which requires combining knowledge from the biomedical, behavioral, and pharmaceutical sciences. Given the dynamic nature of pharmacy as a profession, the field has begun to explore learning strategies that go beyond mere content coverage to strategies that better support higher-order learning outcomes. One of these approaches is problem-based learning (PBL). While studies have focused on how to support PBL to improve learning outcomes, the role of assessment is often overlooked. Further exploration is thus needed since assessment plays a pivotal role in teaching and learning. This Voices paper will explore this idea within a larger context; we will also share the experience of how a subject matter expert (SME) worked with a team of instructional designers (IDs) to revise an existing course to more explicitly employ PBL and thus adopt an inquiry-based mindset needed for complex clinical decision making. Given the inherent challenges of assessment in PBL, further discussion will be focused on how to (a) design ill-structured problems, (b) align assessments to the PBL curriculum, and (c) how to hold students accountable in cases where a traditional grade is not attached.

AB  - Children's understanding of living and non-living concepts is usually interpreted by a child's degree of cognitive development. However, many studies with a different methodology include biological characteristics demonstrating that young children can distinguish between living and non-living. This research aims to examine the effect of the interdisciplinary and sensory-based education program prepared for preschool children on acquiring living and non-living concepts. A mixed method design was used, involving pre-test and post-test. Seventy-eight children, including 38 in the experimental group and 40 in the control group, participated. An education program was developed and applied to the experimental group for eight weeks. A designed questionnaire was used to collect data. According to the results, a significant difference (p < 0.05) existed between the pre-test and post-test of the experimental group scores of plant and non-living categories, but in the animal category, no significant difference (p > 0.05) was evident. In the scores of the human category, only five-year-old children's scores were found statistically significant (p < 0.05). The children with interdisciplinary sensory-based education explained the living and non-living things primarily through biological characteristics (growth, nutrition, and breathing). These differences were not observed in the control group expressions.

AB  - Contribution: A novel proactive and collaborative learning paradigm was proposed to engage learners with different backgrounds and enable effective retention and transfer of the multidisciplinary artificial intelligence (AI)-cybersecurity knowledge. Specifically, the proposed learning paradigm contains: 1) an immersive learning environment to motivate the students for exploring AI/ machine learning (ML) development in the context of real-world cybersecurity scenarios by constructing learning models with tangible objects and 2) a proactive education paradigm designed with the use of collaborative learning activities based on game-based learning and social constructivism. Background: Increasing evidence shows that AI techniques can be manipulated, evaded, and misled, which can result in new and profound security implications. There is an education and training gap to foster a qualified cyber-workforce that understands the usefulness, limitations, and best practices of AI technologies in the cybersecurity domain. Efforts have been made to incorporate a comprehensive curriculum to meet the demand. There still remain essential challenges for effectively educating students on the interaction of AI and cybersecurity. Intended Outcomes: A novel proactive and collaborative learning paradigm is proposed to educate and train a qualified cyber-workforce in this new era where security breaches, privacy violations, and AI have become commonplace. Application Design: The development of this learning paradigm is grounded in the pedagogical approaches of technology-mediated learning and social constructivism. Findings: Although the research work is still ongoing, the prototype learning paradigm has shown encouraging results in promoting the learners' engagement in applied AI learning.

AB  - Experiments are described that involve undergraduates learning concepts of nanoscience and chemistry. Students prepare nanopatterns of organosilane films using protocols of particle lithography. A few basic techniques are needed to prepare samples, such as centrifuging, mixing, heating, and drying. Students obtain hands-on skills with nanoscale imaging using an atomic force microscope (AFM) when they learn to characterize samples. Designed surfaces are made using a surface mask of latex or silica spheres to generate nanopatterns of organosilanes. An organic thin film is applied to the substrate using steps of either heated vapor deposition or immersion in solution. The steps for preparing samples are not complicated; however, the nanostructures that are produced by particle lithography are exquisitely regular in geometry and surface arrangement. At the molecular level, two types of sample morphology can be made depending on the step for depositing organosilanes. Ring-shaped nanostructures are produced with heated vapor deposition through a particle mask, and nanoholes are produced within a matrix film using immersion of masked substrates. Experience with advanced AFM instrumentation is obtained for data acquisition, digital image processing, and analysis. Skills with chemical analysis are gained with bench methods of sample preparation. Concepts such as the organization of molecules on surfaces and molecular self-assembly are demonstrated with the visualization of nanopatterns prepared by students. Experiments with particle lithography can be used as a laboratory module or for undergraduate research projects, and are suitable for students with a multidisciplinary science background.

AB  - All-solid-state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have been regarded as an advisible alternative for simultaneously overcoming the safety issues and high energy density demands presented in traditional lithium batteries, and they represent the development orientation of energy storage devices. This course describes the preparation of a cross-linked and helical polyurethane modified poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO@HPU) and its utilization as the SPE in lithium batteries, which can be used to teach upper-division undergraduates the principle of energy storage devices and the role of liquid-free electrolytes. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and [superscript 1]H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies are used to determine the structure of the polymers. The ionic conductivity, lithium ion transference number, and electrochemical window of PEO@HPU are measured through an electrochemical workstation. The lithium batteries assembled by students are evaluated via a battery testing system. The modification by the special helical polymer obviously improves the electrochemical and battery performance of the PEO-based SPE. Upon completion of the experiment, students will understand the structure-activity relationship in materials science and propose new suggestions for designing advanced SPEs. This experiment requires well-prepared laboratory chemicals as well as long-term processes, so it is suitable to be considered as a project. Meanwhile, it can be also used for senior projects and interdisciplinary projects between engineering and science.

AB  - Art studies, as an academic discipline, is an under-researched topic, especially with reference to science evaluation. Yet, it is a particularly interesting field to study given that it does not easily fit into the 'science' category. Our analysis centres on the core element of the evaluation system: scientific journals in the field of arts. We compare the rank of the journals with their disciplinary coverage and methodological orientation, to identify what kind of research approaches are most encouraged by the system of research funding. Our results show that journals in the field of arts have higher odds of being highly ranked if (1) their scope is diversified and combines art studies with explanatory sciences and (2) they publish empirically oriented research on the arts. Our findings suggest that the analysis of research evaluation systems should take into account not only interdisciplinary differences but also differences between particular types of research (within a given discipline).

AB  - Sustainability is an important cross-curriculum priority in Australian education that is not commonly realised in schools and classrooms. In this article, we discuss the challenges and opportunities to enacting sustainability, suggesting that both top-down (systemic schoolwide leadership and support) and bottom-up (individual educator's reflexivity) support for sustainability is needed. We postulate that an action-oriented and transformative geography education may support the realisation of sustainable world views for learners, and we present a simple learning progression for action-oriented education, adapted from the Australian Curriculum: Humanities and Social Sciences, for achieving this aim. In this way, geography teachers may be empowered to embed sustainability in their day-to-day teaching.

AB  - This research used mixed effects to construct a PBL-STEM (problem-based learning with STEM) questionnaire with high validity and reliability. The benefits of PBL-STEM focused on cross-disciplinary and longitudinal research to analyze students' self-efficacy in life science. All 175 university students who attended this course as an elective participated in this research. The purpose was to evaluate students' performance in the cake-baking practice experiential course and to use unpaired samples t-test, one-way ANOVA, and feedback analysis as quantitative and qualitative data. The following are noteworthy results: The t-test showed that five stimulated scales were significantly different and better after the cake-baking PBL-STEM activity. In one-way ANOVA, to engage with more students in STEM activities, improve conceptual learning, and close achievement gaps. The more enthusiastic students are, the more actively they study and think, and the more effectively they improve their PBL-STEM learning. Students' feedback analysis of this teaching activity is beneficial for improving technology, student-teacher engagement, process comprehension, and learning interest. The light of this research will foster a disposition of learning, enhance cake-baking skills, and encourage problem-solving based on their thinking.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine whether Socioscientific Issues (SSI) based learning environments affect university students' epistemological understanding of scientific inquiry differently from traditional science educational contexts. We identify and compare conceptions of scientific inquiry of students participating in an interdisciplinary, SSI-focused undergraduate human biology major (SSI) and those participating in a traditional biology major (BIO). Forty-five SSI students and 50 BIO students completed an open-ended questionnaire examining their understanding of scientific inquiry. Eight general themes including approximately 60 subthemes emerged from questionnaire responses, and the numbers of students including each subtheme in their responses were statistically compared between groups. A subset of students participated in interviews, which were used to validate and triangulate questionnaire data and probe students' understanding of scientific inquiry in relation to their majors. We found that both groups provided very similar responses, differing significantly in only five subthemes. Results indicated that both groups held generally adequate understandings of inquiry, but also a number of misconceptions. Small differences between groups supported by both questionnaires and interviews suggest that the SSI context contributed to nuanced understandings, such as a more interdisciplinary and problem-centered conception of scientific inquiry. Implications for teaching and research are discussed.

AB  - Recent solar eclipses provide relevant real-world contexts for learning about the scientific phenomena of the lunar phases. News coverage of the phenomenon may have raised questions such as, "Why does the Moon look different at different times, and sometimes as if it is not there?," and "What patterns can be found in the lunar phases?" Teachers can use these recent events to launch investigations into the mathematics of the phases. Connecting learning across the mathematics and science disciplines provides opportunities for students to deepen their conceptual understanding and apply what they have learned in new contexts (Vasquez et al., 2013). In this article, the authors present how they used the Moon Pie simulation in a sixth-grade science classroom to bridge the mathematics of angle measurement, fractions, covariation, and co-splitting (multiplicative/proportional covariation) with the scientific phenomenon of lunar phases.

AB  - Few studies, if any, have systematically investigated the connection or relationship between geography curriculum and scientific literacy. With this realization, in this article, we examined the potential contribution of geography curriculum to developing students' scientific literacy, with China's middle-school geography curriculum as an example. Through content analysis and semi-structured interviews, we found that geography curriculum holds significant potential to develop scientific literacy, especially regarding interpreting data in various formats, scientific reasoning, and interrelationships among science, technology, society, and environment. This study could provide insights for educators to design interdisciplinary programs to develop students' scientific literacy.

AB  - Research on science teaching and learning commonly makes use of reductionism to specify conditions of science learning. In my studies of academics'-of-science-teaching-&-learning (academics'"-of-st&l") research practices and values, I discuss how philosophic inquiry shifted my research practices from reductionism to critical (or, "new") materialism, where critical materialism is a research approach attuned to the materiality of social practices. Reading materiality as affectual, intellectual, and spatial components of practices turns my attention toward the logics informing academics'"-of-st&l" research practices as well as the comfortable and dangerous effects of particular practices on our connectible landscape. In this forum response, I briefly explore multiple logics informing academics'"-of-st&l" conference attendance choices, in addition to these choices' alignment to communal definition rendered by governmental and conference entities. I also explore other modes of communal boundary-marking experienced by academics"-of-st&l" that do not make use of formal definitions, but suggest that it is in the minutiae of conference relating that academics"-of-st&l" construct their sensing of communal un/boundedness. With these explorations, I hope to generate awareness of the small shifts that re-configuring practices can make possible in academics'"-of-st&l" connectivity.

AB  - The purpose of this project is to measure the effects of interprofessional education (IPE) on the perceptions of preservice professionals' development of an Individualized Education Plan (IEP). The preservice professionals (PSPs) participants included master's students from speech language pathology (SLP), occupational therapy (OT) and special education (SPED) programs (N = 78). The primary project goals were to examine the perceptions of the participants' roles and knowledge on a multidisciplinary education team, their perceptions of the collaborative process, and their familiarity with the IEP development process. A mixed-methods, retrospective, cross-sectional investigation was used to obtain quantitative and qualitative outcomes. A pre-workshop and post-workshop survey were used to collect the quantitative data. Qualitative data were collected via open-ended survey questions. Results demonstrated increased perceptions of knowledge as a result of the workshop across the three disciplines (OT: "t"(32) = -3.85, "p" < 0.001; SLP: "t"(29) = -5.70, "p" < 0.001; SPED: "t"(14) = -2.12, "p" = 0.02). Qualitative themes identified included increased confidence, collaboration, and preparedness to develop an IEP, and new understandings of roles and responsibilities among the participants.

AB  - Collaboration between two biologists and a physicist resulted in the example of tattooing being used as a motivator to support discussion across several scientific fields (cell biology, microbiology, human health, and physics). Although often viewed as self-destructive and rebellious in the Western world, tattooing has a deep and rich history full of meaning, for example as a rite of passage. Our main objective was to use a culturally relevant topic as a way to increase student engagement and learning while linking biological phenomena and physics. We describe this experience and provide a brief background on how the art and history of tattooing can aid in teaching young biologists.

AB  - Mobile devices are a ubiquitous accessory in daily life for millions of people. These devices can be used to effectively meet a user's information needs. Librarians can assist users with the skills to select, purchase, design, develop, deploy, and maintain mobile applications and related technologies (MAT). Project MISSILE (Mobile Information Skills and Solutions in Library Education), funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services, created an interdisciplinary curriculum plan for training library and information science (LIS) students to serve as mobile technology consultants (MTC) for libraries and not-for-profit organizations including schools and churches. This paper introduces the curriculum designed from an assessment by the experts on our advisory board. Our unique curriculum includes hands-on training gained through practica, guest speaker series, and field visits under the collaborative interdisciplinary mentorship of researchers and practitioners. The MISSILE curriculum builds twenty-first-century skills in information, communications and technology literacy, critical thinking, and problem solving.

AB  - Evaluation of student learning is of paramount importance to the educational community and allows reflection on program successes and weaknesses; however, best practices are hotly debated. This project designed and implemented an assessment system in which an identical, mixed-format assessment was given to all levels of students in the Georgia Gwinnett College biology program at the start of the semester for academic years 2014-15, 2015-16 and Fall of 2016. The assessment contained multiple choice and free-response questions, and evaluated lab reports from core courses in the biology program. This system allows for longitudinal assessment of students, provides quick results for timely action, and can allow analysis of interesting demographic questions. We found student achievement on program goals was lower than previously assessed and student performance on multiple choice questions was higher than free-response questions. There was a modest, but temporary, gain in performance on the ability to effectively communicate science. Additionally, males outperformed their female counterparts and Hispanics underperformed their non-Hispanic peers.

AB  - The enzymatic determination of glucose in soft drinks, based on the glucose concentration measurement by means of the coupled reactions of glucose oxidase and peroxidase, has been implemented at the University of Malaga and optimized according to the Biochemistry and Chemistry undergraduate students' results and feedback throughout the last few years. This traditional and robust laboratory practical has been reformed, in the light of inquiry-based and interdisciplinary learning approaches, in order to optimize the students' formative achievements that now are not restricted to the learning of enzymology, but also integrates cross-curricular knowledge from chemistry and mathematics. In this experiment, inexpensive and feasible to be carried out in a single laboratory session, students have to make the decision of what method is the most suitable for a given analytical problem, anticipating situations that they will probably face throughout their professional careers. It not only illustrates basic issues related to the use of enzymes as reagents for enzymatic analyses and its application to food chemistry, but it is also used to put into practice some principles of statistical analysis and analytical methods evaluation. This can be achieved because students get results from two different enzymatic analysis protocols (kinetic and end-point methods) using a single reaction mixture. The measurement of glucose concentration in four carbonated soft-drinks, regular or sugar-free colas and tonic waters makes students deal with the presence of color interferences that should be either avoided or eliminated. Undergraduate students, having performed this experiment, have found it formative, interesting, and challenging.

AB  - The STEM is an interdisciplinary approach provided learning atmosphere where students can use science, technology, engineering and math in daily life. The aim of the STEM is educating the students to be STEM Literate. This research goal was to implement STEM learning on electricity using Arduino-Android Game based experiment to 8th-grade students. STEM Learning was chosen as an approach in this research by the consideration that it was developed through Android Game, YWRobot, and Arduino Uno experiment lesson plan and worksheet. The analysis of this research was focused on the effect of STEM learning implementation through lesson plan and worksheet to 8th-grade students' STEM Literacy on electricity topic. The method used in this research was pre-experimental with one group pretest-posttest design. The data of this research was obtained from the STEM Literacy objective test (pretest and posttest) based on Allan Zollman. Then the data were analyzed based on each aspect of STEM Literacy such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The result shows that the value of g-bar from students' STEM Literacy pretest-posttest are -0.06, -0.12, -0.06, -0.87 for science, technology, engineering and mathematics literacy respectively. The result implies that STEM Learning implementation was less optimal to improve science, mathematics, technology and engineering literacy. The reason was because STEM Learning implementation was not implement in continuously. Therefore, science, technology, engineering, and technology literacy regarding electricity topic are emphasized less optimally.

AB  - This paper presents findings from a quasi-experimental study evaluating future teachers' attitudes and beliefs in response to a cross-curricular university course on evolution and creation bridging biological and Christian theological perspectives. Based on previous findings, we hypothesized that a course providing learning opportunities for epistemic insight within this multidisciplinary arena might have effects on attitudes and beliefs relevant to the field. Hence, the main research question was the following: To what extent do student teachers' attitudes and beliefs change by attending a cross-curricular course on evolution and creation intended to develop student teachers' epistemic insight into the nature of science and into the relationship between science and theology? The answer from this quasi-experimental evaluation study (pre-post-design; test group n = 26, control group n = 24) is as follows: It depends upon the variable investigated! Pre-post-analysis using a repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the cross-curricular course integrating epistemic insight induced changes in creationist beliefs, in students' perception of conflict, and in acceptance of evolution. In contrast, there was no effect on attitudes toward evolutionary theory, on attitudes toward the Biblical accounts of creation, or on scientistic beliefs. However, when student responses were analyzed individually, case-based evidence for belief change in students with scientistic positions emerged. Among the reasons for those different effects, we discuss conceptual differences between attitude and acceptance, features of the student teacher sample, and the particular content of the course explicitly addressing creationism but not scientism. In conclusion, the paper corroborates the role of epistemic insight in the multidisciplinary field of evolution and creation and provides initial evidence that epistemic insight possesses a particular potential concerning positions at both ends of the spectrum.

AB  - With the emergence of the "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS"; NGSS Lead States 2013), it is apparent that teaching and learning about nature of science (NOS) continues to be an important goal of science education for all K-12 students. With this emphasis on NOS, early childhood teachers are asking how to design instruction to teach NOS within the context of these new standards. During a recent research project, the authors had the opportunity to teach NOS to 70 first-grade students in an urban midwestern city. For this study, their instruction focused on the learning of three aspects of NOS from the "NGSS": Scientific knowledge is based on empirical evidence; science is a way of knowing; and scientific knowledge is open to revision in light of new evidence. However, it is important to note that other aspects of NOS, including "Science is a human endeavor," were also addressed. The lessons were integrated into the science curriculum and augmented with literature connections. Interwoven throughout these inquiry lessons were reading, writing, and drawing activities. These multidisciplinary lessons allowed them to address topics found in both the "Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts" (CCSS-ELA) (NGAC and CCSSO 2010) and the "NGSS" (NGSS Lead States 2013). In this article, they share examples of lessons and activities they used in the study.

AB  - In order to be well-educated citizens in the 21st century, children need to learn computing in school. However, implementing computing education in schools faces several practical problems, such as lack of computing teachers and time in an already overloaded curriculum. A solution can be a multidisciplinary approach, integrating computing education within other subjects in the curriculum. The present study proposes an instructional unit for computing education in social studies classes, with students learning basic computing concepts by programming history related games using Scratch. The instructional unit is developed following an instructional design approach and is applied and evaluated through a case study in four classes (5th and 7th grade) with a total of 105 students at a school in (omitted for submission). Results provide a first indication that the instructional unit enables the learning of basic computing concepts (specifically programming) in an efficient, effective and entertaining way increasing also the interest and motivation of students to learn computing.

AB  - Policymakers and industry leaders are calling for a 21st century education that is more interdisciplinary in nature, including the ability to solve problems and think creatively. Traditional teaching practices that present subjects as separate and distinct disciplines do not encourage students to make connections between subjects in school and in the inherently interdisciplinary nature of their daily lives. It is important for educators to help students link multiple subjects with the world outside the classroom, encouraging reform that implements a multidisciplinary approach and real world applications. Efforts to include true interdisciplinary experiences in today's schools face many obstacles: teachers as subject specialists, class time schedules, traditional school structures limiting teacher time for curriculum development or collaboration, and lack of understanding of interdisciplinary learning. Rather than true interdisciplinary experiences, students usually participate instead in thematic or multidisciplinary approaches. This article describes a study that examined the experiences of a teacher team: two elementary school teachers, a music teacher and a science teacher, as they developed and implemented innovative, interdisciplinary curriculum based around BioMusic. This emerging field of research combines physical and biological sciences of sound and animal communication with concepts from the discipline of music. Through BioMusic, this project involved designing curricula to provide opportunities for elementary school students to gain a deeper understanding of their world, expanding beyond the traditional classroom presentation of music and the physical properties of sound.

AB  - A two-semester-long interdisciplinary support effort to improve student posters in organic chemistry lab is described. In the first semester, students' literature search report is supported by a workshop conducted by an Instruction Librarian. During the subsequent semester, a second workshop is presented by the Instruction Librarian, an English professor, and the Assistant Director of the college's Learning Center. In that workshop, the students are shown PowerPoint applications to enable them to produce digital posters. They also learn the conventions of scientific poster layout and design, scientific writing style, use of graphics, and correct ACS documentation. The interdisciplinary support culminates in a poster competition at the end of the second semester. The digital posters created not only exemplify professional scientific design and content; they are also easily transported, presented, and stored and eliminate the expense of printed posters.

AB  - This case explores the complexity and dilemmas that faculty and academic administrators at Southwestern University (SU) encountered as they engaged in the development and establishment of a partnership with the local city's school districts. The partnership--carried at SU's College of Science but funded and based through a university-based agency--aimed to prepare math and science educators to better respond to the increasing pressure of improving student achievement in those subject areas. The complications and dilemmas that the math and science partnership encountered are traced and made visible as its establishment coincides with a period of institutional changes at SU. The changes involve the university's redefinition of its mission and goals including an institutional shift from a focus on teaching to one on research. The shift brought into stark relief a long-standing tension between two cherished but unequally valued academic practices: disciplinary (or basic) scholarship versus transdisciplinary (educational or applied) scholarship. Thus, set against the backdrop of institutional change and the resulting unstable institutional environment, the College of Science faculty who were part of the math and science partnership were confronted with an irreducible task: to work to reconcile the traditions and expectations of their department's disciplinary orientations that privileged disciplined based scholarship with the institutional commitment acquired through the partnership expecting a more transdisciplinary, applied educational scholarship. What follows describes how faculty and academic administrators navigated through this complex institutional tension and context, the dilemmas they confronted, and some of the outcomes that resulted.

AB  - In order to be well-educated citizens in the 21st century, children need to learn computing in school. However, implementing computing education in schools faces several practical problems, such as a lack of computing teachers and time in an already overloaded curriculum. A solution may be a multidisciplinary approach, integrating computing education within other subjects in the curriculum. The present study proposes an instructional unit for computing education in social studies classes, with students learning basic computing concepts, including computational thinking, by programming history related games using Scratch. The instructional unit is developed following an instructional design approach and is applied and evaluated through a pilot case study in four classes (5th and 7th grade) with a total of 105 students at a school in (omitted for submission). Results provide a first indication that the instructional unit enables the learning of basic computing concepts (specifically programming) in an efficient, effective and entertaining way increasing also the interest and motivation of students to learn computing.

AB  - Project-based learning (PjBL--to distinguish from problem-based learning--PBL) has become a recurrent practice in K-12 classroom environments. As PjBL has become prominent in K-12 classrooms, it has also surfaced in post-secondary institutions. The purpose of this paper is to examine the research that has studied a variety of science, technology, engineering and mathematic (STEM) subjects using PjBL in post-secondary classrooms. Fourteen articles (including qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods) were included. Two tables and two figures are included. In this paper, theoretical backgrounds and key terms were identified, followed by a literature review discussing four themes: content knowledge, interdisciplinary skills, collaboration and skill development for future education and careers. Results suggested that there is a positive connection between content knowledge learning and PjBL in collaborative settings. However, some negative perceptions arose regarding teamwork situations. Interdisciplinary skills were achieved, but quite limited in post-secondary classrooms. PjBL and STEM were perceived to be important for future education and careers. Future research needs to be completed and institutional curriculum changes informed by the results of this research need to occur to further explore interdisciplinary courses and the use of PjBL.

AB  - The Computer Science Teachers Association has asserted that computational thinking equips students with essential critical thinking which allows them to conceptualize, analyze, and solve more complex problems. These skills are applicable to all content area as students learn to use strategies, ideas, and technological practices more effectively as digital natives. This research examined over 200 elementary students' pre- and posttest changes in computational thinking from a 10-week coding program using adapted lessons from code.org's Blockly programming language and CSUnplugged that were delivered as part of the regular school day. Participants benefited from early access to computer science (CS) lessons with increases in computational thinking and applying coding concepts to the real world. Interviews from participants included examples of CS connections to everyday life and interdisciplinary studies at school. Thus, the study highlights the importance of leveraging CS access in diverse elementary classrooms to promote young students' computational thinking; motivation in CS topics; and the learning of essential soft-skills such as collaboration, persistence, abstraction, and creativity to succeed in today's digital world.

AB  - Although researchers have argued that textbooks should be customized to local cultures and experiences, they rarely are. Ciencia Puerto Rico, a non-profit group interested in promoting science literacy and education among Latino(a)s/Hispanics, identified a need to provide schools with culturally relevant materials. The result was the publication of the book "¡Ciencia Boricua! Ensayos y anécdotas del científico puertorro," an anthology of short, multidisciplinary science essays written by Puerto Rican scientists to develop awareness of Puerto Rican science and scientists. The purposes of this manuscript are (a) to provide evidence of instances of contextualization and cultural relevance in "¡Ciencia Boricua!," and (b) to determine the extent to which the use of "¡Ciencia Boricua!" and related activities changed the perception toward science of 57 elementary and middle school students enrolled in a public school in Puerto Rico, and which contextualized science activities students preferred. The results showed that the contextualized activities improved the perception about science in many children, particularly boys. Students preferred activities with more interactivity, like presenting their science posters during Closing Night, visiting a science laboratory, and receiving guest scientists at the school. Results showcase a successful strategy for developing culturally relevant and contextualized science education resources.

AB  - Annmarie Guzy opens this article by saying that, as a professor of composition and technical communication, she has found "dipping into other fields" an integral part of her job. In a traditional English department, what she does is considered service teaching, providing a service to other departments and colleges rather than teaching English majors. Although she occasionally sees an English major on her roster, she spends the majority of her time working with students from pre-professional programs such as engineering, computer science, biomedical sciences, health care management and informatics, graphic design, and secondary education. Her work with so many students, honors and non-honors alike, from a range of professional disciplines, provides a unique perspective on the interdisciplinarity of college studies. Guzy requires her students to make the transition from academic writing for a grade to workplace writing in which they need to convey field specific information effectively so that a real audience can make a decision or take a course of action. Similarly, her honors freshmen are building writing skills necessary to navigate writing and research projects in any discipline. When Guzy's students can successfully explain their discipline- specific work to classmates from different majors, when they have learned enough to have thoughtful discussions about topics from everyone's majors, then Guzy has achieved one of her major pedagogical objectives. Honors administrators and faculty consider students to be the leaders of the future in their disciplines of choice and strive to give them the tools to be responsible, ethical citizens. Guzy argues that fast-tracking students past their humanities courses deprives students of opportunities to develop their critical thinking and writing skills beyond those of an eighteen-year-old high school senior before they have to complete advanced projects in their majors. It also limits them to trade-school coursework in increasingly narrow disciplinary specializations without giving them valuable chances to discover the interdisciplinary connection--the human connection--among all majors.

AB  - First-year seminars and learning communities (LC) have been used to help increase retention, provide continuity, and support students as they transition to the university setting. Another high impact educational practice--common intellectual experiences (CIE)--includes student activities centered on a theme to help facilitate learning, increase involvement, and provide continuity; one such example is a common read. A group of interdisciplinary faculty created a health sciences specific learning community to help increase cultural awareness and understanding. "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks" was used as a CIE to meet course objectives in all LC classes and provide a background to health sciences and caring professions. Data were collected from students (n = 14) by using an instructor-developed instrument that evaluated student knowledge of stem cell research, medical advances due to stem cell research, ethics in medical research, the African-American experience (1930s-1960s), and socioeconomic disparities in America. Results indicated statistical significance for the three content areas emphasized throughout the course. Further, results suggest that in LCs in which the students have similar academic and career goals, use of a common intellectual experience can enhance critical thinking and deep learning.

AB  - Purpose: The paper aims to provide a conceptual map of how to mediate between sustainability theory and practice in higher education and how disciplinary divides can be bridged. It further looks at issues linked to knowledge views and drivers for institutional change that affect opportunities for whole institution development promoting action preparedness. Design/methodology/approach: Taking its point of departure in the University Educators for Sustainable Development report UE4SD (2014, 2015), the paper discusses ways that ideas and interaction can be mediated in higher education settings, to connect sustainability research with vocational programmes. Different options are considered and compared. Findings: Although the literature stresses both action orientation and the need for holistic transdisciplinary approaches, many institutional drivers limit opportunities for more integrating approaches. Research limitations/implications: However, while conclusions may hold for universities at an overarching level, it is likely that certain research and teaching environments have been able to transcend such barriers. Practical implications: Conceptually mapping the different forms that dialogue, interaction and flows of ideas take within higher education institutions has relevance for whole institution development for sustainability. Social implications: Importantly, producing sustainability science with relevance to practice in various professions is a fundamental condition to support accelerated transitions to sustainability at societal levels. Originality/value: The paper makes a significant contribution by focusing on concrete institutional pathways for knowledge exchange and negotiation that can support education for sustainability in higher education.

AB  - Nowadays, knowledge dissemination among children is no longer limited to the classroom and course or information books. It also includes websites explicitly addressed to youngsters who have a different stage of cognitive development and background knowledge compared to adults. However, they are also the first to live in today's multimodal hypertext environment and have a multimodal and multimedial communicative competence. In web-based educational hypermedia, education and entertainment often converge, relying on different semiotic resources. In point of fact, the term 'edutainment' is frequently used to describe such a combination. Edutainment websites are also one of the main accesses to science for children. In particular, explanations of scientific phenomena are frequently intertwined with different kinds of visual material, partly evoking science books. The aim of this paper is to shed light on the verbal-visual interplay in three scientific websites designed for children in English, whose express aim is to popularize scientific knowledge.

AB  - Reflection on the theme of the paper makes one to remember Sir Snow's 1959 lecture on The Two Cultures in which Snow had advanced the thesis that the sciences and the humanities had become split into two cultures and had argued that this division had become a major handicap to solving the world's problems. Mathematics education itself has always been negatively be influenced by this rift. For example, in educational context it is frequently claimed that "mathematics is a language since it provides both a conveyance for and a substantiation of our thoughts. It is that aspect of mathematics that explains the key role it plays in modern science" (EFFROS 1998, p.132). But mathematics is no mere language, as everyone will find out if he tries to order a new door to his apartment with words alone and without measurements. The paper will argue historically and in semiotic terms proposing a methodology based on the conception of a complementarity of meaning and reference of knowledge representations.

AB  - Progress has been slow in improving health disparities between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) Australians and other Australians. While reasons for this are complex, delivering healthcare respectful of cultural differences is one approach to improving Indigenous health outcomes. This paper presents and evaluates an intercultural academic leadership programme developed to support tertiary educators teaching Indigenous health and culture prepare interdisciplinary students to work respectfully and appropriately as health professionals with Indigenous peoples. The programme acknowledges the impact of colonisation on Indigenous Australians and draws on theories of the intercultural space to inform reflection and discussion on Indigenous/non-Indigenous relations and their impact on healthcare. Furthermore, the programme encourages establishing a community of practice as a resource for educators. Evaluation indicated participants' confidence to teach Indigenous content increased following the programme. Participants felt more able to create intercultural, interdisciplinary and interactive learning spaces that were inclusive and safe for students from all cultures. Participants learned skills to effectively facilitate and encourage students to grapple with the complexity of the intercultural space, often tense, uncertain and risky, to enable new understandings and positions to emerge that could better prepare graduates to work in Indigenous health contexts.

AB  - Catholic colleges and universities traditionally are grounded in liberal arts education, yet many Catholic institutions also educate future scientists and engineers. We propose that a distinctively Catholic science and engineering education should include an emphasis on Catholic concepts of the common good and social justice, liberal arts education that enriches and informs science and engineering practice and vice versa, and commitment to service. Moreover, we propose that Catholic colleges consider implementing curricular changes designed to bring the humanistic and technical disciplines into closer alignment. New curricula could include a capstone undergraduate course that draws on interdisciplinary faculty with the goal of giving science and engineering students the tools needed to be ethical practitioners in a frequently unethical world. Such a course would also provide humanists with a better understanding of the technological world in which we all live, enabling graduates to make well-informed decisions throughout their lives.

AB  - Biosphere contamination is a current environmental and social issue that must be included in the school programme. It is essential that students recognise their responsibility, and be knowledgeable about the generation and reduction of environmental pollution. Dyes are usually used in school activities and discharged into household effluents, constituting potential toxic agents. To offer solutions to this problem, it was proposed to evaluate the ability of "Lemna" sp. plants to remove synthetic dyes. For this, activities that require accessible resources and minimum safety precautions were designed, which could be carried out by students at home in the virtual education modality imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The practical experience integrated theoretical-practical contents from different disciplines, achieving a true interdisciplinary dialogue. The use of "Lemna" sp. secured a fast and significant dye decolourisation, demonstrating the importance of biodiversity in the attenuation of environmental changes due to anthropogenic activities. This experience allowed us to arrive at an interdisciplinary, significant and situated learning experience through the implementation of the scientific method.

AB  - Literature highlights how education in the twenty-first century begins to advocate multiple new concepts, such as new technology, new pedagogies, interdisciplinary curricula, open learning, etc. Among these concepts, the recognition and awareness about one's character strengths are demonstrated to improve emotional management and individual/group's quality of life. We studied three fifth-grade Italian classes using an emerging educational model called IARA to verify if it can truly improve emotional literacy, characters strengths awareness, and cohesion in ten-years children. To demonstrate its efficacy, we used Bloom's Taxonomy and Sociogrammatic study. We proved that the IARA could be an efficient model to improve one's character strengths and class milieu awareness.

AB  - In response to a request from a campus student organization, faculty  from three fields came together to develop and teach an integrated  interdisciplinary course on water issues and social activism. This course, "Water as Life, Death, and Power", brought together topics from the fields of anthropology, biology and chemistry to explore water rights, access to clean water, and water treatment methods. Students enrolled in the course developed interdisciplinary projects related to a variety of local and global water issues to present real-world solutions at a university-wide student research showcase. This article describes the process by which the faculty learning community designed the course as a truly integrated whole, and reflects on the challenges and rewards  of teaching a course in this way.

AB  - Scientific literacy should be promoted through the teaching of science from Grade R and for this to happen, teachers need to understand what science should be taught and how it should be taught. This interpretive, qualitative study explores the degree to which four foundation phase teachers interpret the life skills programme with regard to the teaching of natural science by using an adapted version of a theory of implementation. Analyses of a questionnaire, documents (Revised National Curriculum Statement and lesson plans) and interviews enabled us to build a picture of how each teacher interpreted the curriculum with regard to a number of constructs. The findings show that foundation phase teachers have great difficulty interpreting the curriculum because the foundation phase curriculum does not give clear guidance with regard to the teaching of science. Their poor content knowledge, the poor understanding of what integration of science in numeracy and literacy entails, as well as their poor understanding of the instructional methods used to teach science exacerbate the problem.

AB  - Music cannot be separated from its historical, geographical, and cultural context; therefore, it is important that students be taught music from a variety of genres, cultures, and historical periods relevant to the music to which they are introduced. In this article, I introduce an interdisciplinary approach through contextualization of the content of music, using it to lead to the study of related works in various disciplines. Using a song inspired by Indonesia's Solo River, a lesson sample demonstrates teaching strategies that motivate students to engage in integrative thinking. By exploring music's connection with relevant subjects to teach about the natural environment, this contextualized lesson presents a global learning experience to broaden students' knowledge of the world. Contextualizing the content of Bengawan Solo illustrates how history and culture shaped the song and demonstrates how this work can be used as a springboard for students' exploration of its history, geography, and ecology.

AB  - The current literature relates to how teachers develop knowledge and practice of science inquiry, but little has been reported on how teachers develop interdisciplinary science inquiry (ISI) knowledge and practice. This study examines the effect of university research experiences, ongoing professional development, and in-school support on teachers' development of ISI pedagogical knowledge and practices. It centers on documenting diverse teachers' journeys of experiencing ISI as well as developing knowledge of ISI. It was found that there was variation in ISI understanding and practice among the teachers as a result of the combination of teachers' experiences, beliefs, and participation. Thus, in order to help teachers develop ISI knowledge and pedagogy, barriers to ISI knowledge development and implementation must also be addressed. Professional developers must articulate clear program goals to all stakeholders including an explicit definition of ISI and the ability to recognize ISI attributes during research experiences as well as during classroom implementation. Teachers must also be held accountable for participation and reflection in all aspects of professional development. Program developers must also take into consideration teachers' needs, attitudes, and beliefs toward their students when expecting changes in teachers' cognition and behavior to teach inquiry-rich challenging science.

AB  - The relevance of the research is due to additional opportunities to improve the quality of teaching mathematics in a digital school, support professional orientation and self-determination of young people through the inclusion of mobile services and platforms in mathematical activities. The research problem is determined by the following contradictions: 1) between the capabilities of modern digital technologies in terms of improving the quality of mathematical training, the formation of universal skills required by the economy of the future, and the model implemented by educational institutions; 2) between the need to provide resources for solving problems of a socio-economic nature in the conditions of the fourth industrial revolution and the insufficient level of mathematical literacy of graduates. The purpose of this research is to study the didactic potential of mobile technologies to support mathematical education in a digital school while preparing specialists of the future. Moreover, the research offers a methodological approach to organize project activities of developing applications in terms of increasing the effectiveness of teaching mathematics and vocational guidance. The article clarifies the concepts "mathematical thinking", "mathematical literacy" for a digital school and describes the didactic principles of incorporating mobile resources into the educational space which increase the efficiency of training engineers of the future, support vocational guidance and self-determination. The author offers methodological methods and recommendations for organizing creative interdisciplinary project activities in order to develop mobile applications that contribute to the formation of qualities and skills forming the basis of mathematical thinking. The materials of the article can be used: firstly, to ensure the personalization of mathematical training in the course of creative, interdisciplinary, cognitive research activities of students while developing mobile applications, social integration and vocational guidance; secondly, to change the concept of mathematical education at school; thirdly, to improve the implemented model of education based on the traditional trajectory "preschool education-school-university-additional education" in the context of the new requirements of business, society, and the state for the training of highly qualified professionals in the professions of the future.

AB  - Creative thinking and scientific knowledge are essential components of twenty-first-century learning. The aim is to assess the effectiveness of an inquiry-based interdisciplinary course of study, complemented by training that stimulates the development of creative and research skills. The main sample, which provided the most complete data set, consisted of 175 students. Participants filled out a questionnaire created by the authors and presented in Appendix A to get the participants' assessment of the characteristics of the training course. The analysis was carried out using the Atlas.ti software. The study of Pearson's correlation between the variables of the questionnaire, as well as the variables of the questionnaire and the estimates of the 'creative and search process' according to the results of the described analysis was carried out. A significant correlation was revealed between such factors as 'satisfaction with the training course' and 'usefulness of the training course' (r = 0.85), 'usefulness of the training course' and 'research process' (r = 0.72), 'satisfaction with the training course' and 'creative process' (r = 0.62). The research results can be implemented in colleges and universities to create specialised training courses or training elements in order to increase creativity and improve the scientific thinking of students with usage of electronic educational environment.

AB  - This paper presents findings from a two-year qualitative study examining integration of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) into elementary mathematics instruction. Integrated units were developed by elementary teachers and CS/CT coaches with support from university faculty with expertise in CS/CT and elementary mathematics. CS/CT instruction primarily relied on the Scratch environment, although some lessons made use of Code.org materials. This research primarily relied on two theories of integration (i.e. Kiray, 2012. A new model for the integration of science and mathematics: The balance model. "Energy Education Science and Technology Part B: Social and Educational Studies," 4(3), 1181-1196) that provided insight into the level of interconnection between the disciplines and the relative amount of instructional time spent within each discipline. Findings revealed that cross-grade CS/CT concepts included sequencing, looping, and conditional logic. Within each category: (a) concepts were taught with increasing complexity across the grades, (b) the mathematics was dominant and CS/CT was important but secondary, and (c) three types of lessons emerged: No integration, partial integration, and full integration. Lastly, lessons generally included a transition from less integrated to more integrated activities with an initial focus on discipline-specific conceptual understanding prior to integrated activities.

AB  - The multi-disciplinary nature of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers often renders difficulty for high school students navigating from classroom knowledge to post-secondary pursuits. Discrepancies between the knowledge-based high school learning approach and the experiential approach of future studies leaves some students disillusioned by STEM. We present Discovery, a term-long inquiry-focused learning model delivered by STEM graduate students in collaboration with high school teachers, in the context of biomedical engineering. Entire classes of high school STEM students representing diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds engaged in iterative, problem-based learning designed to emphasize critical thinking concomitantly within the secondary school and university environments. Assessment of grades and survey data suggested positive impact of this learning model on students' STEM interests and engagement, notably in under-performing cohorts, as well as repeating cohorts that engage in the program on more than one occasion. Discovery presents a scalable platform that stimulates persistence in STEM learning, providing valuable learning opportunities and capturing cohorts of students that might otherwise be under-engaged in STEM.

AB  - Interdisciplinary field study courses at 2-year colleges can provide an opportunity to enhance student learning. The authors present here an 11-day interdisciplinary field-study course designed for nonscience majors at a 2-year college. Using a theoretical learning framework that emphasizes cognitive and metacognitive gains, the field study curriculum is designed to incorporate both geology and biology topics illustrating the cross-discipline nature of science education. The course allows students to travel to classic geologic locales that provide a means of science immersion in a more active learning and inquiry based atmosphere. Students are encouraged to ask questions about nature, formulate hypotheses for answering those questions, and evaluate conclusions. Additionally the course provides an opportunity for students to refine observation and inquiry skills beyond a set of laboratory exercises and classroom lectures. An end-of-course survey was used to capture students' perceived value of the course.

AB  - This study used the framework of technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) to examine how elementary education preservice teachers integrated technology in science units that they designed after completing courses on science education and technology integration. The findings indicate that technologies included at the end of lessons were associated with higher order thinking, while those included at the beginning or middle of lessons were focused more on lower order thinking and presenting content. Further, frequently used technology-rich activities such as viewing videos and PowerPoint presentations were associated with lower order thinking, while activities such as completing an interactive whiteboard activity or having students make presentations or videos included more opportunities to develop higher order thinking. Implications from this research suggest that science educators and teacher educators should focus more on technologies that support higher-order thinking and support course work with special attention to technology in the context of designing engaging science instruction.

AB  - Following a modeling-first approach to differential equations, inquiry-based learning activities on modeling and controlling the growth of locally relevant species, such as lionfish or sea turtles, are developed by the authors. Emerging exemplary practices are presented, building towards a balanced teaching of differential equations involving multiple mathematical perspectives, representations, and intra-disciplinary and interdisciplinary mathematical connections. This innovative approach is an effort towards realizing the MAA's "Common Vision" for Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences programs in 2025. Discrete and continuous approaches are used simultaneously, while numerical and graphical methods are used to build connections between logistic differential and difference equation models. The resulting chaotic behavior of the solutions is also emphasized. We suggest that this enhancement of the "Doing the Math" phase of modeling outlined in SIAM's 2016 "Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Mathematical Modeling" offers a wider access to deeper mathematics, and helps to foster complementary disciplinary perspectives in mathematics.

AB  - This study investigated students' perceptions of their graduate learning outcomes including content knowledge, communication, writing, teamwork, quantitative skills, and ethical thinking in two Australian universities. One university has a traditional discipline-orientated curriculum and the other, an interdisciplinary curriculum in the entry semester of first year. The Science Students Skills Inventory asked students (n = 613) in first and final years to rate their perceptions of the importance of developing graduate learning outcomes within the programme; how much they improved their graduate learning outcomes throughout their undergraduate science programme; how much they saw learning outcomes included in the programme; and how confident they were about their learning outcomes. A framework of progressive curriculum development was adopted to interpret results. Students in the discipline-oriented degree programme reported higher perceptions of scientific content knowledge and ethical thinking while students from the interdisciplinary curriculum indicated higher perceptions of oral communication and teamwork. Implications for curriculum development include ensuring progressive development from first to third years, a need for enhanced focus on scientific ethics, and career opportunities from first year onwards.

AB  - STEM, or the integration of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, has rapidly become a dominant discourse in political, economic and educational spheres. In the U.S., the STEM movement has been boosted by global economic-based competition and associated fears, in terms of STEM graduates, when compared with other nations. However, many critiques question the nature and goals of this competition, as well as, the possibilities to improve STEM talents through the current dominant conceptualizations and practices of STEM education. In addition, the apparent lack of significant and coherent embracement of (and sometimes silence about) socioscientific and socio-political issues and perspectives renders STEM education incapable of preparing learners for active citizenships. Building on these critiques, I argue that these problems are possible consequences of STEM as a construct of power. My arguments are based on Lyotard's conceptions of knowledge in postmodern society (as reported in The postmodern condition: A report on knowledge, University Press, Manchester, 1984), which I use to analyze some aspects of the STEM educational movement. Throughout the paper, I explore the construction of STEM education within competitive frames that place prime value on high performativity. There seem to be two characteristics of current STEM education that support performativity; these are an increased focus on technological and engineering designs, and a tendency for interdisciplinary education. At the same time, the eagerness for performativity and competition seems to drag STEM education into selectiveness, thereby jeopardizing its possible benefits. Recommendations are also discussed.

AB  - Computer science (CS) and computational thinking (a problem-solving process used by computer scientists) teach students design, logical reasoning, and problem solving--skills that are valuable in life and in any career. Computational thinking (CT) concepts such as decomposition teach students how to break down and tackle a large complex problem. Engaging in CT practices like debugging (finding and fixing errors), persevering, and collaborating helps to prepare students to be the innovators and developers of new technologies. Elementary educators see the need and benefit of CS education but struggle to fit something new into the already packed elementary school day. While some schools have started robotics and computer science after-school clubs, these do not address the need to educate ALL students in CS. To provide equitable access to CS education, instruction needs to occur during the regular school day and in the classroom. The authors sought to address this problem by developing and implementing interdisciplinary STEM + Computer Science Problem-Based Learning (STEM+CS PBL) units in grades 3-5. CS concepts are integrated with content already being taught, thus eliminating the need for an additional block of instructional time. Each unit centers on a real-world problem, integrates multiple content areas, and includes a culminating performance task/product in which students demonstrate and apply their understanding of the concepts learned. The problem provides context and gives students a purpose for learning content area benchmarks. This article examines one of their five-week-long STEM+ CS PBL units, "Non-Native Invasion," which engaged fourth-grade students with tackling the real-world problem of the invasive Burmese python in the Everglades and required students to design a computer simulation to model and predict how its introduction to the ecosystem affects native populations.

AB  - In response to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI) was formed to answer oil spill-related scientific questions. However, peer-reviewed scientific discoveries were not reaching people whose livelihoods depended on a healthy Gulf of Mexico. GoMRI and the four Gulf of Mexico Sea Grant programs partnered to develop a regional Extension program with a team of multidisciplinary specialists and a regional manager embedded within the Sea Grant programs. The team answered oil spill science questions from target audiences. The program leaders also identified the value of adding a regional Extension communicator to enhance their Extension products.

AB  - Citation is an essential part of academic writing and allows writers to make strong arguments, review previous research, and express their opinions. This study investigates reporting verbs as a part of citation practice in the research articles published in Iranian and international journals (with different linguacultural backgrounds) in humanities and medical sciences from 2015-2019. In this cross-disciplinary study, 60 research articles (RAs) from Applied Linguistic (AL) and Nursing and Midwifery (NM) as part of humanities and medical sciences respectively were selected and classified based on Hyland's (2002) frameworks. The results demonstrated that the Iranian journal articles utilised more reporting verbs (RVs) than the international journal articles whereas, the international articles used RVs with a wide variety. Although the types of verbs were different, the research verbs had a clear preference in the corpus. The finding suggests some pedagogical implications for novice scholars and EFL (English as a Foreign Language) students to become familiar with differences in using RVs and select the correct choice of reporting verbs in the field of humanities and medical sciences.

AB  - Environmental education (EE) is vital in addressing global environmental problems. Educational institutions are integrating EE into their curricula, but studies indicated the need for its intensification. This mixed method study assessed the integration of EE in Teacher Education Programs (TEPs) in Region III, Philippines. Respondents were 10 program deans, 10 chairs, 171 teachers, and 344 students. Data were gathered using validated questionnaires. Findings revealed that the New Teacher Education Curriculum (NTEC) integrated EE in program outcomes and performance indicators; in mandated courses -Physical Education (PE) and National Service Training Program (NSTP); and in Science Technology and Society (STS), a General Education (GE) course. Likewise, teachers integrated EE in their lessons and in community extension programs. Seminars/webinars included environmental care and promoted environmental awareness in social media. As to support for EE integration, administrative, physical facilities and financial support were provided. On student outcomes, positive findings were shown on attitude towards environment care, but application of knowledge and skills needs improvement. Students' knowledge was significantly correlated to attitude (Pearson's r value is 0.593 and p value <0.05) as well as skills acquisition and attitude (Pearson's r value is 0.647 and p value <0.05). Teachers' challenges in the EE integration included inadequate environmental knowledge and lack of time to lead students in environmental action. The study concludes that EE is integrated into the TEPs but the outcomes on the learners' knowledge and skills acquisition still need strengthening. Also, EE should be integrated in professional education courses, not only in GE and mandated courses.

AB  - This paper presents a case study of didactic infrastructures to direct Study and Research Paths (SRP) in teacher education within the context of interdisciplinary inquiry. The disciplines of school mathematics and school biology, and their didactics, are made to interconnect through the investigation of a generating question concerning the illness diabetes. The resulting interdisciplinary knowledge as evidenced through students written diaries is analysed using the Anthropologic Theory of the Didactic and shows the challenge of combining two disciplines and their didactics at the same time. Two particular forms of didactic infrastructure to guide the self-sustained process of SRP are proposed and scrutinized: "Selective picking" and "Side questions." Selective picking is shown to be a promising, yet indirect, infrastructure to steer the SRP without taking away the desired autonomy of the students. Side questions, initially proposed by Ives Chevallard, are considered in light of the case, and a number of suggestions for their characteristics and use are put forward.

AB  - This study documented the means by which STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) educators experienced the mathematics and science associated with understanding lunar phenomena. The article reports how well STEM education graduate students interacted with projectbased materials as they engaged in interdisciplinary teaching and learning. Research questions pursued were: (a) How will students' spatial mathematics and scientific understandings develop as they engage in a contextualized, technology-rich, project-based environment? and (b) How will the students' group projects affect their understanding of lunar related concepts? A mixedmethods approach was used with this semester-long design study to expose how focused project work facilitated spatial understanding. Significant gains were made on lunar-related concepts that had been previously resistant to conceptual change (lunar motion and effect of lunar phase with location change). An implication of this study suggests that technologies (i.e., Stellarium, online blogging with Australia, and Geometer's Sketchpad) facilitated students' project progress, aided students' understanding of how perspective matters in terms of Earthly sky viewing, and deepened students' understanding on domains that included spatial reasoning.

AB  - Teachers' knowledge of literacy has gained considerable interest over the last three decades, largely with a focus on the basic language constructs of phonological awareness and phonics. Fewer studies, however, have focused on spelling. Given the close relationship between reading and spelling and the necessity of an explicit understanding of the phonological, orthographic, and morphological patterns of English spelling in the science of teaching reading, the current study examines educators' knowledge of English spelling. Specifically, this pilot investigation focuses on those who are teaching the teachers--teacher educators from multiple institutions throughout the United States, who completed a survey assessing their knowledge and understanding of the phonological, orthographic, and morphological aspects of English spelling. Moreover, the survey assessed the 85 teacher educators' self-efficacy in teaching spelling and their philosophical stance on spelling instruction. Findings indicate that the teacher educators feel they were not prepared to teach spelling, although they believed that some of the pivotal characteristics of spelling (i.e., morphological awareness and alphabetic principle) are important in teaching spelling. Additionally, while teacher educators were able to determine some of the correct spelling patterns, many spelling patterns posed problems for them. Lastly, teacher educators overall lacked knowledge concerning spelling for diverse learners. Research and practice implications for teacher education and preparation are discussed.

AB  - This article moves on from the 'turn to affect' in applied theatre to explore further how concepts related to affect theory might offer ways in which practice might respond to the contemporary context of a 'post-normal' and 'post-truth' world. Acknowledging the influence of transdisciplinary discourses on gender, race, disability, space, place, performance philosophy and neuro-psycho-biology, it explores how applied theatre-making might be conceptualised as a 'space of potentiality'. The terms 'space' and 'potentiality' are surveyed as relational, contingent, and indeterminate, allowing for an understanding of practice that embraces fluidity, and difference, and resists pre-defined assumptions. Specifically, it draws on my practice of collaborative theatre-making with people in recovery from addiction to re-frame the issue of change within a more fluid appreciation of "affect" as a process of bodily inter-relation. It, therefore, discusses theatre-making as an affective ecology that generates an 'aliveness' that might support growth beyond the entropic life-cycle of addiction.

AB  - In many schools following the National Curriculum for England the teaching of science has been overshadowed by the demands of literacy and numeracy, with the focus on statutory testing (SATs) and emphasis on national targets. This has often led to increasing concerns around teachers' subject knowledge, the sapping of teacher confidence and reduction of interesting, engaging science lessons. However, in Wales the forthcoming return of science as a tested subject is seen in year 6 (ages 10-11) and new routes into this subject need to be developed. How is this relevant to UK schools more widely? The author provides examples of how poetry can be used to develop scientific enquiry and method, while inspiring scientific learning using rich tasks that open doors to fantastic worlds of wonder.

AB  - The General Education Foundation (GEF) Programme, consisting of two seminar courses, namely "In Dialogue with Humanity" and "In Dialogue with Nature," has been a common core requirement of The Chinese University of Hong Kong since 2012. Aided by selected classics, students from all faculties engage in dialogues with their teachers and each other to reflect on what it means to have a good life, what an ideal society is, and the nature of intellectual pursuit in the sciences. Reading classics and discussing serious questions in class, however, can be challenging for some students. To help students meet these challenges, Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) were introduced in the pilot stage of GEF in 2010 and, with subsequent refinements, continue to this day. The seminar-style and interdisciplinary nature of GEF makes it an atypical case for PASS. This paper will examine and evaluate how PASS can improve student learning in seminar-style courses like GEF with a mixed-method study from a student perspective. According to evidence from online surveys and focus group interviews, PASS successfully (1) improves students' understanding of the course content at a cognitive level; (2) assists and motivates them to prepare better for seminar discussions, effecting a behavioural change; and (3) facilitates affective learning outcomes in terms of confidence and motivation. Major challenges--including students' misperceptions about PASS, differences in leaders' approaches and organisational difficulties--are identified. Proposed solutions to these challenges will also be discussed.

AB  - Current reform efforts in science education around the world call on teachers to use integrated approaches to teach science. As a part of such reform efforts in the United States, engineering practices and engineering design have been identified in K-12 science education standards. However, there is relatively little is known about effective ways of teaching science through engineering design. The study explores the approaches or strategies used by a sixth grade science teacher to teach science and engineering in an integrative manner. Classroom observations, teacher interview, and student surveys were used to study the features of engineering integration implemented by the teacher and the changes in student interest in science and engineering by participating in an engineering design-based science unit. Findings suggest that the teacher explicitly included practices and core ideas from engineering and science; used an engaging, motivating engineering challenge; and provided students with opportunities to be autonomous. Students engaged in the activities in the engineering unit and their interest level slightly increased. The results suggest that the three strategies that the teacher used to teach engineering and science are important foundations of integrated science and engineering education.

AB  - In recent years, several theoretical discussions as to the relationship between neuroscience and education have been held. Researchers have started to have cooperation over neuroscience and the interdisciplinary researches in which education is included. It was found that there were interactions between cognitive neuroscience and educational researches. It is thought that when the research results regarding the ones carried out on an educational dimension along with neuroscience and the application of their findings into classroom environments are included, then these research results will be given more importance. It is also considered that interdisciplinary researches such as cognitive and educational neuroscience will contribute to the understanding of how one can learn better.

AB  - The need to develop clean-energy storage systems, harvesting technologies, and new functional materials are but a few of the many contemporary challenges in the domain of science today. To address these challenges, problem solving has become a key skill of the 21st century. It is generally documented, however, that experts and students differ in terms of their problem-solving skills. Experts in a domain are fluent in the use of different resources to solve domain-specific problems, whereas students stumble when using formulas, devices, or measurement methods. In most cases, the students are not aware if and why the resources are appropriate to solve the given problem. To acquire expertise in a domain, it is necessary to become fluent in the domain-specific resources. This means being aware of various resources and how they can be used reflectively in problem solving. In this study, we investigated how students' awareness of various domain-specific resources developed within minimally guided, authentic research projects in an undergraduate materials chemistry course that focuses on crystal structures and its characterisation. By monitoring participants' problem solving through audio-diaries and in-depth qualitative interview data, we examined to what extent their awareness of domain-specific resources developed. We further characterised productive moments of failure and uncertainty during students' problem-solving processes that influenced their awareness. Thick descriptions of these moments facilitate understanding of how students' awareness develops in a minimally guided, authentic learning environment and how students can become fluent in a given domain.

AB  - We describe a successful collaboration between mathematics and psychological science faculty members to create a learning community for our students that linked sections of introductory mathematical reasoning and psychological science courses. The students in our learning community were in their second or third semester. The learning community is designed so that, throughout the semester, students regularly move across the border between the two linked disciplines by completing common assignments, including a group project. We modified our existing course topics and frameworks to be intentional about building connections between the courses.

AB  - This article aims to discuss the health of the public administration discipline in the US higher education system. In particular, it debates two possible alternatives: decline or reposition. The paper analyzes the academic offers of political science, public policy, and public administration programs at both undergraduate and graduate levels. The Results highlight that the public administration discipline is currently at a crucial point. The core attention within both governments and higher education is more focused on politics and policies than on management. Accordingly, this scenario has two main effects. First, it creates an imbalance between the political discourse, the formulation/execution of public policies, and the managing of effective public sector organizations. Second, it might lead the discipline of public administration into a decline. Nevertheless, public administration can find a reposition within social sciences by developing more openness and a process of cross-contamination with other humanistic disciplines.

AB  - In Australia, the Federal Government and the Australian Academy of Science have developed a programme entitled "Primary Connections" (primaryconnections.org. au), aimed at supporting the teaching of science in the primary sector. The programme makes strong and explicit links between science and literacy through the use of word walls, science journals, discussion groups and procedural texts, among a range of other techniques. There are many ways to link or integrate science and literacy and this article reports on an approach used with pre-service primary teachers at an Australian University, specifically the use of science-based texts to introduce science topics to primary pupils.

AB  - Created by Tufts University through a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded project, the Novel Engineering website explains that "Novel Engineering is an integrated approach to teaching engineering and literacy" (2018) that asks teachers to support students' engagement in a project-based endeavor of problem-and-solution processes and products. The overarching structure of activities in novel engineering require students to read a novel (children's picture books or young adult chapter books both work) and engineer a creative solution to a problem described in the novel. This article shares how teachers were prepped to implement this program.

AB  - In this paper, the author (Todorova, Petia) addresses the problems students of humanities and social sciences face in the choice of methodology which they should employ in the theoretic discussion of a given task. This is due to the fact that in the course of their education the necessity of methodological competency is largely neglected and is rarely included as part of their curriculum. Todorova introduces the transdisciplinary approach that allows for the understanding of the complexities of the modern world which is a primary feature of its scientific legitimacy, and adds that the use of transdisciplinary approach is a way to broaden one's academic view on life. This may be achieved by expanding scientific knowledge, by creating a common model of tackling complex subjects, and by improving the methods used in dealing with such complex subjects.

AB  - Four case studies of preservice teachers enrolled in a STEM-focused elementary teacher preparation program are used to document changes in mathematics and science teaching efficacy over the course of one academic year. Qualitative analysis revealed that all four case studies experienced changes in their mathematics and science teaching efficacy beliefs over the course of the year. Participants described unique ways of understanding their growth (or lack thereof) in teaching efficacy, the trajectory of teaching efficacy over the course of the year, and the role of teacher training in changing their efficacy beliefs.

AB  - The Research Skill Development (RSD) framework was devised in 2006 to articulate what educators do when they facilitate student learning through active exploration in ways that enable their skills to grow in sophistication and rigour. This special issue of JUTLP comprises eight articles that focus on the critique, adaptation and application of the RSD. This article introduces the special issue and presents the 2018 version of the RSD, in response to 12 years of feedback on the framework. Changes in the RSD include improvements in articulation of the facets of research, better delineation of autonomy, and the addition of the affective domain and guiding questions. Of the other seven articles, five are set in the undergraduate years and two in master's, with contexts including biology, education, engineering, humanities and interdisciplinary studies. The articles are based across diverse settings, including laboratory, online, language and workplace learning. Of these seven, one critiques the RSD, three focus on curriculum design and three connect the RSD to enduring issues of current concern by adapting the framework for academic literacy, work skills and problem solving. These three adaptations are examples of numerous emerging models that modify RSD terminology and shape, within its broad parameters, and are introduced in this issue as the Models of Engaged Learning and Teaching (MELT).

AB  - The author reflects on his 44-year career as a science instructor, during which he gradually implements new active learning strategies in the classroom and shifts to integrating science and literature in the teaching of learning communities. The author describes three learning communities to show how the disciplines of science and literature can be integrated in productive ways. The author is especially pleased that students became more active and productive learners and also appeared to demonstrate increased confidence and enjoyment of their learning community classes because the courses integrated cultural and scientific perspectives, and were interactive as well as personally and socially relevant.

AB  - This article describes how two faculty members at Cabrini College--one from biology and the other from psychology--incorporated interdisciplinary community-based research in an honors course on environmental watershed issues. The course, Environmental Psychology, was team-taught in partnership with a local watershed organization, the Valley Creek Restoration Partnership (VCRP) in such a way that the students could see first-hand the interdisciplinary nature of many community-based research (CBR) projects. The study of watersheds is necessarily an interdisciplinary endeavor, requiring an understanding of natural, social, and behavioral sciences. Additionally, since both faculty were working with the same community partner, they anticipated that they would be able to align and integrate their research designs more closely with one another when team-teaching an interdisciplinary CBR course. The interdisciplinary CBR course exposed more students at Cabrini College to an experiential learning opportunity. The course was open to students in any major and at any level in the Cabrini College Honors Program. The design, implementation, and assessment of the course can serve as a roadmap for others considering teaching an interdisciplinary CBR course in honors, including details about the collaboration between faculty from different disciplines with a community partner, student focus group data on course learning outcomes, the impact of an honors interdisciplinary CBR project from a community partner perspective, and the expansion of the honors model into an institution's general education requirements for all students.

AB  - To address the lack of communication among scientists and teachers, the social media platform, Twitter, could be a useful tool. Over the years, Twitter has become an informal learning space for teachers (Rehm & Notten, 2016). Teachers use hashtags such as #scichat to collaborate with each other, share resources, stay informed about current educational practices, and hold conversations with people and organizations from around the world. Personal learning networks have emerged from these conversations. Twitter could be an excellent platform for science teachers to connect with scientists in order to assist them with their research via citizen science, but are they using it? In this investigation, the author explored the extent to which those involved in science teacher social networks are also involved in citizen science social networks. An overarching research question is "In what ways are K-12 science teachers involved in citizen science on Twitter?" The question was investigated with two sub-questions as follows: (1) What kind of overlaps exists between participants using science educator hashtags and citizen science hashtags?; and (2) What kind of overlaps exists between top influencers using science educator hashtags and citizen science hashtags? Findings from this study could assist researchers in determining the next steps for Twitter usage among science teachers who are interested in collaborating with scientists and pursuing citizen science in their classrooms.

AB  - Supplementing classroom instruction with online materials and learning activities is becoming less avant-garde and more of an expectation for faculty members in higher education. The use of Blackboard, WebCT, or proprietary software, like Georgia Institute of Technology's Sakai installation (T-Square), has become a requirement, rather than an option. Citing both Project Tomorrow's "Speak Up 2008" report and "Visions 2020.2," a report based on a survey sponsored by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the Department of Education, and NetDay, a nonprofit organization in California, the "Chronicle of Higher Education" concluded in their "The College of 2020: Students" report that the students of 2020 "are restless with the traditional forms of learning and eager to incorporate into their educations the electronic tools that have become omnipresent in their lives: their smartphones, laptop computers, iPods, and MP3 players" (Van Der Werf and Sabatier 7). Faculty intent on reaching such students must devise nuanced methods of course delivery and revise course assignments to more comprehensively account for these shifting paradigms. As these alterations are made, faculty must also devise new systems of evaluating student work when it reaches beyond the discipline-specific learning outcomes to include technical writing and digital design components. In constructing an interdisciplinary course on the intersections between science and science fiction at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, one of my goals was to create assignments that challenged students' technical prowess, as well as their skills with writing and critical analysis. Requiring students to learn or improve upon their HTML skills by developing webpages, rather than traditional essay assignments, allowed me to more easily convey the idea of technical languages as having their own rhetorical principles. The complexity of the projects required a staged evaluation process that ultimately challenged students to work far beyond the assignment "requirements," as they began to truly explore the boundaries between different modes of discourse.

AB  - This article focuses on an argument-based inquiry (ABI) approach to a fourth grade unit on waves. A fourth-grade teacher included multiple opportunities for students to read, write, and use language to represent their understanding of physical science Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) performance expectations (NGSS Lead States 2013). He used the ABI approach for the STEM Infused Science Teaching (ASSIST) approach, which will be discussed briefly in this article and can be used to engage students in work with any science concept. In a follow-up interview, the fourth grade teacher who taught this unit indicated that the students were engaged throughout the lesson. Also, he noticed that when he taught the math portions of the lesson, the students were more attentive than they typically would be. He also indicated that being a self-contained teacher was beneficial to this lesson because he could use his language arts time to teach the reading lesson about different types of waves, and math time to teach about graphs, angles, and area.

AB  - After providing some glimpses of his private life, Peter Fensham, a leading figure of the prestigious Faculty of Education, Monash University (and now emeritus professor at Queensland University, Brisbane, Australia), gives some suggestions about the conditions that help students to learn meaningfully. He began his career in the field of physical chemistry and then became an international authority in science education. His dedication to students and commitment to teaching a learner-centered science is palpable in many of his comments. This interview touches on many of the themes he addressed in numerous studies and research: the curriculum, the qualities of the expert teacher, and the decline of standards in schools. Although he is a supporter of a constructivist approach to teaching chemistry, he criticizes the extreme views of constructivism and explains the origin of his inner strength that made him a champion of "science for all".

AB  - Many students in US community colleges often speak a language other than English (LOTE) at home. They find it difficult to complete college requirements, and many drop out. Struggling with the acquisition of academic English and the content of their courses, they exhibit low academic confidence and are easily frustrated. In an attempt to raise students' self-esteem and motivate them to remain enrolled, we explore plurilingual pedagogies across the college curriculum, in science, humanities, education, and linguistics courses. The four case studies presented demonstrate how we integrate dynamic translingual teaching practices such as translation, code-switching, cross-linguistic analysis, and the use of students' linguistic repertoires to complete assignments in multilingual classrooms. We have found that plurilingual pedagogies enable students to discover their linguistic strengths and utilize them to complete college assignments. As bilingual faculty we found our educational goals supported and validated through interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - Organic agriculture courses and degrees in higher education have become more common in recent decades. In this article, we characterized instructor priorities for organic agriculture education and identified critical concepts and skills to be included in curriculum. We used interviews and surveys to learn from 19 instructors from universities and colleges in the United States. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded for frequency of mentions. The critical concepts most frequently mentioned by instructors were soils, ecological principles, and certification standards. The topics that instructors most frequently mentioned covering occasionally or not at all included social dimensions, climate change, and livestock production. Instructors frequently mentioned the challenges of lack of teaching materials specific to organic agriculture and lack of expertise, given the multidisciplinary span of organic agriculture. Including guest lectures was mentioned as a way to cover topics where instructors felt they had less knowledge or expertise. Instructors stated that the most challenging topics and skills for students to learn included systems thinking, managing nutrients, and performing fertilizer calculations. Our summary highlights the specific concepts that instructors across the United States prioritize in their teaching, laying the groundwork for future curriculum development. They offer valuable insight into the challenges and successes in organic agriculture teaching.

AB  - This article maps out existing research regarding the effectiveness of subject-integrated school garden teaching. The school subjects of interest are mathematics, languages and science, and subject integration is defined as a link between these subjects and school garden teaching. The article is based on an integrative review and is derived from existing research, which claims that teaching in school gardens has a predominantly positive influence on students' academic learning outcome. However, experimental studies indicate that some programmes are less effective than more traditional teaching in the subjects concerned. The review extracts and discusses factors that are consistently regarded as vital to ensure the effectiveness of school garden teaching in terms of the integration of mathematics, languages and science. It is concluded that developing a school garden curriculum is essential with a view to planning, carrying out and evaluating subject-integrated school garden teaching. The teaching should include experiential learning and hands-on activities as teaching methods, making the subject content less abstract, stimulating the students' senses, and increasing the feeling of meaningfulness. Furthermore, collaboration across subjects and links between indoor and outdoor teaching are central factors in ensuring the effectiveness of subject-integrated school garden teaching.

AB  - Sustainable development is an interdisciplinary structure that includes the dimensions of environment, economy and society. The aim of this research was to determine the sustainable development awareness of science, social studies and primary school teachers. The research designed with the survey approach was carried out with 2982 teachers working in different regions of Turkey in 2019. In the research, Sustainable Development Awareness Scale consisting of 3 sub-dimensions and 36 items developed by Atmaca, Kiray and Pehlivan (2019) was used. Significance level was taken as 0.05 in the analyses that examined the signification between the groups. As a result of the research, no significant difference was found between the teachers' sustainable development awareness and their branches and years of service, while a significant difference was found between the teachers' ages and gender and their sustainable development awareness scores.

AB  - Science education scholars emphasize the significance of an integrative, interdisciplinary STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education that encourages students to learn about the natural world through exploration, inquiry, and problem-solving experiences. This article reports on a professional development program aimed at improving a group of secondary science and mathematics teachers' competence in using a problem-based approach in the teaching of STEM. Through surveys, qualitative interviews and focus groups, the study investigated the teachers' understanding and perceptions of problem-based learning (PBL) as an approach to interdisciplinary STEM education as well as their perceptions of the personal and systemic challenges in implementing such an approach in their professional practice. This investigation offers insight into how university-based professional development programs can support secondary educators' understanding of, and ability to use an interdisciplinary problem-based STEM approach in their schools and classrooms. The study concludes with implications for practice and a discussion of how future interdisciplinary professional development can be conceptualized.

AB  - Internationally in secondary schools, lessons are typically taught by subject specialists, raising the question of how to accommodate teaching which bridges the sciences and humanities. This is the first study to look at how students make sense of the teaching they receive in two subjects (science and religious education [RE]) when one subject's curriculum explicitly refers to cross-disciplinary study and the other does not. Interviews with 61 students in seven schools in England suggested that students perceive a permeable boundary between science and their learning in science lessons and also a permeable boundary between religion and their learning in RE lessons, yet perceive a firm boundary between science lessons and RE lessons. We concluded that it is unreasonable to expect students to transfer instruction about cross-disciplinary perspectives across such impermeable subject boundaries. Finally, we consider the implications of these findings for the successful management of cross-disciplinary education.

AB  - Educational robotics has become one of the most effective methods to teach STEM concepts in a practical and didactic way at all educational level. In this context, the LEGO Mindstorms robotic platforms have been widely used due to their versatility ease of use and modularity. Despite this, most of the papers focus on K-12 and undergraduate levels, with little information reported in the literature about educational experiences at the graduate level. This article deals with the use of educational robotics for the teaching of mathematical concepts at the graduate level, and more specifically on the physical visualization of metrics (Euclidean, Taxicab, and Infinity), and the convergence of Cauchy sequence using a mobile robots LEGO Mindstorms NXT. The educational experience was applied to a group of graduate students who offered good comments on this type of educational activity and its usefulness to understand the mathematical concepts addressed. It was observed that this type of educational experiences motivates students to use mathematical concepts in interdisciplinary problems and encourages them to understand their functionality and application in the real world.

AB  - The culture of Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics (STEAM) teaching is still new among preschool teachers. Nevertheless, STEAM teaching is seen as challenging to be implemented if there is no clear guideline prepared by qualified experts. Therefore, a need analysis on STEAM teaching strategies ought to be conducted to ensure the implementation of STEAM teaching its related problems may be attended. This research aimed to explore experts' perceptions about Fred Rogers' STEAM as a STEAM teaching strategy approach as a considered method to be taught in preschools. This need analysis employed semi structured interviews with four experts. The obtained findings were categorized and analysed thematically. Five themes were identified: (1) features and needs of STEAM education, (2) inquiry-based learning (3) learning by doing activities, (4) interesting and systematic teaching strategies and (5) suitability with children' development and practices. The research findings benefit preschool teachers in selecting and implementing STEAM teaching strategies based on experts' opinion. Besides, it is anticipated to help teachers to conduct meaningful and effective STEAM teaching with preschool children.

AB  - With the impulse to control and order the disorderly, the threads or tributaries of affect and emotion, which mimic the meanderings of the aquifer itself, are often oversimplified or ignored. These are not anomalies of citizen science (CS) but 'normal' and expected 'disconnects' that surface when working within a multidisciplinary environment. The article adds value to current discourse on CS by reflecting on the confusing configurations and shifting allegiances that are part and parcel of CS experience. In presenting research from a current project in the Hout Catchment, Limpopo Province in South Africa, it suggests that CS is often oversimplified and does not capture the array of emotions that emerge at multiple scales around CS projects. The authors reflect on the field, which is fraught, fragile and fleeting--and on the intrusions into the field--similar itself to an aquifer with its dykes and flows. Considering CS within the frame of feminist philosophy, it is emancipatory and personally transformative with the element of 'surprise' that the end point is undetermined--and the process, however much 'planned' is unknown. CS in this instance is a powerful tool for creating virtuous cycles of inclusion and equality and promoting sustainable development through improved water literacy through a grassroot, out-of-the-classroom pedagogy.

AB  - This article discusses the development of an interactive online textbook for undergraduate teaching, in response to moving teaching online due to COVID-19. The development took place initially for a university with less than 5% of students studying online in 2019. The online textbook was incorporated into a large, diverse, multidisciplinary and predominantly first-year undergraduate research design and statistics course. Digital tools were embedded into the textbook to facilitate student engagement in lieu of face-to-face contact, including online crosswords for low-level statistical literacy, drop-and-drag activities, screencasts, exercises, animations, and videos. The textbook was prepared in markdown format. This approach allows for instant updating of material and provides focussed URLs that educators can use to point students directly to specific learning outcomes. Despite the textbook being developed in response to restricted teaching conditions, it has provided a cost-effective resource, targeted at teaching research design and basic statistics concepts, interpretation, and communication. Having returned to face-to-face teaching, the text is now fully integrated into the course. Importantly, the online textbook is freely available for other educators to use, either in its existing form, or by forking (on Github) the textbook sources to create a bespoke online textbook for other courses.
