AB  - This article is an attempt to reflect on the institutional and disciplinary context of a course on "Race, Gender and Sexuality in the Information Professions" from the perspective of instructors and students. It examines the effectiveness of a course like this as an intervention to the normative landscape of the Library and Information Science (LIS) field that often privileges White, male, middle-class, heterosexual, U.S.-based values and interests. In this article we provide a brief background for the re-establishment of this course, offer a literature review defining the normative landscape of LIS, and discuss the positive aspects and pitfalls of injecting this course into the curriculum as a "diversity" intervention. Finally, we offer recommendations for how to further make visible and shift the hegemonic landscape in LIS toward an inclusivity that actively deals with how race, gender, class, and sexuality deeply informs our profession.

AB  - The undergraduate Bioengineering Program at Lehigh University was established as part of the university's Bioscience and Biotechnology Initiative with support from the National Science Foundation through a grant from its Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC). The objective here is to describe the program development and implementation, as well as the challenges encountered. Bioengineering at Lehigh was designed as an interdisciplinary program, with an emphasis on experiential learning, entrepreneurship, and innovation. In this light, the goals established for the program implementation were focused on recruiting students, developing a rigorous curriculum, equipping laboratories, and fostering industrial partnerships. The curriculum initially had three key components: a core of basic requirements, three tracks allowing students to specialize within a field of bioengineering, and experiential learning. The key challenges faced are balancing breadth and depth of a curriculum in a diverse field, improving experiential learning opportunities, implementing changes while maintaining stability, and handling operations as a new program rather than as an established department. The effectiveness of these strategies has been assessed on an ongoing basis. For example, an integrated recruitment strategy was used to encourage student enrollment, the results of which were measured through surveys and admissions data. Requiring students to select one of the three tracks, which are Biopharmaceutical Engineering, Cell and Tissue Engineering, and Bioelectronics and Biophotonics, each with an advanced laboratory course, added depth to the curriculum. Based on several sources of feedback, numerous changes have been made to the curriculum, including the addition of more bioengineering courses, especially advanced electives. The incorporation of Integrated Product Development (IPD), which was already an established hallmark program at Lehigh, into bioengineering, was a major program change that enhanced the hands-on learning and innovation opportunities. Implementing such changes, and managing them effectively, have been necessary to maintain program stability.

AB  - Men outnumber women in the enrollment of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) undergraduate majors. Course syllabi are distributed to students during open enrollment and provide key insights into the courses. A critical discourse analysis of introductory engineering syllabi at a 4-year public university revealed limited to no inclusion of: student learning course outcomes, connections to topics outside of engineering, encouragement of faculty-student or peer relationships, personal growth and societal impacts, or acknowledgement of the underrepresentation of women in STEM. Syllabi should incorporate multicultural engagement factors to help reduce the gender gap and promote the increased involvement of women in STEM fields.

AB  - Recently, a growing contingent of "evolutionary sociologists" has begun to integrate theoretical ideas and empirical findings derived from evolutionary biology, especially sociobiology, into a variety of sociological inquiries. Without capitulating to a naive version of either biological reductionism or genetic determinism, these researchers and theorists have begun to synthesize sociological thought with research produced in various branches of the evolutionary life sciences. These recent developments provide sociology instructors with new opportunities to reconsider how they address the topic of biology's relevance to sociology. In this article, the authors review key issues pertaining to evolutionary explanations of social behavior, offer clarifications and explanations of several issues that are sometimes misrepresented and misunderstood, and provide specific suggestions for instructors who are interested in updating and improving the quality of instruction on this important topic.

AB  - Today's children grow up surrounded by computers. They observe them, interact with them and, as a consequence, start forming conceptions of how they work and what they can do. Any constructivist approach to learning requires that we gain an understanding of such preconceived ideas and beliefs in order to use computers as learning tools in an effective and informed manner. In this paper, we present five such conceptions that children reportedly form about computers, based on an interdisciplinary literature review. We then evaluate how persistent these conceptions appear to be over time and in light of new technological developments. Finally, we discuss the relevance and implications of our findings for education in the contexts of conceptual pluralism and conceptual categorisation.

AB  - The increasing need for communicating science to the public suggests that future scientists and science educators should be educated in science outreach and trained to communicate with lay audiences. We present a recently developed novel graduate course, which trains students in outreach efforts aimed to increase the public's understanding of science and of the role of science in our daily lives. In this course, the students, with the help of expert faculty mentors, prepare lay-language presentations about science-related topics of their choice and take the presentations to adult venues in the community. This article provides a detailed description of the course and its impact on the students and the audiences, and it discusses challenges encountered and lessons learned that will support others interested in attempting such a program.

AB  - Lloyd Bond comments here on the Focus article in this issue of "Measurement: Interdisciplinary Research and Perspectives". The Focus article is entitled: "How Task Features Impact Evidence from Assessments Embedded in Simulations and Games" (Russell G. Almond, Yoon Jeon Kim, Gertrudes Velasquez, and Valerie J. Shute). Bond begins his comments by observing that the Focus article is an ambitious one that attempts to overlay evidence-centered design (ECD) onto two very different kinds of assessments. As initially conceived by Mislevy, Steinberg, and Almond (1999) and their colleagues at Educational Testing Service, "The evidence-centered design (ECD) project at Educational Testing Service provides a conceptual design framework for the elements of a coherent assessment, at a level of generality that supports a broad range of assessment types, from familiar standardized tests and classroom quizzes, to coached practice systems and simulation-based assessments, to portfolios and student tutor interaction" (p. 1). The framework was designed to be (a) general enough to be applied to the myriad extant forms of assessment; (b) articulated sufficiently to be useful as a kind of development checklist against which a developer might buttress the evidentiary base of intended interpretations and uses; and (c) a mechanism for assessment improvement. The idea is not a new one, but underwritten as it was by the nation's preeminent testing organization and one of its equally preeminent psychometricians, ECD has gained considerable currency in the measurement community. The Focus article attempts to illustrate the versatility and utility of the framework by demonstrating how two very different assessments (a conventional test of mathematics-problem-solving ability using word problems and an "assessment" of conceptual physics, creativity, and conscientiousness embedded in the computer game "Newton's Playground") can both be analyzed using the processes and materials described in the framework. It is important to reiterate at the outset that ECD represents an important contribution to test development and use for two quite distinct reasons: (1) as a prospective guide to the test developer that provides a coherent and logically connected set of activities that she or he must undertake to ensure that intended interpretations and uses of an assessment under development are warranted; and (2) as a retrospective filter through which an extant assessment system can be passed for evaluative as well as improvement purposes. Whether one is applying ECD in either a prospective, developmental way or in a retrospective, evaluative way, the important point to note is that the entire effort has the effect of sensitizing the potential user to the essential interdependence of the processes and materials, and to the fact that an assessment is not simply a test and a scoring scheme. In reality, it is a coherent, articulated system of procedures and materials that when interpreted and used properly allows appropriate inferences about a person's standing on some attribute of interest. While Bond says that he applauds the effort to examine computer-based games and simulations in the context of ECD, he acknowledges that the Focus article shows that this and similar attempts in the future will not be easy.

AB  - The primary goal of education is to help students gain the knowledge and skills necessary to solve the problems that occur in real-life situations. One of the most touted methods for achieving this goal is through curriculum integration. Physical education students can benefit from an integrated curriculum. NASPE's (National Association tar Sport and Physical Education's) Standards for Initial Programs in Physical Education Teacher Education specifically outline in standard 6.6 that the physical educator will "provide learning experiences that allow students to integrate knowledge and skills from multiple subject areas." The national curriculum standards for math and science also support interdisciplinary collaboration. The proposed project integrates physical education, physics, and mathematics, and has been successfully implemented at the high school level.

AB  - The recent push for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education introduces (through the emphasis on engineering) a "design process" to science classrooms; some educators have also pushed for the "artistic or creative process" becoming a part of STEM education. In certain cases, this might be an opportunity for greater prominence for art education, better art and STEM learning, and heightened student engagement; in others it might weaken each discipline and confuse the boundaries between different approaches. In what follows we describe the possibilities and pitfalls of an approach that infuses both the creative process and design thinking into a new iteration of STEM education that adds arts (with a capital "A") to the acronym to make STEAM.

AB  - Higher education institutions and scientific funding agencies are emphasizing international projects that involve the integration and synergy between research groups, particularly if different disciplines are involved. Students with an education that reflects these trends will have more tools to succeed in the future, but it is challenging to provide this type of learning experience. Here we present the organization of a bi-national course with the goals to teach students protein structure/function relationships, which give them actual research experience in both computational and experimental laboratories, and engage them in an international networking experience. Two collaborative learning courses were organized at Loyola University Chicago (USA) and Universidad Nacional del Litoral (Argentina) for graduate and advanced undergraduate students. Multiple instructors at different stages in their careers gave lectures during the course and were able to interact with students on a one-on-one basis. Nearly every student from both institutions thoroughly enjoyed this approach, and they learned more about protein structure and gained important tools for their own research. We believe that this type of course design is applicable and transferable to other institutions and areas of science. We found that the combination of international networking and incorporation of actual research projects ignited the enthusiasm of students and instructors. Due to the success of these courses, we planned to incorporate them as regular series in our curriculum. (Contains 3 tables, 3 schemes, 2 figures, and 1 footnote.)

AB  - This qualitative study reports the concerns of faculty in one food science department as they integrate communication competencies into their classes. The results of the study prioritized self-reports from faculty regarding the challenges they experienced while integrating communication activities into their classes; the nature of the concerns and accompanying recommendations may be generalizable to integration efforts in other disciplines. Two areas of concern that emerged are: faculty were challenged by logistical issues such as developing assessment instruments and assignments and by developing group activities; second, the risks they took by teaching an area outside of their disciplinary expertise caused them to question their preparedness to teach another discipline in these ways: they felt they were losing control of their own disciplinary content and were not prepared to help students with group activities or to give students useful feedback. Several issues emerged for the consideration of agents of integrations and researchers in this area, among them, that integration is a process rather than an event, and agents of integration are visitors who must respect the traditions of the disciplines within which they work.

AB  - This article provides a theoretical foundation to argue for an effective and meaningful realization of human rights education in school curricula and beyond. Despite emerging research on a content-related basis and large-scale initiatives, the practical realization of human rights education is mostly still a desideratum. By analyzing relevant documents by the United Nations (UN), particularly the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UNGA, 1948), this paper shows that human rights education is a human right itself. Upon joining the UN, member states pledged to provide human rights education to all citizens. However, the question what it means to ensure the right to human rights education is complex because the concept of 'right' is ambiguous. Thus, this manuscript logically analyzes the right to human rights education by means of Kanger's theory of rights that encompasses a classification of all possible types of right. The analysis shows that the right to human rights education consists of two complex types of right that contain both a claim right as well as service rights. The author concludes that in order to meet the obligations of the UN "Charta," UN member states are required (1) to provide mandatory human rights education in compulsory education and (2) to grant access to human rights education to all citizens.

AB  - The integration of ideas, methods, and data from diverse disciplines has been a transformative force in science and higher education, attracting policy interventions, program innovations, financial resources, and talented people. Much energy has been invested in producing a new generation of scientists trained to work fluidly across disciplines, sectors, and research problems, yet the success of such investments has been difficult to measure. Using the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) program of the U.S. National Science Foundation as a strategic research site, we conducted an experiment to determine whether and how the process and products of research of IGERT-trained scientists differ from those of scientists trained in disciplinary graduate programs. Among scientists in the early years of graduate study we found substantial and consistent differences suggesting that interdisciplinary training improved the quality and process of research, but this pattern was equally strongly reversed among students in the latter years of graduate study. Using systematic observation and other data we suggest why this might be so, then discuss the implications of these results for the design and conduct of graduate education and research.

AB  - This article describes the design and implementation of a business proposal module for final-year science students at a tertiary institution in Hong Kong. It is argued that in the needs analysis process, the present situation analysis (PSA), that is, personal information about the learners and factors which may affect their learning, is just as if not more important than, the target situation analysis (TSA), that is, professional information about the learners in terms of their future language requirements. The PSA aspect of the needs analysis was found to present several constraints impinging on the course design, which required compromises and adaptations to be made to how the course was originally envisaged. The module adopts the case-study approach which is advocated in the literature on EOP as it mirrors the activities and practices of a real-life business situation. The article describes how key teaching points (socio-pragmatic competence, the issue of "glocalisation", communication with impression, genre conventions and interdisciplinarity, and usage errors) are addressed within the case-study approach.

AB  - Finding solutions to complex health problems, such as obesity, violence, and climate change, will require radical changes in cross-disciplinary education, research, and practice. The fundamental determinants of health include many interrelated factors such as poverty,  culture, education, environment, and government policies. However, traditional public health training has tended to focus more narrowly on diseases and risk factors, and has not adequately leveraged the rich contributions of sociology, anthropology, economics, geography, communication, political science, and other disciplines. Further, students are often not sufficiently trained to work across sectors to translate research findings into effective, large-scale sustainable actions. During the past 2 decades, national and international organizations have called for more effective interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary, and translational approaches to graduate education. Although it has been difficult to work across traditional academic boundaries, some promising  models draw on pedagogical theory and feature cross-disciplinary training focused on real-world problems, linkage between research, professional practice, community action, and cultivation of leadership skills. We describe the development the Doctor of Public Health program at the University of California, Berkeley, USA and its efforts to improve transdisciplinary and translational research education. We stress the need for international collaboration to improve educational approaches and better evaluate their impact.

AB  - In both developed and developing countries, population aging has attained unprecedented levels. Public health strategies to deliver services in community-based settings are key to enhancing the utilization of preventive care and reducing costs for this segment of the population. Motivated by concerns of inadequate access to oral health care by older adults in urban environments, this article presents a portfolio of systems science models that have been developed on the basis of observations from the ElderSmile preventive screening program operated in northern Manhattan, New York City, by the Columbia University College of Dental Medicine. Using the methodology of system dynamics, models are developed to explore how interpersonal relationships influence older adults' participation in oral health promotion. Feedback mechanisms involving word of mouth about preventive screening opportunities are represented in relation to stocks that change continuously via flows, as well as agents whose states of health care utilization change discretely using stochastic transitions. Agent-based implementations illustrate how social networks and geographic information systems are integrated into dynamic models to reflect heterogeneous and proximity-based patterns of communication and participation in the ElderSmile program. The systems science approach builds shared knowledge among an interdisciplinary research team about the dynamics of access to opportunities for oral health promotion. Using "what if" scenarios to model the effects of program enhancements and policy changes, resources may be effectively leveraged to improve access to preventive and treatment services. Furthermore, since oral health and general health are inextricably linked, the integration of services may improve outcomes and lower costs.

AB  - Educational institutions with world language requirements face increasing student demand to offer Spanish Language for Specific Purposes (SPSP) courses at lower proficiency levels to fulfill language requirements. Language for specific purposes courses are designed to fulfill the communicative needs of students within a specific professional context such as medicine, law, sciences, social work, business, translation and interpretation, among others. The focus of these courses is on the integration of language related competencies through connections to other disciplines. These traits are very attractive to students who feel they will be able to use their second language in future professional domains. This short-form article discusses the proposal to start offering SPSP courses earlier, before students reach advanced proficiency, and in mixed classes where second language learners and heritage students sit together, to benefit from the specific content. For this project, the authors compared students enrolled in the Spanish for the Professions course (SPSP) (n=44) with a group of students (n=42) enrolled in the traditional course. All participants were undergraduate students with an average age of 19.5 years. The authors undertook statistical analyses to compare both courses (SPSP/Traditional) and analyze variance as to student performance. They undertook analyses of variance (ANOVAS) with course type (SPSP, traditional) as a between-subjects variable and assessment type (compositions, oral presentation, unit exams, online homework) as within-subjects variable. The dependent variable was student performance in each class component. Results indicated that overall, students enrolled in the traditional topics' course outperformed the one in the SPSP group (83% versus 77%). A second important finding indicated that students enrolled in the SPSP course outperformed students in the traditional topics' course in the oral presentation component (91% versus 86%). The performance of Spanish heritage bilinguals (HSs) is also part of this analysis. It was compared with the performance of second language learners (L2) in both courses (SPSP and traditional). Not waiting to offer SPSP courses at the advanced level of proficiency opens multiple possibilities for students to collaborate with others who are bridging language content and professional applicability. It presents all students with the same task: learning challenging vocabulary for the real world of the professions.

AB  - The article discusses the notion of the ecological self as a key concept for teacher identity construction during teacher education in the context of sustainable development (SD). Substantial amount of literature supports the understanding that the solution to the global sustainability crisis lies in the field of education where teacher identity, teacher self, plays a significant role. The paper gives the argumentation for the concept of ecological self and focuses on the question how to support the development of the ecological self during teacher education (TE). EsbjÃ¶rn-Hargens & Zimmerman's model of eco-selves and Saks' model of intention are presented that could be used for that purpose. Some methods for supporting the development of an ecological self of a future teacher are also shared, for investigation and practical implementation in TE. The limitations of the present approach are obvious first and foremost due to the understanding that we are currently facing transformation in governing paradigms, change in dominating worldviews that penetrate any quest for "truth", also in the field of science.

AB  - This paper argues for a reimagining of education abroad that fuses short-term programming with some kind of experiential research component led by home campus disciplinary faculty, especially those in the sciences, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, in order to better integrate the study abroad program into the core undergraduate curriculum. To show how this could be done, this paper: (1) provides a brief background on study abroad; (2) reviews the relevant literature on the learning goals, program assessment, and faculty engagement in education abroad programs; (3) examines the current state of academic integration within study abroad; (4) explores the growth in undergraduate research at both home and overseas; and (5) identifies the unique opportunities represented in the extensive patterns of international faculty research collaborations, and explains how these patterns could be leveraged into new kinds of study abroad programs. The argument is supported with evidence of innovative programs at several American universities. A bibliography is included.

AB  - The trustworthiness and expertise of professionals is much in demand even while they are derided as members of slippery, credentialized and self-serving elites. Eliot Friedson's three 'logics' provide a contextual lens for this deconstruction of 'professional' and are updated by adding Artificial Intelligence (AI) as putative fourth logic to provide a contextual background--so, Markets, Bureaucracy and AI are seen as alternatives to and influences on professionalism. This context suggests that it may already be too late to save 'professionals', but them paper confronts a significant conceptual deficit by using a second interdisciplinary lens, Clarke's Place Model, to critically deconstruct the 'place' of professionals to reimagine a commodious and accessible conceptualization, consisting of five dystopias and a potentially potent oxymoron--"inclusive professional." The Place Model is presented as an example of a Geographical Imagination (Massey), combining two conceptions of 'place': place as esteem and place as a changing position on the expanding horizons of a career-long growth of expertise. This novel conceptualization is then used to examine the dystopias and potential ideals of 'professional'.

AB  - The goal of this study was to develop an instrument for assessing grade 10 and 11 student's levels of scientific literacy in the areas of problem solving and decision making. In concentrating on determining the scientific literacy of gymnasium level students, it was taken as a first; previous international studies like PISA have focused on ninth grade students. The study used four interdisciplinary situations in a personal, social and global context, taken from everyday life, and answers were expected at higher levels of scientific thinking. In addition, student's opinions were sought about their interest related to the kind of instruments used, with the intention of considering their opinions if later modifying the instrument. The sample (N = 62) was composed of 10 and 11 grade students in two schools. Results indicated that it is possible to develop an instrument for dividing students' responses between levels of scientific literacy, although most students responded at the functional level with very few at the multidimensional level and this despite the fact that the questions were developed to assess higher levels of scientific literacy. In the students' opinion, the more interesting situations were those in a personal and social context. Students justified this by answering that their capability to solve problems and make decisions by utilizing science knowledge and skills was best in such situations. In reality, they still operated at a functional level as indicated by their responses. (Contains 6 tables.)

AB  - The National Research Council completed a major study of undergraduate biology education, "BIO 2010-Transforming Undergraduate Education For Future Research Biologists (BIO 2010)," funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the National Institutes of Health. The "BIO 2010" report recommends that biology pedagogy should use an interdisciplinary approach incorporating a strong basis in mathematics and physical sciences. Many of the aims of "BIO 2010" can be met by an interdisciplinary major program such as that of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Kenyon College. The Kenyon program effectively encourages students to connect biology with chemistry and mathematics and to develop a sound basis for research in the biological sciences. A continuing challenge is to balance the needs for depth of physical and mathematical understanding and breadth of diversity in biology.

AB  - Experimental science activities in primary school enable important cross-curricular learning. In this study, experimental activities on microbiology were carried out by 16 pupils in a Portuguese grade-4 classroom (9-10?years old) and were focused on two problem-questions related to microbiology and health: (1) do your teeth carry microbes? (2) why should you brush your teeth after meals? To solve problem-question (1), children's samples of dental plaque were prepared and observed under the microscope. For question (2), culture medium plates were inoculated with children's dental plaque either before or after tooth brushing and the colonies were counted. Results showed that pupils easily recognised the presence of microorganisms in the mouth and verified the effectiveness of the process of teeth-brushing. Pupils understood that microorganisms were potentially responsible for the onset of dental caries. These practical activities on microbiology in primary school were very effective in ensuring young children easily understand the causes of dental caries and how they can be prevented. Pupils became aware that the act of brushing their teeth is not only a socially correct behaviour or a simple rule to meet, but also a matter of preventing illness and promoting health.

AB  - Students are attracted to innovation and entrepreneurship. However, it is challenging for them to take courses in I&E due to their already busy curriculums. This paper describes the "New Venture Design Experience," a one-year interdisciplinary program that pairs core and elective courses between the colleges of Engineering and Business Administration. The program aims to provide the time and resources for students to venture into their own entrepreneurial projects during a one year period, within the classroom setting. Students will first take either Design Thinking, a course that teaches human-centered design with a project-based learning approach; or Consumer Behavior, a course that teaches students about the different factors that influence consumer behavior and the decision process. Each team has members in both courses, which continue working together throughout the year. In the second semester, team members work on their ventures through the Product Design, Capstone, or Technology-Based Entrepreneurship courses. By the end of the program, they will have developed a working prototype, created a crowdfunding pitch, and submitted to an entrepreneurial competition. This leads teams to start impacting society in a positive manner by providing solutions to real-life problems.

AB  - Integrating the worlds of art and science can be a perfect tool for engaging students who wouldn't be initially interested in a science class. Even those students who love science may delve deeper into the subject when it's associated with art. One way to make this connection is to explore the life and work of great nature artists of the past and present. According to Content Standard G (History and Nature of Science) of the National Science Education Standards, "Science is very much a human endeavor, and the work of science relies on basic human qualities, such as reasoning, insight, energy, skill, and creativity" (NRC 1996, p. 130). Integrating the life and work of those who have successfully combined these disciplines into the science curriculum demonstrates that science is a human endeavor and has the potential to inspire students' creativity. Students may gain a newfound appreciation for the wonder and beauty of science. (Contains 3 figures and 8 resources.)

Such lectures can be generic, stand-alone modules or embedded within a discipline-specific course. Pragmatic and institutional considerations suggest that a generic model of delivery often has an effective role to play; however, there are strong pedagogical arguments for adopting an embedded approach wherever possible. The practice of embedding literacy interventions within subject papers is time-consuming and often logistically challenging; therefore, in order to help learning advisors, their managers and academic staff in faculties to consider the issues, options and constraints in a systematic manner, this paper proposes a best-practice model drawing from over two decades of literature and the authors' practical experience over the same period in New Zealand and overseas. In order to elucidate the model, the paper critiques an embedded academic literacy skills programme facilitated by an interdisciplinary studies unit at Auckland University of Technology (AUT), New Zealand. The programme is embedded in a core paper entitled "Knowledge, Enquiry and Communication" (KEC) which is a prerequisite for entry into all of the Health Science programmes. As well as describing key features which have contributed to the success of the programme, the authors identify several key factors which need to be taken into account when considering embedded academic literacy initiatives.

AB  - Art education as a distinct academic discipline is relatively recent and closely related to the growth of specialist teacher qualification programmes in university education departments. Opportunities for art teachers to engage in research were first provided in advanced diploma courses and specialist masters programmes set up in university education departments. Later these were followed by specialist doctoral degrees. Since the majority of such programmes are located in education departments, research training has tended to be social science based. Recently there has been a flurry of publications by art and art education specialists devoted to explaining and extolling the idea of art practice as an alternative paradigm. This article analyses and discusses this development and the status of research in the specialist field, drawing on the author's recent experience of carrying out two systematic reviews of studies in art education. It examines strengths and weaknesses in the two research paradigms and suggests ways forward for improving training in art education research.

AB  - Content and language integrated learning (CLIL) is an approach to bilingual education in which academic content and an additional language are taught at the same time. It is growing rapidly throughout the world, with the medium of instruction in most CLIL classrooms being English. This means that many teachers around the world are teaching academic content in English, which is neither their, nor their students', first language. There is thus a need to establish and clarify the knowledge of language necessary for these teachers to carry out teaching tasks effectively. Drawing on [Ball, Deborah Loewenberg, Mark Hoover Thames, and Geoffrey Phelps. 2008. "Content Knowledge for Teaching: What Makes It Special?" "Journal of Teacher Education" 59: 389-407] work on content knowledge for teaching (as do [Freeman, Donald, Anne Katz, Pablo GarcÃ­a GÃ³mez, and Anne Burns. 2015. "English-for-Teaching: Rethinking Teacher Proficiency in the Classroom." "ELT Journal" 69 (2): 129-139] in the ELT context), the article proposes the construct of 'Language knowledge for content teaching' (LKCT). This construct has two sub-domains: common language knowledge for content teaching (CLK-CT) and specialized language knowledge for content teaching (SLK-CT). These sub-domains are described and illustrative examples from a corpus of classroom interactions are presented. It is suggested that further research can develop these domains of teacher's' language knowledge for CLIL both theoretically and empirically, and they are offered as a tool for mapping out the language component of the knowledge base for CLIL teacher education.

AB  - This paper describes a web-based collaborative project called "A Dance with the Butterflies" that applied the brain-based research of the Center for Applied Special Technologies (CAST) and principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to Pre-K-4 science curriculum. Learning experiences were designed for students to invoke the Recognition, Strategic, and Affective neural networks for learning identified in the CAST research. Instruction was based on the Science Education content standard that all students should develop an understanding of the characteristics, life cycles, and environments of living organisms. Teachers designed interdisciplinary projects for students with the metamorphosis of the butterfly as the theme the unit. Participants from nine states and four countries learned about UDL to transform teaching and to collaborate through a blog that supported their learning. They shared new technology applications for use in their projects. The learning that occurred and the excitement to use technology for learning clearly demonstrate the power of the UDL framework for increasing engagement and understanding by all learners.

AB  - As teachers and administrators focus increasing attention on the mental health needs of students, researchers are exploring ways that addressing social-emotional needs is essential to academic growth as well as personal wellness. This descriptive investigation explored ways that seventh and eighth grade students perceived their social-emotional development in a school context in which teachers integrated social and emotional learning (SEL) with academics. An English Language Arts (ELA) teacher and a team of university researchers observed students during lessons, gathered work samples, and interviewed students across a school year. Intensive case studies with ten students provided descriptions of the types of connections students made with their learning experiences and ways these connections varied. Participants made visible connections with teachers on a personal level. They connected with peers spontaneously and reflected on peer relationships to varying levels. Reflecting on these social connections helped develop self-awareness, social awareness, and relationship skills. Reflections also enabled participants to connect interests, engagement, and accomplishment to varying extents, enhancing capacities for self-management and responsible decision-making. Results suggest that emphasizing the process of reflection in reading, writing, math, science, social studies, and electives may be a powerful way to enhance social and emotional learning in the flow of classroom events.

AB  - Aristotle launched Western knowledge on a trajectory toward disciplinarity that continues to this day. But is the knowledge management project that began with Aristotle adequate for the age of Google? Perhaps an undisciplined discourse more evocative of Plato can help us constitute new, more relevant inter- and transdisciplinary forms of knowledge. This article explores the history of disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity, arguing for a new, critical form of interdisciplinarity that moves beyond the academy into dialogue with the public and private sectors. Contemporary knowledge production should involve not only a horizontal axis stretching across academia but also a vertical axis where academic research is integrated into contemporary life.

AB  - This study investigates critical thinking in a Physical Geography course and illustrates how students can understand physical geography in the context of their world. As a general education science course, most students are in non-science disciplines and feel disconnected from the material. By using exercises that challenge learning and concept associations, they apply new information into their lives to make the material meaningful and memorable. As an introductory survey course, students are introduced to an array of subject matter. They find it difficult to link concepts of Earth systems together. By using thought sessions and formatted worksheets, students can reflect on one system and how it impacts another system. Students choose thought sessions from categories (political/economic, analytical/scientific, philosophical/artistic, technological), supporting an interdisciplinary approach.

AB  - Before 1950, history of science did not exist as an independent academic branch, but was instead pursued by practitioners across various humanities and scientific disciplines. After professionalization, traces of its prehistory as a cross-disciplinary area of interest bound to an interdisciplinary, educational philosophy have remained. This essay outlines the development of history of science as an interdisciplinary academic field, and argues that it constitutes an obvious choice for inclusion in an interdisciplinary academic program,  provided faculty and administrators learn how best to manage its advantages and pitfalls.

AB  - The reflections on interdisciplinarity cover several dimensions. One, among them, concerns the nature of what occurs between two disciplines. Does inter-disciplinarity relate to an intention, to a metatheory, to the object, or to a method? It is this ultimate space that we propose to study, supported by Reswebers (2000) proposition, putting the study of the homology of forms forward as a promising way to better understand the interdisciplinarity. Therefore, we have modelled the literature review methods for social work and nursing in order to clarify what expresses, on the plan of the method, either some form homologies or else some interdisciplinary possibilities.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity is rapidly becoming a norm within both the professional and academic worlds, and the ability to collaborate is becoming an essential skill for all graduates. "Chemistry Is in the News" ("CIITN") is a curriculum that aims to teach students this skill by engaging student collaborative groups in a project that ties real world events and topics to the content taught in the classroom. While the collaborative activity has been successful in many ways, the challenge of maintaining individual accountability within the collaborative activity has persisted. The need to balance the tension between promoting collaboration and maintaining individual performance standards drove the development of an intra-group peer review system. In developing this peer review system, four goals guide the design: the desire to promote collaboration, to produce a differentiated score among group members reflecting the contribution each person made, to improve student perception of fairness and accuracy in the assessment process of "CIITN" and to avoid artificially inflating students' grades. The system was assessed in the winter semester of 2004 in a large lecture course at a major Midwestern university via student questionnaires and the "CIITN" scores. Evidence is provided to suggest that the intra-group peer review system has met its core goals. (Contains 4 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - The purpose of this article is to describe an internationalization project that was developed at the University of Central Florida (UCF) in Orlando, Florida to provide faculty across the disciplines with assignments they can use to foster the development of their students' global competency. After describing the project and the series of assignments they developed, the authors focus on one of the assignments, a cultural interview, and describe how it was adapted in two disciplines: hospitality management and political science. Overall, the students found the experience to be a positive one. They gained confidence as a result of conducting the interview and developed a broader perspective on their chosen profession. Finally, many students reflected on the fact that before completing the interview they thought their level of cultural competence was much greater than it actually was. The interview assignment is a valuable tool for faculty who wish to help their students develop their global competency whether the primary motivation is to help students become more competitive in the job market or to foster students' development as engaged global citizens. As shown by the findings of this study, the assignment has the potential to do both simultaneously.

AB  - This single site case study examines the ways a particular STEM school in its first year of operation meets the unique needs of freshmen students with disabilities (SWD). Specific research questions address primary supports and challenges to the learning of SWD, and the working relationship among general and special educators and administrators. A constant comparison analysis of data (extended observations, semi-structured interviews, and document review) resulted in three categories: ownership, challenge, and flexibility. Additional reflection revealed an overarching theme of "Practice what you preach." Faculty and staff in this STEM school take ownership of all students and maintain high expectations. They use inquiry, project-based learning with real-life applications, and cooperative group learning to teach a rigorous curriculum that includes engineering, physics, and Chinese in addition to more traditional freshman courses. The teachers also employ technology and collaborative problem solving to build on the strengths of students while differentiating, accommodating, and sometimes, modifying lessons to meet all students' unique learning needs.

AB  - Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Project Green Reach (PGR) is a children's program that has offered garden-based youth education since 1990. PGR focuses on Grade K-8 students and teachers from local Title I schools who work in teams on garden and science projects. In this exploratory study, the authors used field observations, document analysis, and past participant interviews to investigate PGR's program, model informal science education, and document the influence of the program on urban youth. In all, 7 themes emerged: (a) participants' challenging home and school environments, (b) changes in academic and interdisciplinary skills, (c) changes in science and gardening skills, (d) increased environmental awareness, (e) social and personal growth, (f) a positive life experience, and (g) the cultural significance of the program.

AB  - The effectiveness of flipped classroom approaches can be improved by combining it with other pedagogical models such as inquiry-based learning. Implementing inquiry-based learning in flipped classroom scenarios requires teachers to plan arrangements for in- and out-of-class activities carefully. In this study, a design heuristic based on the 5E inquiry model was developed to support teachers' practice of planning inquiry-based flipped classroom lessons. Following a design-based research approach, the design heuristic progressed through two cycles within 2 years. The design heuristic was implemented in both cycles in an online professional development course for secondary mathematics teachers. In the first cycle, 18 lesson plans were collected and analysed using the 5E lesson plan scoring instrument. Results showed that the design heuristic helped teachers to set up lesson plans for flipped classroom scenarios which were mostly in line with the 5E model. However, the evaluation phase was insufficiently addressed. Revision decisions were made at the end of the first cycle, and the design heuristic was revised and re-implemented in a second cycle. Results of the second cycle showed another 19 participating teachers who also struggled in choosing appropriate assessment techniques, an issue which could not be resolved with the proposed design heuristic. This paper describes the development of the design heuristic as well as relevant design principles for inquiry-based flipped classroom scenarios. The proposed design heuristic is not domain specific. Hence, further research could examine its use in other subjects or interdisciplinary as inquiry-based flipped classroom approaches are one of the emerging pedagogies.

AB  - We are delighted to welcome you to the International Psychological Applications Conference and Trends (InPACT) 2016, taking place in Lisbon, Portugal, from 30 of April to 2 of May, 2016. Psychology, nowadays, offers a large range of scientific fields where it can be applied. The goal of understanding individuals and groups (mental functions and behavioral standpoints), from this academic and practical scientific discipline, is aimed ultimately to benefit society. This International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the several areas within the Psychology field, new developments in studies and proposals for future scientific projects. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between psychologists, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in psychological issues. The conference is a forum that connects and brings together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. There is an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement the view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons there are nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. InPACT 2016 received 332 submissions, from 37 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. It was accepted for presentation in the conference 96 submissions (29% acceptance rate). The conference also includes: (1) A keynote presentation from Prof. Dr. Richard Bentall (Institute of Psychology, Health & Society of the University of Liverpool, United Kingdom); (2) Three Special Talks, one from Emeritus Professor Carlos Amaral Dias (University of Coimbra, Director of Instituto Superior Miguel Torga, Vice-President of the Portuguese Association of Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy, Private practitioner of psychiatry and psychoanalysis, Portugal) and Prof. Clara Pracana (Full and Training member of the Portuguese Association of Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy, Portugal), another from Emeritus Professor Michael Wang (University of Leicester, United Kingdom), and a third one from Dr. ConceiÃ§Ã£o Almeida (Founder of the Portuguese Association of Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytical Psychotherapy, and Vice-President of the Board. Member of the Teaching Committee, Portugal); (3) An Invited Talk from Dr. Ana Vasconcelos (SAMS--ServiÃ§os de AssistÃªncia MÃ©dico-Social do Sindicato dos BancÃ¡rios de Sul e Ilhas, founding member of the Portuguese Association of Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy, and member of NPA-Neuropshycanalysis Association, Portugal). Thus, we would like to express our gratitude to all our invitees. This volume is composed by the abstracts of the International Psychological Applications Conference and Trends (InPACT 2016), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (W.I.A.R.S.). This conference addresses different categories inside Applied Psychology area and papers fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. To develop the conference program six main broad-ranging categories had been chosen, which also cover different interest areas: (1) In CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY: Emotions and related psychological processes; Assessment; Psychotherapy and counseling; Addictive behaviors; Eating disorders; Personality disorders; Quality of life and mental health; Communication within relationships; Services of mental health; and Psychopathology. (2) In EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY: Language and cognitive processes; School environment and childhood disorders; Parenting and parenting related processes; Learning and technology; Psychology in schools; Intelligence and creativity; Motivation in classroom; Perspectives on teaching; Assessment and evaluation; and Individual differences in learning.

AB  - Undergraduate research in the biochemistry, cell, and molecular biology program at Drake University uses apprenticeship, cooperative-style learning, and peer mentoring in a cross-disciplinary and cross-community educational program. We call it the one-room schoolhouse approach to teaching undergraduate research. This approach is cost effective, aids learning, supports the development of science and transferable management skills, is productive, and supports diversity. It allows a small set of faculty to involve large numbers of students in research and maintain a productive scholarship program. It provides students with skills in scientific research and transferable skills that they apply to a wide set of careers. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - Previous studies have provided insights into classroom etiquette through research focused on observing small student groups, with no significant exploration, through survey research, of classroom etiquette in a large sample. The present study addresses this gap through a questionnaire measuring students' self-perceptions of classroom etiquette. A review of empirical studies on classroom etiquette, misbehavior, and students' silent in-class behavior allowed the development of this classroom etiquette questionnaire. We then ran a series of factor analyses on 44 questionnaire items extracted from the literature in a sample of N=113 university students enrolled in the life science department of a private university in Gunma, Japan. The statistical results revealed only 22 items being relevant to the Japanese university classroom. These items fell into four underlying dimensions: Misbehaviors (rude or unwelcome behaviors), Disengagement (behaviors related to off-task activities), Apprehension (behaviors triggered by the anxiety of speaking up in class and worrying about other people's judgments), and Silent in-class behavior (the adoption of silent behavior to prevent class disruptions). Further analysis of the relationships between these four factors, using Spearman's rho correlations analysis, revealed a high degree of association between Apprehension and Silent in-class behavior and moderate, but significant, associations between Disengagement and Misbehavior, and between Disengagement and Apprehension. These relationships were further explored through in-depth interviews with ten university students of the same university. The significant findings showed that although the interviewees reported having a positive image of students who expressed personal views during class, most of them preferred to remain silent. They felt afraid of making mistakes and appearing ignorant if they made inquiries or provided incorrect answers. Silent in-class behavior plays an essential role in classroom etiquette as it prevents disruptions or the exchange of conflicting opinions during class while preserving harmony in the classroom, and at the same time, is used as a face-saving action by students to prevent damage to their self-esteem. This study contributes to the body of research on classroom etiquette by supporting the findings of previous qualitative studies. It also contributes by furnishing an acceptably reliable instrument that provides an initial approximation of the spectrum of student behavior within Japanese university classroom parameters.

AB  - Social Entrepreneurship (SE) programs have been expanding over the past decade. The emergence of this new discipline can be attributed to two overlapping factors. Students (particularly business students) have expressed an increased desire to blend values, ethics and social causes into their own vocations. At the same time, the nonprofit and public sectors are rapidly adopting the language, practices and paradigms of business. These two forces have set the stage for a rapid expansion of SE programs across US universities. A review of colleges and universities reveals more than 500 professors teaching courses related to SE. Additionally, over the past five years, the Dell Social Innovation Challenge has logged more than 15,000 student competitors from 105 countries. Despite its expansion, a core body of knowledge is not yet solidified for this emerging field. SE is still an interdisciplinary exercise; drawing from business, public policy, and the social sciences. Consequently, there is still enormous variation across universities in program goals, content coverage, and teaching methodology. Specialized academic conferences, new journals, and countless numbers of papers, are all attempting to define the boundaries of the discipline, standardize content coverage, and explore useful pedagogical tools to move the discipline forward. This paper contributes to this ongoing conversation by describing the SE program at Samford University's Brock School of Business. The first section of the paper offers a brief overview of the program including its philosophy and core elements. The second section describes in more detail one key piece of our curriculum, the Financial Management for Nonprofit Organizations course. This course was a more recent addition to our SE program. The paper concludes by summarizing the contributions of this course to the strategic goals of Samford's SE program.

AB  - Creativity often has been associated with the arts, although creativity also is essential for innovative discoveries and applications in science and engineering. In this article, a pilot study is presented about an investigation concerning how creativity is fostered in an art education course in conjunction with an undergraduate engineering course, through visual arts experiences and instruction using creative problem solving strategies. Through emphasizing creative strategies and ways of thinking developed through art, such as resistance to closure, tolerance of ambiguity, visualization, and use of metaphor, interdisciplinary collaborations of art with other disciplines, such as engineering, can become very successful. In addition, this project is relevant for art teacher preparation as well as K-12 art education with its focus on creative problem solving, considered an important 21st-century skill, and in regard to increased interest in making engineering a part of high school curricula.

AB  - Enacting a critical environmental education curriculum theory with 8- to 9-year-old children in 1978 is now "restoried" in a "history of the present/future" like "case study" for prosecuting five interrelated problems confronting progress in environmental education and its research. They are: the intense heat of the Anthropocene; the accelerating speed of the Dromosphere; the deep cuts of neoliberalism's policing of the cognitive capitalism of the corporate university and public education; the entrepreneurial entry of sustainable into the discourse of education; and the digital colonisation of its pedagogical practices. The once radical promise of environmental education to serve as a critique of education partially through its "language" (Le Grange, 2013) of empowerment, agency, transformation, contestation, ideology, ethics, action, praxis and change demands revitalisation; hence, this belated restorying of the 1978 case. The time is right; at least in some academic/educational settings where the "new materialism" notions of critical, agency and action remain much more than a fading memory or convenient text. New theory helps restory this old curriculum theory and its slow ecopedagogical activism. In this "old", the critical curriculum theory (re)positioned young children and their teacher as action researchers of their own embodied socio-environmental relations. Through highly inclusive and participatory practices of outdoor and indoor ecopedagogy, children became ethically active "citizens", capable of democratically enacting political and Political change. This "active responsibility for the environment" was, indeed, a key purpose, or promise, of environmental education when the field was formalised in the 1970s. Elements of children's (eco)aesthetics-environmental ethics and ecopolitics are described in this case account of the "environmental design" of a radical curriculum innovation that critically emphasised the "humanly-constructive" educational conditions that enable agency (Payne, 1995, 1999a). Such enablements were only ever assumed in the "socially critical" theorisations of curriculum and pedagogy developed in Australia in the early 1980s. For researchers, this partially autoethnographic narrating of the old case describes the children's (embodied) experiences and locally emplaced agencies in newer theoretical "figurations" of their "body~time~space" relationalities. Children's outdoor "expeditions", interdisciplinary inquiries, literacy development, scientific investigations, and personal and public activisms are described. Revealing these micro figurational relationalities in slow ecopedagogical contexts of the environmental design of education (Payne, 2014) is consistent with Robottom and Hart's (1993) too often forgotten "old" call for researchers and practitioners to clarify the presuppositions they make about the trilogy of ontology-epistemology and methodology in framing, conceptualising, contextualising, representing, and legitimating the research problem and its questions. This restorying and history of the present/future is alert to (but cannot develop) aspects of contemporary "high" theory drawn from the humanities, social sciences and arts that prioritises the politics of ontological deliberation and the ecologies of things, (re)claims a material disposition in empirical inquiry and critique while speculating about non-anthropocentric "thought" responsive to the "new" rallying point of, for example, the Anthropocene. In sum, new theory helps restory the critical, creative, expressive and experimental forms of re-theorising the persistent problematic of human and non-human nature relations and the role of education--well on display in this "old." This revitalised history of the present/future aims to revive critical optimism and imagination about how agencies of socio-environmental change once promised by critical environmental education and its research can be "returned". The article concludes with some post-critical retheorising of key critical components of the 1978 curriculum theory.

AB  - Secondary school educators are told to teach more mathematics and science to their students to help them become more proficient in the two subjects. Coordination of mathematics and science teaching is recognized as another means of improving proficiency. The National Science Foundation has funded the "Mathematics, Science and Technology Partnership" at Hofstra University and Stony Brook University to enhance mathematical proficiency of middle school students through coordinated teaching of mathematics, science, and technology. Involvement in this project has inspired the author to incorporate mathematical concepts in her own college classroom. In particular, she used mathematical concepts to enhance the teaching of a biological course in Molecular Immunology, the study of the immune system. This course is taught to undergraduates and to perspective biology teachers at Stony Brook University. Three areas in the course have become enriched through the introduction of mathematical concepts. These areas are also covered briefly in other biology courses such as Molecular and Cellular Biology, Microbiology, and in various laboratory courses at Stony Brook University. The incorporation of mathematical concepts in these three areas is described in this article. The author has found that using mathematical concepts to enhance the teaching of immunology has enriched students' grasp of the subject and makes teaching more rewarding.

AB  - Several studies have applied the dichotomy of deep and surface approaches to learning in a range of disciplinary contexts. Existing questionnaires have largely assumed the existence of these constructs; however, in a recent study Case and Marshall (2004) described two additional context-specific approaches to learning in engineering. The current study examines approaches to learning in a similar, but not identical educational context. Academically successful students adopted either a conceptual deep approach or a procedural deep approach, whereas their less academically successful peers resorted to a procedural surface approach. This study confirms constructs identified by Case and Marshall (2004); however, a much larger student sample would be necessary to generalise current findings. Issues of diversity in the student population are outlined and measures suggested that might help increase the prevalence of deep approaches to learning. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - Humans have long wondered about life in the universe. Are we alone? Is Earth unique? What is it that makes our planet a habitable one, and are there others like Earth? NASA's Kepler Mission seeks the answers to these questions. Kepler is a space-based, specially designed 0.95 m aperture telescope. Launching in 2009, Kepler is NASA's first mission capable of finding Earth-size and smaller planets in the habitable zone of other stars in our galaxy. Therefore, the Kepler Mission provides an opportunity for interdisciplinary science teaching, as it combines Earth and space science with life sciences. Teachers and students can bring this mission down to Earth by using the accompanying poster, partaking in classroom activities, and visiting the mission's website.

AB  - The goal of this study was to test the effectiveness of integrating science and societal implication on adolescents' positive thinking and emotional perceptions about learning science. Twenty-five eighth-grade Taiwanese adolescents (9 boys and 16 girls) volunteered to participate in a 12-week intervention and formed the experimental group. Fifty-seven eighth-grade Taiwanese adolescents (30 boys and 27 girls) volunteered to participate in the assessments and were used as the comparison group. Additionally, 15 experimental students were recruited to be observed and interviewed. Paired "t"-tests, correlations, and analyses of covariance assessed the similarity and differences between groups. The findings were that the experimental group significantly outperformed its counterpart on positive thinking and emotional perceptions, and all participants' positive thinking scores were significantly related to their emotional perceptions about learning science. Recommendations for integrating science and societal implication for adolescents are provided. (Contains 6 tables and 3 figures.)

We reconceptualise what, within the school context, might be thought of in Bernstein's terms as the transfer of knowledge between two insulated vertical discourses. We describe an interdisciplinary project carried out by secondary mathematics and science teachers, and present two accounts of learning episodes to illustrate and amplify our ideas. We conclude with some discussion of how we might plan to develop interdisciplinary work using ideas of community of practice.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this article is to present the development-oriented Master's curriculum "Global Studies" (GS) at the University of Graz, Austria, as an example of interdisciplinary academic training with the purpose of fostering inter-"cultural" understanding. It aims to show that scientific disciplines can be understood as "cultures of cognition" producing own views of realities. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a decade of previous experiences, the communication and assessment functions of e-learning platforms and e-journals are used to facilitate stepwise approximations among the various "cultures of understanding". Findings: Despite severe financial limitations, peer-oriented planning and lecturing efforts since 2004 have resulted in a bundle of electives and in a new Master's curriculum elaborated cooperatively by the faculties of the legal, economic, historic, cultural, natural and communication sciences at Karl-Franzens-University Graz. Both the bundle of electives and the Master's curriculum appear to offer a truly "m:n type" interdisciplinary and intercultural design which assumes various stakeholder-dependent perspectives of multi-faceted realities. Research limitations/implications: The wealth of interdisciplinary and intercultural thought and practice can be best "proceduralised" through dialogue-oriented educational technologies. Practical implications: In practical terms, hundreds of students may follow these web-enhanced curricula that are based on the materialised results of their founders' ethical systems. Originality/value: This is the first paper that outlines the Global Studies curriculum at Graz University. (Contains 2 tables and 11 figures.)

AB  - For the past five summers, the authors have taught summer school to recent immigrants and refugees. Their experiences with these fourth-grade English language learners (ELL) have taught them the value of using models to build scientific and mathematical concepts. In this article, they describe the use of different forms of 2- and 3-D models to show students how, when, and why scientists and mathematicians use models. In addition, they capitalize on how models can enhance the use of discipline-specific language. The language of science goes beyond natural language (oral and written). To make meaning in science, they also make use of "mathematical relationships, visual representations, and manual-technical operations" (Lemke 2004, p. 38). Although teachers may use models as tools for learning, they may not as often see their use as tools for expressing understanding. The use of models for expressing meaning is particularly helpful when working with ELL students. (Contains 6 figures and 1 online resource.)

AB  - According to Carl Sagan (1987), "Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge." Field studies and undergraduate research provide students with the best opportunities for "thinking" about science, while at the same time acquiring a body of knowledge. Natural History of Tropical Carbonate Ecosystems is a spring semester course cross-listed in biology, geology, and environmental studies, with a prerequisite of two semesters of introductory biology, geology, or environmental science. The purpose of the course is to provide from these three discipline areas an introduction to the unique ecology and geology of tropical-marine ecosystems with an emphasis on the Bahamas, including additional opportunities to investigate problems of human impact on tropical island marine and non-marine ecosystems and island karst hydrologic systems.

AB  - Nanoscience and Technology (NST) have revolutionized the world. It has led to many innovations since it entered our lives. Meanwhile, the number and quality of people trained in this field gained importance. Currently, initiatives are being taken to integrate this field into the primary education curriculum in many countries. This study focuses on integrating NST into the curriculum as a primary education topic. In this context, meta-synthesis research was used. First, developed countries' well-known initiatives on adapting NST to the curriculum will be discussed in the paper. Then, the works on NST in the literature, especially experimental ones, will be addressed. Finally, based on the results, some suggestions will be made for creating a curriculum in this field. Although there are differences in countries' curriculums, the basic knowledge necessary for education in this field is also outlined.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to establish the unity between the missions of the Family and Consumer Sciences (FCS) discipline and Catholic higher education by demonstrating relationships among (a) Catholic Social Teaching (CST) and the role of the service principle to FCS; (b) Catholic Intellectual Tradition (CIT) and the centrality of intellect to FCS; and (c) the institutional charism and the shared calling of FCS professionals, exemplified by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, sponsors of Fontbonne University. Key philosophical and foundational FCS papers along with documents pertaining to the principles of CST, CIT, and the charisms of the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent De Paul, and the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet were examined and shared meanings were identified; institutional mission statements from respective sponsored institutions were likewise compared. The review process permitted a very pointed comparison between the disciplinary and institutional missions, substantiating the congruity between the two. The parity between professional and Catholic institutional missions outlined in this paper suggests that the longevity of FCS programs could be fostered by taking root in Catholic institutions.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate links among experiences commonly associated with strategies and experiences of surface versus deep learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses, STEM school graduates' (n = 3,526) reported level of college readiness, and eventual completion of university degrees in a STEM discipline. Using logistic regression analysis, we identified 4 variables linked to reported feelings of college readiness of graduates of specialized STEM high schools and their reported undergraduate degrees. These variables comprised: (a) the level of focus on deep conceptual understanding in STEM content, (b) the number of concepts covered in high school STEM classes, (c) the depth of concept coverage, and (d) connections made between STEM concepts and other content areas. Of these 4 variables, some were found to be positively associated with graduates' feelings of college readiness; yet, no variables were associated with earning an undergraduate degree in STEM.

AB  - It is commonly believed that self-report, survey-based instruments can be used to measure a wide range of psychological attributes, such as self-control, growth mindsets, and grit. Increasingly, such instruments are being used not only for basic research but also for supporting decisions regarding educational policy and accountability. The validity of such instruments is typically investigated using a classic set of methods, including the examination of reliability coefficients, factor or principal components analyses, and correlations between scores on the instrument and other variables. However, these techniques may fall short of providing the kinds of rigorous, potentially falsifying tests of relevant hypotheses commonly expected in scientific research. This point is illustrated via a series of studies in which respondents were presented with survey items deliberately constructed to be uninterpretable, but the application of the aforementioned validation procedures nonetheless returned favorable-appearing results. In part, this disconnect may be traceable to the way in which operationalist modes of thinking in the social sciences have reinforced the perception that attributes do not need to be defined independently of particular sets of testing operations. It is argued that affairs might be improved via greater attention to the manner in which definitions of psychological attributes are articulated and greater openness to treating beliefs about the existence and measurability of psychological attributes as hypotheses rather than assumptions--in other words, as beliefs potentially subject to revision.

AB  - The cereal box design activity is intriguing both for its simplicity and the resourcefulness that it can generate in young people. Also, it lends itself to a variety of curriculums. It covers both consumerism and Design for the Environment (DfE) concepts broadly and in depth. The activity introduces a wide range of topics. They include graphic design; basic drawing; sketching and rendering; measurement of area, volume, and weight; technical presentation skills; oral and written reports; the technological design process; applied problem solving; marketing; consumer research; eco-packaging; environmental education; recycling; point-of-purchase displays; and considerations of form, function, and aesthetics. Teachers can easily adapt the activity to serve as an interdisciplinary project throughout the school. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Consideration of a possible use of virtual reality technologies in school contexts requires gathering together the suggestions of many scientific domains aimed at "understanding" the features of these same tools that let them offer valid support to the teaching-learning processes in educational settings. Specifically, the present study is aimed at creating a theoretical framework for the didactic use of VR technologies in schools, highlighting the characteristics of these tools that are supported by a view of teaching that enhances sensorimotor activity in learning. The theoretical approach, through the study of the international scientific literature on this topic, offers interdisciplinary suggestions for realising teaching-learning practices that are supported by scientific principles and a concept of learning that is consistent with the processes that these tools may activate.

AB  - In response to a need to equip youth to become successful contributors to our growing digital economy, educators and researchers are exploring ways to incorporate computational thinking (CT) for all across curricular domains. In this paper, we take a place-based approach to examine how and what CT practices youth learn through designing mobile games in and for their own communities. We conducted three after school workshops with 29 participants (13 female, 16 male, ages 10-16) in a rural city in the Western United States. Youth designed place-based, mobile games to share stories and experiences about local environmental or civic issues using the Augmented Reality and Interactive Storytelling (ARIS) programming platform. We collected and analyzed a range of data including field notes, design artifacts, screencasts, and final reflective interviews. Using Brennan and Resnick (2012) framework for studying and assessing the development of CT, we illustrate how youth engaged with CT practices and how their local topics facilitated their engagement with civic issues beyond the screen. Findings demonstrate how youth can engage with CT practices and their local communities through designing computational artifacts. We discuss implications for how leveraging place-based computational tools afford equitable and accessible CT integration in interdisciplinary contexts.

AB  - On September 21, 2012, two astronomers using a telescope in the International Scientific Observing Network (ISON) near Kislovodsk, Russia, discovered a comet that came to be formally known as C/2012 S1 and was popularly called Comet ISON. Just a year later, two honors instructors in Wichita, Kansas, found themselves teaching a course on Comet ISON that came to be formally known as Fire in the Sky and was popularly referred to as "the comet course." In this article, the authors discuss preliminary considerations for the course, sample topics and approach, and major assignments for the course.

AB  - We describe a unique Research Experience for Undergraduates and Research Experience for Veterinary students summer program at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis on the campus of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. The program focused on interdisciplinary research at the interface of biology and mathematics. Participants were selected to work on projects with a biology mentor and a mathematics mentor in an environment that promoted collaboration outside of the students' respective disciplines. There were four research projects with teams of four participants and two faculty mentors. The participants consisted of a mixture of 10 undergraduates in biology- and mathematics-related disciplines, four veterinary students, and two high-school teachers. The activities included lectures on both the biological and mathematical backgrounds of the projects, tutorials for software, and sessions on ethics, graduate school, and possible career paths for individuals interested in biology and mathematics. The program was designed to give students the ability to actively participate in the scientific research process by working on a project, writing up their results in a final report, and presenting their work orally. We report on the results of our evaluation surveys of the participants. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Although there is considerable activity in developing assessment protocols for undergraduate learning, there are few established models for assessment of student progress in multidisciplinary doctoral-level graduate education. To resolve this impediment in tracking graduate student development, we created a simple assessment tool based on the concept of T competency that allows graduate students to articulate explicit learning goals in disciplinary and multidisciplinary research. Our instrument allows quantitative measurement of a student's self-perception of his/her knowledge and interest in multidisciplinary inquiry. We use our T assessment tool to measure graduate student progress in an NSF IGERT-funded graduate program in coastal ecosystem management. The T model provides us a nomenclature to articulate learning goals, a quantitative means to evaluate current and future learning targets and progress in reaching those targets, and gives us another measure of assessing overall graduate program effectiveness. Our T tool is an instrument that should have considerable utility in measuring knowledge and interest in multidisciplinary research across a range of disciplines and graduate programs.

AB  - Scientific and technological advances, occurring with increasing frequency, allow for exciting opportunities for multidisciplinary research but may be accompanied by unintended consequences for kinesiology. These advances require depth of knowledge in subdisciplines and place pressures on kinesiology departments to hire experts with grants in hand, ready to direct or participate in multidisciplinary research projects on our field's central topic: physical activity. However, we have already observed that large proportions of nonkinesiologists in a department can change the culture of the department, the physical activity research focus, and even the name. Alternatively, departments can use technological advances such as Web 2.0 and "wiki science" to build multidisciplinary research teams with members from other disciplines across the campus or the world.

AB  - The rapid evolution of System-on-Chip (SoC) challenges academic curricula to keep pace with multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary system thinking. This paper presents a curricular prototype that cuts across artificial course boundaries and provides a meaningful exploration of diverse facets of SoC design. Specifically, experimental contents of a digital flow SoC product design--a simplified Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/Internet Protocol (IP) stack--are systematically developed and implemented in the series of courses that comprise the Digital Design track of the Rowan Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) curriculum. The System-on-Chip project and its progressively more complex laboratory modules are described and discussed. Its implementation in the existing ECE curriculum is also presented along with the assessment results. (Contains 9 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - Development of post-secondary curriculum in emerging interdisciplinary fields presents particular challenges in course design and resource utilization, especially when the field is interdisciplinary by nature of its inherent breadth. A new course at the University of Calgary, designed to introduce undergraduate students to the methods and philosophy of Acoustic Ecology--the study of sound and its effects on health, cognition and culture--exemplifies both the challenges and some practical solutions. Following a brief history of the concept and its philosophy, a summary and critique is presented from the first offering of the course as a pilot project. Conclusions drawn include the necessity of an integrative approach to interdisciplinary fields of study that are true "interdisciplines", the utility of experiential fieldwork, and the advantages presented by a student group with diverse academic backgrounds.

AB  - Documenting treatment integrity is an important issue in research and practice in any discipline concerned with prevention and intervention. However, consensus concerning the dimensions of treatment integrity and how they should be measured has yet to emerge. Advances from three areas in which significant treatment integrity work has taken place--psychotherapy, substance abuse treatment, and prevention science--are summarized and integrated with recent advances in treatment integrity in school psychology. Innovations discussed include broadened models of treatment integrity, generic treatment integrity measures that assess common and unique elements of multiple interventions, and experimentally validated strategies for enhancing treatment integrity. Building on innovations across disciplines is one means for advancing treatment integrity technology in educational settings. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Computational thinking is an important and necessary way of thinking for computer programmers and other professionals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Research on emerging practices around computational thinking that is developed through coding initiatives in schools reports that elementary children typically learn how to operate technologies rather than learn how to develop new technologies (Israel, et al., 2015). As a result, students in elementary schools experience only the receiving end of technology (Burke & Kafai, 2014). This lack of production potentially limits the effectiveness of technology integration since early experiences with computational thinking as a means of problem solving in abstract ways has the potential to improve attitudes, engage students, and enhance programing skills (Israel, et al., 2015). Thus, it is important to provide students with early exposure to computational thinking. Yet, with so many apps and so little guidance, it can be difficult to know how to integrate these apps into classroom instruction. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to provide recommendations for teachers, drawn from research, on how to select apps and begin practices that support computational thinking.

AB  - The authors open this article with a description of an incident that happened in 1992, when 28,800 rubber bath toys (i.e., ducks, frogs, turtles, and beavers) fell off a cargo ship in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. In 2009, these rubber bath toys were still washing ashore on beaches all around the world. This science instruction can be used with students in grades 3-5 to promote critical thinking. The story of the rubber bath toys provides an opportunity to make multiple connections to crosscutting concepts and to integrate science (e.g., floating and sinking, decomposition, and human impact on the environment) and social studies (e.g., movement of goods, geography, and human-environment interactions) and environmental education. In addition, it presents students with a meaningful issue with which to examine cause-and-effect relationships and infer ways to mediate environmental problems by addressing a global issue with local action. The students can gain meaningful context on collecting and analyzing data related to the science content of flotation and buoyancy, as well as to think critically about cause-and-effect relationships related to human impact on the environment.

AB  - As much as ever before, mathematics teachers are searching for ways to connect mathematics to real-life scenarios within STEM contexts. As students develop skill in proportional reasoning, they examine graphical representations of linear functions, learn to associate "slope" with "steepness" and rate of change, and develop skill in calculating slopes of lines. Slope and rate of change, however, do not exist only in math class. Engineering applications associated with ramps, staircases, and roller coasters rely on analyses of slope and rate of change. In science class, students learn about velocity and speed, each of which connects to slope and rate of change. Technology can be used to support students as they explore slope and rate of change in these and other contexts. Given these connections, slope is an ideal topic with which to bring STEM into the mathematics classroom. This article presents a series of science- and engineering-related activities addressing rate of change that occurred in a middle-grades public school math class. As students worked through the activities, they developed an understanding of slope and rate of change within STEM contexts. The activities were developed as part of Expeditions in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Education through Mathematics (ESTEEM), a professional development program funded by the Virginia State Department of Education and held at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. The two activities helped develop students' thinking about rate of change and slope within STEM-related contexts. With exposure to hands-on activities like the staircase problem, students come to understand how math can be used to solve problems in engineering. This article presents one example of the many ways that teachers can bring science and engineering connections into math class. As teachers think of these ideas, they need to continue to share them so that we develop not only a mathematically literate but also a STEM-literate citizenry.

AB  - To discuss reflexive practice in relation to epistemic cognition, we posit informed reflexivity as an epistemic virtue that is informed by its particular context and purposes of knowing and action and promotes use of reliable processes to achieve epistemic aims. It involves reasoning about social relationships in which a person is embedded when acting in a specific kind of context--whether academic or real-world--that requires construction, evaluation, and application of knowledge. Informed reflexivity is the learned disposition to reason about one's knowledge-related actions, entailing context-specific epistemic characteristics. It involves an intentional stance about the need to reason about oneself and the context. Discussions of two disciplinary competencies (science and history) and two cross-disciplinary competencies (critical thinking and writing) illustrate how epistemically competent practices instantiate informed reflexivity. Promoting informed reflexivity as an epistemic virtue might dispose students toward reliable processes of knowing and making epistemically informed resolved action appropriate to the context.

AB  - Environmental agencies in most states have an environmental education Web page that can point geography teachers to a variety of opportunities and resources to enhance their teaching. Most states provide linkages to local and national programs such as Project WET and Project WILD, and access to lesson plans and other teaching materials. A number of state agencies have environmental resource centers, teacher workshops, and grant programs for field trips and class projects. A few states have workshops that provide graduate academic credit and special certification. Much of the content of these programs contributes to fundamental geographic education themes as specified in the 1983 "Guidelines in Geographic Education K-12" and "Geography for Life: National Geography Standards 1994".

AB  - Debate about the definition of a "child" occurs in multi-disciplinary contexts, most recently located in the new sociology of childhood where social constructionism is the dominant discourse. Given that the child's voice has become an increasingly valued component of research, this paper reports on one aspect of a study which explored how 7-11-year-olds (N = 56) defined and understood the concept of "a child". Data were categorised into four types: physical, behavioural, lifestyle and criteria-referenced descriptors. Dominant theoretical elements such as agency, social construction, relational understanding and notions of themselves as beings were evident in the children's responses. However, the importance of the biological and developmental bases of childhood and their sense of becoming adults were stronger than is sometimes acknowledged in the literature. The implications for education of these two digressions from contemporary theoretical discourse are considered in light of the Cambridge Primary Review which calls for a reshaping of primary education and initial teacher training in England to include childhood as a central concept.

AB  - The overall goal of the Swiss Virtual Campus project Dealing with Natural Hazards and Risk (NAHRIS) is to create a common educational course program that compiles the most recent knowledge in the field of natural hazards and risk management. Several higher education institutes from all parts of Switzerland were involved in the realization of this Internet course platform presenting a total of 87 learning units available online at www.nahris.ch. NAHRIS is primarily targeted at university students at the bachelor of science level. The main novelty of NAHRIS lies in the holistic examination of the natural hazard and risk management domain including technical, environmental and social aspects. Therefore, it enjoys growing popularity among researchers and practitioners employed in these working areas. (Contains 6 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - It is widely acknowledged that multimodal digital texts support student engagement with ideas, knowledge and new forms of literate practice. With this in mind, an interdisciplinary team at The University of Melbourne collaborated to create a digital resource--"The Venom Patrol" website--to teach scientific concepts about Australia's venomous animals to middle years students (Years 5-9). The website's development was a response to students' increasing use of digital texts and technologies, and the need to develop students' skills around being "multiliterate". An inquiry-based pedagogy sought to encourage interactive learning and to enhance student development of scientific literacy. This article reports the findings of a pilot study that investigated student and teacher responses to the functionality and appropriateness of the digital resource for teaching scientific literacy, and for engaging students with the science-based content. The study revealed different teacher approaches to using the digital resource in the classroom, with varying levels of success. It also found the students to be critical and insightful users of digital texts who welcomed both the choices offered by the non-linear structure of the resource and the opportunity this research afforded for their voices to be heard around texts and contexts for learning.

AB  - Undergraduate engineering education must train students to not only solve design challenges that transcend disciplinary boundaries, but also communicate, transfer knowledge, and collaborate across technical and non-technical boundaries. One approach to achieving this goal is teaching bio-inspired design (BID) in an engineering curriculum. In teaching bio-inspired design, the Concept-Knowledge (C-K) theory is a well-established approach for integrating multiple domains of information and facilitating innovation through connection building. For the purposes of evaluating the benefits of using C-K theory and their application to design innovation, students in sophomore engineering are assigned a design project using C-K theory template. This paper discusses the adoption of Concept-Knowledge (C-K) theory template for student's use in sophomore design course at both the University of Georgia, Athens (UGA) and the James Madison University (JMU) for design innovation in undergraduate engineering curriculum. Statistical analysis of student's work based on the C-K theory template was carried out to investigate the relationship to design innovation. The results obtained are presented and discussed. Results from the analysis suggest that the C-K theory based approach improved students abilities to design and develop innovative solutions.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to first define the "jet principle" of (e-)learning as providing dynamically suitable framework conditions for enhanced learning procedures that combine views from multiple cultures of science. Second it applies this principle to the case of the "Global Studies" curriculum, a unique interdisciplinary curriculum at Graz University in Austria that is targeted to multicultural and developmental learning among students from diverse ethnic and disciplinary backgrounds. Design/methodology/approach: Social and learning procedures are heuristically analysed based on ten years of interdisciplinary experience in interdisciplinary learning settings in a multicultural environment with critical approach to globalisation, while also diverse scientific disciplines are counted as "cultures of understanding". Findings: The outcomes of the analysis suggest that the negation-oriented web-supported five-level learning suite "Surfing Global Change" (SGC) is capable of providing helpful framework conditions to multicultural learning that can suitably be applied in the "Global Studies" curriculum as well as in other similar international curricula. Research limitations/implications: Quality criteria are subject to scientific cultures and hence differ from discipline to discipline; thus representing continuous challenge for suitable perception of actors and bystanders. Practical implications: Complexities of cultural diversity are reflected also by complexities caused by origins in diverse scientific cultures. For constructing thorough and practically implementable consensus solutions, dialogic processes and peer review are best mediated through web-based discussion, for which this paper provides examples. Discourse-oriented features and amendments for curricula of "Global Studies" are presented. Social implications: Networking among multicultural and interdisciplinary curricula with a critical stance towards globalisation is facilitated through suggestions in this paper. Originality/value: By offering a new type of graphic notation for learning procedures, this paper facilitates new perspectives on the intrinsic dynamics of learning, adoption of new standpoints and acquiring a 360 degree view of the institutional landscape and interest patterns in complex multi-stakeholder issues such as globalisation.

AB  - This article applies the perspective of "boundary work," an approach originating in science studies, to relations between the disciplines of Second Language Writing (SLW) and rhetoric and composition (R&C), especially to controversies surrounding the concept of translingualism. Boundaries both separate and connect, a dual potential to exacerbate tensions or to create opportunities for cooperation. Translingualism has sometimes been regarded by R&C as a radical innovation and by SLW as a distracting novelty, but a closer exploration shows both common historical roots and shared contemporaneous parallels in disciplines such as applied linguistics and second language acquisition. For WAC/WID, the translingual challenge may lead to a deconstruction of the L1/L2 binary and to the further rhetorization of correctness, as we find ways to help faculty help students negotiate language choices within a context of acceptance of their full linguistic repertoire and empowerment of their writerly choices.

AB  - We report the qualitative and quantitative results of incorporating interdisciplinary application projects and increasing the use of teaching with technology into Calculus I, II and III at the University of Colorado Denver. Minimal changes were made to the curriculum and minimal time was required of instructors to make the changes. Instructors were given one 3-hour introduction to teaching with technology, a 3-hour introduction to one or two interdisciplinary problems to be used in the class, and course instructors met with each other no more than 1 hour per week. To evaluate the effectiveness of these modifications, 24 students were interviewed four times during a 2 year time span, student comments from student evaluations regarding the application projects were recorded, and the grade-point averages (GPAs) of four groups of 40 students for the year following their completion of Calculus III were analysed. The results show that students' enthusiasm and interest in interdisciplinary application projects were greater when the projects were enthusiastically endorsed by the instructor, but even with mixed instructor enthusiasm, incorporating application projects and increasing the use of technology in the classroom increase the well-roundedness of students' education and increase their performance in more advanced courses as measured by their overall GPA for the year following their Calculus III math class.

AB  - Politics courses embedded in business and commerce degree programs have soared in number in recent years. Yet how business students, often compulsorily enrolled in politics courses, learn key politics concepts is an under-researched area. The purpose of this article is to determine where the teaching and learning of political science and business intersects. This research reviews the place of the "threshold concept" in student learning, with particular reference to "power" as a political concept. This article advances three arguments: that the study of political institutions involves a series of "threshold" concepts that students must pass over before moving onto a higher plane of understanding; that the teaching of political institutions should span the three key areas of knowledge, attitudes and skills; and that a real understanding of political institutions allows students to regard business figures, in pursuing self-interest, as "political" actors like any other.

AB  - Cross-cultural education is thought to develop critical consciousness of how unequal distributions of power and privilege affect people's health. Learners in different sociopolitical settings can join together in developing critical consciousness--awareness of power and privilege dynamics in society--by means of communication technology. The aim of this research was to define strengths and limitations of existing cross-cultural discussions in generating critical consciousness. The setting was the FAIMER international fellowship program for mid-career interdisciplinary health faculty, whose goal is to foster global advancement of health professions education. Fellows take part in participant-led, online, written, task-focused discussions on topics like professionalism, community health, and leadership. We reflexively identified text that brought sociopolitical topics into the online environment during the years 2011 and 2012 and used a discourse analysis toolset to make our content analysis relevant to critical consciousness. While references to participants' cultures and backgrounds were infrequent, narratives of political-, gender-, religion-, and other culture-related topics did emerge. When participants gave accounts of their experiences and exchanged cross-cultural stories, they were more likely to develop ad hoc networks to support one another in facing those issues than explore issues relating to the development of critical consciousness. We suggest that cross-cultural discussions need to be facilitated actively to transform learners' frames of reference, create critical consciousness, and develop cultural competence. Further research is needed into how to provide a safe environment for such learning and provide faculty development for the skills needed to facilitate these exchanges.

AB  - To promote social consciousness and a sense of responsibility, educational proposals organised around the principles of technology-enhanced project-based language learning (Dooly & Sadler, 2016) should engage students in a process of reflecting upon and responding to crucial social issues. Thus, in this paper we will present a project carried out by two groups of primary education students who launched a solidarity campaign to collect money for four Syrian children living in a refugee camp in Greece. The project was implemented in a cross-disciplinary Arts and Crafts class taught through English and resulted in significant outputs in English (those addressed to the Syrian children) and in Catalan (those targeted at the local community). First, we outline the student-led project and then we analyse some fragments of student plurilingual practices during the project development that demonstrate their learning gains. Our findings reveal that our meaningful contextualised cross-disciplinary project favoured the natural integration of multiple skills, competences, and field knowledge form various disciplines while promoting a sense of social consciousness and empathy. First, it enabled children to put their plurilingual competence into play and take decisions regarding language choices to meet particular communicative objectives. Second, it contributed to the acquisition of 21st century knowledge, competence, and skills, while helping the learners gain social values. Third, it engaged learners in processes of problem solving, decision making and creative thinking that lead to the development of entrepreneurial competencies. To conclude we argue that when young learners are given responsibilities and opportunities to take up socially relevant challenges learning becomes meaningful for them and those around them.

AB  - Background: The philosophical underpinnings of evaluation guidelines set forth by a funding agency can sometimes seem inconsistent with that of the intervention. Purpose: Our purpose is to introduce questions pertaining to the contrast between the instructional program's underlying philosophical beliefs and assumptions and those underlying our evaluation approach. Drawing heavily on Scriven, we discuss these from a pragmatist evaluation stance in light of issues defined by Lincoln and Guba (2000). The discussion is couched in the evaluation of an innovative approach to teaching computer science. Setting: Auburn University, Auburn, AL Intervention: The evaluation is designed to investigate the effects of a studio-based teaching approach in computer science education. The evaluation framework employs a rigorous design that seeks to provide evidence to support or refute some assumed truth about the object (or construct) investigated. The program evaluated is steeped in a constructivist framework which assumes that no universal truth or reality exists, but rather, is constructed by the individual. Research Design: Our evaluation design, to a good extent, reflects a post-positivist, quasi-experimental position. We also include a qualitative component using student interviews. Data Collection and Analysis: Evidence of the effectiveness of the instructional approach for learning is assessed quantitatively using pre- and post-test and pre- and post-survey data group comparisons (mixed design ANOVA). Interviews provide the basis for qualitative theme analysis. Findings: Quantitative results were somewhat weak but consistent in support of the studio-based teaching. Interview data suggest that most students did find working in groups enjoyable and a valuable experience. (Contains 6 tables.)

AB  - This guidance report aims to help secondary schools improve literacy in all subject areas. It provides seven recommendations related to reading, writing, talk, vocabulary development and supporting struggling students. Throughout the report, recommendations emphasise the importance of disciplinary literacy. Disciplinary literacy is an approach to improving literacy across the curriculum. It recognises that literacy skills are both general and subject specific, emphasising the value of supporting teachers in every subject to teach students how to read, write and communicate effectively in their subjects. This guidance challenges the notion that literacy in secondary school is solely the preserve of English teachers, or literacy coordinators. The emphasis on disciplinary literacy makes clear that every teacher communicates their subject through academic language, and that reading, writing, speaking and listening are at the heart of knowing and doing Science, Art, History, and every other subject in secondary school. [For the three other companion reports in this series, see Improving Literacy in Key Stage 1 (ED612212); Improving Literacy in Key Stage 2 (ED612216); and Preparing for Literacy: Improving Communication, Language and Literacy in the Early Years (ED612218). For three related evidence reviews, see Writing Approaches in Years 3 to 13 (ED612219); Literacy Development (ED612220); and Reading Programmes for Secondary Students (ED612242).]

AB  - Recent publications have elevated the priority of increasing the integration of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) content for K-12 education. The STEM education community must invest in the development of valid and reliable to scales to measure STEM content, knowledge fusion, and perceptions of the nature of STEM. This brief report discusses the development of an instrument to measure student perceptions of the interdependent nature of STEM content knowledge in the context of a complex classroom intervention implemented in five Colorado high schools (N = 275). Specifically, cross-functional science, technology, engineering, and mathematics teams of high school students were formed to complete engineering design problems. Exploratory (pretest) and confirmatory (posttest) factor analyses indicated that a newly adapted scale to measure student perceptions of the interdependent nature of STEM content knowledge had possessed adequate model fit. Furthermore, analysis revealed a novel pattern of results for the intervention. Specifically, students with initially high perceptions of the interdependent nature of STEM sustained their high perceptions at posttest; however, students with initially low perceptions exhibited statistically significantly positive gains from pretest to posttest. Therefore, this intervention may work best with students who are at risk of losing interest in STEM disciplines. The implications of these research findings are discussed.

AB  - Over the last few years, WTAMU Mathematics, Engineering and Science faculty has used interdisciplinary projects as the basis for implementation of a linked-class approach to Problem-Based Learning (PBL). A project that has significant relevance to engineering statics, fluid mechanics, and calculus is the Hydrostatic Pressure Project. This project was developed by faculty associated with the NSF-funded INCRSE project, Increasing Numbers and Connections in Science, Math, and Engineering, for application of the linked-class PBL to calculus II and engineering statics. The students in the linked classes were to predict the horizontal force and the vertical force on a submerged surface and determine the appropriate locations of these forces in order to experimentally verify the calculations. They worked in groups to outline their procedures, develop their functional relations, record experimental data, and report on their findings. Assessment efforts have focused on student laboratory reports and student perceptions about their learning and experiences with this linked-class PBL project collected through surveys and focus groups. In all the surveys and focus groups conducted with students who had participated in the Hydrostatic Pressure Project, all of the students felt their experience was beneficial and had enhanced their understanding and applications of engineering and mathematics.

AB  - In this paper, we focus on the efforts of educators at nine different research sites within the United States, funded by a grant from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), to develop and implement innovative, interdisciplinary curriculum on the relationship of the environment and human health. The NIEHS correctly maintained that the interdisciplinary nature of learning about environmental health would improve students' learning across several subject areas and should, therefore, contribute to students scoring higher on state's subject area based standardized tests. However, these goals were undermined by state polices linking standardized tests with student promotion and graduation, and the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) that required public schools and districts to aggregate test scores which might have negative consequences, such as reducing school funding or privatizing school administration and state policies. These policies resulted in deleterious effects that undermined implementing environmental health curricula. (Contains 4 notes.)

AB  - In today's organizations team work has become an integral part of the day-to-day routine. For this reason, University professors are including group projects in many courses. In such group assessments, we advocate the use of interdisciplinary teams, where possible. As a case study, we report an interdisciplinary group technical project with members from a Master of Business Administration course and a Master of Science in Accounting course. We also describe the refinements made to the course in order to enhance the collaboration between students from two classes.

AB  - This paper describes the design and development process used to create Alien Rescue, a multimedia-enhanced learning environment that supports problem-based learning (PBL) in middle school science. The goal of the project is to further our understandings of technology, pedagogy, and instructional theories as they relate to the application of PBL within middle school classrooms through the application of design-based research. A unique characteristic of the project is that it is developed entirely by a team of graduate learning technologies students, working under the direction and supervision of the faculty. Throughout the development process, graduate student developers learn steps and strategies for designing immersive learning environments, engage in technology development, and conduct research that informs future design iterations. Key features of the development model are described in detail and developers' reflections are shared. Recommendations for those interested in engaging similar endeavors are provided.

AB  - A random sample of language arts, social studies, science, and math high school teachers from across the United States were surveyed about their use of writing to support student learning. Four out of every five teachers reported they used writing to support student learning, applying on average 24 different writing activities across the school year, with nine activities applied by at least one-half of the teachers once a month or more often. Teachers' responses, however, raised several concerns. One, a majority of teachers indicted they did not receive adequate preservice or inservice preparation on how to use writing to support learning (this issue was especially acute for science and math teachers). Two, many of the nine most commonly applied writing to learn activities involved little or no analysis, interpretation, or personalization of information to be learned. Three, use of writing activities involving the use of digital tools, report writing, and written arguments were infrequent. Such activities are stressed by the Common Core State Standards. Four, when respondents taught students how to apply writing to learn activities, they only used effective teaching practices slightly more than one half of the time (math teachers did this even less often). We further found that use of writing to support learning was related to teachers' preparation to apply such strategies, perceptions of capabilities to teach and use these tools, and percent of below average students in the class.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to understand one case of undergraduate inquiry-based instruction through the words and actions of students and instructors. The data sources included fieldnotes from 16 of 29 classes, two sets of student and instructor interviews (beginning and end of the semester), and a collection of artifacts, such as the laboratory manual, lecture handouts, and the course syllabus. The participants for this study included four faculty instructors and two purposively selected student groups, totaling eight students. We found the instructors' two course goals, (a) teaching students how scientists do science and (b) using an interdisciplinary approach to develop students' content knowledge of the big ideas in science, were consistent with our observations and the students' descriptions of their experience in the course. However, we observed, and the students also noted, an important feature of the course that the instructors did not describe as a course goal was its reliance on the social nature of learning. This telling case demonstrates that inquiry-based instruction is achievable in undergraduate science education. Implications are discussed for college science instructors interested in inquiry teaching.

AB  - Educators deal with the many dynamic functions and applications of the human brain on a daily basis. The theoretical research of the biology and functionality of the human brain is on the rise, and educational publishers continue to support books and scholarly articles that promote the notion that "brain research" can and should be applied to classroom teaching. Key terms such as "brain-differentiated learning, brain-compatible learning, brain-friendly learning, and brain-based teaching" have been used to lure educators to adopt these theoretically supported teaching strategies. Much of the literature on brain research deals with explaining the memory systems of the brain, or more specifically how the brain works to retain and retrieve bits of information. The idea that applying this knowledge base to educational psychology to yield positive outcomes in the teaching and learning process sounds promising, however, there is a lack of empirical research conducted in K-12 classrooms to support the positive results of applying brain research to teaching practices. So, the question arises: Have educators and proponents of brain research assumed all too quickly that brain-informed teaching strategies will yield consistent positive results? Our study offers empirical evidence which helps answer this question. This empirical study has investigated how information about human memory from the field of cognitive psychology can be applied specifically to teaching Spanish vocabulary in high school classrooms. Our interdisciplinary study brought together the fields of cognitive and educational psychology along with foreign language teaching in order to understand better how research on human memory can improve teaching vocabulary in high school Spanish classes.

AB  - Taste perception was the focus of an undergraduate course in the health sciences that bridged the sciences and humanities. A problem-based learning approach was used to study the biological issues, whereas the cultural transmutations of these molecular mechanisms were explored using a variety of resources (novels, cookbooks, and films). Multiple evaluation procedures were used: problem summaries and problem-solving exercises (tripartite problem-solving exercise) for the problem-based learning component and group tasks and individual exercises for the cultural issues. Self-selected groups chose specific tasks from a prescribed list of options (setting up a journal in molecular gastronomy, developing an electronic tongue, designing a restaurant for synesthetes, organizing a farmers' market, marketing a culinary tour, framing hedonic scales, exploring changing tastes through works of art or recipe books, and crafting beers for space travel). Individual tasks were selected from a menu of options (book reviews, film reviews, conversations, creative writing, and oral exams). A few guest lecturers (wine making, cultural anthropology, film analysis, and nutritional epidemiology) added more flavor. The course was rated highly for its learning value (8.5 Â± 1.2, n = 62) and helped students relate biological mechanisms to cultural issues (9.0 Â± 0.9, n = 62).

AB  - This research draws on developments in educational research where "learning progressions" are emerging as a strategy for synthesizing research on science learning and applying that research to policy and practice, and advances in the natural sciences, where "interdisciplinary research on coupled human and natural systems" has become increasingly important. It focuses on the human systems that supply all of our essential goods and services (i.e., food, water, transportation), which begin and end in the earth's natural systems. In order to investigate what students know about how human actions affect environmental systems, we developed assessments focusing on "supply and waste disposal chains". In addition, students were asked about a major environmental issue--global warming. Assessments were administered to elementary, middle, and high school students from rural, suburban, and urban schools. Results from this study provide insight into how student knowledge of connections between human-engineered and natural systems varies across grade level and context, which is essential if we are to teach students to be responsible citizens and stewards of our environment.

AB  - Over the last decades more and more research has analysed relatively new or rediscovered teaching-learning concepts like blended, hybrid, multi-sensory or technologically enhanced learning. This increased interest in these educational forms can be explained by new exciting discoveries in brain research and cognitive psychology, as well as by the accelerated integration of technology (computers, intranets, internet, etc.) in education. We have investigated how the educationally valuable outcomes of these trends could be implemented in computer-programming education and in what ways this process could be catalysed by arts (dance, music, rhythm, theatrical role-playing). We present a theoretical basis for technologically and artistically enhanced multi-sensory teaching-learning strategies. This work focuses particularly on how dance can be involved in computer science classes. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - This work presents an approach that integrates the preparation of a coordination compound, potassium tris- (oxalato)ferrate(III), with its photochemical behavior and provides a possible application, the printing of a photograph using the cyanotype technique. Through this experiment, students can be taught several concepts that occur in a coordination chemistry course, including the thermodynamic aspects of forming a compound, its photochemistry, the detection of its photoproducts, and the observation of the formation of a new compound and the resulting intervalence band, which generates the blue print.

AB  - While online instructors may be versed in conducting e-Research (Hung, 2012; Thelwall, 2009), today's faculty are probably less familiarized with the rapidly advancing fields of bibliometrics and informetrics. One key feature of research in these areas is Citation Analysis, a rather intricate operational feature available in modern indexes such as Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO. This paper reviews the recent extant research on bibliometrics within the context of citation analysis. Particular focus is on empirical studies, review essays, and critical commentaries on citation-based metrics across interdisciplinary academic areas. Research that relates to the interface between citation analysis and applications in higher education is discussed. Some of the attributes and limitations of citation operations of contemporary databases that offer citation searching or cited reference data are presented. This review concludes that: a) citation-based results can vary largely and contingent on academic discipline or specialty area, b) databases, that offer citation options, rely on idiosyncratic  methods, coverage, and transparency of functions, c) despite initial concerns, research from open access journals is being cited in traditional periodicals, and d) the field of bibliometrics is rather perplex with regard to functionality and research is advancing at an exponential pace. Based on these findings, online instructors would be well served to stay abreast of developments in the field.

AB  - The success of interdisciplinary research teams depends largely upon skills related to team performance. We evaluated student and team performance for undergraduate biology and mathematics students who participated in summer research projects conducted in off-campus laboratories. The student teams were composed of a student with a mathematics background and an experimentally oriented biology student. The team mentors typically ranked the students' performance very good to excellent over a range of attributes that included creativity and ability to conduct independent research. However, the research teams experienced problems meeting prespecified deadlines due to poor time and project management skills. Because time and project management skills can be readily taught and moreover typically reflect good research practices, simple modifications should be made to undergraduate curricula so that the promise of initiatives, such as MATH-BIO 2010, can be implemented.

AB  - When the author writes, her intention is to inform readers and to invite debate and discussion (or at least individual reflection) that continues after the work has been read and put aside. As a scientist with an interest in education, the author now feels able to submit some writings to a non-science educational journal, such as "Teaching in Higher Education," in order to contribute to debates on educational topics, but it has been a long journey to reach this point. She believes her experiences may resonate with others who have come to educational research from different disciplines and contribute to discussions of how this journey might be made easier for later travellers. The author was motivated to contribute this piece after reading the articles by Harland (2009) and Rowland (2009) regarding the nature of research and researchers into Higher Education (HE) as readers of and contributors to "Teaching in Higher Education." These articles contribute to the debate on the role and publication of practitioner research within HE; and on reflection on her own history, the author feels the viewpoint of a practitioner researcher wishing to make a contribution to the wider picture is relevant to this debate. Rowland points out that few contributors to "Teaching in Higher Education" write about their identity, and in this spirit the author offers some thoughts about the difficulty of trying to belong to two communities of practice (Wenger 1999)--that of her discipline and that of a practitioner researcher in HE.

AB  - Over the past 10 years, there has been a technical revolution in the life sciences leading to the emergence of a new discipline called bioinformatics. In response, bioinformatics-related topics have been incorporated into various undergraduate courses along with the development of new courses solely focused on bioinformatics. This report describes the design and implementation of an interdepartmental bioinformatics program throughout several life science programs. Using elements of the backward curricular design process, nine faculty members from the Biology, Microbiology, and Chemistry Departments at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse incorporated bioinformatics in a coordinated manner into 10 courses. Key molecular biology concepts were first identified followed by development of bioinformatics exercises that centered on these concepts. An overview of how the program was constructed and implemented and a summary of the exercises that were designed will be presented.

AB  - In response to changing federal priorities, much discussion has taken place recently about the need for graduate education programs to firmly embrace interdisciplinary research, or "interdisciplinary integration across related fields" (National Research Council, 2004, p. 6). The related fields usually are understood to be certain social and behavioral sciences. From the perspective of the humanities, the author challenges an emerging view, widely regarded as commonsensical, about the proper nature of interdisciplinarity in education and what  counts as good education research (Hostetler, 2005). He devotes particular attention to the problem of determining and distinguishing ends and means and the dangers of narrowness, and provides examples of the value of the humanities to education research.

AB  - Constructing academic genealogies involves the practice of creating family trees based on doctoral advisors, that is, the advisor-graduate student relationship replaces the father-son relationship. Forestry academic genealogies document the historical development of forestry and quantify the contributions of other disciplines. In this study, the authors researched the academic genealogies of all the tenured faculty members in the Forestry Department at Virginia Tech. The resulting academic genealogies included 122 individuals and individual family trees varied in length from 19 generations spanning 360 years to two generations spanning 8 years. The interdisciplinary history of forestry was demonstrated by the high number of non-forestry doctorates earned and the genealogies included individuals trained in agricultural economics, agronomy, botany, civil engineering, ecology, environmental engineering, environmental science, chemistry, economics, horticulture, medicine, plant physiology, political science, recreation, and soils. In contrast to academic genealogies from other disciplines, most early American forestry programs hired faculty members who lacked doctorates, instead of hiring European-trained foresters, and these gentlemen went on to train doctoral students and develop forestry research programs, even though they lacked doctorates themselves.

AB  - A case study of an exemplary third grade teacher's use of the outdoor classroom for meeting both state science and language arts standards is described. Data from the researcher's field journal, teacher lesson plans, and teacher interviews document how this teacher used nature-study to bridge outdoor classroom experiences with the state science and language arts curriculum. This teacher's early life experiences supported her strong interest in science and nature in the outdoors and experiencing it with her children. Children interacted with the outdoor classroom throughout the day as a context for science and literacy learning. All but one child successfully met Annual Yearly Progress (AYP) goals in reading at the end of the school year.

AB  - This article offers food for thought on a strategy used by seven faculty to enhance students' integrative learning by offering cross-course, cross-disciplinary projects and shared activities focused on food. The faculty teach a cluster of ten courses in natural sciences, health sciences, social sciences and humanities that address food themes. Assessment data illustrate the learning gains by students enrolled in the clustered courses and points to limitations of the strategy as well. The evaluation of the strategy includes a discussion of the costs and benefits of the effort from the perspective of the teaching faculty. (Contains 9 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - This paper presents Part I of a two-part study. This first part reviews the literature of transfer of learning as one of the major goals of instruction. Transfer refers to students' ability to apply knowledge and skills in new learning contexts. The literature suggests partially or non-overlapping definitions, and empirical studies on transfer often lack sufficient theoretical background. The goal of this first study is twofold: (a) narrowing the gap between theoretical and empirical aspects of transfer skills, and (b) designing a theoretically-founded transfer framework that can be applied to research and practice in education. The framework was then investigated in the field of chemical education and will be further discussed in Part II. A comprehensive literature search resulted in 664 papers being identified for review. Papers in which transfer was a secondary issue were filtered out. Afterwards, we formulated a theoretical transfer framework that distinguishes between near and far transfer. The framework consists of three attributes: task distance, interdisciplinarity, and skills set. Our study contributes to the body of literature of transfer at several levels. At the theoretical level, we have pointed out commonalities and differences between the various current transfer definitions and proposed a three-attribute transfer framework. Part two will focus on the empirical-application level, showing the interplay between specific learning environments and their effect on students' transfer skills with emphasis on chemical education. These contributions help narrow gaps between the theory of transfer and empirical research.

AB  - The author's specialization as a Christian theologian is in the combined area of morality and spirituality. The focus of his teaching and research has been in the areas of bioethics; the theology of sexuality, marriage, and the family; and Christian spirituality. In his research he came across several authors who advocated some positions different than his own and referred to certain findings of neuroscience to support their positions. Not wanting to simply dismiss what these authors said led him to a deeper exploration of neuroscience and its relevance to his work as a Christian theologian. With the help of a neuroscientist and professor at another academic institution in Edmonton, the author developed an interdisciplinary course in the area of neuroscience and Christian theology, and received a Templeton award for the development of such new science and religion courses. Learning more about neuroscience has helped him to appreciate better the need for a holistic and balanced anthropology as a foundation for approaching moral, spiritual, and educational issues. Among other things, it has helped him to appreciate better human nature as embodied persons. In this article, the author outlines some of the contributions of neuroscience, philosophy, and Christian theology. Together they can help individuals to have a fuller understanding of human experience and the human person, than each by itself. (Contains 3 footnotes.)

AB  - In this essay, we tell the story of how a team of English and nursing professors came together to develop curriculum for a mandatory first-semester writing course in the collaborative Bachelor of Science, Nursing (BScN) at Fanshawe College and Western University, both in London, Ontario. The discussion focuses on the implementation of the course at the Fanshawe site. Following a review of literature that has informed our thinking about writing in nursing, we discuss how the team, consisting of both English/writing and nursing faculty, solved curriculum problems to develop an effective course. We also look forward to areas for future development.

AB  - iSMART (Integration of Science, Mathematics, and Reflective Teaching) Program is an online science and mathematics integrated graduate program for middle school teachers across the state of Texas. As part of a large design-based research project, this paper describes the initial stages of the design process of the iSMART program for its first cohort in the fall of 2010 with a focus on program development. The paper begins with our theoretical perspective and rationale for our use of design-based research methodology. We then provide a review of literature on the integration of science and mathematics and the design of online learning environments. Next, we report on the decisions made by science and mathematics teacher educators in the early process of iSMART design as well as the online design components. Finally, we provide our plan for the continuous implementation and redesign of the program with the first cohort of 25 iSMART teachers. (Contains 1 figure and 3 tables.)

AB  - Molecular biology is a difficult comprehension subject due to its high complexity, thus requiring new teaching approaches. Herein, we developed an interdisciplinary board game involving the human immune system response against a bacterial infection for teaching molecular biology at high school. Initially, we created a database with several questions and a game story that invites the students for helping the human immunological system to produce antibodies (IgG) and fight back a pathogenic bacterium second-time invasion. The game involves answering questions completing the game board in which the antibodies "are synthesized" through the molecular biology process. At the end, a problem-based learning approach is used, and a last question is raised about proteins. Biology teachers and high school students evaluated the game and considered it an easy and interesting tool for teaching the theme. An increase of about 5-30% in answering molecular biology questions revealed that the game improves learning and induced a more engaged and proactive learning profile in the high school students.

AB  - Two of the most influential works of the Western nineteenth century were completed in 1859: Charles Darwin's "The Origin of Species" and Richard Wagner's opera "Tristan and Isolde." Although created within very different cultural traditions, these works show some striking similarities: both brought about a critical, long-lasting debate and caused conflicting reactions after their publications, and both had fundamental and compelling impact on their disciplines. In this article, the author focuses on the following questions: (1) How is the idea of evolution expressed in "The Origin of Species" and "Tristan and Isolde"? (2) What are common essences of that which Darwin referred to as "descent with modifications" and Wagner to as "becoming" ("das Werden")? (3) What educational potential exists for exploring and understanding evolution when comparing its historical emergences in biology and music? Using a phenomenological approach, the author aims to survey, describe, and compare significant parallels between the two works. He expands the comparison of the two works to considerations of how teachers can facilitate students' meaningful learning of evolution and which joint role art and science might play.

AB  - This study examined how a group of ten middle school teachers implemented a technology enriched problem-based learning (PBL) environment. The goal was to understand their motivation, document their implementation techniques, and identify factors that teachers considered important in using technology-based PBL tools in their teaching. The analysis identified four factors that provided the impetus for teachers to consider the adoption of technology-based PBL instruction. These factors are (1) the PBL program addresses the teachers' curricular needs and implementing it has campus administrative and technical support, (2) the method is aligned with teachers' pedagogical beliefs, (3) the PBL program offers a new way of teaching and promotes the development of higher-order thinking skills, and (4) the PBL program challenges students in a captivating manner and supports the learning needs of all students. Teachers' implementation techniques with over 1,000 sixth graders were documented in detail with regard to: 1) the teacher's roles, 2) the student's role, and 3) the classroom interactions during the implementation of the PBL program. In addition, a detailed description of contrasting narratives of two pairs of teachers is provided, illustrating the range of implementation techniques that can occur using the same PBL program to allow for individualized instruction to meet different students' needs. The goal of providing detailed implementation practices is to address the lack of "how to" in PBL implementation in K-12 classrooms as indicated in the literature and offer insights and ideas to those interested in adopting and implementing PBL. Findings are discussed within the theoretical framework and implications are provided.

AB  - This study examined relationships between important aspects of a university education and the assessment and development of generic skills. A sample of 323 students enrolled in single or double arts, engineering and/or science degrees from a research-intensive university in Australia were administered the Graduate Skills Assessment to measure four generic skills--critical thinking, interpersonal understandings, problem solving and written communication. As expected, students' grade point average was generally found to be significantly related to scores for all four skill scales both within each discipline area and across the total sample. Reporting of academic achievement through the GPA therefore provides some measure of students' generic skill levels. However, since relationships were modest, GPA should be considered an imperfect indicator of levels of generic skills attainment. In addition, we found only limited evidence that students' skill levels increased with progression through their studies, with study length being consistently related only to Problem Solving. Finally, our analyses revealed significant, interdisciplinary variations in students' skill scores. Results are discussed with respect to theoretical, practical and methodological implications.

AB  - In recent years, there has been greater emphasis placed on cross-curricular approaches to teaching and learning evidenced in changes to curriculum guidance in a number of countries. Research indicates the complexity and challenge of such approaches to curriculum organisation, and presentation is considerable. This small scale study is focused on post graduate student teachers' perceptions of cross-curricular approaches to the planning, organisation and representation of the primary curriculum. It tracks their emerging understanding of the nature of cross-curricular education prior to and following their own cross-curricular learning experience in art and science. The discussion draws on empirical evidence from questionnaires and reflective group discussion to identify student teachers' emerging insights into the rationale underpinning such approaches to teaching and learning. The findings reveal a paradox between their initial positive perceptions and their direct experiences of such practice. The conclusions identify some implications for enhancing critical engagement and the development of teacher subject and pedagogic knowledge in initial teacher education.

AB  - Students are seldom given an authentic experience within school that allows them the opportunity to solve real-life complex engineering design problems that have meaning to their lives and/ or the greater society. They are often confined to learning environments that are limited by the restrictions set by course content for assessment purposes and school/teacher educational boundaries. However, the spotlight on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education has increased the focus of implementing multisensory activities based on meaningful tasks that motivate students to learn and develop creativity, problem-solving, and innovation skills. Within STEM Education, teachers may be requested to provide students with hands-on, problem-based activities that focus on real-life issues (Clemm, 2012). In technology and engineering education, design briefs are instructional tools used to provide hands-on, problem-based learning opportunities to students. However, these instructional tools can sometimes lack authenticity and true real-world problem-solving experience. This article will explain how teachers can provide an authentic learning experience by providing a situation for student-selected learning using examples dealing with natural disasters. Natural disasters have been selected as examples because they are social constructs occurring at the intersection between humans and nature (Hooke, 2007). In addition, current weather trends and the increase in natural hazards provide connections to a student's own life experience. Although engineering for natural disasters is a broad topic, authentic learning experiences based on the issues involved can stimulate student discussions and ideas for future innovative products or processes that might mitigate the impacts of such disasters. More specifically, technology and engineering can promote future solutions to such problems because, as Hooke (2007) describes, the engineering community holds the key to diminishing the threats of natural hazards.

AB  - College curricula of engineering and information systems do not afford frequent engagement with individuals with disabilities. The authors of this research study analyzed the benefits of disability films for a community film festival of largely engineering and information systems students and individuals with developmental and intellectual disabilities. The authors learned that disability film media enables discernable engagement and advocacy of the students for the rights of individuals with disabilities. The authors also learned that the disability film media facilitates engagement and self-advocacy of the individuals for themselves. This study will be beneficial to instructors in engineering and information systems, and instructors in liberal arts, evaluating film media as an exciting method for involving students with individuals with disabilities on multidisciplinary projects of public service.

AB  - Engineers must be able to collaborate with experts across disciplinary boundaries to successfully address the complex challenges of a contemporary workplace. As programming has a reflexive synergistic character, it can support a way of thinking about and exploring disciplines beyond computer science. Meanwhile, programming is a medium of communication. In this study, engineering students used authoring tools of mobile app to design an English-learning app, in which English teachers provide feedbacks for revision, and a preliminary cross-disciplinary collaboration is asserted. The learning design referred to the frameworks of constructing socio-technical creativity to aid the students in employing their existing English knowledge to design mobile apps. The evaluation was conducted on the basis of the students' designed apps and presentation, teachers' feedback, and students' self-reports. The results indicated that the common use of mobile apps in daily life seemed to create a boundary object for the engineering students and English teachers to express, communicate, and coordinate their perspectives and knowledge. Students could view the engineering work from different aspects and value English teachers' expertise. By accounting for the interests of students and schools' limited resources, this study serves as a reference for developing a method of cross-disciplinary learning and collaboration. Implications for practice or policy: (1) Students can acquire knowledge of English as well as programming skills in an instructional software design activity; (2) Cross-disciplinary collaboration could be enhanced by using mobile application as a boundary object; and (3) Teachers could use instructional software design activity to promote cross-disciplinary learning and collaboration for engineering students.

AB  - The information technology (IT) of today forms an integral part of everyday living, thus the nurture of children's IT awareness early in life is crucial. Young children have an innate curiosity for IT which suggests that in the school environment it can easily be integrated with other subjects in thematic and interdisciplinary curriculum. This quasi-experimental study used the Technology Foundation Standards for Students of the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) project on National Educational Technology Standards (NETS) as the basis to design a thematic and interdisciplinary IT curriculum for elementary students. A total of 1273 elementary students and 12 computer teachers were separated into either a control or experimental group. After one academic year, students' final scores in English, mathematics, science, social studies, and art were gathered and compared. Statistical analysis indicated that there were significant differences in the experimental group's academic scores. Findings also suggested that an interdisciplinary curriculum design opened opportunity for collaborative work and cohesiveness among faculty. Further longitudinal studies are recommended to examine the long-term implications of a thematic and interdisciplinary IT curriculum design. (Contains 12 tables.)

AB  - This study identified historical continuities and discontinuities across a century of secondary research published in "English Journal" (1912-1966) and "Research in the Teaching of English" (1967-2011). It highlights considerable methodological continuity across six decades of "English Journal" and some shifts in research emphases that tended to echo changing emphases in psychological research, curriculum reforms, and critiques of traditional linguistics. The analysis of secondary research published in "Research in the Teaching of English" explores how "RTE" emerged in 1967 with a definition of empirical social science that both expanded and contracted practices of positivist research and also excluded traditions of practitioner research and humanities-based research that had been published for decades in "EJ." Next, the study tracks patterns of continuity and change across "RTE" from the late 1960s to the present, including shifts in secondary research that seemed to echo shifts in behavioral science (1960s-1980s), cognitive psychology (1980s), and the onset of "sociocultural" research (early 1990s to present). The article concludes with a brief discussion of overarching impressions of continuity and change in secondary research, the place of "science" within the NCTE imprint, and a call for more historical research in English education.

AB  - The biochemistry and molecular biology of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is difficult to convey to students in a classroom setting in ways that capture their interest. The understanding of the matrix's roles in physiological and pathological conditions study will presumably be hampered by insufficient knowledge of its molecular structure. Internet-available resources can bridge the division between the molecular details and ECM's biological properties and associated processes. This article presents an approach to teach the ECM developed for first year medical undergraduates who, working in teams: (i) Explore a specific molecular component of the matrix, (ii) identify a disease in which the component is implicated, (iii) investigate how the component's structure/function contributes to ECM' supramolecular organization in physiological and in pathological conditions, and (iv) share their findings with colleagues. The approach--designated i-cell-MATRIX--is focused on the contribution of individual components to the overall organization and biological functions of the ECM. i-cell-MATRIX is student centered and uses 5 hours of class time. Summary of results and take home message: A "1-minute paper" has been used to gather student feedback on the impact of i-cell-MATRIX. Qualitative analysis of student feedback gathered in three consecutive years revealed that students appreciate the approach's reliance on self-directed learning, the interactivity embedded and the demand for deeper insights on the ECM. Learning how to use internet biomedical resources is another positive outcome. Ninety percent of students recommend the activity for subsequent years. i-cell-MATRIX is adaptable by other medical schools which may be looking for an approach that achieves higher student engagement with the ECM.

AB  - Environmental education (EE) pedagogy is grounded in a view of teaching as a "creative and dynamic process in which pupils and teachers are engaged together in a search for solutions to environmental problems." However it is not only the students who need support engaging in this search but the teachers--in creating dynamic, rigorous exploration of environmental issues. Ian Robottom (1987b, 1987c, 1987d) promotes professional development to support teachers' pedagogical approaches to EE, which differ from traditional teaching approaches. These include interdisciplinary planning, active investigation of local issues, and robust participation--with students--in activities around environmental improvement. This research explores environmentally sustainable school practices through a case study of how one school design, Expeditionary Learning (EL), provides teacher professional development. This professional development promotes environmental-based education that aims to support teachers in learning and teaching about ecosystems and the natural world and has as its goal an impact on student experience and work. Embedded within this study, and the focus of this article, are two case studies of teachers in urban schools developing and implementing science expeditions, a primary pedagogical practice in the EL school design. The goal of both expeditions was to engage students in exploring ideas of sustainability within their communities, families, and the larger world. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - It is generally accepted that the environmental education deals with a wide range of environmental experiences, methods and processes. Teaching the subject of the environment should not be considered as an easy task. It should not only cover pure ecology education; but also include the citizenship responsibilities and the problems that are sourced from other interdisciplinary factors. Therefore teachers should have the responsibility to facilitate environmental issues. Hitherto no researcher has undertaken a comprehensive study that focuses on environmental education in teacher training programs. This study aims to detect basic environmental knowledge of Turkish teacher candidate at the onset of their studies. This study has been conducted during in the fall of 2007 with a heterogeneous group of 248 teacher candidates from Education Faculty in Turkey, 82 students chosen from randomly from biology, science and 84 students from classroom teacher departments. To detect respondents' basic knowledge about environmental pollutants we administrated the questionnaire during the 1st month of their last academic year. The results found in this research have shown that teacher candidates possess less pro environmental knowledge. An interpretation of these results is that the teacher candidates do not fully comprehend the underlying ecological and environmental concepts related to environmental issues. Therefore, the design of pre service programs should take into account the characteristic of the student population which are the outcome of their social, cultural, and physical environments, and include all the necessary components for adequately preparing future educators to effectively address the environmental education of their future students. This may reflect into pupils' attitudes during teaching process in primary and secondary schools. (Contains 5 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - In this paper, we present an activity to introduce the idea of public-key cryptography and to make pre-service STEM teachers explore fundamental informatics and mathematical concepts and methods. We follow the Theory of Didactical Situations within the Didactical Engineering methodology (both widely used in mathematics education research) to design and analyse a didactical situation about asymmetric cryptography using graphs. Following the phases of Didactical Engineering, after the preliminary analysis of the content, the constraints and conditions of the teaching context, we conceived and analysed the situation a priori, with a particular focus on the milieu (the set of elements students can interact with) and on the choices for the didactical variables. We discuss their impact on the problem-solving strategies the participants need to elaborate to decrypt an encrypted message. We implemented our situation and collected qualitative data. We then analysed a posteriori the different strategies that participants used. The comparison of the a posteriori analysis with the a priori analysis showed the learning potential of the activity. To elaborate on different problem-solving strategies, the participants need to explore and understand several concepts and methods from mathematics, informatics, and the frontier of the two disciplines, also moving between different semiotic registers.

AB  - Context: Where a professional athletic training education program (ATEP) should be housed within a college/university has been a topic of discussion for many years. While individual institutions have unique preferences and priorities that suit its specific situation, it is essential that the field as a whole develops a consistent and cohesive model to guide ATEPs in their initial or continued development as programs. The current literature investigating the appropriate location of both undergraduate and graduate professional ATEPs is limited. Objective: To begin a discussion on what ultimately will be the best situation to ensure the sustained growth of ATEPs and, therefore, the profession. Conclusion: The current literature is inconclusive as to the optimal location for professional ATEPs within a college/university community. It is the author's opinion that undergraduate ATEPs should maintain their traditional place in physical education/kinesiology departments, as that is the most appropriate location for students to receive well-rounded, multi-disciplinary educational opportunities. Professional graduate ATEPs, on the other hand, should be housed in schools or departments of health sciences, because of the similarities between their two-year intense professional focus and those of other allied health fields.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to share the content and early results from an interdisciplinary sustainability curriculum that integrates theory and practice (praxis). The curriculum links new topical courses concerning renewable energy, food, water, engineering and social change with specialized labs that enhance technological and social-institutional sustainability literacy and build team-based project collaboration skills. Design/methodology/approach: In responses to dynamic interest emerging from university students and society, scholars from Environmental Studies, Engineering, Sociology, Education and Politics Departments united to create this curriculum. New courses and labs were designed and pre-existing courses were "radically retrofitted" and more tightly integrated through co-instruction and content. The co-authors discuss the background and collaborative processes that led to the emergence of this curriculum and describe the pedagogy and results associated with the student projects. Findings: Interdisciplinary student teams developed innovative projects with both campus and community-based partners. However, the incentives for an integrated sustainability curriculum faced persistent obstacles including the balkanization of academic knowledge, university organizational structure, and the need for additional human and financial investments. The team is currently designing the second phase of this integration and expanding a social learning network through collaborations with five universities in the Americas and Europe. Originality/value: This paper shows the development process, design and content of an interdisciplinary sustainability curriculum that integrates engineering with the social and ecological sciences while enlivening campus-community relationships through student projects. Several replicable practices include the contents and integration of topical classes, the strategies to overcome the obstacles for developing interdisciplinary student teams engaged in problem-based learning and approaches to negotiate institutional hurdles.

AB  - This article describes a successful interdisciplinary collaboration among chemistry, humanities and English faculty members, who utilized poetry and artistic illustration to help students learn, appreciate, and enjoy chemistry. Students taking general chemistry classes were introduced to poetry writing and museum-type poster preparation during one class period. They were then encouraged to use their imagination and creativity to brainstorm and write chemistry poems or humors on the concepts and principles covered in the chemistry classes and artistically illustrate their original work on posters. The project, 2-3 months in length, was perceived by students as effective at helping them learn chemistry and express their understanding in a fun, personal, and creative way. The instructors found students listened to the directives because many posters were witty, clever, and eye-catching. They showed fresh use of language and revealed a good understanding of chemistry. The top posters were created by a mix of A-, B-, and C-level students. The fine art work, coupled with poetry, helped chemistry come alive on campus, providing an aesthetic presentation of materials that engaged the general viewer. (Contains 3 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - Over the last few decades, there has been a shift in the classroom from lecture-based to active learning settings with the argument that students retain more information when they are involved in the learning process. This correlation is even stronger when the active learning setting incorporates a real-world or personal connection. Using active learning activities that develop students' ability to comprehend primary scientific literature is particularly important in the field of immunology, due to the rapid expansion of information in the field, which has been further accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. By nature, immunology is interdisciplinary, requiring an integrated knowledge of concepts from several scientific disciplines to understand complex immune processes. Engaging undergraduate students through the use of primary literature can improve scientific literacy, develop critical thinking, and enhance understanding of complex topics. To explore this, we utilized a group learning activity in an introductory immunology course that incorporated both a coronavirus-related review and COVID-19 clinical research article. We found that this learning activity significantly enhanced student confidence in key scientific literacy skills: reading scientific literature, clearly explaining relevant points, and describing conclusions generated from the data. Moreover, all students reported that they enjoyed the activity and that it helped them understand more about the current COVID-19 pandemic in the context of the immune response.

AB  - It has been 40 years since science, technology, society, and environment (STSE) education first appeared in science education research and practice. Although supported among many educators worldwide, there is much confusion surrounding the STSE slogan. Widely differing discourses on STSE education and diverse ways of practicing, have led to an array of distinct pedagogical approaches, programs, and methods. We are left wondering how we might orient ourselves amid such a diversity of propositions. What does STSE look like in practice? What ideological orientations underpin its practice? In this paper, we review the research literature and educational practices in STSE education to (1) map out a typology of STSE education in the form of currents and (2) provide a heuristic that educators can use for critical analysis of discourses and practices in the field. We identify, explore, and critique six currents in STSE education: application/design, historical, logical reasoning, value-centered, sociocultural, and socio-ecojustice currents. We suggest that these currents may serve as a didactic tool for others, a framework that will assist educators in informing their own theoretical understandings, choices, and practices in the context of STSE education.

AB  - The current emphasis in K-12 education on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) (Douglas, Iversen, & Kalyandurg, 2004; Sanders, 2009) creates many ways to partner engineering education with these fields. Therefore, it is appropriate to examine the commonalities these fields have with engineering education. Though much of the science education and mathematics education history is understood, technology education's history is not common knowledge, and as a result misconceptions abound (Daugherty & Wicklein, 1993 Wicklein, 2008). Technology education's longstanding history in problem- and project-based learning, design- and engineering-related pedagogical approach is over a century old and grounded in theories of Comenius, Rousseau, Pestalozzi, Froebel, Herbart, Sheldon, and Dewey (Dewey, 1915; Foster, 1995, 1997; Herschbach, 2009; Kirkwood, 1994). The brief review of technology education's history will reveal an almost eerie parallel to the current engineering education and STEM education movements. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Climate change (CC) is one of the most urgent problems to solve in this century, the effects of which cover a wide range of disciplines that go beyond the environmental component, becoming a social and economic problem as well. Social educators are professionals who must ensure that the quality of life in socially vulnerable societies is improved. In order to mitigate the problem of climate change, it is necessary for all professionals in the most varied areas to have climate literacy, so that they can adopt behaviors that comply with the objectives of sustainable development. Recognizing the importance of the social educator in the context of contemporary societies, we intended to find out the university students' perceptions on the social education course. With this in mind, we set out to carry out this study, which was based on the application of a questionnaire using a Likert scale. The respondents were 161 social education students at a higher education institution in Portugal. In order to carry out the inferential analysis, we took care to meet the necessary criteria for carrying out parametric tests. The results showed that a majority (72.6 %) of students were concerned about climate change. They (54.7 %) also stated that they would like their course to deal more with climate change, as 74 % acknowledged that they did not have the skills to deal with climate change as a future professional. The results also showed that the students were incapable of correctly listing a consequence of climate change. The data collected and analyzed in this study allowed us to conclude that Environmental Education played a fundamental role in the academic training of social educators, suggesting the need for its reinforcement and inclusion in their training plans. We also found that greater efforts were needed to improve students' climate literacy.

AB  - Faculty at a Midwestern metropolitan public university recently developed a course on bioinformatics that emphasized collaboration and inquiry. Bioinformatics, essentially the application of computational tools to biological data, is inherently interdisciplinary. Thus part of the challenge of creating this course was serving the needs and backgrounds of a diverse set of students, predominantly computer science and biology undergraduate and graduate students. Although the researchers desired to investigate student views of the course, they were interested in the potentially different perspectives. Q methodology, a measure of subjectivity, allowed the researchers to determine the various student perspectives in the bioinformatics course.

AB  - We are delighted to welcome you to the International Psychological Applications Conference and Trends (InPACT) 2017, taking place in Budapest, Hungary, from 29 of April to 1 of May, 2017. Modern psychology offers a large range of scientific fields where it can be applied. The goal of understanding individuals and groups (mental functions and behavioral standpoints), from this academic and practical scientific discipline, aims ultimately to benefit society. This International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the several areas within the Psychology field, new developments in studies and proposals for future scientific projects. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between psychologists, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in psychological issues. The conference is a forum that connects and brings together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. There is an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement the view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons there are nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. InPACT 2017 received 243 submissions, from 35 different countries from all over the world, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. It was accepted for presentation in the conference 128 submissions (29% acceptance rate). The conference also includes: (1) Two keynote presentations by Prof. Dr. Leslie G. Walker (Professor of Cancer Rehabilitation at the University of Hull, United Kingdom) and by Prof. Dr. Howard S.

AB  - In an effort to clean up the Chesapeake Bay, Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF) members use hands-on experiential learning opportunities to train teacher ambassadors throughout the bay's jurisdictions. Teacher ambassadors use the skills they learn to develop a Meaningful Watershed Educational Experience (MWEE) for their students to raise awareness of how communities can care for the local watershed. The teacher ambassadors at Lower Dauphin High School designed and implemented an outdoor, investigatory opportunity for their students during the 2018-2019 school year. This article describes how this ninth-grade class (nearly 300 students) gathered data on stream health, explored the watershed and stormwater runoff with tech tools, and designed a student action project using social media to connect their experience with the community.

AB  - The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to evaluate the efficacy of 14 Mathematics, Science and Technology Teacher Preparation (MSTTP) academies located across the state of Texas. The aim of the academies was to increase the number of highly qualified mathematics, science and technology teachers, while also improving the quality of certified teachers in these areas by focusing on seven established goals. A mixed-methods design was utilized to analyze both quantitative and qualitative data. The results revealed that the 14 MSTTP academies demonstrated three key strengths: focusing on strengthening content knowledge; developing professionally committed teachers; and providing funding for participants. Additionally, all 14 academies were charged with accomplishing seven goals; however, none of the academies fully implemented all of these goals. Specifically, all of the academies struggled to accomplish two goals: the integration of the areas of science, technology and mathematics; and the infusion of technology into curriculum. Finally, the study revealed that the goal of strengthening content knowledge was a good predictor for participants' content qualifications, while strengthening content knowledge and strengthening pedagogical skills were good predictors of participants' pedagogical qualifications. This research study contributes to the fields of teacher preparation and professional development.

AB  - This article reviews the preceding articles and distills from that collection answers to three questions that all good teachers need to ask and answer. The preceding articles in this volume have been written by teachers who have used the ideas of integrated course design (ICD) in an effort to improve their teaching and their students' learning. They represent a variety of disciplines and different levels of teaching experience. Their disciplines come from the full spectrum of university departments: (1) music; (2) accounting; (3) virology; (4) philosophy; (5) art history; (6) Spanish; (7) economics; (8) civil engineering; (9) psychology; (10) biology; (11) special education; and (12) biomolecular sciences. Some of these teachers are in the early years of their careers as college teachers, and others are veterans. The purpose of this article is to explore what everybody can learn from their experiences.

AB  - The author works as a biliteracy teacher in a bilingual school that serves students from K-5th grade. She and her coteacher provide instruction in both English and Spanish to 4th and 5th graders. They have two language arts blocks so that students receive literacy instruction in both their native and second languages, and they teach math, social studies, and science in English. She and her teammate, Jeanette Scotti, strive to deliver comprehensible, meaningful instruction to all students. Rather than using a pull out or "push in" model, they create an environment that supports all learners all day. It's a challenge, but one the author takes on every day because she believes her students have much to offer. It's her job to help her Spanish-speaking students transfer their knowledge from their home language to English and feel safe and strong expressing themselves. It's also the job of teachers who work with second language learners to help them gain content knowledge and work with it in their second language. Nancy Commins (2011) puts it well: "As educators, our job is not just to teach students to read and write well, but rather to fill the conceptual reservoir as deeply as possible, whether students can read and write--or not. Reading and writing are simply a means to the end of conceptual development. (p. 96)" Bilingual and multilingual students have a plethora of tools they can use to fill this conceptual reservoir. Teachers need to create a structure in which students can use those tools to strengthen their literacy skills and blossom. One planning structure that works well for this is thematic units. Integrated thematic units focus on core content that teachers teach across disciplines throughout the day. If outer space is the core content for the unit, the author doesn't just teach about space during her science block, she also plans lessons in language arts, social studies, and even math that focus on space while developing skills in those disciplines. Making connections throughout the day gives English language learners multiple opportunities to acquire meaningful language and content that's both academically and linguistically useful.

AB  - This paper presents a comparative evaluation of Google Scholar and 11 other bibliographic databases (Academic Search Elite, AgeLine, ArticleFirst, EconLit, GEOBASE, MEDLINE, PAIS International, POPLINE, Social Sciences Abstracts, Social Sciences Citation Index, and SocINDEX), focusing on search performance within the multidisciplinary field of later-life migration. The results of simple keyword searches are evaluated with reference to a set of 155 relevant articles identified in advance. In terms of both recall and precision, Google Scholar performs better than most of the subscription databases. This finding, based on a rigorous evaluation procedure, is contrary to the impressions of many early reviewers. The paper concludes with a discussion of a new approach to document relevance in educational settings--an approach that accounts for the instructors' goals as well as the students' assessments of relevance.

AB  - This study examines work preferences of 984 students across 6 disciplines within a business school--accounting, finance, information technology/decision science, management and international business, marketing, and hospitality management. Differences are found on 11 of the 17 measures. As predicted, we found that (a) accounting, finance, and information technology/ decision sciences students have the strongest preferences for analyzing data, (b) information technology/decision sciences students have the strongest preferences for working with objects, (c) marketing students have the strongest preferences for interacting verbally, being liked by others, and working with ideas, and (d) hospitality management students have the strongest preferences for helping others. These findings shed light on differences that exist among business students. These differences have important implications for faculty, career counselors, practitioners, and leaders of interdisciplinary cross-functional teams. The potential for academic ethnocentrism as a result of the psychological differences found is also discussed. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Background/Context: One of several challenges to fusing reading and science instruction through the use of reflective practice arises from recent claims that it is questionable whether anyone can "make" preservice teachers into reflective practitioners. This challenge has implications for researchers and teacher educators in general, especially if one assumes that novices are without sufficient resources for reflecting on their own experiences and interactions. Two frequently cited commissioned reviews of reading research conclude that skills-based instruction in graphic organizing, self-questioning, summarizing, and other similar generic reading strategies can improve adolescents' comprehension of written texts. However, there is a growing consensus about the importance of domain-specific pedagogical knowledge, and preservice teachers who view science instruction as largely concept oriented may not view reading instruction as highly relevant. Little research has been directed toward understanding how preservice science teachers learn to integrate what they know about their subject matter with the generic reading strategies they are taught in content literacy courses. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: The researchers documented a prospective science teacher's struggle to make sense of an online content literacy course that attempted to strengthen her capabilities to combine skills-based instruction (reading) with concept-based instruction (science). Specifically, the researchers were interested in her reflections on the feedback she received from the course instructors and, in turn, how her struggle caused the researchers to reflect on several contradictory discourses in the online course that needed addressing before offering it in subsequent semesters. While looking at the course through the eyes of this student's experiences and interactions, the researchers were also mindful of how her professional identity as a science teacher was being informed by those same contradictory discourses in small but incremental ways throughout the semester. Research Design: In the context of an online content literacy course, 11 pairs of prospective and mentor teachers worked as partners in the instruction of middle school students reading one or more grade levels below actual grade placement in one or more content areas. This interpretive case study focused on one of those pairs. The concept of approximations of practice framed this study and led to a focus on the clinical aspects of reflective practice manifested during periods of preactive teaching (e.g., lesson planning) and reflective teaching (e.g., explaining and receiving feedback on the planned lessons). Data Collection and Analysis: Data sources included a prospective teacher's four intervention lessons plans and e-mails containing reflections on those lesson plans from the prospective teacher, her mentor teacher, and the teaching team. Analysis was a four-step process that included coding key sources and writing analytic memos through the use of deductive and inductive methods. The primary researcher used discourse analysis to interpret the researchers' and participants' written reflections related to preactive and reflective teaching. Conclusions/Recommendations: Implications derived from the study's findings for literacy educators point to the value of collaborating with colleagues in schools of teacher education who have expertise in teaching their specific discipline's content. Most importantly, the implications point to the need to reexamine the assumption that prospective teachers are without sufficient resources for reflecting on their own experiences and interactions in situations that call for fusing skills-based reading instruction with concept-based science instruction.

AB  - A novel experiment for the extraction of lycopene from tomato paste without the use of an organic solvent is described. The experiment employs polymer, green, and analytical chemistry. This environmentally friendly extraction is more efficient and requires less time than the traditional approach using an organic solvent. The extraction is accomplished using an aqueous emulsion. The emulsifying agent CPS, which is a co-polymerization product from acrylic acid, n-butyl acrylate, and styrene monomers, is generated as a part of the experiment. The emulsion can be reused by simple basification. This experiment acquaints students with a polymerization reaction, the extraction of a natural product, and provides experience with thin-layer chromatography and UV-vis spectroscopy, which are used for purity determination and identification, respectively. During the experiment, students gain an understanding of the overlap among the different fields of chemistry and the concept of green chemistry. The experiment is suitable for upper-level chemistry laboratories. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - It was refreshing to read Hisham Ghassib's (2010) article outlining his model of scientific knowledge production. Too few scholarly writings in creative studies and gifted education deal with issues at the large-scale, panoramic level of analysis. Ghassib (2010) would not disappoint Albert Einstein who lamented that "I have little patience with scientists who take a board of wood, look for its thinnest part, and drill a great number of holes where drilling is easy" (cited in Gardner, 1993, p. 106). Instead of selecting an easily drilled micro-element of creativity, Ghassib (2010) drilled into a very thick, knotty board, the philosophy and history of science itself, looking for creative dimensions within. Of course, given the thickness of this board, Ghassib (2010) cannot possibly address all complexities and nuances of the scientific enterprise in a single article. While he does explore some aspects of the historical evolution of science, cognitive and procedural dimensions of scientific work, and science's role in the economy, his analysis could benefit from treatment of several additional elements, I think there are some other facets of scientific creativity that can augment what he has done and I address some of them here. First, I provide some responses to his model, which include some recommendations for its extension and refinement. These recommendations include a call for more attention to alternative creative processes and paradigms, as well as deeper scrutiny of the sociopolitical and economic contextual influences on scientific processes. In addition, I argue that more interdisciplinary work can enrich both the model and the scientific enterprise somewhat.

AB  - Nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary field of research and development identified as a major priority in the United States. Progress in science and engineering at the nanoscale is critical for national security, prosperity of the economy, and enhancement of the quality of life. It is anticipated that nanotechnology will be a major transitional force that possesses the potential to change society. Rapid and continued advancement in the field of nanotechnology is accelerating the demand for specific professional knowledge and skill. These lines of technological discovery and improvement continue to unlock new content for classroom incorporation. Contemporary approaches and practices to further engage learners and enhance their abilities to apply nanoscale-related content knowledge must be continually developed in order for the United States to solidify itself as the primary builder of nanotechnology research and development. Steadfast development of new technologies leading to continual transformation of society serves as a strong indicator that current educational practices should be altered in order to prepare knowledgeable and engaged citizens. The use of three-dimensional graphics, virtual reality, virtual modeling, visualizations, and other information and communication technologies can assist in reinforcing nano-associated scientific and technological concepts.

AB  - The paper presents empirical findings on the potential benefits and challenges associated with collaborative postgraduate programs between African universities. It reflects the empirical benefits and challenges towards a collaborative master in the fields of Earth Observation, Geographical Information Science (GIS) and Remote Sensing. The research applied a combination of approaches that include desktop study, consultative meetings and round table meetings with experts in universities operating partnership. Positive and negative effects of collaborative degree programs were equally collected and the results were verified. The research established that although collaborative degree programs are more favorable around the world, a number of administrative issues hamper the system. These are lack of funding and inconsistent accreditations among country universities. Key recommendations include inclusive administration, proper funding for higher institutions and consistent accreditations among universities. This paper presents a glimpse of the challenges and benefits associated with collaborative postgraduate programs between African universities.

AB  - This paper is part of a larger study that aims at highlighting students' interpretations of the idea of the "Balance of Nature", as well as its use in their reasoning about the future of an ecosystem, in order to subsequently develop a learning environment that might promote a reconsideration of its validity and usefulness. Our focus here is particularly set on whether and how non biology-major students use this idea when making predictions about (a) the future of an ecosystem that is supposed to have suffered a human-driven disturbance, and (b) the future of an ecosystem that is supposed to be protected against such disturbances. Administering a questionnaire of 12 items--4 of which concern us here--to 61 1st-year educational sciences students at the University of Patras, we traced--among others--their reasoning about (a) the future of three ecosystems (forest, sea, lake), supposed to have suffered different human-driven disturbances (fire, oil spill, new population introduction), and (b) the future of a protected forest ecosystem of a national park. According to our findings, most of the students found it very likely for a disturbed ecosystem to fully recover its initial state--mainly due to a "recovery process" or inherent "recovery mechanisms"--showing a strong belief in an extremely resilient "Balance of Nature". Moreover, most of them appeared to believe that if human-protected, an ecosystem will be in a continuous "balance", while very few were skeptical enough to claim a non-predictable future for it.

AB  - This paper examines the effective deployment of conversational agents in virtual worlds from the perspective of researchers/practitioners in cognitive psychology, computing science, learning technologies and engineering. From a cognitive perspective, the major challenge lies in the coordination and management of the various channels of information associated with conversation/communication and integrating this information with the virtual space of the environment and the belief space of the user. From computing science, the requirements include conversational competency, use of nonverbal cues, animation consistent with affective states, believability, domain competency and user adaptability. From a learning technologies perspective, the challenge is to maximise the considerable affordances provided by conversational avatars in virtual worlds balanced against ecologically valid investigations regarding utility. Finally, the engineering perspective focuses on the technical competency required to implement effective and functional agents, and the associated costs to enable student access. Taken together, the four perspectives draw attention to the quality of the agent-user interaction, how theory, practice and research are closely intertwined, and the multidisciplinary nature of this area with opportunities for cross fertilisation and collaboration.

AB  - The focus on standardized testing in the areas of reading and mathematics in early elementary education often minimalizes science and the arts in the curriculum. The science topics of health and nutrition were integrated into the reading curriculum through read aloud books. Inclusion of creativity skills through figural transformation drawings allowed students to display nutrition comprehension, modeling how these subject areas can fit into a narrowed curriculum. This repeated measures study examined the weekly effect of teacher lesson introduction on 19Â second grade students' (11 female, 8 male) creativity and content knowledge of nutrition under two conditions that alternated every 2Â weeks over a 16-week period: a brief, positive, standard lesson introduction (control) compared to a more enhanced introduction promoting originality, risk-taking and persistence (experimental). Students listened to read-aloud books on nutrition and completed figural transformation drawings related to the stories. Findings showed that student work evidenced more creativity during the experimental condition with a very large effect size for breaking perceived boundaries; a large effect size for depicting movement in drawings; medium effect sizes for fluency, originality, storytelling articulateness, humor, wisdom, emotion, and total creative traits; and a small effect size for elaboration. Students also evidenced greater overall knowledge of health/nutrition content during the experimental condition with a small effect size. Small changes in the way a lesson was introduced had a significant impact on student knowledge and creative performance, indicating that early childhood teachers should implement similar lesson introductions to increase student creativity.

AB  - The contribution of the discipline of geography to the field of education is complex since they have both been dependent upon the contributions of other social science disciplines, particularly those in the mainstream of social sciences (economics, sociology and political science). Indeed, the number of researchers who would consider themselves as working within the sub-discipline of the geography of education is small, but apparently growing. While the paper suggests that to date there has been relatively little debate at the intersection of these two fields of enquiry it goes on to propose that the potential contribution this would have for both fields remains significant. The pivotal contribution of geography to all the social sciences, that of space (and place), has been central to UK education research since the early origins of a national education system and the roles education and curricular developments have played in nation building. The role of space has also featured heavily in analyses of territorial justice and governance at the level of local authorities and further down in scale to spatial analyses of the classroom. But in order to fully appreciate its contribution the paper utilises the related concept of "scale" to systematically explore the relationship between space and education, in terms of its analytical, theoretical and methodological uses. The paper also considers the recent "spatial turn" in education (and the social sciences more generally) and the equivalent focus on education matters within the field of human geography. In developing this approach it becomes apparent where interdisciplinary research across and between the disciplines of geography and education remains limited and what further contributions from geography would be beneficial to the field of education.

AB  - As we have throughout the association's history, we focused in 2011 on multiple initiatives--all designed to further, support, and communicate the important work that psychologists do. This year we had the benefit of APA's first-ever strategic plan as well as funding for the following seven initiatives that are specifically designed to execute the plan: Increase member engagement and value by assessing and restructuring our business models; conduct ongoing analysis of current and future demand for the psychology work force to meet national needs; continue to develop treatment guidelines to promote the translation of psychological science into practice; expand our public education campaign to communicate the scientific base of psychology; promote opportunities for graduate and professional development to advance psychology's role in health, including interdisciplinary training; increase support for research, training, public education, and interventions that reduce health disparities among underserved and marginalized populations; forge strategic alliances with health care organizations to include psychologists in integrated health care services. These initiatives will strengthen psychology's relevance to health care; to personal, community, and organizational wellness; and to research-based solutions to social needs. They will also strengthen APA's relevance to members, psychologists, and psychology students worldwide. Please read more about APA's activities in support of psychology and psychologists throughout this report. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - Much of the literature around the notions of discourse and identity explores how education (particularly higher education) might develop academic discourses and identities in students. There is however a dearth of work relating to what the development of academic discourses and identities in students might mean for the lecturers who teach them. The identities of lecturers, especially those in applied science/engineering fields, are generally framed in terms of their disciplinary affiliation rather than their role as professional educators. This construction of a science/engineering-based identity in many ways militates against the incorporation of an identity as a professional educator. Using narrative methodology, life history approaches and discourse analysis to trace twenty lecturers' perceptions of their changing roles and identities as academics, this paper argues that the incorporation of a professional educator identity would enable the explicit teaching of academic discourses. The findings show that the identity of professional educator can be developed in science/engineering lecturers through their interaction with academic developers from 'other' disciplines such as Education and Language/Linguistics. Bringing academic developers and science/engineering lecturers into dialogue with each other facilitated the development of an alternate identity, that of professional educator, in science/engineering lecturers. The paper concludes that academic developers, through the generic academic literacy courses offered at most tertiary institutions, occupy a space that science/engineering lecturers should be filling, that of inducting students into the discourses of science and engineering. Finally the paper recommends that sustained interaction between academic developers and science/engineering lecturers facilitates a shift in the academic identities of the science/engineering lecturers, towards incorporating an 'otherness' as discourse teachers.

AB  - Contemporary educational debate in curriculum organisation and pedagogy has focused on the merits or otherwise of integrating disciplines for more effective learning. A wide range of terms is used to describe the various traditions associated with the presentation and structure of the curriculum and there are various perspectives on the purposes and efficacy of such approaches. Terms such as cross-curricular, thematic and interdisciplinary learning encompass a broad range of interpretations that place different emphases on the process of interdisciplinary organisation. It is often suggested that integration in its various forms promotes understanding through building connections in meaningful learning contexts. However, the delivery of a more integrated curriculum depends on teachers' abilities to integrate knowledge appropriately such that pupils are able to make productive links between subjects. This presents a particular challenge in initial teacher education; this paper explores how student teachers' conceptualisation of these practices is mediated and influenced in relation to their experience in school.

AB  - For nearly four decades, researchers have explored the integration of arts and humanities content into health professions education (HPE). However, enduring controversies regarding the purpose, efficacy, and implementation of humanities initiatives suggest that the "timing" and "context" of trainees' exposure to such content is a key, but seldom considered, factor. To better understand the affordances of introducing humanities-based health curriculum prior to the HPE admissions gateway, we conducted a qualitative instrumental case study with participants from Canada's first Health Humanities baccalaureate program. Fully anonymized transcripts from semi-structured interviews (n = 11) and focus groups (n = 14) underwent an open-coding procedure for thematic narrative analysis to reveal three major temporal domains of described experience (i.e., "prior to," "during," and "following" their participation in a 12-week semester-long "Introduction to Health Humanities" course). Our findings demonstrate that perceptions of arts- and humanities content in health education are generated well in advance of HPE admission. Among other findings, we define a new concept--epistemological multicompetence--to describe participants' emergent capability to toggle between (and advocate for the role of) multiple disciplines, arts and humanities particularly, in health-related teaching and learning at the pre-professional level. Improved coordination of baccalaureate and HPE curricula may therefore enhance the development of capabilities associated with arts and humanities, including: epistemological multicompetence, aesthetic sensibility, and other sought-after qualities in HPE candidates. In conclusion, attending to the pre-professional admissions gateway presents a new, capabilities-driven approach to enhancing both the implementation and critical understanding of arts and humanities' purpose, role, and effects across the "life course" of health professions education.

AB  - A cloud network system is combined with standard computing applications and a course management system to provide a robust method for sharing data among students. This system provides a unique method to improve data analysis by easily increasing the amount of sampled data available for analysis. The data can be shared within one course as well as used in interdisciplinary environments. Student accessibility is improved over other data sharing methods with the benefit of minimal oversight required by the instructor. The networked system is ideal for large enrollment and research-based laboratory courses. Methods for implementation in research labs are also described. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)

AB  - Current trends in ecological research emphasize interdisciplinary approaches for assessing effects of present and predicted environmental changes. One such emerging interdisciplinary field is the discipline of ecohydrology, which studies the feedbacks and interactions between ecological and hydrological processes. However, interdisciplinary science, which includes ecohydrology and other fields, has not yet been effectively translated into many K-12 curricula. We adapted an ecohydrological research project, originally conducted at the Biosphere 2 research apparatus, for use in a middle school classroom. The experiment focuses on describing the effects of changes in landscape vegetation cover on the partitioning of evapotranspiration, the major component of the water budget, into plant transpiration and soil evaporation. The 1-week long experiment was conducted by Grade 6 students (n = 82) in classrooms in Oro Valley, AZ. Students completed pre- and post-experiment tests designed to assess their general understanding of the components of evapotranspiration as well as the scientific procedures that can be used to differentiate them. Our results show significant improvement between the pre- and post-experiment evaluations on the understanding of the water cycle concepts, particularly those associated with evapotranspiration. This improvement illustrates how the incorporation of experimental knowledge can constitute a key instrument to successful delivery of scientific information in the classroom. We discuss how current scientific research can be effectively incorporated into the science curriculum, which in turn can be used as an instrumental tool to produce scientifically relevant data.

AB  - Citizens participating in contemporary socio-scientific issues (SSI) need to draw on local knowledge and personal experience. If curricular developments in the teaching of controversial SSI are to reflect contemporary notions of citizenship then the personal narrative is an indispensable instrument in bridging the gap between the local/personal and the emergent science. In the context of controversy personal narratives help contending parties to see events in the light of those who do not share their views. A goal-oriented protagonist is the narrator in the personal narrative, which consists of three components--situation-event-reaction--the reaction being an evaluation of the event. Promoting personal narratives in science-based curricula is considered problematic given the dominant role of science's explanatory frameworks. An inter-disciplinary approach is proposed based on McLaughlin's levels of disagreement.

AB  - Background: Historically, the meaning of teacher competence has changed and is continuously being re-constructed along with changes in society as well as with shifting values and intentions in preschool guidelines and curricula. Over the past decade, Swedish preschool has been incorporated as a part of the educational system, and has received its own national curriculum, which recently, has been revised. A new preschool teacher education has been initiated. All these changes influence preschool practice, conditions for teachers' pedagogical work and children's learning, and as a consequence, the meaning that teachers ascribe to teacher competence. Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the meaning given to preschool teacher competence by Swedish preschool teachers. Focus is directed towards teachers' descriptions of their approach and their communication and interaction with children in relation to the overall goals of the preschool curriculum. Sample: The study was carried out in Sweden and the sample consist of 15 preschools in the country's two major cities, Stockholm and Gothenburg, and 15 preschools from the rural area of Malardalen in mid-Sweden. Both of the urban regions and the rural area are stratified to represent districts that differ geographically, demographically, ethnically, and which include varied socio-economic structures. From each of the 30 preschools, one preschool class/group and one preschool teacher were recruited as participants. All except one of the teachers were women. Design and method: The study is based on interactionist perspectives and draws on Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory and a critical ecology of the early childhood profession. To study teacher competence, the method chosen was individual, and semi-structured interviews that lasted 60-120 minutes were recorded and transcribed "verbatim". The analysis is qualitative and focuses on key questions that were asked of all participants. The analyses aimed to discern similarities and differences, and distinguished between competences teachers said that they have and competences they wanted to develop, such as knowledge, skills and attitudes and whether these competences were understood as static, situational and/or dynamic. Result: Three intertwined dimensions of teacher competences emerged. These dimensions are mutually interdependent, inseparable and constitute the meaning given by the teachers to teacher competence as a whole. These are: "Competence of knowing what and why, Competence of know-how, and Interactive, relational and transactional competence". These dimensions highlight teacher competence as a complex, multidimensional and relational phenomenon, constituted from interacting abilities. The participating teachers have a broad multidisciplinary knowledge, which needs to be deepened within specific areas such as, mathematics, ICT, science etc. Conclusion: Being a part of complex ecological system with increasingly global dimensions, preschool teaching is a profession in change. Preschool teacher competence is constituted in the intersection of values, knowledge and ideologies on different system levels. In line with changing policy and curriculum intentions teachers create shared understandings of the meaning of teacher competence both for today and tomorrow. Based on these beliefs teachers create conditions for children's learning in preschool practice. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - In this article, I recount the many ways in which Harold Guetzkow influenced my career. From the beginning of my graduate studies at Northwestern University in the 1960s into the next century, Harold's guidance has been indispensable. His idea of bridging islands of theory has provided many of us with a broad, integrated vision of social science. His workman-like approach to scholarship has provided us with the tools needed to contribute to the field. As a broad theorist, Harold inspired us to devote a lifetime in pursuit of knowledge. As a mentor, he imparted the essential skills of writing for publication, presenting at professional meetings, teaching and advising, and contributing to the profession. Above all, his values of interdisciplinary and responsible scholarship have been a hallmark of my own research and project leadership. My work on simulation reflects these values as well, with regard to research platforms and classroom learning. Indeed, a recent article in this journal owes much to Harold's influence (Druckman & Ebner, 2008). (Contains 2 notes.)

AB  - Service modelling has become an increasingly important area in today's telecommunications and information systems practice. We have adapted a Network Design course in order to teach service modelling to a mixed class of both the telecommunication engineering and information systems backgrounds. An integrated approach engaging mathematics teaching with strategies such as problem-solving, visualization, and the use of examples and simulations, has been developed. From assessment on student learning outcomes, it is indicated that the proposed course delivery approach succeeded in bringing out comparable and satisfactory performance from students of different educational backgrounds.

AB  - In this article, the author discusses how science can be integrated into the "creative curriculum". Creative approaches to curriculum design, cross-curricular studies and an increased focus on the creative arts are routes to promoting and teaching creativity. But when learning in science is based on a genuine enquiry-based approach with children given the skills, resources, time and security to ask and answer their own questions and define and solve real problems, science, taught discretely or linked to other subjects, becomes more thoughtful and creative. Although pupils are not (yet) going to discover new theories they will, by carrying out their own investigations and discovering things that are new and interesting to them, construct their own developing understanding of how the world around them works. And what could be more creative than that?

AB  - In this study we investigated the research designs employed to study the interdisciplinary profession of school librarianship during a time period of notable changes across both the Pre-K-12 and school library domains. To conduct this work, we analyzed all 217 articles published in "School Library Research" (SLR) and "School Libraries Worldwide" (SLW) from 2007 through July 2015. Results point to the high variability in research designs employed and limited inclusion of Pre-K-12 students as participants. The articles also exhibit high incidences of collaboration between scholars but limited involvement of practitioners as researchers. Findings are discussed in relation to research and practice.

AB  - English is an international language used all over the world. Mathematics is the language of sciences but it is also a language used in everyday life. Although both are perceived as languages, mathematics and English are considered as two completely distinct disciplines. In this paper we first discuss English and mathematics as languages. Then we present interviews conducted with five mathematics and English teachers in order to explore their views regarding issues of language features, ways of teaching and issues of anxiety and collaboration between English and mathematics teachers. The interviews suggest some communalities in the way English and mathematics teachers relate to the two languages. The connection between the two disciplines seems to challenge teachers' thinking about their teaching.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the designed cultural ecology of a hip-hop and computational science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) camp and the ways in which that ecology contributed to culturally sustaining learning experiences for middle school youth. In using the principles of hip-hop as a CSP for design, the authors question how and what practices were supported or emerged and how they became resources for youth engagement in the space. Design/methodology/approach: The overall methodology was design research. Through interpretive analysis, it uses an example of four Black girls participating in the camp as they build a computer-controlled DJ battle station. Findings: Through a close examination of youth interactions in the designed environment -- looking at their communication, spatial arrangements, choices and uses of materials and tools during collaborative project work -- the authors show how a learning ecology, designed based on hip-hop and computational practices and shaped by the history and practices of the dance center where the program was held, provided access to ideational, relational, spatial and material resources that became relevant to learning through computational making. The authors also show how youth engagement in the hip-hop computational making learning ecology allowed practices to emerge that led to expansive learning experiences that redefine what it means to engage in computing. Research limitations/implications: Implications include how such ecologies might arrange relations of ideas, tools, materials, space and people to support learning and positive identity development. Originality/value: Supporting culturally sustaining computational STEM pedagogies, the article argues two original points in informal youth learning (1) an expanded definition of computing based on making grammars and the cultural practices of hip-hop, and (2) attention to cultural ecologies in designing and understanding computational STEM learning environments.
