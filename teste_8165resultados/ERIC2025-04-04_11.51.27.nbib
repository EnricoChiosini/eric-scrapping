AB  - This study evaluates the effects of the Mathematics, Arts, and Creativity in Education (MACE) program on students' ability in geometry and visual arts in the upper grades of elementary school. The program consisted of a lesson series for fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students in which geometry and visual arts were integrated, alongside with a professional development program for teachers. A quasi-experimental study was conducted in which three groups of teachers and their classes were investigated. One group of teachers taught the lesson series and followed a professional development program (n=36), one group of teachers only taught the lesson series (n=36), and a comparison group taught a series of traditional geometry lessons from mathematical textbooks (n=43). A geometrical ability, creativity, and vocabulary test and a visual arts assignment were used in a pre- and post-measurements to test the effects of the MACE program. Results showed that students who received the MACE lesson series improved more than students who received regular geometry lessons only in geometrical aspects perceived in a visual artwork. Regarding students' understanding and explanation of geometrical phenomena and geometrical creative thinking, all students improved, but no differences between the groups were found, which implies that on these aspects the MACE program was as effective as the comparison group that received a more traditional form of geometry education.

AB  - Higher education is a field of study. It does not have an integral cognate discipline that defines its extent and borders. Contributions to understanding higher education come from, among others, sociologists, historians, political theorists, economists and students of science policy and cultural studies. These were the disciplines whose exponents were assembled by Burton Clark in UCLA to summarise for a wider audience the contributions their disciplines were making to scholarship and research into higher education in the early 1980s. This paper reviews these disciplinary approaches and Clark's reactions to them in the light of later developments in higher education and its study. It concludes by claiming that the contributors showed remarkable prescience in identifying many of the main developments in higher education studies over the following quarter of a century. It also asserts that although there has been a huge expansion in higher education studies since then, and they now have all the attributes of an academically respectable field of study throughout the world, they remain dependent on their foundation disciplines for their intellectual rigour.

AB  - Population trends--birth and death rates, immigration patterns, sex ratios, and life expectancies--are one of the most important issues facing the international community. These trends' relationship to the world economy, the environment, and developing countries' ability to meet the needs of growing populations is a topic appropriate for the social studies classroom. Moreover, population trends are strongly correlated with other vital issues in international relations, such as world hunger, the spread of infectious diseases, the vitality of numerous political and religious movements, and the development of democracies throughout the world. The study of population is directly linked with all of the social studies, in addition to science, technology, mathematics, and the humanities. Therefore, designing lesson plans centered on population issues is an excellent way to fuse the social studies with other disciplines and show students the connections between the social and natural sciences and the direct relevance of these sciences to their lives.

AB  - Contests are usually applied in the academic environment to simulate real professional situations that require from the participants a more pro-active attitude than the one shown in conventional coursework. Although they are commonly applied in the scope of a unique course, the contest described here was an extracurricular experience applied in an Information System undergraduate program. The evaluation of the contest is also presented; the objective was to assess the role of the contest as a tool to bring together interdisciplinary subjects, complementary to the traditional disciplinary structure of the program curriculum. The results indicate that a significant portion of the participants noticed increase in their knowledge after the contest, which is verified by statistical tests. However, students from the first stages received more benefits, probably because such students were more motivated and had more available time to be involved in the contest activities.

AB  - Art education is an interdisciplinary field in the sense that it requires a mix of studio practice with theory and academic-style learning. Teachers teach philosophy and theory drawn from psychology, social sciences, history, and the humanities. Helping students be successful readers, writers, speakers, and test-takers are goals shared with those who teach academic classes. Students who have made it to high levels of performance in art include a variety of different artistic profiles as well as different academic strengths and challenges. In a pilot study using an open-ended questionnaire and a follow-up member check, a sampling of graduate art education students offered some very practical recommendations. Soon to be teachers themselves, they are at a state of heightened awareness of their own learning styles, preferences, strengths, and challenges. Their candid responses suggest a lot about how they learn best, what they need from teachers, and how they also can help themselves. The central question for this study is to find out, from a student point of view, strategies for teaching and learning that may foster academic achievement among those whose intellectual strengths and learning style preferences are primarily visual, spatial, and kinesthetic. Secondarily, this study is an initial effort to look for emerging patterns between different artistic and academic profiles. A third question concerns beliefs and expectations regarding the doubly exceptional; that is, gifted in one area and challenged in another. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Despite collaboration among different professions being recognized as fundamentally important to contemporary and future healthcare practice, the concept is woefully undertheorized. This has implications for how health professions educators might best introduce students to interprofessional collaboration and support their transition into interprofessional, collaborative workplaces. To address this, we engage in a conceptual analysis of published collaborative, interprofessional practices and conceptual understandings in theatre, as a highly collaborative art form and industry, to advance thinking in the health professions, specifically to inform interprofessional education. Our analysis advances a conceptualization of collaboration that takes place within a work culture of creativity and community, that includes four modes of collaboration, or the ways theatre practitioners collaborate, by: (1) paying attention to and traversing roles and hierarchies; (2) engaging in reciprocal listening and challenging of others; (3) developing trust and communication, and; (4) navigating uncertainty, risk and failure. We conclude by inviting those working in the health professions to consider what might be gleaned from our conceptualization, where the embodied and human-centred aspects of working together are attended to alongside structural and organizational aspects.

AB  - Collaboration between academia and actors outside academia (AOAs) has been proclaimed as a way for society to confront challenges in different fields. This 'participatory imperative' is anchored in EU research policy. The paper explores the participatory imperative in contemporary Swedish aging research. Three kinds of motives for participatory research as a way to societal impact emerged in the social voices of researchers granted money and AOAs with experience of participating in research. Participatory research was a "suitable research method for certain types of research objectives," an "answer to AOAs' outspoken needs for new knowledge" and a "result from the interviewee's double identity as a clinician and a researcher." Moreover, four types of activities were talked of. Participatory research was described as "dissemination of results," as "commissioned work," as "joint action" and as "education." The paper closes by promoting a synergistic approach where collaboration is enacted within already existing infrastructures of research and education. Scholars are encouraged to integrate collaboration with AOAs in their daily work as teachers and researchers. By doing so, new constellations of actors will emerge; constellations that are equipped to tackle real-world issues in new ways.

AB  - Many educators today advocate the use of historical narratives as one of a number of possible contexts for teaching science. However, several pedagogical and epistemological issues arise when implementing narratives in the classroom. In this paper, we are interested in expanding our view of narrative, specific to integrating the history of science and science teaching, and we extend our argument beyond simple anecdotal references to recognise the benefits of the historical narrative in a variety of ways. At the same time, we address pedagogical concerns by broadening perceptions of the manner and contexts in which narratives can be developed so as to include imaginative and manipulative elements that provide interactive experiences for students that are more conducive to implementation by science teachers. Several practical examples are presented as illustrations of historical narratives with imaginative and manipulative elements that by design facilitate a more meaningful implementation in the science classroom.

AB  - Implementing true inquiry teaching is challenging. Many teachers confuse hands-on activities with inquiry and fail to provide opportunities for students to think critically and analytically. As with any teaching, teachers must guide, focus, challenge, and encourage students to continue questioning and exploring. The level of inquiry that a teacher chooses to implement depends upon the goals of the particular lesson. Both highly structured and more open-ended inquiries have their place in science classrooms. In this article, the authors present a project that three university professors used with preservice teachers in a middle-level teacher education program. The goal was to incorporate inquiry teaching and literature-based instruction within the disciplines of science, language arts, and social studies, which is the method of interdisciplinary instruction supported by the National Middle School Association.

AB  - The National Standards for Arts Education encourages teachers to help students make connections between music and other disciplines. Many state curriculum guides likewise encourage educators to integrate curricula and find common ground between different subjects. Music--particularly vocal music--offers ample opportunities to find relationships with historical events, diverse cultures, and the humanities in general. It may not be so easy, however, to find relationships among music, mathematics, and science. Teachers sometimes boast that "music teaches math" in counting rhythms or learning the fractional nature of note values. While partially true, this connection between music and mathematics is superficial when compared to the real scientific and mathematical basis for music--musical acoustics.

AB  - Because quantitative biology requires skills and concepts from a disparate collection of different disciplines, the scientists of the near future will increasingly need to rely on collaborations to produce results. Correspondingly, students in disciplines impacted by quantitative biology will need to be taught how to create and engage in such collaborations. In response to this important curricular need, East Tennessee State University and Georgia Technological University/Emory University cooperated in an unprecedented curricular experiment in which theoretically oriented students at East Tennessee State designed biophysical models that were implemented and tested experimentally by biomedical engineers at the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Technological University and Emory University. Implementing the collaborations between two institutions allowed an assessment of the student collaborations from before the groups of students had met for the first time until after they had finished their projects, thus providing insight about the formation and conduct of such collaborations that could not have been obtained otherwise.

The mathematical concepts and skills, including measurement and geometry, taught in this project met and often exceeded the standards set by New York state for sixth-grade mathematics skills. This term-long exercise was developed as a method of creating a context in which to solve authentic, real-world problems. Many experienced mathematics teachers agree that the most powerful learning experiences are relevant ones that require active input and participation from the student. (Contains 6 figures.)

AB  - Taking an interdisciplinary approach that draws on narrative theory, composition scholarship, and investigations into the affective dimensions of the research process, this article discusses stories written by college students about their experiences locating, evaluating, and using information in the context of academic research. These narratives provide insight into how students conceptualize the research process and perceive their often tenuous roles as researchers. A textual analysis of a selection of student narratives is included, demonstrating how narrative not only enhances our understanding of the research experience but also enables students to raise larger questions about authenticity and power in the classroom.

AB  - This article explores the insights literature can bring to administrative and bureaucratic critique, focusing on the work of Nikolai Gogol. Gogol's satire of bureaucracy presages many subsequent social science analyses. These encompass the fundamental ruptures in society caused by a surfeit of bureaucracy in "The Nose" and, on a more psychological level, the effects of bureaucratization on the individual in "The Overcoat". His stories portray the alienation, futile activity and servility caused in lower level functionaries through problems of loss of identity, the absence of meaningful work and a lack of separation between public and private life. This article uses Gogol's work to intensify and sharpen an exploration of the pathological responses of educational administrators and policy makers to an accountability era of burgeoning bureaucracy that has a profound negative impact on performance.

AB  - To motivate student learning, the affective domain--emotion, attitude, and motivation--must be engaged. We propose a model that is specific to the geosciences with theoretical components of motivation and emotion from the field of educational psychology, and a term we are proposing, "connections with Earth" based on research in the fields of environmental education and art education. When all three of these components (motivation, emotion, and connections with Earth) are combined in the classroom, students may experience greater interest in and connection to the content. This interest and connection may lead to greater motivation to learn and value the content. We use our model to evaluate three practices in geoscience education and show that their demonstrated success in achieving student learning lies in the attention to students' affective needs as well as to delivery of content. We propose a future research agenda using currently developed, validated instruments that can measure these motivational and attitudinal shifts to determine what practices work best for our students from both cognitive and affective perspectives. Although this was conducted in both Europe and the United States, the implications of this research may extend across cultures and nationalities. Additional research needs to be conducted to understand these implications.

AB  - To address shortages of health professional human resources and overcome cultural barriers, interdisciplinary health care teams in most northern Canadian aboriginal communities include paraprofessionals recruited locally. This paper identifies factors fundamental to effective team functioning, arguing for an extension of the information on interdisciplinary practice included in health science education programs to address this issue.

AB  - Polytechnique Montréal has integrated an approach of teamwork in its twelve engineering programs, in the bachelor's degree program since 2005. Students must take a compulsory 45 hours course on teamwork and are then accompanied with team coaching throughout the four years program, in all the engineering integration projects. These integration projects are generally ones in which, over a session, the students work in teams to conceive an engineering project. From the creation of a model of a bridge, to the production of a miniature robot, or the design of an industrial product, the projects are as varied as the teams. Within the framework of these projects (1 per year), a group communication specialist meets every team for approximately 60 minutes. This process promotes the transfer of the accumulated knowledge acquired in the teamwork course to their projects and helps identify the group processes at play in their teamwork dynamics. These meetings incite the members of a team to explain their work method, their internal organization, their decision-making process, as well as to give feedback with the objective of finding solutions and taking action. The specialist, during this type of follow-up, acts as a mentor. Along with these meetings is added a service of "crisis management" for the teams in difficulty. The specialist attempts, with the team, to define as clearly as possible the dynamic and relational aspects of the problems and they focus on helping the group find a solution for better teamwork. During this type of follow-up, the specialist acts as an advisor. Hence, an experiential approach and a solution-oriented approach used throughout the learning process allow the development of skills in teamwork for the students. The objective pursued by this article is to present an innovative formula used by Polytechnique Montréal and to demonstrate by clear examples how it allows the development of skills in teamwork in all the scientific disciplines. In fact, the experiential approach and the approach oriented to the solutions used at Polytechnique Montréal could be transferred in disciplines as varied as design, computer science, engineering or even ergonomics.

AB  - This article describes the TangibleK robotics program for young children. Based on over a decade of research, this program is grounded on the belief that teaching children about the human-made world, the realm of technology and engineering, is as important as teaching them about the natural world, numbers, and letters. The TangibleK program uses robotics as a tool to engage children in developing computational thinking and learning about the engineering design process. It includes a research-based, developmentally appropriate robotics kit that children can use to make robots and program their behaviors. The curriculum has been piloted in kindergarten classrooms and in summer camps and lab settings. The author presents the theoretical framework that informs TangibleK and the "powerful ideas" from computer science and robotics on which the curriculum is based, linking them to other disciplinary areas and developmental characteristics of early childhood. The article concludes with a description of classroom pedagogy and activities, along with assessment tools used to evaluate learning outcomes. (Contains 5 figures and 4 tables.)

AB  - This article presents an innovative approach to diversity education. The approach is multidisciplinary, and it was developed by blending the expertise of anthropological research with the pedagogical skills developed by education specialists. To institutionalize this approach, a unique university-level collaboration occurred between students and faculty from an anthropology department and a college of education. This collaboration facilitated the development of a program that uses a hands-on approach to teach participants about the origin of humans on Earth and the importance of biological diversity. This program has also become a formal component of a teacher education program exposing pre- and in-service teachers to content not usually encountered in their educational careers. Data based on the participation of middle school students indicate that this is a successful strategy for teaching members of our global society an appreciation for and understanding about human diversity.

AB  - This article is a summary of an interdisciplinary research project which had the objective of setting up and implementing "interdisciplinary training for policy dialogue in the field of education". This training focuses on the past, present and future of secondary education in various African and Latin American countries. In describing this work, the author hopes to establish useful interactions with other policy dialogue projects that are presented in this and the preceding issue of "Prospects." This article provides and overview of the development of a research project. Soledad Perez, in her capacity as professor of comparative education at the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences (FPSE) at the University of Geneva, had a major influence on this complex project. Cecilia Braslavsky, in her role as Director of the IBE, was one of the most dynamic initiators and driving forces behind this research. The frank and creative exchange of ideas was enriched by their unique intellectual, methodological and human qualities. The author wishes to describe, as Cecilia and Soledad would have wanted, what has already been achieved and to pay them homage by highlighting their specific contributions to this work.

AB  - This article considers interdisciplinary approaches to education for sustainable development (ESD) in initial teacher training (ITT) partnerships in the light of recent national policy initiatives. In identifying challenges for interdisciplinary innovation, it brings to bear research evidence from three sources: questionnaires sent to ITT partnership schools; questionnaire surveys of geography and science graduate student teachers; and questionnaire surveys of their school mentors. Key findings are that: schools are not yet well developed as sites for student teacher learning in the domain; student teachers generally have greater understanding of sustainable development than their mentors; geography mentors perceive themselves to be better prepared for mentoring in this area than their science counterparts (who feel ill-prepared); for both students and mentors, there are significant gaps in understanding of ESD compared with representations found in the literature. Some implications and possible ways forward for interdisciplinary ESD in teacher education partnerships are discussed. (Contains 4 figures)

AB  - Based on extracts from an ethnography produced during the ESRC 2009-10 research project, ""Preparedness Pedagogies" and Race: An Interdisciplinary Approach," this article explores the racialized culture of civil defence in the UK whilst also critiquing the world of higher education. The ethnographic artefacts of interviews, observations of preparedness role play around fictional character, and of professionals' live reminiscence of emergency, are explored through the lens of the psychoanalytical construction of being "buried alive"; Critical Race Theory (CRT) conceptions of policy constitution of a social world that imprisons the non-white citizen and the other are seen, in this article, as enshrined in this construction. Freud's "The Uncanny" encompasses the psychology of being "buried alive," and one conception of this is seen as a state akin to life in the womb, a strange place of safety. In contrast I use two CRT narratives of resilience auto-education as a way of beginning to analyse different presentations of being "buried alive". I refer, following Royle, to Edgar Allan Poe's "The Premature Burial" and his introductory conception of being "buried alive" as being something that happens to others, about the affective act of burial; in contrast I draw on the chapter entitled "Buried Alive," in the sensation novel "Lady Audley's Secret," a useful metaphor for the eternal live imprisonment of the other facilitated by legal means, ensuring the security of a racially pure, class secure, hetero-normative status quo: the burial of race. This burial within policy is double edged: the shadow character "buried alive" within preparedness and within education haunts the work and is thus more likely to return as evoked by the events of 9/11.

AB  - Minority student disproportionate representation in special education has been debated and (increasingly) studied in the United States for the past 40 years. The purpose of this article is to place this problem in the larger arena of equity studies related to "difference" in educational practice and propose a comparative model to study it. A first step in the creation of a comparative interdisciplinary paradigm is the publication of this special series. The authors theorize the disproportionality problem and critique U.S. research on the topic before introducing the articles included in this issue, which cover six nations on four continents. The authors conclude with a discussion of key themes to include in the next generation of comparative interdisciplinary research on disproportionality. (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - The purpose of this simulation study was to assess the performance of latent variable models that take into account the complex sampling mechanism that often underlies data used in educational, psychological, and other social science research. Analyses were conducted using the multiple indicator multiple cause (MIMIC) model, which is a flexible and effective tool for relating observed and latent variables. The data were simulated in a hierarchical framework (e.g., individuals nested in schools) so that a multilevel modeling approach would be appropriate. Analyses were conducted accounting for and not accounting for the nested data to determine the impact of ignoring such multilevel data structures in full structural equation models. Results highlight the differences in modeling results when the analytic strategy is congruent with the data structure and what occurs when this congruency is absent. Type I error rates and power for the standard and multilevel methods were similar for within-cluster variables and for the multilevel model with between-cluster variables. However, Type I error rates were inflated for the standard approach when modeling between-cluster variables. (Contains 5 figures and 6 tables.)

AB  - Objectives: The authors summarize the pedagogical approaches and curriculum used in the training of clinicians in cultural psychiatry at the Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry, McGill University. Method: We reviewed available published and unpublished reports on the history and development of training in cultural psychiatry at McGill to identify the main orientations, teaching methods, curriculum, and course content. Student evaluations of teaching were reviewed. The training strategies and curriculum are related to the larger social context of Canadian society including the history of migration, current demography, and policies of multiculturalism. Results: The McGill program includes core teaching, clinical rotations, an intensive summer program, and annual Advanced Study Institutes. The interdisciplinary training setting emphasizes general knowledge rather than specific ethnocultural groups, including: understanding the cultural assumptions implicit in psychiatric theory and practice; exploring the clinician's personal and professional identity and social position; evidence-based conceptual frameworks for understanding the interaction of culture and psychopathology; learning to use an expanded version of the cultural formulation in DSM-IV for diagnostic assessment and treatment planning; and developing skills for working with interpreters and culture-brokers, who mediate and interpret the cultural meaning and assumptions of patient and clinician. Conclusion: An approach to cultural psychiatry grounded in basic social science perspectives and in trainees' appreciation of their own background can prepare clinicians to respond effectively to the changing configurations of culture, ethnicity, and identity in contemporary health care settings.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to track the development of fifth-graders' reading and writing skills in the context of ecosystems science content using an action research design. A collection of students' work, a researcher journal, video-taped class sessions, student science journals and a weekly book choice checklist were used as data sources. Student journals, guided note taking and the PAR (Preparation-Assistance-Reflection) Lesson Framework were used for writing activities connected to the science content, and pre-reading activities, PAR Lesson Framework and book choice checklist were used as reading activities related to science content. It was found that interdisciplinary instruction of reading and science offered more advantages to reading than writing and science did to writing. In fact, the constraints of teaching various writing structures in the context of science often outweighed any benefits to either writing or science understanding. Implications include maintaining specific disciplinary instruction when necessary to ensure students meet both science and language arts objectives. (Contains 4 tables and 5 figures.)

AB  - According to the aims of the current junior science curriculum for Hong Kong, students are expected to master inquiry skills for problem-solving, understand the nature of scientific knowledge, and appreciate the limitations of science. These aims are, however, difficult to achieve because available science textbooks focus mainly on the transmission of scientific facts and concepts and most science teachers do not have a good understanding of the nature of science. In order to improve this situation, the Integrated Science course of the Postgraduate Diploma in Education Program of the Faculty of Education, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, has in recent years incorporated a unit that aims at facilitating teachers to construct understanding of the nature of science. This article reports a small-scale study of the effect of this unit on a group of in-service science teachers. The unit consists of a number of historical vignettes that illustrate the process of development of scientific ideas, through which teachers were guided to construct the key steps of the scientific methods and appreciate the nature of scientific knowledge. A pre-test was administered to the subjects to identify their alternative conceptions on the nature of science. Comparison of the scores of the pre-test and post-test indicates that the subjects were found to demonstrate substantial improvement in their understanding of the nature of science after intervention, but some alternative conceptions were still persistent in most subjects. Implications were made for ways to integrate the historical approach into science teaching in schools. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)

AB  - Integrating advanced biological techniques into instruction at non-R1 institutions can prove to be a challenge. Here, we report the creation of a model for the introduction of gene expression microarray technology into a research laboratory. A student assessment tool was used to evaluate: (1) technical skill development; (2) cross-disciplinary issues; (3) development of trouble-shooting skills; and (4) career evaluation. The exposure of "Saccharomyces cerevisiae" yeast cells to three plasticizers served as a template for the introduction of this technology. Cells were harvested at mid-log phase, and RNA was extracted. The mRNA was converted to cDNA by using reverse transcriptase primers containing a capture sequence that was later recognized by a fluorescent dendrimer by using cyanine (Cy)3 or Cy5 dyes. cDNA was hybridized onto yeast microarray chips provided by the Genome Consortium for Active Teaching. Exposure to phthalate plasticizers revealed genes with differential gene expression. Trouble-shooting approaches were used as learning opportunities for the evaluation of RNA extraction methods, and data analysis highlighted the use of mathematics in a molecular biology context. This article describes a promising model for the introduction of interdisciplinary, student-based projects involving microarray technology at non-R1 undergraduate institutions.

AB  - The authors examined teachers' beliefs and classroom practices during a 2-year professional development program that required middle-school teachers to develop, implement, and revise problem-based, interdisciplinary curricula focusing on locally relevant environmental health issues. The results of the study indicate that over the course of the program, teachers' self-efficacy, beliefs about the classroom learning environment, and reported use of reform-based classroom practices increased significantly. The results also indicate that teachers' beliefs about the likelihood of support from the school environment declined significantly, and their outcome expectancy beliefs did not change significantly. The authors offer related data showing the impact of the program on other teacher and student outcomes and advocate for the use of problem-based learning curricula that use local environmental health science issues as an integrative context.

AB  - Quantitative literacy (QL), a relatively new literacy, has the potential to bridge the gap between the literary and scientific cultures. The chasm of the two cultures refers to the gulf and increased polarization between scientists (science) and literary intellectuals or literati (arts). Snow (1959) drew attention to the divide of The Two Cultures and attributed the gap to the inability of scientists and literati to communicate effectively with each other due to deficient knowledge of each others' discipline. Re-education or less specialization in education, according to Snow would facilitate communication between the cultures and promote citizenship, as QL cultivates the authentic application of scientific and mathematical cultural practices (measurement, interpretation, quantitative expression, assertions, reasoning, estimation, analysis, problem solving, etc.) across the arts, humanities, and culture. QL highlights the natural inter-relatedness of the two cultures and serves as a potential bridge in the gap. In addition QL across the arts would provide measurable, yet unobtrusive component of the arts; a pedagogical component that requires no formal training; and a language understood by both literati and scientists. The development of QL has emerged as a task for higher education, mainly because of higher education's emphasis on scholarship and research, model tools in re-education. QL provides an alternative approach to interdisciplinary instruction in higher education and cross curricular projects at the elementary school level. Whereas elementary schools seek to integrate the arts into the sciences, QL draws attention to the sciences and mathematics that inherently exist in the arts. Consequently, QL decreases compartmentalization, enhances meaning in context, and promotes the underpinnings of communication between the two cultures and citizenship.

AB  - In this study, a learning unit on microorganisms for ninth-grade students was developed based on the Science-Technology-Environment-Society (STES) approach. The learning unit contained 15 learning tasks, which were performed in individual and cooperative learning settings, using a variety of teaching/learning methods with an emphasis on the interdisciplinary approach. The study goals were to investigate the impact of the learning unit on ninth-grade students' cognitive and meta-cognitive domains and attitudes toward peace. The sample included 91 students from two classes in villages A and B, and one class of gifted students in Arab schools in the north of Israel. The unit enabled the evaluation of the learning process through students' portfolios, semi-built-in interviews, and closed questionnaires toward environment and peace. Both, quantitative and the qualitative analyses were used. The portfolio content analysis showed a significant improvement on the cognitive and meta-cognitive knowledge of the students, including asking questions, higher order cognitive skills, argumentation skills, self-evaluation and reflection. Triangulation of data assured the high reliability of the results, which revealed a significant improvement in attitudes toward environment and peace. We therefore suggest developing the concept STES to STEPS: Science-Technology-Environment-Peace-Society.

AB  - Calls for reforms in the ways we teach science at all levels, and in all disciplines, are wide spread. The effectiveness of the changes being called for, employment of student-centered, active learning pedagogy, is now well supported by evidence. The relevant data have come from a number of different disciplines that include the learning sciences, cognitive psychology, and educational psychology. There is a growing body of research within specific scientific teaching communities that supports and validates the new approaches to teaching that have been adopted. These data are reviewed, and their applicability to physiology education is discussed. Some of the inherent limitations of research about teaching and learning are also discussed.

AB  - Art provides students a way to visually represent their scientific knowledge and at the same time helps teachers assess student understanding. Examining a drawing allows teachers to scrutinize students' mental model of a science concept. Science can be described as a continuing process of discovering the order and recurring patterns in nature; therefore, science that involves action and the act of creating artistic representations models the very nature of the scientific enterprise. Curriculum integration of art and science makes the connection not only between the disciplines but also more importantly between students and the concepts of science. In this article, the author emphasizes the important role that art plays in the science classroom, and presents examples of science/art activities. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - In this article, we attempt to intersect the interdisciplinary characters of disability studies and gender studies, in order to make sense of the activism and lived knowledge of/with two women with the label of "learning difficulties." Inspired by Deleuze and Guattari's anti-essentialist notion of "devenirs-particules," we find our multiple selves involved in cross-cutting relational storytelling, as such destabilising essentialist, biological determinism towards women with/out the label of "learning difficulties." Thus in becoming femme(s) fatale(s), we make the most of a science capable of grasping the continual interplay between agency, structure and context, creating a "becoming space" where we, as activists with our academic allies, can think and act with one another.

AB  - Nationally, there is a steadily increasing emphasis on the improvement of STEM education. This includes the integration of STEM subjects that have been traditionally taught separately, making it critical that prospective STEM educators are equipped to teach using integrated STEM approaches. Connected, an important challenge is providing preservice STEM teachers with experiences in which they can develop an understanding of how to optimize learning through integrated STEM instruction. A potentially effective way to foster this conceptualization is through video analysis of integrated STEM practices. To investigate this possibility, here we present a semester-long study focused on engaging preservice STEM teachers with observing, analyzing, and reflecting about instructional STEM practices through a video-based intervention. Findings suggest that viewing and reflecting on integrated STEM practices may enhance preservice STEM teachers' conceptions of integrated STEM approaches, representing a practical method of preservice STEM teacher professional development.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of providing preservice teachers the opportunity to collect real data in a science methods inquiry investigation and using the data, design data displays in their mathematics methods course. The research questions focused on how preservice teachers' understandings of data displays, research design, and the specific content addressed improved when they used these displays to attempt to communicate the data they had collected themselves in their inquiry investigations. The 46 preservice teachers were given questionnaires at the beginning and end of the courses, twelve were interviewed both pre and post, all written work pertaining to data displays and the inquiry investigations was collected, methods class sessions were audio and videotaped, and the final data display and science investigation projects were photocopied. The findings show that by creating and scrutinizing their data displays, the preservice teachers were able to recognize the limitations of their inquiry investigation design. Through working with data in the context of inquiry projects of their own design, the preservice teachers realized meaningful connections and commonalities that exist in mathematics and science while strengthening their knowledge and skills in both disciplines.

AB  - The world faces a number of complex challenges that are sometimes referred to as "wicked problems." Universities have been relatively poor at preparing graduates for such challenges, yet it will be the future professionals who need to tackle the problems. This essay looks at two related projects that have attempted to advance the skills training of graduates for a complex world, in the context of educating engineers and scientists in sustainable development. A Delphi study conducted in the UK suggested that systemic, student-centred approaches were vital to the appropriate development of undergraduates to become engineers with skills in sustainable development. A pilot project sponsored by the UK Royal Academy of Engineering developed an inter-disciplinary course unit, using student-centred principles, to embed the principles of sustainable development, in its broadest sense, in the curricula of engineers and scientists. The essay includes an evaluation of this approach.

AB  - In their article "Innovations in Setting Performance Standards for K-12 Test-Based Accountability," Kristen Huff and Barbara S. Plake (2010) lay out three preconditions for continued investment in standard-setting methodology and practice, all focused on the sound development and use of achievement level descriptors (ALDs). Among these preconditions is the use of "empirically-based learning progressions" to inform the articulation of ALDs, drawing upon information about ways in which students make progress towards "more sophisticated, deep understanding". Huff and Plake argue that these ALDs (and, by extension, learning progressions) should then drive test design and item development for educational accountability systems. Learning progressions are proposed as a means of ensuring that students "learn age-appropriate versions of core ideas" through their influence on both curriculum and standards. In this commentary, the author explores several challenges that must be considered in order to make progress toward Huff and Plake's (2010) vision of the way in which learning progressions might inform ALDs and, thus, test design for educational accountability systems. In doing so, the author draws upon recent work on learning progressions in science.

AB  - Logic models are based on linear relationships between program resources, activities, and outcomes, and have been used widely to support both program development and evaluation. While useful in describing some programs, the linear nature of the logic model makes it difficult to capture the complex relationships within larger, multifaceted programs. Causal loop diagrams based on a systems thinking approach can better capture a multidimensional, layered program model while providing a more complete understanding of the relationship between program elements, which enables evaluators to examine influences and dependencies between and within program components. Few studies describe how to conceptualize and apply systems models for educational program evaluation. The goal of this paper is to use our NSF-funded, Interdisciplinary GK-12 project: Bringing Authentic Problem Solving in STEM to Rural Middle Schools to illustrate a systems thinking approach to model a complex educational program to aid in evaluation. GK-12 pairs eight teachers with eight STEM doctoral fellows per program year to implement curricula in middle schools. We demonstrate how systems thinking provides added value by modeling the participant groups, instruments, outcomes, and other factors in ways that enhance the interpretation of quantitative and qualitative data. Limitations of the model include added complexity. Implications include better understanding of interactions and outcomes and analyses reflecting interacting or conflicting variables.

AB  - In this paper I take a positive view of ambiguity in the learning of mathematics. Following Grosholz (2007), I argue that it is not only the arts which exploit ambiguity for creative ends but science and mathematics too. By enabling the juxtaposition of multiple conflicting frames of reference, ambiguity allows novel connections to be made. I describe a classroom episode in which students discuss their understandings of volume and surface area and in which definitional ambiguity plays a significant role. Had precise definitions been offered explicitly beforehand, the potential for rich mathematical thought would have been dramatically diminished.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present a brief review of the various streams of constructivism in studies of education, society, science and technology. It is intended to present a number of answers to the question (what really is constructivism?) in the context of various disciplines from the humanities and the sciences (both natural and social). In particular the discussion will focus on four varieties of constructivism: philosophical, cybernetic, educational, and sociological constructivism.

AB  - No one learns in isolation; learning must be tied to real life experiences that are relevant to the student. "Integrated curriculum, interdisciplinary" and "multidisciplinary curriculum, teaming, standards" and "accountability" are terms with which every educator is familiar. "No Child Left Behind" is the current mantra, and family and consumer services (FCS) fits right into it. Core teachers become aware and surprised that FCS is a thriving "academic" subject with roots in the sciences and math, the arts, and the humanities. Once they understand FCS, teachers and administrators quickly gain new respect for it. The fact is, FCS is a key player in the education of today's students; FCS helps to guarantee that "no child is left behind." The author of this article demonstrates the many creative ways that today's FCS teachers and administrators are integrating the core academics into their curriculum.

AB  - In an effort to examine students' understanding about the structure of boundary conditions in upper-division courses, think-aloud interviews were conducted in the context of both quantum mechanics and electricity and magnetism. In the quantum mechanics task, students were presented with a standard potential step scenario. In the electricity and magnetism task, students were given a classical question about electromagnetic waves at the boundary of two media. The analysis of the interviews was guided by the use of a symbolic forms perspective. In this paper, we report the symbolic forms identified in students' work and provide examples of students' reasoning. Generally speaking, students were able to generate the correct symbolic templates while having difficulties with the underlying conceptual ideas. We also discuss instructional implications from this study.

AB  - This article illustrates the multiple ways in which anthropology graduate students crossed the boundaries of educational discourses by encouraging themselves, other students, activists and community leaders to speak in dialogical contexts (Giroux 2005: 73). They did this through the organisation of the Interrogating Diversity Conference. The authors organised this conference in March 2007 at the American University, Washington, DC, to expand scholarship on surveillance and policing in an egalitarian forum. We discuss how students can engage their departments and faculty in building the students' knowledge of both anthropological theories and methodology through shared scholarship. We show how students can "apply" anthropology to audiences, which will in turn influence policy decision making. In addition, the authors explore how academics can transform knowledge sharing into tools that shape broader political and social dialogue. (Contains 3 notes.)

AB  - In this article, the author shares his experience in incorporating writing into a science curriculum and how to incorporate effective techniques in teaching vocabulary, proper word usage, and reading comprehension skills, all common in a typical English curriculum. As a young teacher, she thought interdisciplinary units had to be extensive, complicated, cotaught units that needed more time and energy to actually implement than the average mortal teacher possessed. However, through the help of an English teacher, she began to learn that interdisciplinary studies did not have to arise from labored sessions of searching for perfect matches between subjects, nor did they require extended, cotaught units. While there may be value in those approaches as well, there is also much to be gained by simple interactions, insertions, and combinations; and by the development of a common language and set of expectations.

AB  - Can art and science find a happy home in the same unit? We think the answer is yes, if the central problem interests the students and allows them to try out multiple abilities. The sixth-grade unit described in this article, which we called "The Dragon Project," grew mainly from two roots, a study of ancient China and a later probe into anatomy and physiology. The host institution was Ross School, located in East Hampton, New York. This campus-style exploratorium is noted for its interdisciplinary studies based on a humanistic core of world cultures. By "interdisciplinary studies" we are referring to problem solving that uses input from several subjects in a way that interests students more than traditional methods and content do (Walker, 2003). In this unit, aesthetics fueled the problem solving. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - Aim/Purpose: This paper presents the preliminary findings of a pilot survey that sought to examine the technology uses, backgrounds, needs, interests, career goals, and professional expectations of Generation Z students enrolled at a minority serving institution in the United States Mid-Atlantic region. Background: Students entering college today are part of Generation Z born in the late 90's through 2016. Known for their short attention spans and heightened ability to multi-task, they already outnumber millennials and are the first true digital natives born during the age of smart phone. Methodology: In the fall of 2017, an online student perception survey was piloted with students enrolled at a mid-Atlantic minority-serving institution. The survey included a combination of dichotomous, Likert-scaled, and ranking questions. The survey was administered electronically using the Survey Monkey system to students following completion of core computer concepts courses and explored their technology backgrounds, skills, perceived computing self-efficacy, and the role they predict technology will play in their future career. The data was subsequently exported to Microsoft Excel and SPSS where descriptive statistical analyses were conducted. Contribution: As Generation Z descends on college campuses, with their technology dominated backgrounds and different communications, learning, and social preferences, it is important to better understand this generation whose needs and expectations will help shape the future of higher education. Additionally, this study also provides research on a population (first-generation minority college students) that is expanding in numbers in higher education and that the literature, reports is impacted negatively by the digital divide and educational inequalities. This paper is timely and relevant and helps to extend our understanding of Generation Z. Findings: The findings show that Generation Z learners enrolled in a minority-serving institution enjoy computer classes, feel that using computers comes easy to them; and perceive themselves as experts in the use of social media, mobile operating systems, using a smart phone, searching the Web, and email. Participants also reported that they want to be more technologically literate, want to be more skilled in computer software applications, and are interested in learning about cyber security. In terms of the future, most respondents also believe that their career will require them to analyze information to inform decision making. Additionally, most stated that information security will be important to their future career. Finally, the results affirmed that college computing courses remain important and that college students recognize that technology will play a crucial role in their career with employers wanting to see job applicants with strong technology skills. Recommendations for Practitioners: Generation Z learners enrolled in higher education need, and want, a wide range of technology courses available to them in order to help them meet the rapidly evolving demands of tomorrow's workplace. Students in this study overwhelmingly see the value in enhancing their technology skills especially in such areas as computer software applications, information management, and cyber security. Recommendation for Researchers: Institutions of higher education should invest in thorough and ongoing examinations of the information and technology literacy skills, needs, and perceptions of students. Impact on Society: Understanding the interests and needs of Generation Z learners is imperative to the future of higher education. Future Research: This survey is a work in progress that is part of a pilot study that is being used to help guide a much more sizable examination of Generation Z learners.

AB  - Students in an interdisciplinary undergraduate introductory course were required to complete a group video project focused on nutrition and healthy eating. A mixed-methods approach to data collection involved observing and rating video footage of group work sessions and individual and focus group interviews. These data were analyzed and used to evaluate the effectiveness of the assignment in light of two student learning outcomes and two student development outcomes at the University of Minnesota. Positive results support the continued inclusion of the project within the course, and recommendthe assignment to other programs as a viable means of promoting both content learning and affective behavioral objectives.

AB  - This article describes steps taken to demystify the writing of chemistry as part of the development of a junior level writing course for chemistry majors at Northern Arizona University (NAU). Although the course is offered by the chemistry department, its conception, development, implementation, and assessment have been the result of an interdisciplinary effort among course-development team members from both chemistry and applied linguistics (the latter housed in NAU's English department). To describe the process of demystifying the writing of chemistry, the authors first provide a brief description of the course that they have developed over the last four years. They then focus on the steps taken thus far to demystify the writing of chemistry for three primary groups: (1) chemistry faculty who have little experience teaching writing; (2) applied linguists, on the course-development team, who have little, if any, chemistry knowledge; and (3) junior-level chemistry students who have had little, if any, exposure to and experience with the professional genres of chemistry.

AB  - This essay argues for the importance of quantitative reasoning skills as part of a liberal education and describes the successful introduction of a mathematics-based quantitative skills course at a small Canadian university. Today's students need quantitative problem-solving skills, to function as adults, professionals, consumers, and citizens in an increasingly information-based society. In spring 2006 the authors were asked by the Faculty of Arts and Science at the university to design and teach a Quantitative Reasoning (QR) course. Their course development focused on three main strands. First, students must have some basic numerical knowledge and skills; they need a good number sense and what Cockcroft called an "at homeness" with numbers, including the number system and the basic arithmetic and algebra of numbers as well as a number of other topics. Beyond this, they want students to gain higher-order skills such as problem solving, modeling, estimation, and communication skills, as part of the critical-thinking skills of liberal education. Students need the first strand to understand numerical data and the second to be able to interpret, evaluate, and use them. Third, attitude and habits of mind are crucial to a student's willingness and ability to engage with quantitative material. Twenty-two students registered for the first offering of the QR course, piloted as Topics Course LibEd 2850, in the spring 2007 semester. This first offering of the course was very challenging to teach. The instructor is a mathematician who teaches a variety of mathematics and statistics courses. In such courses she usually knows quite clearly who the students are: their background, their career goals, exactly what they know and do not know, and what they are likely to find difficult. In this course, the students and their backgrounds were an unknown, and very diverse, group for her. Overall the instructor found the course quite exhilarating to teach. A very good rapport was developed with students, and their enthusiasm fed and was fed by the instructor's love of mathematics and desire to share the knowledge and tools it offers with the students. Student response was very positive, with a number of enthusiastic comments in the math logs and end-of-semester student evaluations about how interesting the historical topics were and how very relevant and useful the financial section was.

AB  - Professionals in family and consumer sciences (FCS) encounter children with an autism diagnosis more frequently than they did in the past, but often have had no specific preparation for working with this population. The Paula and Anthony Rich Center for the Study and Treatment of Autism at Youngstown State University was established to improve the lives of individuals with autism by providing education, research, and support to professionals and families. A professor of FCS, who serves as Academic Coordinator for The Rich Center, facilitates, through a mini-grant fund, faculty involvement with The Rich Center. Collaboration has occurred among disciplines, academic departments, community agencies, faculty, and students. Examples of this interdisciplinary approach are presented.

AB  - The science education literature suggests that the public and students often hold narrow stereotypical views of scientists and science. Here we argue that it is important that students and the public understand the basis on which scientists make scientific claims. The inquiry sought to develop an understanding of the scientific mind, explored through Gauld's (2005) notion of "habits of mind". The vehicle used to explore these ideas consisted of an inquiry into how scientists rationalise conflicts between scientific theories and religious beliefs which are not in agreement with consensually-accepted scientific theories. Twenty scientists from different scientific disciplines and levels of seniority were interviewed using as a basis an instrument containing a series of religious-based item statements that a panel of scientific and religious experts considered were in agreement with a variety of religious doctrines yet in disagreement with current scientific thinking, or for which there is at present no supporting evidence from a variety of scientific disciplines. These statements acted as an interview protocol and formed the basis for interactive discourse, which was audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and participant-validated. These data provide a window into scientific thinking as practiced by modern scientists, and helps develop a picture of these scientists' "habits of mind". The findings suggest that these scientists, unlike their stereotype, hold idiosyncratic views of what constitutes good scientific evidence and sound, credible testimony.

AB  - There are few professional development courses in Australia for the rural sector concerned with climate variability, climate change and sustainable agriculture. The lack of educators with a sound technical background in climate science and its applications in agriculture prevents the delivery of courses either stand-alone or embedded in other courses, and adversely affects the ability of graduating students to apply climate information. This paper presents evidence from a professional development climate course with 20 professional educators and consultants and results from: surveys at the training workshop; from a questionnaire 12 months post-workshop; and a combined interview and survey two years post-workshop. The key finding was that professional development courses specifically addressing climate are essential, while topics should include climate and weather, the impacts of climate on agricultural systems, strategic thinking and planning options available for business. A project undertaken by professionals delivering climate education helped to improve their skills and confidence to deliver other stand-alone climate courses or to embed climate in existing courses. The paper proposes that a suitable resource manual should be 'problem-based' in its design to allow for a broad range of geographic climates, and should address a wide range of agricultural enterprises including livestock production, horticulture and cropping. The authors also propose ways to introduce and integrate applied climate knowledge and skills into the wider community. Possible progress for inter-disciplinary education and the implications from enhancing learning about climate for sustainable agriculture are discussed. (Contains 6 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - How does an African American feminist psychologist develop and promote an interdisciplinary sexuality course placing the experiences of African American women at the center of analysis while simultaneously maintaining its relevance to all students? This article provides answers by explaining how a course's title, perspective, structure, and assignments were developed in ways that attracted students in the social sciences, humanities, women's studies, and African American studies. Furthermore, the course was taught at a state institution in a rural setting with approximately 40,000 students, 12 percent of whom are minorities and students of color.  (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - The Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 mandates that English language proficiency (ELP) standards align with content standards. As the fast-growing population of English learners (ELs) is expected to meet college- and career-ready content standards, the purpose of this article is to highlight key issues in aligning ELP standards with content standards. The overarching question is how to align ELP standards with academically rigorous and language-intensive disciplinary practices of content standards while respecting and maintaining the nature of the discipline within each area. I begin by describing contributions and shortcomings of content standards and ELP standards. Next, I propose consideration of three components in aligning ELP standards with content standards: (a) norms of disciplinary practices across content areas, (b) developmental progressions of disciplinary practices across K-12 grade levels or bands and across content areas, and (c) language use across levels of English proficiency. For each component, the challenges in establishing alignment and potential trade-offs in addressing these challenges are discussed. Finally, I highlight how these challenges present opportunities for substantive collaboration between EL education and content areas to move these fields forward and ensure ELs achieve academically rigorous content standards while developing ELP.

AB  - Several studies have shown significant improvements in the attitudes and perceptions of healthcare professional students toward interprofessional education (IPE) immediately following intervention with IPE courses. However, there remains little evidence on the lasting effects of IPE courses and the long-term influences of these IPE experiences are poorly documented. The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term effects of an intensive, ten-week interprofessional gross anatomy dissection course at McMaster University. Attitudes and perceptions of past participants towards interprofessional learning were evaluated, now that they have started working with other healthcare professionals outside of the IPE course setting. Thirty-four past participants who have clinical experience working in interprofessional settings or are currently working in the healthcare field completed a follow-up questionnaire consisting of a modified Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) and open-ended questions. Quantitative analysis revealed a significant decrease in their attitude towards teamwork and collaboration and respect for other health professions, but a significant improvement in their understanding of roles and responsibilities compared to their results immediately after the IPE intervention. Qualitative analysis of open-ended questions revealed several themes such as developing interprofessional competencies, developing relationships, and remembering the strengths of the IPE dissection course. The results of this study indicate that the IPE experience in anatomy was highly valued by the students and that past participants maintain a clear understanding of their scope of practice, but the reality of clinical practice may have eroded gains made in the program.

Five colleagues brainstormed ideas for teaching a unit on trees for the third grade that would fit in our boxes. The disciplines involved were art, children's literature, science, social studies, and technology. Each person decorated the lunch box for their appropriate discipline and placed instructional items inside. Technology was infused throughout the unit.

AB  - The new Science and Technology Curriculum Framework recently issued in Taiwan advocates the teaching of integrated science and technology with greater emphasis on basic skills. Science teachers are not used to teach in this way, they need different abilities and skills in order to do so. Using various effective professional development strategies, including a collaborative action research approach, the aim of this study was to help science teachers develop professionally through the development of instructional modules on integrated science and technology. A research team was formed consisting of science educators/researchers, graduate assistants and science teachers from six junior high schools in the central area of Taiwan. In order to involve teachers collaboratively over an extended period of time, the entire study went through preparatory, elaborative and disseminative stages for three consecutive years. Various professional development opportunities were built-in. The instructional modules developed were discussed by participants of this study and evaluated by external experts before they were tried out in actual classroom settings. Both qualitative and quantitative methods, including field notes, interviews, observations, video-taping, audio-taping, document analysis, and surveys of students' and teachers' opinions were used to collect data for a closer examination of the effectiveness of the instructional modules and of the increase in teachers' instructional proficiencies. Overall, teachers' interdisciplinary experiences and knowledge increased. They were more flexible and resourceful in using instructional strategies that best fit the instructional settings. Their knowledge and skills in using information and communication technologies in science classrooms also increased considerably.

AB  - It is important for students to have opportunities to experience mathematics in contexts outside of the mathematics classroom. The links between mathematics and other disciplines can help students develop a fuller understanding of mathematics. Problems arising in health, science, and social studies can help students understand ratios, measurement, data, and algebra. Projects in art can help students make sense of shape, symmetry, similarity, and geometric transformations. Activities in language arts can help students develop skills for reading, writing, and discussing mathematics. Such interdisciplinary experiences also help students appreciate the usefulness of mathematics. This article presents a process that middle school mathematics teachers can share with their colleagues to identify ways to incorporate important mathematical concepts and procedures into other subject areas. The authors also discuss what one middle school social studies teacher learned from her experiences supporting mathematics in her classes. (Contains 2 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - A Biomedical Engineering Internship Program conducted within a Comprehensive Cancer Center over a 10 year period was assessed and evaluated. Although this is a non-traditional location for an internship, it is an ideal site for a multidisciplinary training program for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students. We made a systematic and comprehensive effort to assess and evaluate the impact of the internship experiences on trainees' learning. The curriculum centered around six content categories: didactic classes, research skills, clinical experience, communication, tours and demonstrations, and social activities. The students were assessed for this study via three methods: demographics, selected response surveys, and academic outcomes. The assessment data indicate that the Biomedical Engineering Internship Program has been successful in creating a learning environment that integrates medical principles and STEM fundamentals.

AB  - Purpose: This article aims to explain why geography is a prime discipline for analysing globalisation and a multicultural view of Global Studies. The generic approach of human geography to first select an appropriate methodology is taken as a key approach. Design/methodology/approach: Concepts from aggregate disciplines such as history, economics, and geography are scanned through during a short description of the historical genesis of these sciences and the paradigmatic shifts they have encountered. Findings: There are four main theses: (1) values are created by appreciation; (2) development is growing jointly with responsibility; (3) accumulation of material value is seen as expenditure to achieve non-material values; and (4) spatial relations are interrelated with social relations. Research limitations/implications: Conceptual considerations have to be further corroborated by quantitative analyses using suitable metrics of "development". Practical implications: "Social and cultural geography" should contribute to any curriculum of "Global Studies". Social implications: Dialogue and discourse between world views is the essential, ideology-free approach for understanding globalisation. Originality/value: Unlike other scientific articles focusing on "facts", this article focuses on perspectives. Thus, it explains "multi-perspectivity" and a multi-paradigmatic approach.

AB  - In this qualitative research study, we sought to understand teachers' conceptions of integrated mathematics. The participants were teachers in the first year of implementation of a state-mandated, high school integrated mathematics curriculum. The primary data sources for this study included focus group and individual interviews. Through our analysis, we found that the teachers had varied conceptions of what the term integrated meant in reference to mathematics curricula. These varied conceptions led to the development of the Conceptions of Integrated Mathematics Curricula Framework describing the different conceptions of integrated mathematics held by the teachers. The four conceptions--integration by strands, integration by topics, interdisciplinary integration, and contextual integration--refer to the different ideas teachers connect as well as the time frame over which these connections are emphasized. The results indicate that even when teachers use the same integrated mathematics curriculum, they may have varying conceptions of which ideas they are supposed to connect and how these connections can be emphasized. These varied conceptions of integration among teachers may lead students to experience the same adopted curriculum in very different ways.

AB  - Over the past few decades, it has become evident that the natural environment is an entity that humans need to better understand. Environmental education is defined here as the teaching and learning of, and about, nature and human interaction with nature. Traditionally, the environment has been researched and taught about in a piecemeal fashion--studies and instruction in the sciences (hydrology, land cover, soil, atmosphere, etc.) were completely separate from social issues related to the environment. However, a new approach to conducting research has permeated environmental studies whereby a "systems" approach (or a more-holistic view) is utilized that combines ideas and approaches from the sciences and humanities. Some schools are beginning to implement this approach by organizing environmental curricula in a "systems" or holistic manner. This paper provides an application of C.P. Snow's ideas in thinking about how to develop curriculum and teaching strategies that transcend the piecemeal approach (and the corresponding cultures associated with each discipline) and provide a deeper understanding for students of not only the elements of the environment, but also the ways in which they interact and their relationship to social issues.

AB  - This article describes cereal box design, an interdisciplinary graphics activity. The cereal box design activity is intriguing both for its simplicity and the resourcefulness that it can generate in young people. It lends itself to a variety of curriculums. It covers both consumerism and Design for the Environment (DfE) concepts broadly and in depth. The activity introduces a wide range of topics. They include graphic design; basic drawing; sketching and rendering; measurement of area, volume, and weight; technical presentation skills; oral and written reports; the technological design process; applied problem solving; marketing; consumer research; ecopackaging; environmental education; recycling; point-of-purchase displays; and considerations of form, function, and aesthetics. Teachers can easily adapt the activity to serve as an interdisciplinary project throughout the school. Art, math, science, family and consumer sciences, music, health, history, social studies, language arts, English, and computer education each has a logical piece of the puzzle to contribute. Students can have related real world experience through a field trip to a local grocery store. They can research packaging, products, and consumer activity within their own community. Finally--and perhaps best of all--students find this activity fun, rewarding, and interesting. (Contains 1 table and 8 online resources.)

AB  - Literature and medicine is a discipline within medical humanities, which challenges medicine to reconfigure its scientific model to become interdisciplinary, and be disciplined by arts and humanities as well as science. The psychological, emotional, spiritual and physical are inextricably linked in people, inevitably entailing provisionality, disturbance and lack of certainty, and lack of closure and therefore of control. Arts and humanities approaches can foster significant interpretive enquiry into illness, disability, suffering, and care. Reflective expressive writing, undertaken and engaged with critically, and particularly when explorative of narrative and metaphor, can enable professionally developmental enquiry into values, ethics, identity and responsibilities. This article offers examples of reflexivity, reflection, and disciplined questioning of the narrative and perspectival nature of medical and healthcare clinicians' experience. Creative writing is a focus, as art can observe and connect from unconventional angles.

AB  - What happens when an old farmstead, native tall-grass prairie, and middle school students are mixed together? Would one guess learning? That is exactly what is happening in Fergus Falls, Minnesota, where students from a rural middle school have joined with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to restore native tallgrass prairie. In the process, the lines between traditional subject areas are blurring as the local environment becomes the context for integrating science, math, and writing. Growing out of a dream of developing a school located on the prairie where children learn about the natural environment, this partnership is proving that integrated science makes sense. Today, 100 students attend school daily at the Prairie Wetlands Learning Center (PWLC), a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service site. These students, known as the Prairie Science Class, are discovering that using their local environment helps learning come alive and brings new meaning to their study of basic subject areas.

AB  - The article addresses the problem of defining and attributing pedagogic essence to the mechanisms of personality identity development. It is based on the general mechanism of social interaction. Its structure contains, on the one hand, pedagogic interaction, including the forms of pedagogic assistance and pedagogic support; on the other hand, it also contains such components as impulse, perception, manipulation and conclusion (according to G.H. Mead). As a result, with regard to the pedagogic context with specified scientific-methodic supply, we explore local mechanisms of development (stimulating, teaching) of reflection and reflective behavior; acceptance of the Other's role; learning the choice and facilitating a motivated reasonable choice. We review the developmental potential of pedagogics of game, theatrical pedagogics, communicative attack technique, reflective teaching and mentoring, pedagogic support of empathy development, etc., for personality identity development.

AB  - Constructivist learning theory holds that "learning consists less in recording information than in interpreting it. To interpret what is received and is attended to, the learner must personally construct meaning for it." Unfortunately, opportunities for interpreting conceptual information are often lacking in classroom environments--particularly in the area of biological science. By contrast, constructivist environments in science are created by learning experiences that are "active, hands-on, lab-rich, curricularly lean, connected to contexts, and enmeshed in a community of learners." Field-based learning provides an ideal environment for constructivist learning that promotes deep scientific understanding in conservation biology and biodiversity. The "Field Course Experiential Learning Model" evolved from repeated short-term study abroad field course experiences in selected biomes from around the world over a six-year period. This paper reports assessment findings from three cohorts of students participating in a short-term study abroad field course experience in Costa Rica, entitled Environmental Science and Conservation Biology: A Field Study in the Biodiversity of Costa Rica, using the "Field Course Experiential Learning Model" as its pedagogical framework. It describes cognitive and affective learning gains of students participating in the course. (Contains 2 figures and 3 tables.)

The authors discuss the benefits of incorporating reading, writing, and speaking into science instruction. They describe the results of research on two models for combining language arts and science--the Science IDEAS model and the Guided Inquiry supporting Multiple Literacies model--that shows how this strategy can increase both students' science knowledge and their literacy skills.

AB  - A high proportion of PhD candidates in science and engineering fail to complete their degrees. This paper reports the results of a series of workshops where experienced researchers and supervisors were brought together with PhD students to discuss and develop a model of the PhD process. The objective was to help students develop a more rounded and thoughtful approach to their work. The impact of the workshops was assessed by carrying out structured interviews and coding the results to determine the impact on participant perceptions. The analysis suggests that the approach is effective in helping participants to clarify their thinking about the research process in which they are engaged. A proportion of participants appear to have moved from a tactical to a more strategic approach to their research. The study involved students in a postgraduate university but has implications for training of all research students in applied disciplines. (Contains 1 table and 4 figures.)

AB  - The names of many common elements have found their way into the titles of feature films: gold, silver, iron, copper, and lead, for example, appear in hundreds of movie titles. Surprisingly, perhaps, more than two dozen other elements, including iodine, cadmium, zinc, calcium, argon, chlorine, and others, have also been used in film titles. In this article, the authors present a list of films (and a few "shorts") that contain the names of elements in their titles. In many cases, there is a direct chemical significance behind an element's use in the title. For example, in the 2004 film, "The Calcium Kid," Orlando Bloom's character claims he developed strong bones due to a lifetime of milk consumption. In some instances, however, there is little or no scientific reason why an element appears in the title such as the 1998 Bruce Willis thriller "Mercury Rising," in which the "mercury" has no chemical relevance to the film's plot. Nevertheless, movies are an extremely popular form of entertainment, and even if the link to chemistry is tenuous, these can provide interesting cultural examples of chemistry. Suggestions for integrating some titles into classroom lessons or lectures are provided.

AB  - There are concerns that the effective use of interactive whiteboard technology is being inhibited by its use only as a means of presentation. This article looks at the way in which a working group drawn from the university and school areas of mathematics teaching developed materials to enhance the pedagogic use of interactive whiteboard technology. The group worked according to the principles of developmental work research, used mainly in multi-agency social policy planning. The multi-disciplinary, structured and outcome-oriented work was used to support what was considered by the participants to be effective professional development for all participants. Analysis of the approach according to culture, partnership, reflection and conceptual challenge offers evidence that cross-sector experiential learning is mutually beneficial because it enhances both process and outcome.

AB  - This article demonstrates that interdisciplinary alliances on environmental education projects can effectively address the gap between complex environmental problems in the real world and disciplinary curricula in a university. We describe an alliance between an advanced communication course and a general science course wherein we addressed interconnections of energy efficiency, economics, and global climate change with respect to their impact on individuals, local businesses, and society. This project established that an interdisciplinary environmental project focused on local solutions to global problems is both a valuable learning tool for students and an effective method of accelerating the application of appropriate technologies.

AB  - Any science about human beings will inevitably entail the integration of various fields of knowledge--philosophy, biology, medicine, anthropology, psychology, pedagogy, and so on. The term that is coming into increasingly widespread use is "humanitarian knowledge," which makes it possible to focus first and foremost on the study of the human being in all manifestations (both spiritual and corporal), on determining the conditions and characteristics of age-phase development as the subject of one's own life and activity, as a personality. Pedagogical psychology studies, designs, and organizes complex educational processes that serve to socialize the personality by schooling, while fostering the emergence of that personality as an individual in the dynamics of a child's development. A key problem of pedagogical psychology in Russia continues to be the correlation of instruction and mental development. This article examines the content and character of this correlation that has changed a great deal. It discusses the object and methods of the present-day pedagogical psychology and how pedagogical psychology has been developed in the country. (Contains 3 notes.)

AB  - It is becoming increasingly difficult to keep graduate students in forage and range science connected to producers and grazingland resources in the USA. Students must take an integrated systems approach to understanding the complexity of our grazinglands and their role in addressing critical issues. This can best be conveyed to the student by bringing together an array of expertise and providing exposure to diverse sites for these learning opportunities. Thus, a multidisciplinary graduate course was developed for students at U.S. universities that transports students to professionals in different ecoregions, and provides a hands-on approach to grazinglands education. In the first 5 years of the course, 59 students from 12 countries have represented 8 universities in the USA and Mexico. Student responses to the course have been positive. We believe this course fills a niche currently lacking in most graduate programs and provides a unique opportunity for students to interact with experts in every aspect of forage and range science. The personal and professional contacts, cross-cultural interactions, photographs, and potential for career direction are tangible items seldom attained in graduate education.

AB  - This paper explores an approach to problem-oriented, interdisciplinary field-based courses devised by university consortia in southern Africa and Denmark. The SLUSE (Sustainable Land Use and Natural Resource Management) model has been applied on six three-week field courses within southern Africa and trained over 200 students. Student groups composed of individuals from different academic disciplines that investigated problems specifically devised to integrate social and natural science approaches set the stage for an interdisciplinary approach. The field locations are in rural areas that have a legacy of marginalization, poverty and reliance on natural resources for at least part of their livelihoods thus allowing for environmental and natural resource issues to be investigated. Course evaluations show that students feel they gain invaluable exposure to the innovative field-based learning environment created by the SLUSE approach. The main benefit perceived by hosting local communities was an increase in their self-esteem and to harness the knowledge and experience gained from the courses to further enrich their own communities. On reflection, the students value the opportunity to work cross-culturally, and trying new techniques on "real" issues. To many students the personal challenges they face adjusting to the demands of the field course are as important as the academic outputs. (Contains 1 figure, 6 tables and 4 notes.)
