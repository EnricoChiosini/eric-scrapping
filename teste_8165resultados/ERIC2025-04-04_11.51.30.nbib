AB  - This paper presents results from a July 2005 workshop and course aimed at developing an interdisciplinary course on modeling aquatic ecosystems that will provide the next generation of practitioners with critical skills for which formal training is presently lacking. Five different course models were evaluated: (1) fundamentals/general principles of interdisciplinary modeling; (2) modular course; (3) survey of various interdisciplinary models; (4) seminar series of case studies; and (5) the art of modeling. Options 1 and 2 were most popular among workshop participants, while option 4 was the least popular. (Contains 2 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - Business intelligence (BI) and healthcare analytics are the emerging technologies that provide analytical capability to help healthcare industry improve service quality, reduce cost, and manage risks. However, such component on analytical healthcare data processing is largely missed from current healthcare information technology (HIT) or health informatics (HI) curricula. In this paper, we took an initial step to fill this gap. We investigated the current HIT educational programs, BI industry, and healthcare BI job listings, and students' perceptions of BI and how BI could be incorporated into HIT programs. The student survey results showed strong interests from students in a HIT course containing BI components or a BI course specialized in the healthcare context. Based on the student survey and investigation of BI industry and job market, as well as HIT educational programs, we developed a general curriculum framework and exemplar implementation strategies to demonstrate how BI can be incorporated into an HI or HIT program. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first of its kind. Our approach of integrating information from students, the HIT industry and other HIT programs can also be used as a model for general HIT curriculum development and improvement.

AB  - Little that occurs in contemporary academic geography will surprise members of the National Association of Scholars, for a large part of the field has joined the other humanities and social sciences in the bawdy saloon of progressive politics, cultural nihilism, and subjective epistemology. That geographers are in there roistering with the literary critics and women's studiers may surprise those who expect them mainly to be experts in river lengths and major exports, but no one will be surprised by the songs geographers are singing as they clank flagons with other progressive scholars. The authors begin with a description of contemporary cultural geography and close with an analysis. Their description admittedly dwells on striking examples, but these examples are emblematic of pervasive beliefs and attitudes. Not one is fanciful, overdrawn, or anomalous. Radical politics and cultural subversion are not ubiquitous in cultural geography, but they are abundantly present and more than welcome. Here as elsewhere in the university, the prevalent opinion is that there are no enemies to the left (and no intelligent life to the right). This essay may be read simply as a depressing report of the spread of a deplorable fad to yet another academic field, but the authors believe that something more can be learned from the case of cultural geography due to the peculiarities of the field. In their analysis the authors explain why cultural geography has been so susceptible to cultural nihilism, why its small size has made it an easy conquest for progressive politics, and why its peculiar understanding of interdisciplinary research has been favorable to subjective epistemology.

AB  - Background/Context: In the last several decades, a college education, in particular the bachelor's degree, has become the key to higher earnings, and overall, to a middle-class lifestyle in the United States. In an increasingly globalized economy, privileging information and communication technologies, it is more than likely that this emphasis on higher education in the American labor market will continue in the future. While we know much about the increasing link between a college education and social mobility, writ large, we know considerably less about who actually makes the transition to college, how this occurs, and why. Despite the strides made, large numbers of individuals are not making the transition to college. Among those who are, there are important differences in the kinds of postsecondary institutions they are attending, and in completion rates, with attendant implications for social mobility. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This article has two purposes: (1) to synthesize the key facets of our knowledge base of how to expand the college pipeline and relatedly, to outline particular areas that have been under-examined across the disciplines; (2) to provide future directions that will allow us to better address this important inquiry along substantive and methodological lines. Research Design: This article draws on disciplinary papers commissioned by the Social Science Research Council's Transitions to College Committee. The discussion of preparation is framed around the contributions from the fields of anthropology, and political science; access vis-a-vis history, sociology, and demography; paying for college vis-a-vis economics; and completion vis-a-vis the field of higher education. Conclusions/Recommendations: The article calls for an overall integrative model, e.g., K-16 and interdisciplinary, improved coverage in large-scale datasets, and a more refined mixed methods approach to attend to notable gaps in our understandings of the transition to college. Across disciplines, a key substantive gap is variation along the lines of race, ethnicity, immigrant status, gender, and age across domains, which needs to be illuminated.

AB  - How does one develop and deliver the integrated core of a cross-disciplinary arts and sciences undergraduate degree when the degree program has no departmental or college home and no full-time faculty, but plenty of enthusiastic students who are looking for a unique educational experience? This article outlines how a formalized curriculum assessment process performed a crucial infrastructural role in the development and delivery of a program that falls not only between disciplinary cultures but between the traditional cultures of university administration of faculty assignment, faculty evaluation, and curriculum evolution.

AB  - Children in the back seat on a long trip are not the only ones asking the question "Are we there yet?" At Murray State University (MSU) and other universities starting new programs, the question becomes one of validation of the program. In the late 90s, MSU, a midsize university, was entrusted with the responsibility of developing a program of distinction with financial support from special state funds. The objective of this program was to establish a high-quality, interdisciplinary technical and business, undergraduate and graduate curriculum in telecommunications system management. A review of literature concerning academic technology disciplines revealed that most authors agree there is a continuum of computing disciplines from purely technical programs such as Electrical Engineering (EE) to highly business oriented programs such as Management of Information Systems (MIS) with telecommunications falling somewhere within the continuum. As the MSU Telecommunications System Management (TSM) program was conceived to be an interdisciplinary program of business and technology, we have asked ourselves where it resides in this continuum. The focus of our review centered on where the TSM program would fit in the continuum in relation to computer science (CS), information systems (IS), and information technology (IT) programs, all of which are established academic disciplines from which the initial MSU curriculum was drawn. To articulate the unique value the TSM program must provide to its students in order to be recognized as a "program of distinction," MSU needs to know where the program is in relation to established academic disciplines. This paper examines the curriculum directions taken at MSU in the undergraduate Bachelor of Science (BS) and graduate Master of Science (MS) programs several years after its creation, in an extremely dynamic discipline, in order to understand what the TSM program is currently offering students. With this understanding, the TSM BS program was analyzed using the methodology published in the Journal of Information Technology Education Volume 3 article: An empirical comparison of baccalaureate programs in computing (Reichgelt, Lunt, Phelps, Salzinski, & Willis, 2004). Statistical analysis of the TSM program when compared simultaneously to typical computer science (CS), information systems (IS), and information technology (IT) programs indicates there is a significant difference in the program; however, when compared to each of these programs individually, the significant difference was not as strongly indicated. Using this research, a strong empirical argument can be made that the TSM program is different from CS, but empirical arguments that it is significantly different from the average IS or IT programs are not as strong. Therefore, MSU can not use this methodology to articulate its unique value in comparison to IS and IT. The new TSM program, like most new programs in non-established academic disciplines, can be thought of as distinct simply because it was designed to be different, the "old intangible argument". As the academic community does not have an accredited telecommunications model as in CS and IS (Association for Computing Machinery, 2005), nor an emerging one such as in IT (Hart, 2006), how does MSU articulate the value of its program to both students and potential employers using empirical data? Additionally, there is neither an established model such as the Computing Program Academic Model (CPAM) proposed by Anthony (2003), nor an accepted empirical methodology in place to provide MSU a foundation to make a tangible case for the program's value to students and industry.

AB  - Similar in scope and intent to the National Science Education Standards, the Standards for Technological Literacy were conceptualized as a way to bring more consistency and accountability to the varied technology education K-12 content in the United States (International Technology Education Association, 2000). The organization's goal was to continue the reform of technology education from its industrial arts past to an interdisciplinary and academic future, thus ensuring continued support from educational and political leaders. The future of technology education is uncertain. Technology is changing so rapidly that it is difficult for schools to keep up-to-date technologies in the classrooms (Dugger & Naik, 2001). States are using strong local programs to build a case for technology education as a basic core requirement for graduation (Newberry, 2001). These challenges persuaded leaders of the Technology for All Americans Project and the International Technology Education Association to follow the direction of leaders in science and mathematics in developing standards for the field of technology education. The central problem this paper examines is how content standards devised at the national level filter down into classrooms where teachers make the decision to implement or not. A critical element in dissemination of "top-down" standards is the role of district content area supervisors. There is a paucity of research that explores district-level factors that contribute to or hinder facilitation of education reform. Educational leaders have a lack of understanding about how attributes of the supervisors and districts themselves affect implementation of content standards in classrooms. Two potential results from the study are more efficient ways of disseminating educational innovations in the future and identification of districts that will require more concerted training in the standards. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between school district and technology education district-level supervisor variables and the technology education teachers' perceived levels of classroom implementation of the Standards for Technological Literacy in their respective districts.

AB  - Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) has been widely used in both industry and in schools over at least the last twenty years. The Industry Hothousing variant of CPS is an intensive, time-constrained workshop-based process to build mutual trust between customers and industry experts in order to synergically develop creative solutions. The main objective of this research is to determine whether and how Hothousing might be used in schools for developing Collaborative Problem Solving and then promoting industry skills. In particular, we seek to establish the degree of structure and support required to unleash student creativity and enhance learning, and the benefits to students and teachers in learning, cross-curricular applicability and time savings. Hothousing for students is based on an intensive series of workshops including face-to-face and on-line collaboration supported by a facilitator. It is student-driven and addresses an open-ended challenge such as: how do I get my friends to love STEAM? Three collaborative problem-solving case studies were examined with different groups of students. Concerning the degree of structure and support, the analyses revealed that student-led intensive collaboration within a trusted framework drives creativity, and it was a good opportunity to experience real life challenges. Positive benefits to students and teachers were the development of technology skills, and Personal Learning and Thinking Skills (PLTS) as well as the enhancement perception of self and STEAM education. These benefits were cross-curricular providing qualitative and efficiency gains including on-line learning.

AB  - This paper presents a case study of how a teacher and nine-year-old students deal with mathematics in a practical technology project. By analysing videotaped dialogues between teacher and a pair of students working on constructing a house model, we identify challenges of meaningful inclusion of mathematics in the project. The dialogues are analysed in terms of an analytical framework where four categories of interaction patterns are combined with two main paradigms of mathematics teaching: the exercise paradigm and landscapes of interaction. The project in itself has a potential for facilitating landscapes of investigation in mathematics teaching. However, we find that the teacher as well as students adheres to the exercise paradigm when mathematics is involved in the activity. Two illustrating episodes from the project are examined and presented in detail in this paper. The findings illustrate that the conceptions teachers and students hold of what mathematics teaching means can act as an obstacle in attempts to realize mathematics teaching in creative and meaningful contexts for young students. We suggest that making the various purposes of a project more explicit may help overcome this obstacle, and that the mathematics involved might be taught in separate sessions in order to form a constructive part of a cross-curricular project.

AB  - This article considers the influence of official government policy on Czech comparative education, by tracing changes in its ideological and geopolitical orientation, as well as attempts by the Czech education community to sustain a balance in international orientation toward notions of democracy and human progress. The period of the cold war strongly influenced the development of Czech comparative education. It not only altered the direction the field that had been developing after World War II, but afflicted it with the worst consequences of the cold war bipolarity--censorship and isolation. The forced incorporation of the country into the Eastern Bloc had a damaging impact on earlier democratic and humanistic traditions. The expectation that comparative education would become more firmly grounded as a social science was superseded by requirements of conforming to a unified ideology. The time before and during the Prague Spring of 1968 was one of hopeful expectation in Czech comparative education, particularly compared with other periods of the cold war. The intensity of international activities developed steadily. Serious contribution to the constitution of comparative education as a regular field of science was represented by interdisciplinary and internationally based projects, balanced by interest in Western and Eastern education, aimed toward a future, knowledge-based learning society. The late 1980s introduced a less repressive social and political environment, as a product of the process of liberalization in Czechoslovakia and neighboring countries in Central and Eastern Europe. The political reversal of 1989 opened the way to the revitalization of Czech comparative education. Despite serious handicaps left over from the cold war, Czech comparative education has now developed not only as an area of academic research but also as a strategic source for education policy.

AB  - The study and utilisation of pendulum motion has had immense scientific, cultural, horological, philosophical, and educational impact. The International Pendulum Project (IPP) is a collaborative research effort examining this impact, and demonstrating how historical studies of pendulum motion can assist teachers to improve science education by developing enriched curricular material, and by showing connections between pendulum studies and other parts of the school programme especially mathematics, social studies and music. The Project involves about forty researchers in sixteen countries plus a large number of participating school teachers. The pendulum is a universal topic in university mechanics courses, high school science subjects, and elementary school programmes, thus an enriched approach to its study can result in deepened science literacy across the whole educational spectrum. Such literacy will be manifest in a better appreciation of the part played by science in the development of society and culture.

AB  - The focus article by Coburn and Turner (this issue) seeks to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding data use in the context of data-use interventions. This commentary focuses on what the authors see as a glaring omission in what is otherwise a valuable framework: the issue of "useful data." It is their contention that the usefulness of data should not be assumed, especially when it comes to teachers using data to make instructional decisions in their classrooms. Addressing the "useful data" issue will be critical to the success of any data-use framework, not only because teachers rarely get instructionally valuable data, but also because advancements in developmental and learning science provide powerful methods and tools that, for the first time, allow people to create assessments that actually generate the kinds of data teachers would find useful. It would be unfortunate if emerging data-use frameworks did not take this into account. After all, a data-use framework is only as useful as the data that are used to make decisions.

AB  - A continuing debate in the field of education asks whether music should be taught as a separate discipline, having value in and of itself, or in conjunction with other subjects, valued only to the extent that it complements the learning of other material. Many contend that music is a frill and that its inclusion in a high school curriculum can be justified only to the degree that it enhances learning in general and raises standardized test scores in more "highly valued" areas (math, English, science, and social studies). When the economic situation of a locally regulated school district creates hardships, music and art programs are usually the first to be cut. This article discusses how music and social studies have many natural connections that teachers can use to enhance learning in both subjects. Included is a list of online lesson plans and 15 notes.

AB  - In this study, it is aimed to gain the ability to transform what nature offers into a work of art by using traditional methods. The study has two main aims. Its first purpose is to present ways to transfer environmental literacy skills through art education, as a value that should be acquired at an early age. The second is to contribute to the development of hand skills, to gain creativity, to acquire individual skills and to develop basic social skills such as self-confidence, through artistic activities to be applied to the target audience. The participants of the research were carried out with 124 students studying in the 7th and 8th grades of Süleyman Demirel Secondary School located in Gonen District of Isparta. The analysis of the data was carried out using the SPSS 25.00 statistical program using descriptive statistics and simple correlation analysis. In the study, the application methods of traditional handicrafts were combined with materials obtained from nature for the purpose of the study. According to the results obtained; It has been observed that awareness about how nature is transformed into an art object through artistic activities. The activities within the scope of the study were planned as a result exhibition and a total of 13 activity titles under two categories, conceptual and artistic. In artistic activities, it is planned to carry out activities for the transformation of materials collected from nature by using the methods and techniques of traditional handicrafts. In addition to materials that can be collected from nature such as mud, stone and cones, art materials such as felt, wool, natural stone and similar art materials obtained from nature were used in the activities.

Results indicate that student understanding in some areas does not progress beyond the early grades and that the interdisciplinary approach of environmental science increases the possibilities for misconceptions.

AB  - Changes in research production precipitated by the globalization have generally been theorized as applying across nations and disciplinary projects. This article examines the relation of discipline to research production from the situational vantage point of the developing world, specifically the Southern African country of Malawi, and from the empirical perspective of the social sciences. Evidence derives from eight months of ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Malawi in 2003 and 2004, drawing specifically from over 100 formal interviews and from analysis of historical and contemporary documents. The article finds that against depictions of academic disciplines as inflexible, arbitrary, and in need of restructuring, the case of the social sciences in Malawi demonstrates the value of distinctly disciplined expertise in problem-oriented research. This efficacy is, however, precariously dependent on the capacity of local disciplinary communities to regenerate and reproduce their expertise and compete effectively in the increasingly competitive knowledge market.

AB  - This article analyses interim findings of an ongoing action research project into the use of assessment criteria and grade descriptors in the assessment process. The project is multidisciplinary and covers areas as diverse as Sports Sociology, Economics, Youth and Community Studies, and Education. The idea is to equip first-year students with the tools necessary for raising achievement and for matching their own aspirations with what is expected of them in higher education. This is seen as particularly important with widening access attracting a higher proportion of non-traditional entrants with little exposure to higher education. Assimilation into higher education culture is often a fraught encounter and research (Yorke 2001; Yorke and Thomas 2003) suggests that induction into the requirements of individual subjects, curriculum innovation and the integration of academic skills can aid retention. The project offers a variety of methodologies emphasizing the "situated" nature of academic literacy. The immediate benefits from the pilot study of Sports Studies students have already been demonstrated (Bloxham and West 2004) and the longitudinal research now being undertaken will indicate whether the type of intervention discussed below can have lasting effects.

AB  - This article presents a model for the development of an environmentally oriented unit designed to be implemented as an integral part of the science core curriculum. The program's main goal is encouraging students at the junior high-school level to develop systems-thinking and environmental insight as a basis for environmental literacy. A design-based research was employed in order to construct the learning program and improve it in consecutive cycles. The findings indicate that junior high school students who were involved in the learning process--through knowledge integration activities, scientific inquiry, and outdoor learning--achieved a meaningful improvement of their cyclic and systemic understanding of the water cycle. The article concludes with a summary of the program's design elements we recommend using in other programs seeking to foster students' understanding of natural cycles within the context of their influence on people's daily lives, rather than in the isolation of their specific scientific domains. It is suggested that an environmentally based science curriculum should involve authentic, real environmental topics, and at the same time, it should emphasize the role of scientific knowledge and skills that are needed for the development of environmental literacy.

AB  - The boundaries between subject disciplines in secondary education today make it difficult for students to see their subjects in context. However, examining the secondary curriculum in England shows that there are a wealth of opportunities for making links and helping to develop students' epistemic insight and scholarly thought. This article provides concrete examples of these opportunities and offers a view into ongoing research by the LASAR Centre at Canterbury Christ Church University (UK), which supports teachers in bridging subject boundaries through a strategy called Classrooms with Permeable Walls.

AB  - Immune literacy--the ability to hear, learn, read, write, explain, and discuss immunological content with varied audiences--has become critically important in recent years. Yet, with its complex terminology and discipline-specific concepts, educating individuals about the immune system and its role in health and disease may seem daunting. Here, we reflect on how to demystify the discipline and increase its accessibility for a broader audience. To address this, a working group of immunology educators from diverse institutions associated with the research coordination network, ImmunoReach, convened virtually. As a result of these discussions, we request a call to action for a system-level change and present a set of practical recommendations that novice and experienced educators from diverse institutions, professional societies, and policymakers may adopt to foster immune literacy in their classrooms and communities.

AB  - With a heavy dominance on its technical/empirical aspects, the segmented performance, pedagogy, and assessment of Western classical music is undermining its goal of creating art with precision, style, and expressive beauty. This segmentation has its roots in the quantitative assessment processes found in music education and in the note-perfect performance expectations of art organizations. The results are often heard in the uninspired performances of such vital music. As an alternative, an integral performance, educational, and assessment approach (the IPEA model) will be open for discussion. The IPEA model utilizes the concepts of upward causation (science) and downward causation (art) to equalize the elements found in the music quadrants and it continues with their evolutionary track through the "Spiral Dynamics" as designed by Beck and Cowan. An all-quadrant/multilevel pedagogical, performance, and assessment approach will result signaling a major shift in Western classical music by addressing the developmental needs of music students/performers without corroding their technical or expressive strengths. This model bridges the gap between the empirical and the artistic sides of music proposing, perhaps, the perfect marriage of two seemingly opposing cultures: science and art.

AB  - In the context of a 10-day summer camp makerspace experience that employed design-based learning (DBL) strategies, the purpose of this descriptive case study was to better understand the ways in which children use visualization skills to negotiate design as they move back and forth between the world of nondigital design techniques (i.e., drawing, 3-D drawing with hot glue, sculpture, discussion, writing) and digital technologies (i.e., 3-D scanning, 3-D modeling, 3-D printing). Participants included 20 children aged 6-12. This research was guided by Vossoughi, Hooper, and Escudé's (2016) call for explicit attention to pedagogical practices during the integration of "making" activities. Content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data, including observation, researcher/facilitator field notes, think aloud protocols, daily reflective exit tickets, and participant artifacts. Findings highlight the ways in which participants negotiated visualization skills through (a) imagining, drawing, and seeing through creating 2-D sketches, (b) reasoning and relating through writing stories, (c) transforming through 3-D extrusion, (d) observing and noticing through 3-D sculpting and 3-D scanning, and (e) manipulating through digital 3-D modeling, mental rotation, and mental transformation. Implications for formal K-12 educational contexts and teacher preparation programs are discussed.

AB  - "Melioration" is borrowing and using an idea from another field not closely associated with your field of expertise. Using the borrowed concept to address a challenge in your field potentially provides new avenues of action and insight. I borrow the concept of boundary objects from science fields and use it to examine assignments in the college classroom. Through analysis of student-teacher discussion, I become aware that content, not assignment, is the boundary object of interest. Avenues of action and insight opened through that analysis are discussed.

AB  - U.S. high school graduates for whom the home language is not English run the risk of inadequate preparation for the rigors of higher education. Whether this poor preparation is the result of disruptions caused by the transition to a new country/language/culture, or of a watered-down high school curriculum that reacts to language error but does not always help the student develop a rich academic literacy, there is a need for courses and assignments that acknowledge the strengths of multilingual writers and that build fluency and academic literacy in ways that allow students to make meaningful connections with the college curriculum. This article describes a pilot ethnographic research course, life history project designed in collaboration with a professor in Family Social Science and two ESL basic writing instructors.

AB  - Conferences addressing emerging commonalities in the information professions were being held as far back as the early 1980s. At that time, there appeared to be two differing thoughts on the future of the information professions: one that saw the increasing diversification, the other favouring the professions' convergence. Nearly thirty-five years later, we are still discussing the various advantages and disadvantages that a convergence of the information professions and professionals may bring; yet there has been very little empirical evidence gathered to enable us to move forward in this discussion. This conceptual paper uses existing literature to argue that the convergence of galleries, libraries, archives and museums is not a new concept to these institutions, but that they have been linked--philosophically and intellectually at least--for millennia. The intention of this paper is not to articulate what should be included in a GLAM curriculum, or to identify the skills and knowledge required of an information professional in a converged environment, but rather to demonstrate that this research is needed in order to provide an evidence base from which these may be developed.

AB  - Engaging primary and elementary students in meaningful, relevant science learning is challenging. PBL is an instructional approach that provides a means to foster meaningful science learning while enhancing teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). This paper reports on the experiences of a teacher inquiry group consisting of five teachers (K-5) and a university researcher as they adopted a nine-step problem design model to develop PBL experiences. The objectives of the study were to examine how various facets of teachers' pedagogical content knowledge are engaged as they design PBL modules; describe how teachers engage with a nine-step problem design model; and document teachers' perceptions of the strengths and limitations of the nine-step problem design model.

AB  - Problem solving, interpersonal skills, information literacy, and critical and independent thinking are essential qualities that employers seek, yet many undergraduates lack. We structured an interdisciplinary classroom and experiential learning environment where students from three undergraduate courses (Hospitality and Tourism Management, Landscape Architecture, and Forestry and Natural Resources) designed a sustainable community master plan by investigating the economic, social, and environmental components of a U.S. highway relocation project. Interdisciplinary teams of students were charged with a "problem" that was articulated in the form of a Request for Proposals (RFP). This RFP served as the basis for the group work, which required an interdisciplinary approach. The ability of students to work together to complete the project was analyzed using the construct of synergistic knowledge development (SKD), a process by which a group constructively integrates diverse perspectives of individual group members. We posited that SKD would increase over the semester and that SKD would be influenced by various team dynamics such as task conflict, psychological safety, social interaction, attitudes toward problem-based learning (PBL) in a team setting, and behavioral styles of team members. Assessment of SKD and the variables hypothesized to influence it were assessed via a survey administered after the initial phase of the project and a post-project survey. Results confirmed how social interaction, psychological safety, and attitudes toward PBL in a team setting influence SKD.

AB  - This paper investigates the perceptions of the heads of 12 Library and Information Science (LIS) schools on Knowledge Management (KM) education. These heads from North America, Europe and the Pacific region had either been offering KM courses or had an apparent interest in such programs. Data about perceptions were gathered on the nature of their KM coursework, KM positions their graduates might target, interdisciplinary partnerships, strategic partnerships with industry, and practical difficulties in the introduction of KM courses. They were asked to pinpoint difficulties in the areas of faculty availability, student enrollment, resource availability, creation of partnerships, working with professional associations, and interactions with industry. There existed a strong interest in offering KM courses, cultivating collaborations with business and computing schools, and developing strategic partnerships with industry. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - The American Educational Research Association (AERA) 2007 Call for Proposals points out the need for researchers in education to look beyond their usual sources to other fields that have extensive experience in relevant theories and methods. In transitioning from a response to AERA's Call for Proposals to the text of these articles on Assessing Measures of Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching, one cannot help but be struck by (1) the heavy and repeated emphasis on interpretive arguments, their structure, and the relation of interpretation to validity; and (2) the complete lack of any use of, or even reference to, the decades and volumes of research and theorizing that have been invested in these issues in philosophy, history, anthropology, literary studies, sociology, psychology, and, most pointedly, the philosophy, history, and social studies of science. The papers presented in this journal issue provoke precisely the reaction that the authors of AERA's Call for Proposals must also have often experienced when reading research in education. The authors are trying to reinvent concepts, methods, and tools that already have long-standing histories of success and failure in other fields. In this article, the author offers his critique to the papers presented in this journal issue.

AB  - This article focuses on the need for universities as teaching and research organisations, to recognise and act upon a more culturally inclusive interpretation of "sustainable development" and "sustainability". It argues for the valuing of indigenous worldviews as a means of achieving a more holistic and interdisciplinary way of thinking about the Earth as the home of all people and as a complement to the beliefs of western science and rational objective thinking. At a more personal level, it challenges readers, especially academics, to re-examine their own ways of thinking and knowing for the sake of creating sustainable futures that are inclusive in its processes, contexts and outcomes.

AB  - As a requirement of APA accreditation, many PhD programs in applied psychology subscribe to some variant of the scientist-practitioner model. However, critics have argued that integrating science into an applied psychology curriculum may be too challenging a task. This article describes the development of The New School Psychology Bulletin, a student-operated journal dedicated to publishing original research articles written by psychology graduate students. We argue that the process of publishing a student-operated journal can have a positive effect on students' attitudes toward research and has the potential to serve as a model to foster integration of research and training experiences in an applied psychology program.

AB  - In this paper, I introduce the ideas of Sylvia Wynter, in particular, her concepts of "Man" and "After Man." I argue that the M in STEM is implicated in this discursive assemblage, which traces a lineage back to the political economy of mathematics that emerged during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and which is related to plantation economics and logics of underdevelopment. I provide a description of this logic and attempt to unsettle the privileged position of human beings in thinking of an ethics for Mathematics Education. I propose that the M in STEM be oriented towards a goal of "multispecies' flourishing" and an ethics of kinship, which involves structural coupling and partnering with other species. I illustrate some first steps with student curations of their experience of learning to teach mathematics and with my own photographs and experiments in honouring the challenge of this work.

AB  - This paper analyses the phenomena of co-existence of competing moral principles in a university merger. In doing so, the paper builds on Boltanski and Thévenot's theoretical framework of orders of worth to account for the ways in which different social actors, both inside and outside academia, actively engage in justification work to solve disputes arising from mergers between universities. This justification work is empirically explored through illustrative examples involving the university merger between the Universities of Joensuu and Kuopio, which resulted in the establishment of the University of Eastern Finland in 2010. Based on the findings, the paper offers a new micro-level insight into the composition of novel academic communities as well as academic personnel who have to cope with the plurality of moral principles and resolve legitimacy struggles on a day-to-day basis during and after the merger.

AB  - Increasingly recognized as having significant economic and ecological impacts, non-native invasive species have become an important interdisciplinary topic in biological and social science courses. Oceanic island systems like Hawaii have been particularly susceptible to invaders and efforts to prevent further invasions focus on reducing the accidental and purposeful pathways by which harmful species arrive. A proposal that was initiated in 1988 to expand the airport at Kahului to allow direct international flights to Maui was embraced by some residents as a much-needed plan for expanding tourism and providing long-term economic improvements. Others predicted that if flights arrived from a variety of Pacific Rim countries, invasive species would be introduced that could find a suitable new home somewhere in Maui's diverse habitats. Such invaders would likely include new agricultural pests and threats to natural resource conservation, especially to the many endemic species in Haleakala National Park, and hence could have negative long-term impacts on the ecology and quality of life on Maui. We have developed materials based on this on-going, real-world scenario so that students can develop their research, communication, and critical thinking skills through examination of these conflicting ecological and social issues. Used either as a classroom role-playing exercise or as a case study for students working independently, participants will integrate information from biological, geographical, social, and political science  disciplines, while learning how local business and conservation interests can influence, and be influenced by, changes in global trade and transportation.

AB  - The presence of unfamiliar words and expressions in academic texts is a serious obstacle to students reading in a second language. EAP has responded to this challenge by taking the view that there is a common core of academic vocabulary which is frequent across an academic register. This paper briefly considers this view by examining the range, frequency, collocation, and meaning of items on "the Academic Word List" (AWL) in a large multidisciplinary corpus. Our corpus analysis shows that individual lexical items on the list often occur and behave in different ways across disciplines and that words commonly contribute to "lexical bundles" which also reflect disciplinary preferences. Our findings question the widely held assumption that there is a single core vocabulary needed for academic study and suggests that teachers should assist students towards developing a more restricted, disciplinary-based lexical repertoire.

AB  - When teachers ask upper middle school and high school students what they know about the Westward movement, the students usually draw on their experiences with simulation games. Rather than rely on simulation games or texts to help students understand that era, these authors advocate moving middle or high school students from a simplistic to a sophisticated view of the Westward movement. By drawing on activities from primary and secondary sources, a teacher can ground the study of that historical period through the integration of data analysis, science, and geography. They believe the integration of interdisciplinary subjects is critical for student learning. In the rapidly changing world, educators can no longer afford the luxury of compartmentalized teaching; students need to appreciate the interconnectedness of knowledge so they can solve the complex problems that they will face. This article describes how an in-depth study and analysis of the Donner Party can help students gain a realistic understanding of the westward expansion era. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)

AB  - Foreign language (FL) aptitude generally refers to a specific talent for learning a foreign or second language (L2). After experiencing a long period of marginalized interest, FL aptitude research in recent years has witnessed renewed enthusiasm across the disciplines of educational psychology, second language acquisition (SLA) and cognitive neuroscience. This paper sets out to offer a historical and an updated account of this recent progress in FL aptitude theory development and research. As its subtitle indicates, the paper centres on three major issues: following the introduction and clarification of basic concepts, Section 1 traces the early conceptions of FL aptitude dominated by John Carroll's pioneering work. Section 2 summarizes and examines more recent theoretical perspectives and FL aptitude models proposed by researchers from multiple disciplines that have significantly broadened the conventional research traditions associated with Carroll's original conception. Based on the research synthesis of current FL aptitude models, Section 3 suggests the directions FL aptitude theory and research might take in coming years. We conclude that a working memory perspective on FL aptitude presents one promising avenue for advance, as does the development of new aptitude tests to predict speed of automatization, implicit learning and greater control over an emerging language system. In addition, it is argued that issues of domain-specificity versus domain-generality for aptitude tests may lead to aptitude theory and research becoming more central in applied linguistics.

AB  - At the University of Maryland, an interdisciplinary team of researchers from information studies, computer science, education, art, and psychology worked with seven children (ages seven to eleven) to design a new digital library for children. This partnership led to new approaches for collection development, cataloging (metadata standards), and new technologies for information access and use. The team validated the importance of working with children by analyzing the results of Weblogs, surveys, and lab user studies. This article presents a discussion of the interdisciplinary research landscape that contributes to an understanding of digital libraries for children, examines a case study on the development of the International Children's Digital Library, and discusses the implications from this research as they relate to new technology design methods with children and new directions for future digital libraries.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research is being promoted in many quarters as the way forward, but "research islands" still persist. Taking computer-assisted learning (CAL) within health sciences as a case in point, this paper describes a detailed study of the references to source material within papers published in general medical, specific nursing and general information and communications technology journals as pointing to papers published either in the same category of journal or journals of other categories. The results show that research within this area exhibits a disquieting inbred approach. Furthermore, there is clear evidence of a tendency amongst the papers examined to cite research published in journals with broadly the same impact factors as the journal in which the papers themselves are published. A discussion of the value of journal impact factors, which are a crude but useful index of the quality of journal, and their possible effect on the future of research in CAL within health sciences is embedded in the paper.

AB  - On January 18, 1803 President Thomas Jefferson asked Congress to fund an expedition to the source of the Missouri River. This expedition would become known as the Corps of Discovery, which would spend twenty-eight months exploring, studying, and documenting the wonders of the western frontier. Led by Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, the expedition is a landmark of American history. It exemplifies the challenges of westward expansion (which included issues in international relations, economic competition, cross-cultural communication, and physical endurance) as revealed through the journals of several members of the Corps. In January of 2003, the celebration to commemorate the bicentennial of the Corps of Discovery's expedition began at Jefferson's Monticello home in Charlottesville, Virginia. Many celebrations and commemorations of the expedition will be held over the next three years. One of them could be held at your middle school. Kristy Brugar, teaches seventh grade American Studies and is the Social Science Subject Coordinator at Cranbrook Kingswood Boys Middle School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. In this article she shares the excitement, empathy and many learning opportunities her 7th grade classes experienced as they participated in the annual "Lewis & Clark Day" celebrations.

AB  - One of the outcomes of the policy emphasis upon skills formation in countries like Australia and the UK has been an increase in cross-disciplinary structured programs for higher research degrees raising implicit, but often unexamined, questions about the curriculum and expertise that should inform them. Key insights from applied linguistics and composition studies about disciplinary similarities and differences and writing pedagogy for the development of university-wide structured programs are discussed in the article. In addition, student evaluations of two "social sciences, humanities and business" writing programs that were developed to reflect these insights are reported. The findings are read to suggest that the framework within which research training is conceptualized must consider not only the diversity of domains and activities that characterise higher degree research, but the communicative purposes against which research texts are evaluated and differentiated. The overlapping and contrasting nature of these purposes suggests collaborations among specific discipline groups in structured program provision within the research degree cohort, rather than the local/general research training split that is often assumed.

AB  - Although science and technology are often characterized as contrasting and have some dissimilarities, they are ultimately reciprocal endeavors. Liberal education and vocational training have shortsightedly guided curricula away from the development of leaders, toward mechanistic training. Science and technology need both traditional liberal and vocational education for a healthy society. (MSE)

AB  - More and more technical universities now advocate integrating sustainability in higher education and including it as a strategic goal for improving education's quality and relevance to society. This study examines 30 fourth-year chemical engineering students, graduates of a university course designed to combine their terminological domain with sustainability-oriented goals, focusing on topics like corporate sustainability, developing environmental policy, introduction to ISO 14001--Environmental Management Systems (EMS), and environmental legislation. The study explores their perception of industrial-environmental issues and asks--How did the study unit influence the students' ability to use their preexisting scientific knowledge, while relating to industrial-environmental issues? Our findings indicate that engineering students can develop industrial-environmental awareness, and make use of interdisciplinary knowledge beyond that strictly related to the realm of engineering. Regarding the research's particular aim--i.e. determining the study unit's influence on students' ability to relate industrial-environmental issues to their own field of engineering--the findings indeed show a change in the students' conceptions of environmental elements related to industry. The course graduates became more attentive to the environmental aspects associated with building and opening a factory, and the concepts they raised in connection with the topic gained in variety.

AB  - This article describes a university-sponsored experiential-based simulation, the NANO SCENARIO, to increase the public's awareness and affect attitudes on the societal implications of nanoscience and nanotechnology by bringing together diverse stakeholders' perspectives in a participatory learning environment. Nanotechnology has the potential for massive societal effects across all sectors, globally. Thus, new forms of education are needed to prepare members of society for making complex decisions about policy, governance, and values. Here, the authors examine the theoretical and conceptual framework of the simulation, which uses improvised role-play and perspective-taking to engage the public in a transformative learning experience. As part of this examination, they describe the uses and constraints of simulations with open-ended goals and without competition and prescribed rules. They believe educational role-play scenarios with active participation of the public can serve as a dynamic method for civic engagement across a range of complex, interdisciplinary topics and new technological dilemmas.

AB  - Over the past 27 years, the influence of technology has revolutionized the professional practice of Design and its products produced. At the same time, technology has also created more advanced and complex pedagogy for design education. However regardless of technology's influence, critical thinking, problem solving, and presentation are still founding principles that must be explored, experienced, and comprehended. In the United States, primary and secondary educational institutions do not focus on Design per se, they have Graphics, Architectural Drafting, and Photography listed under "Tech Ed." Colleges and universities vary based on how many different design disciplines they offer. Some have entire schools devoted to design or large departments that offer a multitude of options. Other smaller programs offer Graphic Design under "Commercial Arts" or within "Marketing Communications" departments. At the present time, technological influence or the connection to business are the main identifiers for affiliation. I believe Design should be used to create a more whole-minded educational experience. It blends both science and technology with art and humanities--a dynamic integration. From the initial visualization to the final presentation, a project can employ reading and research, math, drawing a concept, technological production, writing an argument, collaboration, and presenting the project. I will present examples of successful integrated learning experiences that yield both amateur and professional results as well as create exciting learning environments for students and professionals alike.

AB  - There is increasing recognition of multiprofessional learning in anatomy and its role in medical and healthcare professions. This study utilized two components to investigate anatomy interprofessional education (AIPE) in the United Kingdom and Ireland. First, a survey involving qualitative and quantitative components asked Heads of Anatomy to report on their institutions' uptake of AIPE. Second, a series of case studies explored the experiences of students by using evaluation forms and an in-depth analysis of thematic concepts to understand the learners' perspectives on designing and delivering AIPE. Out of the 13 institutions that took part in the survey, eight did not offer an AIPE program. Between the remaining five institutions that deliver AIPE programs, 10 different modules are offered with the majority involving healthcare professions. The AIPE component is rated highly by students. The themes from the case studies highlight how valuable AIPE is from the student perspective both in terms of engaging them in anatomy as well as in the broader skills of teamwork and communication. The case studies also revealed how AIPE can be engaging for groups of students who might not have previously had access to cadaveric anatomy, for example, engineers and archeologists. The results of this study have implications for curriculum design in medicine and healthcare but also for further engagement of professional groups from non-healthcare backgrounds.

AB  - Science and mathematics education needs to serve several (possibly contradictory) motivating goals. One is found in the movement for a universal literacy in the central principles and methods of the disciplines. The second is the need to provide the experiences and background that makes possible the production of scientists and engineers. A complication in both efforts is that the formal education takes place over many years, and the application of the layers of information, understanding, and sophistication need also be aware of the age of the student and what has come before. These efforts require clear ideas as to the end goal of the process and attention to assessment. Receiving less attention is the need to also feed and nurture the creative side of those who would become professionals, as creative approaches will be a central and necessary aspect of their work and thought. In this paper, I address the use of a course in mathematical modeling taught over a period of 25 years to undergraduate students of mathematics, mathematics education, computer science, and engineering, as a method to open up creative pathways. Through an historical discussion of the role and nature of creativity in the sciences and mathematics, a process to have students find their creative voice is described in the context of this course.

AB  - This article describes a university-sponsored experiential-based simulation, the NANO SCENARIO, to increase the public's awareness and affect attitudes on the societal implications of nanoscience and nanotechnology by bringing together diverse stakeholders' perspectives in a participatory learning environment. Nanotechnology has the potential for massive societal effects across all sectors, globally. Thus, new forms of education are needed to prepare members of society for making complex decisions about policy, governance, and values. Here, the authors examine the theoretical and conceptual framework of the simulation, which uses improvised role-play and perspective-taking to engage the public in a transformative learning experience. As part of this examination, they describe the uses and constraints of simulations with open-ended goals and without competition and prescribed rules. They believe educational role-play scenarios with active participation of the public can serve as a dynamic method for civic engagement across a range of complex, interdisciplinary topics and new technological dilemmas.

AB  - Spiders and insects are studied in both Navajo Studies and science classes at a middle school in New Mexico. In Navajo Studies, students learn the names of ground-dwelling insects and the connection between those names and traditional Navajo stories. In science class, students study arthropods to illustrate taxonomy of life, trophic and biological behaviors, and seasonal population dynamics. (PVD)

AB  - With such curriculum gaps, it is hardly surprising that middle school children's understanding of botany is limited and riddled with misconceptions. Knowing that plants supply the oxygen to sustain most life forms and provide the primary energy source of most food webs is a core idea of science. Investigating non-native species is one way to "invade" the science curriculum with the study of plants. Despite the dire ecological consequences of invasive species, few curriculum materials address this topic in a substantive manner. The Alien Invaders activity based on the 5E learning cycle uses interdisciplinary and community-based activities to give students a beginner's level understanding of plant adaptations and a comprehensive overview of the serious ecological problem of invasive species. Lessons include elements of guided scientific inquiry and offer motivational learning experiences that are ideal for middle school students. Numerous opportunities for oral and written expression are included. This activity relies heavily on educational resources drawn from the internet and incorporates opportunities to make literacy connections.

AB  - Using citation analysis, the authors examined the journals cited in theses and dissertations over the first five years of the Water Resources Graduate Program at Oregon State University. These journal titles were compared to the titles predicted as being important in the 2003 Oregon State University Libraries new program (Category I) review. A preliminary core list of journals for this highly interdisciplinary program had been created for the Category I review from faculty publications, "Journal Citation Reports", and Interlibrary Loan (ILL) requests. Through comparison of the citations in the students' works with the data compiled for the Category I, and a review of current ILL requests, the authors address whether the initial review predicted student use, which sources were most valuable for predicting use, and how analysis of student citations can add to the strength of the original core journal list.

AB  - Gender is an essential determinant of health and illness. Gender awareness in doctors contributes to equity and equality in health and aims towards better health for men and women. Nevertheless, gender has largely been ignored in medicine. First, it is stated that medicine was "gender blind" by not considering gender whenever relevant. Secondly, medicine is said to be "male biased" because the largest body of knowledge on health and illness is about men and their health. Thirdly, gender role ideology negatively influences treatment and health outcomes. Finally, gender inequality has been overlooked as a determinant of health and illness. The uptake of gender issues in medical education brings about specific challenges for several reasons. For instance, the political-ideological connotations of gender issues create resistance especially in traditionalists in medical schools. Secondly, it is necessary to clarify which gender issues must be integrated in which domains. Also, some are interdisciplinary issues and as such more difficult to integrate. Finally, schools need assistance with implementation. The integration of psychosocial issues along with biomedical ones in clinical cases, the dissemination of literature and education material, staff education, and efforts towards structural embedding of gender in curricula are determining factors for successful implementation. Gender equity is not a spontaneous process. Medical education provides specific opportunities that may contribute to transformation for medical schools educate future doctors for future patients in future settings. Consequently, future benefits legitimize the integration of gender as a qualitative investment in medical education.

AB  - In this article, the authors describe how an existing partnership between two communities, one in eastern Iowa and one in Mexico, was turned into a cross-disciplinary and international service learning course for students in the University of Iowa Colleges of Engineering, Pharmacy, and Liberal Arts and Sciences. The projects that students worked on through the service-learning component of their university courses were directly related to the development needs the Mexican community had identified. The authors discuss the benefits of the initiative for both communities and make suggestions for how it could be enhanced in the future.

AB  - Despite significant advances in the field of social neuroscience, much remains to be understood regarding the development and maintenance of social skills across the life span. Few comprehensive models exist that integrate multidisciplinary perspectives and explain the multitude of factors that influence the emergence and expression of social skills. Here, a developmental biopsychosocial model (SOCIAL) is offered that incorporates the biological underpinnings and socio-cognitive skills that underlie social function (attention/executive function, communication, socio-emotional skills), as well as the internal and external (environmental) factors that mediate these skills. The components of the model are discussed in the context of the social brain network and are supported by evidence from 3 conditions known to affect social functioning (autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and traumatic brain injury). This integrative model is intended to provide a theoretical structure for understanding the origins of social dysfunction and the factors that influence the emergence of social skills through childhood and adolescence in both healthy and clinical populations.

AB  - This study addresses the need in discourse psychology for computational techniques that analyze text on multiple levels of cohesion and text difficulty. Discourse psychologists often investigate phenomena related to discourse processing using lengthy texts containing multiple paragraphs, as opposed to single word and sentence stimuli. Characterizing such texts in terms of cohesion and coherence is challenging. Some computational tools are available, but they are either fragmented over different databases or they assess single, specific features of text. Coh-Metrix is a computational linguistic tool that measures text cohesion and text difficulty on a range of word, sentence, paragraph, and discourse dimensions. This study investigated the validity of Coh-Metrix as a measure of cohesion in text using stimuli from published discourse psychology studies as a benchmark. Results showed that Coh-Metrix indexes of cohesion (individually and combined) significantly distinguished the high- versus low-cohesion versions of these texts. The results also showed that commonly used readability indexes (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid) inappropriately distinguished between low- and high-cohesion texts. These results provide a validation of Coh-Metrix, thereby paving the way for its use by researchers in cognitive science, discourse processes, and education, as well as for textbook writers, professionals in instructional design, and instructors.

AB  - In this "Seventeenth Delphine Hanna Commemorative Lecture," Boyce draws on the legacy of Delphine Hanna's work in science-based curriculum to address the need for today's educators to balance both professional mission and disciplinary knowledge. In the mid 1960s, Franklin Henry proposed the notion that the foundation of physical education/kinesiology should be centered on a scientific knowledge base in lieu of the previously held notion of the professional mission. The proponents of the scientific knowledge base created new and exciting subdiscipline areas (e.g., biomechanics, exercise physiology, exercise and sport psychology, motor development, and motor learning), and with them came a caste system that has existed for over 40 years in which the scientists were somehow superior to the rest of the folks in the professionally oriented community. One of the outcomes of this growing number of subdisciplines in kinesiology was the significant reduction in the number of faculty with professional emphasis in major research universities. This imbalance has caused fragmentation in the field, which has not been beneficial for most in the profession. This continued imbalance has come at a time when there is a need to address serious health issues that plague society. The solutions to these pressing health challenges lie not only in interdisciplinary research that helps seek out answers, but also in the delivery of these health solutions by professionals in the field. Boyce states her belief that practitioners must seek to integrate their mission with the missions of  universities and the greater needs of society. To do this, there must be a clear picture regarding the missions of the universities. Only then can a kinesiology vision centered on the multifaceted contributions of physical activity that can contribute to the betterment of society be created.

AB  - Reform efforts have renewed attention to science and mathematics integration and brought to the surface varied definitions of "integrated,""interdisciplinary," and "thematic." In an attempt to clarify the meaning of integration, eight manuscripts are presented that clearly indicate that the inconsistent use of language continues to exist and has significant implications for curricular organization, instruction, and assessment that extend well beyond simple semantic concerns.

AB  - Wood education programs across the nation, at and below the secondary levels of education, have declined in enrollment in recent years. To many, wood education means only carpentry or woodworking. A systematic approach to the subject, as a part of a materials science course, can reverse the material's negative connotation and make wood education very attractive for most schools. A study of wood that includes structure, properties, and processes provides a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach, and could serve as a platform for building a strong awareness of materials and design considerations. It could also address the standards for technological literacy laid out by the International Technology Education Association. This article discusses the structure, properties, and processes related to wood technology and identifies generic laboratory apparatus for use in each study, as well as a variety of basic sample activities. (Includes 4 Internet resources.)

AB  - This project was developed as an interdisciplinary application of the optimization of a single-variable function. It was used in a freshman-level single-variable calculus course. After the first month of the course, students had been exposed to the concepts of the derivative as a rate of change, average and instantaneous velocities, derivatives of exponential functions, the chain rule, and single-variable optimization problems. They had also begun to use a computer algebra system to explore functions graphically, estimate local extrema, and differentiate functions. Prior to taking this course, all students had completed a course in mathematical modeling with an introduction to differential calculus. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - Increasing the inclusion of underrepresented individuals in coding is an intractable problem, with a variety of initiatives trying to improve the situation. Many of these initiatives involve STEAM education, which combines the arts with traditional STEM disciplines. Evidence is emerging that this approach is making headway on this complex problem. We present one such initiative, iLumiDance Coding, which attempts to pique the interest and increase confidence of students in coding, by combining it with a fun and physical activity: dance. The connections between dance and coding, while not immediately obvious, are authentic, and we hypothesize that this approach will increase student comfort level with coding. We used student surveys of attitudes toward coding and a variety of statistical approaches to analyze our initiative. Each analysis showed a positive effect on student comfort level with coding. These results are useful for both educators and researchers since they contribute to a deeper understanding of how to increase interest in coding, which we hope will lead to an increase in representation.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare attitudes and practices among general music teachers in Japan (n = 135) and the USA (n = 136) concerning the integration of music with other academic subjects. Teachers completed a researcher-designed questionnaire, and results revealed significant differences in both areas. Music teachers from the USA obtained higher attitude ratings towards the use of music integration, while music teachers in Japan integrated music with other subjects to a lesser extent. Teachers in both countries were most likely to integrate music with reading, language, science and math. History and social science integration with music was the least common area of integration among Japanese music teachers, while among American music teachers the practice of integrating music into history and social science content was more common. Several of the attitude correlations (i.e. science and mathematics integration, art integration) were not significantly related among Japanese teachers. (Contains 4 tables and 1 note.)
