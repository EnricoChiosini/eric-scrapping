AB  - Ensuring that learning is participatory and even further democratized seems particularly important at a time when people are kept apart because of a COVID-19 pandemic that thrives on proximity. Whilst learning is based on exchanges, it also benefits from the existence of a learning community, the access to which needs to be equal and taking account of learners' diversity. How is Higher Education equipping itself to adapt to new learning conditions? How can it ensure that it can meet new types of needs? To address these questions, a workshop was organized at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Research on Education and Development (CeiED), Lisbon, on an emerging area of research called 'Citizen Science'. Citizen Science has been gaining popularity in many disciplines. Here, we are interested in how it could help to improve education and learning, as well as how current research in education might also help approaches in Citizen Science to move forward. Reflections on theory were carried out in parallel with a one-day practical online workshop on 'operationalizing Citizen Science', involving researchers in the center's three areas -- education, museology, and urbanism. This article explains the outcomes of this event.

AB  - Recently, there has been a trend towards adding a multidisciplinary or multicultural element to traditional monodisciplinary project courses in computing and engineering. In this article, we examine the implications of multidisciplinarity for students' learning experiences during a one-semester project course for real customers. We use a qualitative research approach and base our analysis on students' learning reports on three instances of a project course titled "Multidisciplinary working life project". The main contribution of this article is the unified theoretical picture of the learning mechanisms stemming from multidisciplinarity. Our main conclusions are that (1) students generally have a positive view of multidisciplinarity; (2) multidisciplinary teams enable students to better identify their own expertise, which leads to increased occupational identity; and (3) learning experiences are not fixed, as team spirit and student attitude play an important role in how students react to challenging situations arising from introduction of the multidisciplinarity.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an increased interest in conceptual blending in physics and mathematics education research as a theoretical framework to study student reasoning. In this paper, we adapt the conceptual blending framework to construct a blending diagram that not only captures the product but also the process of student reasoning when they interpret a mathematical description of a physical system. We describe how to construct a dynamic blending diagram (DBD) and illustrate this using two cases from an interview study. In the interview, we asked pairs of undergraduate physics and mathematics students about the physical meaning of boundary conditions for the heat equation. The selected examples show different aspects of the DBD as an analysis method. We show that by using a DBD, we can judge the degree to which students integrate their understandings of mathematics and physics. The DBD also enables the reader to follow the line of reasoning of the students. Moreover, a DBD can be used to diagnose difficulties in student reasoning.

AB  - Science education has historically been viewed both as a tool to advance competitiveness as well as to improve the human condition. However, science education as it is enacted at a systemic level often presents itself in over-simplified (and typically Westernized) form that does not fully lend teachers and students the opportunity to explore the relationship between science and peace. This article explores science education literature through the lens of peace education frameworks to look for opportunities to explicitly acknowledge the possibility for the integration between these two fields. The review revealed four major themes in science education literature with connections to peace education, including (1) 'science for all' initiatives, (2) science-technology-society and socio-scientific issues movements, (3) decolonization and diversity, and (4) science education as political activism. This article provides recommendations for emphasizing these themes in the context of science education standards, teaching resources, and teacher education programs.

AB  - This article aims to analyze the potential of new technologies in the area of green chemistry didactics. When viewed through the lens of systems thinking, the use of these ubiquitous tools can be a driving force for the development of a sustainable world because of their global use and reach. The authors concentrate on flat e-learning platforms, social media tools, virtual reality platforms, and machinima, as these tools enable learners to participate in different interdisciplinary topics and exercise habits that trigger behavioral changes through learning by doing or learning from mistakes. To demonstrate the potential of innovative didactic tools, examples of mini scenarios for the development of chemistry lessons are provided, and these scenarios promote the sustainability concept and systems thinking. The authors conclude that the pursuit of sustainability goals in chemistry education should involve extended thinking about instructional design and asymmetries in technology use, as well as incorporate green teaching into the principles of green chemistry.

AB  - This article discusses two multidisciplinary courses created at the Colorado School of Mines that were developed to integrate ethics into the first-year engineering curriculum: "Nature and Human Values" (NHV) and "Innovation and Discovery in Engineering, Arts, and Sciences" (IDEAS). In both NHV and IDEAS, our objectives are to meaningfully integrate personal and professional ethics within a larger context of integrating humanities and social sciences with engineering curricula. We teach students how to apply ethical reasoning in support of engineering solutions through user empathy, problem definition, stakeholder engagement, communication of outcomes, and analysis of contexts and impacts. In the process, we emphasize personal morals, professional ethics, and environmental ethics via literary readings and case studies that have a strong central narrative of engineering and/or environmental impacts. Students practice close reading and analysis, communication in many rhetorical modes, and evaluation of and reflection about the wider contexts and effects of design solutions. These practices, as well as course assessments, enable a focus on synthesis across learning outcomes. Collaboration between faculty from many disciplinary areas as well as student teamwork and group projects also supports this synthesis, and reflective portfolios encourage students to explore their ideas at different learning stages and to review their own perceptions and decisions over time. Our overall theory of change is to simultaneously infuse engineering problem solving with values-sensitive analysis and design, requiring communication skills and ethical reasoning at every step.

AB  - St. Lawrence University received a five-year Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to create the multidisciplinary Liberal Arts Science Scholars program (award #1458712), which makes a high quality science and mathematics education accessible to high achieving, Pell Grant eligible students by providing merit scholarships and specialized supports. The program's supports, which are not specific to any one discipline, are designed to combat three of the main barriers to STEM persistence: capacity, interest, and belonging. This paper describes the first year of the Liberal Arts Science Scholars program and provides preliminary evidence for the program's ability to serve as a model for improving the retention and academic success of low-income students in the natural, physical, and mathematical sciences. While the Liberal Arts Science Scholars Program was implemented at a small, private liberal arts university, the supports described could be adapted for use at any type of institution.

AB  - The complexity of digital and online education is becoming increasingly evident in the context of research into networked learning/participation. Interdisciplinary research is often proposed as a way to address complex scientific problems and enable researchers to bring novel perspectives into a field other than their own. The degree to which research on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is interdisciplinary is unknown. We apply descriptive and inferential statistics to bibliometric data to investigate interdisciplinarity in MOOC research. Results show that MOOC research published in 2013-2015 was (a) mostly conducted by researchers affiliated with Education and Computer Science disciplines, (b) far from monolithic, (c) had a greater representation of authors from Computer Science than in the past, and (d) showed a trend toward being more interdisciplinary than MOOC research published in 2008-2012. Our results also suggest that empirical research on xMOOCs may be more interdisciplinary than research on cMOOCs. Greater interdisciplinarity in xMOOC research could reflect the burgeoning interest in the field, the general familiarity with the xMOOC pedagogical model, and the hype experienced by xMOOCs. Greater interdisciplinarity in the field may also provide researchers with rich opportunities to improve our understanding and practice of digital and online learning.

AB  - As implementation scientists know well, evaluating fidelity is essential for researchers and practitioners when making sure they implement a plan as intended. However, the concept of fidelity remains unclear, given that various conceptualizations exist within and across disciplines. To help researchers and practitioners understand fidelity, a conceptual framework integrating definitions within and across disciplines is needed. The study we report on here aimed to review the many different terms for and definitions of fidelity to create such an integrated interdisciplinary conceptual framework. We performed a rigorous and structured literature review, known as a scoping review. The 77 documents included in this scoping review: (1) defined fidelity by the degree to which a plan is implemented as planned, and (2) discussed fidelity as a concept, definition, conceptualization, facet, dimension, conceptual framework, model, or theoretical model. We used techniques that will be familiar to interdisciplinarians to find the commonalities amid the differences, allowing us to propose an integrated framework for this sort of endeavor. The conceptual framework we propose includes consideration of levels, dimensions, and relationships between key terms in the reviewed literature. It also clarifies the concept of fidelity and provides details regarding reliable measures to evaluate it. This framework can be used by those in all disciplines seeking to assess fidelity. And we think it will be especially helpful to those working in interdisciplinary teams.

AB  - Background: Higher education is expected to prepare students with interdisciplinary learning (IDL), which is important for their educational and working life opportunities. The cocreation of knowledge in interdisciplinary teams offers multiple opportunities for the emergence of collective knowledge objects (KOs) and knowledge practices (KPs). Methods: During iterations of an organization simulation course, interdisciplinary student teams created an offer of human resource services for a client. To analyze the students' IDL (84 students in 12 teams), we conducted an interaction analysis, drawing on sociocultural and knowledge practice perspectives on technology-mediated learning. First, video-recordings of two teams' meetings were analyzed to trace the tensions, negotiations, and cocreation of KOs. Second, students' reflective diaries were analyzed to identify collective KPs. Findings: The negotiation and cocreation of KOs were mediated by multiple material resources and participants' disciplinary knowledge. In their diaries, students described the following collective KPs: 1) attending to interdisciplinary problems, 2) responsibility taking, 3) framing expertise and contribution, 4) crossing interdisciplinary boundaries, 5) exploring and concretizing new knowledge, and 6) reflecting and expanding upon practices and knowledge. Contributions: The study widens our understanding of the intertwined dynamics of KOs and KPs through which students collectively create and engage in interdisciplinary learning.

AB  - This laboratory experiment offers a research-style experience designed for senior undergraduate students in a multidisciplinary laboratory setting. The experiment focuses on the synthesis, characterization, and application of a cation-exchange membrane made of COF-SO[subscript 3]Na/PAN for ion separation. By participating in this practical session, students gain firsthand experience in both the fundamental procedures of membrane synthesis and the application of widely recognized scientific research methodologies. Furthermore, the experiment offers students hands-on opportunities to become acquainted with modern instrumental techniques extensively used in chemical research, such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The acquisition of these skills not only provides students with valuable practical experience but also equips them with the ability to effectively communicate their future research accomplishments to the broader scientific community. Moreover, the experiment demonstrates the significant potential of the synthesized membrane material for real-world applications, as evidenced by its effectiveness in osmotic energy extraction through ion separation using reverse electrodialysis (RED). This serves to underscore the practical utility of the research findings and reinforces students' understanding of the broader implications of materials chemistry. It also enables instructors to contextualize the experiment within the broader field, encouraging students to explore the frontiers of knowledge and innovation.

AB  - This research study aimed to develop, execute, and evaluate the effectiveness of a dance wellness educational curriculum implemented in a university-level dance classroom. The focus of this study involved student application of exercise science and wellness knowledge within a teaching capacity. Using a mixed methods design, this study utilized a pretest/posttest performance assessment and document analysis for qualitative data. Results showed that the (a) posttest knowledge scores were statistically significantly higher, and (b) qualitative data collected from participants indicated deep levels of meaning-making and application of course content to students' personal approaches to training and teaching. Two themes emerged from qualitative data: student growth in knowledge and understanding as well as personal/professional implementation and application. Findings suggest that incorporating a dance wellness curriculum in a university-level dance program builds knowledge in exercise science, wellness, and instructional literacy while encouraging students to apply gained knowledge in both personal and professional capacities.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to analyse the university experience of a social laboratory that mixes science and art to instruct communities of sustainability practice in heterogeneous contexts through interpretive audio-visual ethnography and cinematographic language. Design/methodology/approach: The research approach was qualitative; data were triangulated through the thorough revision of the literature reported on this praxis, the auto-ethnography of the founder and CEO of this social laboratory and the systematization of the training categories from their documentaries. Furthermore, the analysis of this laboratory as a social innovation considered five categories, namely, critical interaction, shared values, social responsibility, digital competences and sustainability practices, and the projects profile was contrasted with the Sustainable Development Goals to show its sustainable approach. Findings: The results showed that the best scored sustainability university communities are interdisciplinary. Moreover, the mix of science and art to train practice communities is a social innovation model that can go beyond university walls to influence its environment in dissimilar and socially disadvantaged territories. Research limitations/implications: This research is based on a case from a Mexican university in a specific cultural context. Although the conclusions cannot be generalized, this case contributes to the need for pertinent complementarity between various classical methodological possibilities which, when articulated, enhance the research work. Practical implications: The results could have practical implications if these are used as inputs in the development of university programmes with an interdisciplinary approach to sustainability training. Originality/value: This research proposes this experience as an attempt to understand how to promote sustainable education among university communities that influence territories with wide social gaps.

AB  - The concept of energy is widely employed in introductory science courses. However, the term energy is defined and utilized in different ways depending on the context, even within a given discipline. Through the lens of metaphor theory, these various definitions of energy are seen as metaphors that highlight and obscure characteristics of energy. Working under this framework, undergraduate students in introductory biology, chemistry, and physics courses were asked to write analogies that reflect their understanding of the role of energy in the context of ecosystems (n?=?49), chemical reactions (n?=?36), mechanical systems (n?=?65), and electrical circuits (n?=?44). These analogies were analyzed qualitatively using metaphor theory to gain understanding of how students conceptualize energy in these different contexts. The results of this study indicate that students use seven different conceptual metaphors to explain the role of energy in various scientific contexts: energy as a substance that can be accounted for, energy as a substance that can flow, can change forms, can be carried, can be lost, can be an ingredient or a product, and energy as a process or interaction. This result gives teachers a framework to use in evaluating student ideas about energy.

AB  - Over the past 35 years, the dance domain has adopted sports medicine as a key driver of professional practice. However, similar to limitations identified within sport, research is yet to achieve its full translational potential within applied settings. This "Viewpoints" paper begins to identify and unpick key philosophical and methodological aspects, with the view to stimulate discussion in this rapidly growing and developing domain. First, we outline a pragmatic philosophy that underpins expert professional practice as a basis to evaluate research. Second, we critically appraise study design characteristics to exemplify a gap between accepted scientific research protocols and professional needs within applied settings. Third, we comment on recommendations/insights made within the literature against the requirements and practices of professionals. Finally, based on this appraisal we suggest an exemplar new line of research that draws upon a pragmatic philosophy; namely, motor skill refinement. In enacting these 'new moves', we look forward to increased collaboration between practitioners and academics to fully realise a strong applied evidence-base. This task will not be easy, as with any interdisciplinary research, and should draw upon interdisciplinary expertise to do so. Hopefully our brief comments will provide a stimulus for further discussion, planning and future action.

AB  - Physics of music is an area that is covered by interdisciplinary approach. In this study it is aimed to determine prospective music teachers' level of association with physics concepts which are related to music. The research is a case study which combines qualitative and quantitative methods. Eighty-four students who were studying at the Department of Music Education participated to the study. A data collection instrument which included qualitative and quantitative items with an interdisciplinary approach was used in this research. The collected data were grouped and analyzed by finding percentage value for each item. The findings from the data analysis were interpreted and a case assessment was made. In addition it was asked if it was necessary to take such an education. The findings revealed that most participants were unaware of musical concepts relating to physics and had difficulty in associating these concepts or expressing what they know. However, a great majority thought that such an education was necessary in their department.

AB  - Growing interest in interdisciplinary (ID) understanding has led to the recent development of four ID assessments, none of which have previously been comprehensively validated. Sources of evidence for the validity of tests include construct validity, such as the internal structure of the test. ID tests may (and should) test both disciplinary (D) and ID understanding, and the internal structure can be examined to determine whether the theoretical relationship among D and ID knowledge is supported by empirical evidence. In this paper, we present an analysis of internal structure of ISACC, an ID assessment of carbon cycling, selected because the developers included both disciplinary and ID items and posited a relationship among these two types of knowledge. Responses from 454 high school and college students were analyzed using confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) with the Mplus software for internal structure focusing on dimensionality, as well as functioning by gender and race/ethnicity, and reliability. CFA confirmed that the underlying structure of the ISACC best matches a two-factor path model, supporting the developers' theoretical hypothesis of the impact of disciplinary understanding on interdisciplinary understanding. No gender effect was found in the factor structure of the ISACC, indicating that females and males have similar performance. Race/ethnicity performance was similar to other science assessments, revealing possible ethnicity bias on the part of the instrument. The reliability coefficients for the two-factor path model were found to be sufficient. This study highlights the importance of the internal structure of test instruments as a source of validity evidence and models a procedure to assess internal structure.

AB  - STEM integration has often been recommended as a way to support students to develop twenty-first century skills needed to function in the complex modern world. In order for students to experience integration, however, their teachers need support in designing, developing and implementing integrated curricular instruction, which is often at odds with a very subject-focused educational system. This paper reports on the second year of a research study conducted with five secondary science and mathematics teachers, concerned with supporting them to teach explicitly the mathematics components within science lessons, mediated via technology. It outlines how the teachers collaborated with the support of science and mathematics education researchers within a community of practice, named a Teaching and Learning Network (TLN). The network was intended to promote and enhance teacher capacity for the interdisciplinary teaching of mathematics in science in the face of various contextual and other obstacles observed in the first year of the study. This study found that the opportunity to work in a Teaching and Learning Network supported the teachers' ownership of the design of the integrated learning unit, enhanced their content knowledge of mathematics, their use of the data logging technology and their understanding of an inquiry-based pedagogical approach. Participation in the TLN provided teachers with the mechanism to cross the boundaries of the subject disciplines and thereby promoted change in their attitudes, professional knowledge and to some extent, practice.

AB  - In recent years, with the popularity of AI technologies in our everyday life, researchers have begun to discuss an emerging term "AI literacy". However, there is a lack of review to understand how AI teaching and learning (AITL) research looks like over the past two decades to provide the research basis for AI literacy education. To summarize the empirical findings from the literature, this systematic literature review conducts a thematic and content analysis of 49 publications from 2000 to 2020 to pave the way for recent AI literacy education. The related pedagogical models, teaching tools and challenges identified help set the stage for today's AI literacy. The results show that AITL focused more on computer science education at the university level before 2021. Teaching AI had not become popular in K-12 classrooms at that time due to a lack of age-appropriate teaching tools for scaffolding support. However, the pedagogies learnt from the review are valuable for educators to reflect how they should develop students' AI literacy today. Educators have adopted collaborative project-based learning approaches, featuring activities like software development, problem-solving, tinkering with robots, and using game elements. However, most of the activities require programming prerequisites and are not ready to scaffold students' AI understandings. With suitable teaching tools and pedagogical support in recent years, teaching AI shifts from technology-oriented to interdisciplinary design. Moreover, global initiatives have started to include AI literacy in the latest educational standards and strategic initiatives. These findings provide a research foundation to inform educators and researchers the growth of AI literacy education that can help them to design pedagogical strategies and curricula that use suitable technologies to better prepare students to become responsible educated citizens for today's growing AI economy.

AB  - The education systems of today face the challenge of imparting skills that are suitable for the 21st century. Encouraging the ability to integrate and process data from different knowledge fields will bring educators closer to the goal. We have developed a model based on the integrative teaching of literature and science, in which a scientific topic is taught from a literary work. After being introduced to integrative teaching, 29 preservice teachers (PSTs) taught active integrative workshops in community schools. In this qualitative study, we examined the contribution of integrative learning and teaching of science and literature to the assimilation of 21st century skills, particularly self-, professional, social and emotional efficacy, teamwork, and creative thinking. We used multiple data collection tools to examine the effectiveness of the integrative model in imparting skills: reflective journals, a summative feedback questionnaire, and in-depth semi-structured interviews. Participation in the integrative course, significantly enhanced the PSTs' integrative thinking, creativity and teamwork skills, as well as their self- and professional efficacy. These findings show that the integrative model of literature and science is a promising way of assimilating 21st century skills.

AB  - Interprofessional Learning (IPL) prepares and upskills health service providers to function optimally in their collaborative care role. Expanding IPL to communities outside of traditional institutional and clinical settings is critical. We aimed to document the students' and facilitators' reflections on an IPL experience through community site assessments. This was a descriptive qualitative case study in which students and facilitators were assigned to multidisciplinary teams, to conduct community site assessments. Data were collected from both students' and staff's reflections on the activity. A total of 401 students and 4 academic staff facilitators participated in 22 community sites. The main themes that were generated were; an emerging sense of advocacy, appreciation of their socio-economic status and multidisciplinary collaboration within the faculty. Exposure through community site assessments is recommended to strengthen the multidisciplinary collaboration among faculty academic staff and to prepare undergraduate students to become a collaborative practice-ready health workforce within and outside institutional and clinical settings.

AB  - In March 2020, the pandemic brought significant changes to higher education modalities. This paper examines how family and consumer sciences (FCS) instructors in a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary department at a large 4-year university modified instruction and related activities as a response to the pandemic. Using the Family and Consumer Sciences Body of Knowledge as a framework, we illustrate approaches to meet students' basic needs and support their individual well-being during the crisis, and we provide a detailed description of changes in instructional strategies across different disciplines within the department. We highlight the lessons learned by instructors during the transition to fully online instruction and provide suggestions for other FCS programs moving forward.

AB  - Studies have not yet consented whether integrating mathematics into science would enhance students' learning or confuse their understanding of abstract mathematical concepts. In spite of the social need for solving social-scientific problems with multiple facets, there has not been a holistic integration model of the disciplines. Hence, this study aims to propose a theoretical model for curriculum integration of mathematics and science (CIMAS) and to examine experts' opinions about its educational perspectives. The model captures appropriate topics, needs (pedagogical, motivational, and societal), and constraints. In spite of the small size of participants--23 mathematics educators in Ankara, their diverse integration examples reached to the conclusion that all units in the Turkish mathematics curriculum can be integrated with physics, chemistry, or biology (e.g., derivative with linear velocity, ratio with chemical mixture, and probability with genetics), while identifying the most number of examples with physics topics. The expert responses consistently clarified that CIMAS would enhance mathematics education for the pedagogical, motivational, societal, and other needs. However, the integration was also perceived to associate with obstacles with teachers, curricula, and facilities for effective implementation. Lastly, this study further presents a key discussion on how to enlarge the scope of CIMAS in terms of collaboration among mathematics educators.

AB  - This paper analyses Sol Plaatje University's (SPU) progress on increased research activities. The paper employs bibliometric analysis review method to demonstrate the university's transition from being a predominantly teaching-focused to a more research-oriented institution. A novel, data-driven methodology is also adopted in this paper, to identify and examine SPU's research niche through publications. This paper's data were collected from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The paper's findings reveal that there was an overall significant increase in research outputs, observable on yearly basis for a decade (2014 to 2023). The yearly increase in research output is recorded from diverse research fields, including machine learning, cryptography, environmental research, and public health. Findings further reveal that SPU has built its international research collaborations within the African and European continents. This paper's findings contribute to literature on higher education development by offering insights into how newly established universities can transition from a teaching-centric focus to becoming research-active. This paper revealed the importance of strategic planning, interdisciplinary research, and international collaboration in the development of a vibrant research environment.

AB  - The Periodic Table of the Elements (PTE) is arguably one of the most central topics in chemistry. This article provides a critical review of current teaching practices of the PTE to high-school students and undergraduate university students. It also provides a new teaching model, the "periodic universe", for understanding of the PTE through building on its foundational periodicity. Students learn through a guided re-creation of the PTE from simple periodic simulations and interdisciplinary processes. The periodic-universe teaching model directs students to conceptualize, rather than memorize, relationships between the elements by predicting patterns in progressively challenging simulated worlds. This mixed-method research project consists of both quantitative (n = 58) and qualitative (n = 15) responses from university undergraduate students, demonstrating the utility of inquiry-based learning of the PTE for novice chemistry students. Herein, we position the periodic-universe teaching model in the current educational literature of inquiry and interdisciplinary studies by outlining the function of the model and illustrating its effectiveness on the basis of empirical analysis with undergraduate students in a postsecondary-education setting. The results indicate that knowledge of the PTE increases after instruction with the model, and that nonchemistry-major students have increased engagement, understanding, and appreciation of the importance of periodicity to chemistry when presented with the periodic-universe teaching model.

AB  - Epidemiological transition, population ageing, and pandemics posed new challenges to the health system. Current global situation demands many new competencies within the scope of teaching public health in medical schools. The aims of this study were to identify the needs of public health competencies for medical doctors in Thailand and to assess the level of integration for technical collaboration in teaching public health. The national survey of all Thai medical schools applied the list of public health competencies framework recommended by the World Health Organization, Southeast Asia Regional Office (WHO-SEARO). Qualitatively, community representatives from 11 sample villages were interviewed in the focus groups and representatives from stakeholder organizations, particularly employers in the in-depth interviews. Data integration applied recursive mixed-method approach. While the survey identified that health economics, disaster management, leadership, and teamwork are not well addressed in curriculum, employers, and national health authority uttered the need to strengthen the health system sciences and leadership in new generation medical doctors. Almost two third of medical schools could not apply interdisciplinary integration to teach such public health subjects. Furthermore, experiential learning and role play are recommended, in addition to the usual teaching method and multiple-choice questions. Thai communities expect doctors to serve the community, lead the primary healthcare team and train the health professionals and community health volunteers. Therefore, future medical doctors require interdisciplinary competencies. The findings of this study may provide evidence to step forward to a national framework of public health core competencies and interdisciplinary collaborations.

AB  - This study advances a concept of science religion encounter (SRE), with preliminary theorisation and shares findings on the extent and nature of such encounters reported by secondary religious education and science teachers. SREs are interdisciplinary engagements in classrooms involving subject knowledge from more than one subject. The researchers hypothesised they may arise unexpectedly, when a pupil asks a question, or be teacher-planned and intended. This article further elaborates the concept of SRE with reference to the concepts of 'epistemic trespassing' (ET), epistemic neighbourliness, and overlapping domains, introducing these to the field of education. The study is contextualised in the school classroom with quantitative data gathered among beginning and experienced teachers measuring whether this ET in SRE topics enter the classroom via 'spontaneity' or via a 'deliberateness'. This clarifies the different roles a teacher may play and offers considerations for teacher development when navigating an SRE in ways that potentially reduce lost learning.

AB  - This study aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the literature on sports nutrition as recovery published between 1964 and 2022. This study illustrates the structure and trends in sports nutrition publications by using scientific mapping and analyzing publication performance. This study identified the contributions of authors, journals, countries, and widely cited articles. While there was no massive expansion in the first year of publication, the results show that high growth emerged in the 2010s. Several countries have made significant contributions to recovery research in sports nutrition. European countries account for the majority of publications on this subject. Latin American and Asian countries are also keeping an eye on the study's growth. Another finding is that various multidisciplinary publishers publish articles about sports nutrition. The International Journal of Sports Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, on the other hand, is the journal that publishes the most articles. Burke L.M. has established himself as a prolific writer in this field, producing many documents and total citations. Several keywords have large nodes associated with their frequency of occurrence. The keyword relationship provides information about the relationship between keywords frequently appearing in one study. Visualizations of research trends are presented to provide an up-to-date reference guide for academics, revealing critical research gaps and potential research avenues for future studies to advance the discipline's consolidation.

AB  - While scholars have found that undergraduate involvement in research is beneficial, the lack of such experiences in the social sciences and humanities is glaring. This paper analyzes how an emphasis on community through cohort models impacts undergraduate student experience in research, taking from the Emerging Scholars Program, an interdisciplinary research program where cohorts of undergraduates are matched with faculty and attend meetings, workshops, and presentations together. We find that the cohort model created a robust community that fosters positive relationships that develop professional skills and emotional support, allowing students to collaborate and aim more toward their professional goals. The results from this study offer valuable insights into how universities can ensure that students have meaningful research experience beyond the classroom.

AB  - This article makes a case for biosocial education as a field of research and as a potential framework for education practice. The article engages with sociology of education's contemporary interests in embodiment and affect, the possibilities offered by concept studies, and uses of assemblage and complexity theory for thinking about educational phenomena. It also considers broader social science and political theory engagements with epigenetics and neuroscience. The article examines the legacy of the biology/sociology split and the risks, limits, and potentialities of degrounded collaborative trans-disciplinary biosocial research. It considers developments in biosciences that may have particular resonance and promise for education, in particular the epigenetics of care and stress and the metabolomics of diet. The article argues that sociology of education should engage with bioscience to interrogate the folding together of the social, cultural, biographical, pedagogic, political, affective, neurological, and biological in the interactive production of students and learning.

AB  - Infrared (IR) technologies have been universally acknowledged as a valuable pedagogical tool for exploring novel and abstract scientific subjects in science education. This study explores the roles of IR images played in middle school students' Evidence-based Reasoning (EBR) process in support of the understanding of the heat radiation process. Specifically, we implement image processing algorithms explicitly for the visual artifacts mentioned in students' descriptions of the radiation phenomenon to obtain the numeric representations of their corresponding features. Meanwhile, the quality of those descriptions is further coded with the guidance of the EBR framework for indicating students' understanding levels of the phenomenon. Finally, the associations between the numerical image features and the quality of descriptions are analyzed to examine the effectiveness of the IR visual artifacts in helping students understand the heat radiation process. The analytical results found that the image features are further positively correlated with the quality of the descriptions generated by students for the heat radiation. The results further suggest the IR images have the potential of driving students to think proactively and explore detailed procedural changes in learning the heat radiation process. Finally, our study calls for the integration of interdisciplinary instructional approaches in science education to reduce students' cognitive load and guide learning attention, for example, incorporating visualization and relevant processing approaches to present and analyze the otherwise invisible abstract process to help students make sense related knowledge more easily.

AB  - This article presents a nuanced discussion of four episodes on the complexity of possible trajectories for sustainable futures through diverse but intersecting practices and discourses as heterogeneous but complementary articulations of "adaptation and space." As design and creative processes evolve, new tools and methods, often adopted from science and technology, are integrated into art, design, and architecture. However, knowledge flow in these developments tends to be unidirectional, with science and technology influencing these fields more than vice versa. The diverse developments relating to the concept of "space" have profound impacts on industries, urban habitats, design approaches, and the arts within the expanded field. This article engages in a conversation from four different disciplinary perspectives, each articulating its own voice in relation to the broad notion of "adaptation and space." Through this multidisciplinary dialogue, presented in four episodes, it critically contributes to the ongoing discussion on sustainable futures, offering new trajectories for Problem-Based Learning (PBL) beyond disciplinary boundaries. In an era dominated by umbrella terminologies like sustainability, the field of higher education faces the challenge of integrating different expertise to foster new solutions for complex challenges. This article highlights the need for diverse fields such as architecture, art, and social science to engage in a dialogue about perception, interaction, and manipulation of space. Its purpose extends beyond the exploration of novel solutions, instead inviting multifarious perspectives that shape interconnected agencies for sustainable futures and their impact on education.

AB  - Global carbon cycling describes the movement of carbon through atmosphere, biosphere, geosphere, and hydrosphere; it lies at the heart of climate change and sustainability. To understand the global carbon cycle, students will require "interdisciplinary knowledge." While standards documents in science education have long promoted interdisciplinary understanding, our current science education system is still oriented toward single-discipline-based learning. Furthermore, there is limited work on interdisciplinary assessment. This article presents the validated Interdisciplinary Science Assessment of Carbon Cycling (ISACC), and reports empirical results of a study of high school and undergraduate students, including an analysis of the relationship between interdisciplinary items and disciplinary items. Many-faceted Rasch analysis produced detailed information about the relative difficulty of items and estimates of ability levels of students. One-way ANCOVA was used to analyze differences among three grade levels: high school, college Freshman-Sophomore, college Junior-Senior, with number of science courses as a covariate. Findings indicated significantly higher levels of interdisciplinary understanding among the Freshman-Sophomore group compared to high school students. There was no statistically significant difference between Freshman-Sophomore group and Junior-Senior group. Items assessing interdisciplinary understanding were more difficult than items assessing disciplinary understanding of global carbon cycling; however, interdisciplinary and disciplinary understanding were strongly correlated. This study highlights the importance of interdisciplinary understanding in learning carbon cycling and discusses its potential impacts on science curriculum and teaching practices.

AB  - The authors of this article applied the determination of phenolic and flavonoid content in small berries to create a didactic cycle based on student-centered active learning (SCAL) in which students actively participated in the topic while studying and profile-forming as future biology and chemistry teachers. The fundamental part of the proposed didactic cycle is that students solve the following task: Determine the phenolic and flavonoid content in berries ("Vaccinium myrtillus" L., "Vaccinium vitis-idaea" L., and "Vaccinium corymbosum" L.) in your region. The submitted interdisciplinary topic is relevant to everyday life, and it aroused interest and enthusiasm among students. The students had the opportunity to test their theoretical knowledge in practical experimental research, and they attempted to work as researchers.

AB  - An effective professional program can enhance the integrated knowledge and skills of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) among mathematics teachers. Nevertheless, the strategies for STEM integration in teaching and learning taught in many professional programs have proven impractical for many teachers. Thus, a systematic literature review is presented to investigate the characteristics of successfully implemented professional programs for STEM education for mathematics teachers. Twenty research articles published from 2017 to 2021 were obtained from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The results show that of six interdisciplinary concepts, the integration of mathematics and science content was the one most employed in professional programs. In addition, the workshop design type was found to be popular for STEM professional programs, and it impacted teachers' teaching practices in the classroom, student learning outcomes, and knowledge and skills. The results suggest that the self-efficacy of mathematics teachers and their commitment to the programs were significant factors contributing to the effectiveness of the programs. When planning STEM professional development programs, organizers need to think about the needs of teachers and students, the length of the programs, practical activities, STEM concepts, follow-up actions, and so on in order to meet the goals of these programs.

AB  - Results from a national needs assessment survey advertised through science teacher networks with the title "Polar Education--Teacher Input Needed" showed that the majority (90%) of teachers that responded are teaching about polar topics or polar regions. We received 508 responses from elementary to post-secondary teachers across the United States. The survey assessed in which classes polar topics are being taught (high school environmental science classes had the highest percentages; [greater than or equal to] 83%), which polar topics are being taught in classes and which topics teachers would like to teach more, what kind of polar education resources teachers are aware of (the majority of respondents, 66%, did not list more than 2 resources), and whether teachers had received professional development on polar topics (81% of teachers had not). Additionally, teachers' knowledge of polar topics was compared to the public's, using item blocks from representative public surveys. Results showed that teacher respondents' knowledge of polar topics consistently exceeded public knowledge. Based on the findings from the survey, we recommend that the polar education community continue to develop educational resources, offer professional development and conduct outreach to K-12 teachers. Specifically, we recommend a focus on: curating classroom-ready authentic data sets based on current polar research, multidisciplinary curricular materials that build on real world geopolitical issues and the historical importance of polar exploration, and curriculum for teaching ocean acidification, ocean ecosystems, and polar teleconnections to global climate.

AB  - The theory of evolution can be a useful basis for developing students' understanding of ecology. Our study used concept maps to examine the development of sixth-grade students' understanding of the Antarctic ecosystem following several evolution 'Science Days' conducted at 'Nature Campus' -- an informal learning environment comprised of a natural history museum, zoological and botanical gardens. The programme included physical experiences, such as observations and measurements of fossils, skeletons and mounted specimens, and observations in the zoological and botanical gardens. After the first and fourth days, the students watched the film 'March of the Penguins,' and were asked to draw concept maps depicting the penguins' lives. These maps were then analysed to assess: (a) the changes in the students' depictions of the ecosystem's complexity, and (b) the manner and extent to which they used ideas and concepts in evolution to explain phenomena in the Antarctic ecosystem. We found that the students' concept maps increased in complexity, and their post-maps incorporated concepts in evolution from their experiences at Nature Campus. Our results therefore emphasise the benefits of fundamentally changing how biology education is divided and defined, and transitioning to a more holistic approach that acknowledges the interdisciplinary nature of biological phenomena.

AB  - The increasing impact of internationalisation in higher education worldwide has led to the growing use of English as a medium of instruction (EMI). Much research on this phenomenon has focused on stakeholders' viewpoints, but there is increasing interest in investigating interaction in EMI classrooms. One interactional practice which is relatively unexplored is that of EMI lecturers' use of examples when co-constructing knowledge with students. This study explores how EMI lecturers provide examples to introduce and develop disciplinary content in their field. Using an interdisciplinary approach which combines Multimodal Conversation Analysis (CA) and the Autonomy dimension of Legitimation Code Theory (LCT), we analyse three exemplification sequences taken from a corpus of 46 hours of video-recordings of online teaching in three different disciplines (chemistry, business administration, food engineering) at a state EMI university in Turkey. The CA findings of the study show how the lecturers use a range of interactional and multilingual resources in the exemplification sequences to position students as more or less knowledgeable in relation to globally and locally relevant examples. The LCT Autonomy analyses trace the trajectories through which target and non-target knowledge moves as part of lecturers' knowledge-building practices. The interdisciplinary findings of the study have implications for lecturer training and professional development in English medium universities.

AB  - This paper assesses prospects for the relationship between educational studies and educational practice, with reference to the current institutional and policy context in England. Drawing on the sociology of educational knowledge and practice, it is argued that educational studies can be conceptualised in contrasting ways, by considering internal structures, external relations and how disciplinary problematics are defined, but also by how educational practice is portrayed. To develop the analysis, Bernstein's work on knowledge structures and academic and professional discourses is articulated with philosophical work that distinguishes between different conceptualisations of practice prevalent in the humanities and social sciences. This enables critical reflection on three arrangements of educational studies (the foundation disciplines, the new science, and the deliberative traditions) each with their own internal dynamic, socio-epistemic assumptions, relationship to policy, and implications for the future production of knowledge. This process of reflection is illustrated with reference to some recent developments in England that illuminate the current position of educational studies in relation to educational policy and practice.

AB  - As distinct communities of practice (COP), science education research (SER) and environmental education research (EER) have both matured a great deal in recent decades, coming to include a greater diversity of theoretical perspectives, worldviews, and researcher and participant voices. In this paper, we present a view of theoretical inclusivity that promises a rich, robust research landscape for both EER and SER through the deliberate inclusion of non-Western theories. This view has several components: it requires researchers to be explicit and clear about their theoretical stances and to use critical reflection to evaluate their research; and it encourages the field to expansively explore phenomena and issues using multiple epistemologies and continue to deepen their focus on developing praxis. EER's interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary nature make it uniquely positioned to model such inclusivity and move forward together with SER to create knowledge that is more robust and more just. We identify and discuss three key imperatives for the two fields to embrace this theoretical inclusivity now and the paths forward to support scholars doing work in both EER and SER and for the productive future of these fields.

AB  - Reforming instruction is challenging. In this comparative case study of 12 school districts, we investigated the dilemmas that emerged for system leaders as they engaged in system building for elementary science and the approaches leaders took in managing them. We found that system leaders' efforts to manage their environments contributed to the preferential treatment of literacy and mathematics relative to science. Leaders managed this dilemma using three strategies: (a) integration of science with other subjects, (b) specialization of teachers, and (c) adopting curriculum materials. This study contributes to literature on dilemma management by showing that dilemmas in education system building are school-subject sensitive, emerge in relation to system building for other subjects, and are embedded in school and education systems' structural/organizational arrangements.

AB  - Contribution: Using threshold concepts as the framework for curriculum design, a project on neural network methods for solving differential equations is presented, with a rich set of transformative concepts from mathematics and computer science. Projects of this kind complement a typical curriculum with expertise that is crucial for critique and fundamental development of modern machine learning. Background: The curricula of many schools of mathematics and computer science present a relatively shallow introduction to the other subject. Student projects, on the other hand, provide an effective environment for interdisciplinary research between the two disciplines. Intended Outcomes: Providing students from computer science and mathematics the opportunity to obtain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the other subject, beyond the confines of the school curriculum. Application Design: The project contains tasks that require acquisition, not just of knowledge, but also of effective strategies and mental models, relevant to a set of transformative concepts from both disciplines. The tasks require a spectrum of activities, ranging from rigorous theoretical work to coding. Findings: Although the theory of threshold concepts needs further development, the existing paradigms provide a helpful framework for curriculum design. The continuous formative assessment proved effective in monitoring the participants' journeys through the liminal state.

AB  - Continuous changes in social demand and development provide an acute and continuous pressure on universities. The question is whether higher education institutions (HEI) in Ecuador deliver graduates with the competences to provide timely economic, ecological, and sustainable solutions. Additionally, HEIs should prepare graduates to find employment in a society characterized by greater uncertainty, extensive use of information technology, speed, risk, complexity and interdisciplinary work. To face this challenge, universities need lecturers to possess a mix of aptitudes, attitudes, and professional development in teaching, research, and services. Unfortunately, knowledge is sparse about the readiness of their pupils to function effectively in a rapidly changing and increasingly globalized environment. Accordingly, this study uses an explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach to explore the impact of lecturers' aptitudes, attitudes, and professional development on teaching and student learning at the University of Cuenca. Lecturers' perceptions about their aptitudes and their attitudes are higher than the students' perceptions. Faculty representatives believe that untenured lecturers have a better attitude and aptitude than the tenured lecturers. A third part of lecturers have achieved one of the required criteria in research development. Students from biological sciences are more satisfied with their lecturers and the competence development that they receive than the students from social sciences or engineering. Understanding the likely implication of the variables, aptitudes, attitudes and professional development, on the quality of teaching and learning is fundamental for the design and carrying out of educational reforms.

AB  - The United States needs to produce more graduates with the required 21st-century skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration and cross-cultural awareness to remain a top competitor in a global marketplace. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, commonly referred to as STEM, is a transdisciplinary approach to learning through real-world application. The fastest growing occupations require STEM skills and STEM education and can be effective in promoting desired 21st-century capacities. To successfully teach STEM, educators need pedagogical content knowledge. Students can be greatly impacted by their teachers and K-12 public school may be the first-time students are exposed to STEM education. Even if students do not pursue careers in STEM, they benefit from the communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills gained from STEM education. The purpose of the correlational quantitative study was to determine the STEM pedagogical content knowledge of preservice teachers and to consider any gaps in STEM pedagogical content knowledge. Recommendations include adding an explicit STEM course into preservice teacher preparation programs and future research.

AB  - Objectives: Research almost always culminates in the communication of findings. Despite the necessity of grant and manuscript writing throughout academic careers, scientific trainees often receive little guided practice in written communication. To fill this gap, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a voluntary writing initiative for biomedical students at a research-intensive (R1) university in the midwestern United States called Writing Initiative in Neuroscience (WIN). Method: WIN consisted of didactic and workshop components. The didactic component included discussions with topic-specific experts on writing grants and manuscripts for the public and for non-academic scientific careers. The workshop component consisted of small group-based peer review of participant writing samples. Student self-enrollment consistently filled all available seats over three separate cohorts, including those formed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Student self-assessments were implemented to determine improvements quantitatively and qualitatively in writing and peer-review across 3 years of WIN programming. Results: Student self-assessment of writing skills before and after programming revealed improved scientific writing competency with medium or large effect sizes. Qualitative self-assessments indicated perceived improvements in writing competency and confidence. Collectively, students who participated in WIN improved their writing and communication skills and gained experience in providing and receiving feedback. Conclusions: Ultimately, peer-led writing initiatives, such as WIN, may enhance scholarly training and lay a foundation for future trainee writing success across scientific disciplines. Implications for Theory or Practice: These results support the utility of a student-centered writing workshop for biomedical students. Our study combined aspects of multiple existing resources, including peer feedback, interdisciplinary student backgrounds, and professional editing guidance. Together, these features formed a flexible and practical writing workshop, which can be used as a template for biomedical training programs.

AB  - Governmental and educational organizations have pointed out that students coming into the biological sciences require stronger skills in statistics and data modeling that are not usually addressed in typical engineering-based calculus courses. Our work here documents how faculty in biology and mathematics addressed this issue at a large urban university in the southwestern USA. The Calculus for Life Sciences course was redesigned to integrate data analysis and engage students in activities connecting the foundational and practical aspects of statistics-based calculus for professionals in life sciences. The goal was to obtain a better-prepared cohort of students with a positive perception of the use of mathematics and statistics in their careers. Over the course of four semesters, the course doubled the average enrollment of students, the failure rate reduced by more than 50%, and students reported positive attitudinal responses regarding the application of math to biological studies. The perception of mastery reported by students throughout the semester, however, did not correlate with the mastery of skills demonstrated on graded activities. This article provides a case study of the successes and pitfalls that we encountered as we attempted to shift all aspects of the course, including pedagogy, grading, and curriculum.

AB  - Mathematics is a common component of many science and social science degrees, but frequently not considered a prerequisite for their study. This can lead to some students studying mathematics components at undergraduate level with little or no previous mathematical learning and varying levels of motivation, or desire, to study mathematics. This situation has consequences for student experience and teaching practice, including the potential for lower levels of student engagement, higher levels of student anxiety and lack of student motivation for studying a subject that is not what they chose as their degree subject. This paper details an intervention designed to address issues experienced in the teaching of mathematics to undergraduate students, with varying motivation for the study of mathematics and high levels of mathematics anxiety, in their first year of study in a department of Earth Sciences at a UK university. The intervention provided a bespoke mathematics module, designed and taught collaboratively by a teaching specialist in mathematics and a subject specialist in Earth Sciences. The mathematics specialist was able to provide extensive experience in teaching students from widening participation backgrounds and those with mathematics anxiety, making the content more accessible to the students, particularly those with mathematics anxiety. The Earth Sciences specialist was able to contextualize the mathematics content, showing students how the content was applicable to the rest of the degree and helping locate the mathematical content within the broader scope of the discipline. Previous approaches to this module were taught either solely by an Earth Sciences specialist or solely by a mathematics specialist. Compared with those approaches the collaborative teaching intervention improved student attainment by 10% in the average module mark and moved the module from having the lowest student satisfaction scores in the department to the highest. This innovation also benefited both teachers with respect to professional development, which is discussed in the paper.

AB  - With the emergence of innovative technologies, including combinatorial chemistry, high-throughput screening, computer-aided drug design (CADD), artificial intelligence (AI) and big data, the importance of drug design in the field of drug discovery and development is increasing. Additionally, education in drug design plays an important role in the training of pharmaceutical talent. Starting with undergraduates, cultivating pharmaceutical design thinking, developing innovation and creativity, and establishing an interdisciplinary knowledge system will not only provide students with a solid knowledge basis but also promote the development of the pharmaceutical industry in China. This article presents the current status of pharmaceutical education and the distribution of drug design courses in China and summarizes the employment prospects of graduates, thus providing valuable references and evidence for global pharmaceutical design education.

AB  - Simple, often artificial problems are normally preferred for introductory lab courses and are restricted to indoor participation. Microtitrations make it possible to leave the lab and study water chemistry directly in the natural environment. An exemplary outdoor challenge is presented here: travertine formation is context-rich, has to be examined on site, fits very well into a beginner's curriculum, and imparts multidisciplinary knowledge. The method is transferable to other water chemistry projects. Experiences with homemade water hardness kits during ten student fieldtrips to travertine forming Waterfall Dreimühlen (Eifel, Germany) are shared, along with a corresponding Bachelor's project.

AB  - STEAM education evolved to address the critical demand for creative transdisciplinary teaching that was under-realized in STEM programs. However, this novel concept has not been clearly conceptualized; this is likely attributed to the lack of a grounding theory to frame STEAM. We propose using connected learning theory to examine a previously developed STEAM conceptual model. This work explores the potential of connected learning theory to understand specific STEAM instructional practices. Using observations of 43 middle-grade teachers from 14 schools enacting STEAM practices in their classrooms, we examined what connected learning looked like in STEAM classrooms and how the STEAM conceptual model could be enhanced by analyzing implementation practices through the principles of connected learning. The qualitative data analysis of observations, video recorded data, and debriefing sessions with teachers after the observations included two rounds of analysis. This found significant overlap in ideas of connected learning and STEAM, notably a shared emphasis on design, collaboration, and contextualized learning.

AB  - So far, not enough effort has been invested in developing reliable, valid, and engaging assessments in school science, especially assessment of interdisciplinary science based on the new Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Furthermore, previous tools rely mostly on multiple-choice items and evaluation of student outcome is linked only to their raw scores in standardized tests. In addition, educational research on student science achievement always limits in certain grade/subject according to application of raw scores. This study provides a way to design, validate, and further improve an instrument to assess student understanding in interdisciplinary science across grade and time. Meanwhile, student learning growth is investigated. The data are collected from elementary/middle school student survey from an Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Partnership (ISEP) in Northeastern part of the USA. The results show a generally good quality of instrument through various aspects of empirical evidence, such as dimensionality, model-data-fit, and validity. Finally, student learning growth in understanding interdisciplinary science shows a sharp increase between elementary and middle school. The study sheds light on developing more reliable and valid instruments in assessing student science understanding based on the new standards and it also provides suggestions of implementation in both educational research and practice.

AB  - Whether the current post-16 qualifications system in the UK is fit for purpose has long been under discussion, with many calling for a broader, more interdisciplinary approach to preparation for university. This paper examines the relationship between post-16 (A-level) qualifications and degree success for students on the University of Exeter's innovative Natural Sciences programme, with particular emphasis on whether it is possible to be successful at degree level in subjects not studied at A-level. Maths was found to be the best predictor of success in interdisciplinary science and no one science was found to be more important than the others for preparing students for the bespoke interdisciplinary first year of the degree programme. The data also demonstrates that these students can be successful in later years in subjects not studied at A-level which they would otherwise have been prohibited from studying at university through their lack of core entry requirements. We acknowledge the unique nature of the cohort under analysis and the fact they self-select for this type of programme, but discuss how the study provokes questions and debate about pre-university qualification requirements and the way we structure our school and university curricula to maximise the opportunities for the next generation of STEM graduates.

AB  - Health professions education is that part of the education system which applies educational philosophy, theory, principles and practice in a complex relationship with busy clinical services, where education is not the primary role. While the goals are clear--to produce the health workforce that society needs to improve health outcomes--both education and healthcare systems continue to evolve concurrently amidst changes in knowledge, skills, population demographics and social contracts. In observing a significant anniversary of this journal, which sits at the junction of education and healthcare systems, it is appropriate to reflect on how the relationship is evolving. Health professions educators must listen to the voices of regulators, employers, students and patients when adapting to new service delivery models that emerge in response to pressures for change. The recent COVID-19 pandemic is one example of disruptive change, but other factors, such as population pressures and climate change, can also drive innovations that result in lasting change. Emerging technology may act as either a servant of change or a disruptor. There is a pressing need for interdisciplinary research that develops a theory and evidence base to strengthen sustainability of change.

AB  - World-class science requires inspiration, so how can we spark creativity in the modern university environment? Creativity does not come automatically: in the modern age, factors from electronic devices to time pressure can stifle creative thought. Yet, to solve the major problems of the future, it will be essential to stimulate creativity in scientific research and teaching. Here, we bring together insights from the literature to offer ways to cultivate creativity in universities. We advocate for creativity at all levels of university culture within which students are embedded, from the students themselves, to teachers, to researchers, and to administrators. We found that, for students, creativity can involve accepting creative coursework and understanding failure; for teachers, it can involve being active mentors and designing creative courses; for researchers, it can involve conscious effort to make room for creative thought within pressured workloads, and researching across disciplines; and for administrators, it can involve relaxing restraints, allowing autonomy over courses, and encouraging cross-disciplinary learning and research.

AB  - Objectives: Computer Science (CS) education has become increasingly prevalent in elementary schools because of multiple rationales, such as the importance of computational literacy and the growing demand for CS-related workforce preparation. As elementary CS standards continue to be adopted by many states, more examples and voices from the field may help educators understand what effective computational thinking (CT)/CS integration looks like in practice. Method: We employed a descriptive qualitative approach to study eight award-winning K-8 CS teachers and aimed to answer three research questions: (1) What were elementary CS teachers' rationales for CT/CS integration? (2) How do elementary CS teachers integrate CT/CS into their classroom practices? (3) What are the needs of CS teachers for meaningful CT/CS integration in elementary schools? Data were collected through interviews, a questionnaire, and artifacts and analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings: Our findings of elementary CS teachers' rationales for CT/CS integration encompassed its essential nature as a literacy skill, its potential to promote equity in education, and its alignment with standards across various disciplines. To support CT/CS integration at the elementary level, CS teachers described important aspects with examples from their instructional practices: (a) Real-world applications; (b) hands-on activities; (c) strategies to scaffold and guide student learning; (d) collaboration with classroom teachers; and (e) support from professional development (PD). Conclusion: The study results shared CS teachers' voices from practice and shed light on the urgent need for more support and PD opportunities for both homeroom teachers and CS teachers in elementary schools, as well as the crucial need for multiple levels of support within K-12 school systems. Continuous efforts in creating systematic and sustainable PD plans and supporting collaborative professional communities for teachers within the instructional context are a must to help prepare our elementary students with the essential CS knowledge and skills they need to thrive in this technology-rich society.

AB  - We report on a survey of 1717 students at two different points of their secondary school education. This survey is designed to discover their reasoning about scientific and religious accounts of the origins of the universe and life. The study was motivated by a concern, based on previous research, that factors such as the compartmentalised curriculum may limit students' progression in interdisciplinary reasoning and their capacities to appreciate why science and religion are not necessarily incompatible. To investigate these matters, we gathered data in seven secondary schools in England. The findings indicated that a significant proportion of students are working with a poor understanding of the limits of science and of the range of scholarly positions on the nature of religious explanation. The implications of the results for educational theory and practice are discussed.

AB  - Sport and geography may be considered allied and complementary disciplines. They share, variously, interests in ideological and physical spaces, political and socio-cultural processes of space- and place-making, historical dis-/continuities, individual and collective identity formation, demography and topographies and representational practices therein. Sports geography modules may, for example, be taught independently within Geography, Sport Management/Studies/Science, Urban Studies, Development or Liberal Arts programmes, or form a bridge across shared degree/honours courses as a way of attracting an interdisciplinary audience of students. Regardless of institutional "home", sports geography, affords a rich context for engaging students with critical contemporary issues, global-local analysis, and socio-cultural complexities and social justice concerns. We argue in this paper for a more pronounced place for sports geography -- specifically, critical spatial studies -- within Sports Management. We draw on our professional and personal experiences teaching sport and geography related courses. We contextualise the teaching of sports geography against wider Higher Education forces. Next we provide pedagogical illustrations of the benefits of a sports geography focus. We offer some recommendations and reflections. Ultimately, we advocate for improved collaboration between Sports Management and Geography fields, and call for continued scholarly and pedagogical symbiosis and play that might produce new and creative interdisciplinary inquiry.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity is defined as communication and collaboration across academic disciplines. The instructional technology (IT) field has claimed to have an interdisciplinary nature influenced by neighboring fields such as psychology, communication, and management. However, it has been difficult to find outstanding evidence of the field's interdisciplinary research efforts, except with psychology. IT and neighboring fields including human performance technology, instructional design, learning sciences, human resource development, and human resource management share common goals of learning and performance in diverse contexts. These fields are converging in terms of underscoring the importance of people in improving organizational performance through learning, development, and innovations. In this context, the purpose of this study was to identify interdisciplinary research collaboration efforts in the field through a review of literature on the topic. Based on the review of the literature, I provided implications for research and practice.

AB  - This article reports on a mentoring case from a transdisciplinary, longitudinal writing-across-the-curriculum (WAC) initiative in which the situated complexities of integrating new writing pedagogies were observed and supported. Considering this case through an agential realist lens, we introduce the concept of "discursive turbulence": an emergent quality of situated semiotic activity produced from the continual mixing of discourses. Discursive turbulence can emerge in myriad and complex ways, including fits-and-starts of pedagogical development, mismatched discursive alignments, affective signs of struggle and intensity, and nonlinear patterns of change. Through a series of four vignettes, we illustrate discursive turbulence as it emerged while pedagogical changes around writing were being implemented by an environmental sciences professor. We suggest that discursive turbulence is to be expected in heterodisciplinary spaces, and we argue that attention to discursive turbulence will lead to more robust accounts of learning, becoming, and literate activity, as well as new ways of supporting pedagogical becoming.

AB  - New curricular orientations in the secondary schools of many Western countries invite teachers of STEM school subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) to integrate these school subjects (Czerniak, 2008). In Quebec, such interdisciplinarity is not a mere recommendation, but an official component of the curriculum (a prescription). Teachers are expected to integrate the school subjects composing the STEM subjects, and to integrate this area with other school subjects. While this interdisciplinary orientation is laudable, it is important to discover how teachers whose training is disciplinary understand this mandated interdisciplinarity and apply it in their teaching practices. Based on a survey of 245 secondary school teachers, this study shows that the interdisciplinarity practiced and described by these teachers is a superficial one and is based on links that do not enable an integration of the contributions of the subjects concerned in order to solve complex problems or achieve unified knowledge (Klein, 1985, 1990; Lenoir & Klein, 2010). These links mainly involve theme-based approaches, the contextualization of subject knowledge (relationship with life outside the school), or the mobilization, in a given school subject, of prior learning acquired in another school subject. These means of understanding and implementing interdisciplinarity can be attributed to teacher education and to the organizational context and the curricular structure of the schools. This article suggests recommendations to help overcome obstacles to understanding and implementing full interdisciplinarity as highlighted by the study in question. Moreover, it also suggests that comparative studies, along with the sharing of training experiences among teachers in different countries, might shed important light on this issue. These comparative studies would make it possible to identify the best ways to train teachers to be able to implement more-than-merely­- superficial interdisciplinary practices in their classrooms. Moreover, the analytical framework and methodology used herein, as well as the results obtained, are not limited to STEM subjects but also apply to all other school subjects. Therefore, such studies as the study we report on here should be of interest to all actors (practitioners and researchers alike) concerned with interdisciplinarity in school programs at any level anywhere in the world.

AB  - Multidisciplinarity and the enrichment of science and mathematics education toward the so-called STEAM-approach where the A stands for art, has raised a lot of academic interest in the past decade. In this study, 5th and 6th graders from the greater Helsinki area (N = 390) participated in a several months long, Mars-colonization themed STEAM-learning intervention. Testing the students' science knowledge using pre- and post-tests, their learning outcomes were compared to those of 5th and 6th graders from a control school (N = 119), who during the same period studied STEM-subjects in a more traditional manner. The main factors that were taken into account during the comparisons were gender and academic achievement level. Based on only whether there was any improvement between the pre- and post-test scores, girls were found to have benefitted from the Mars-module more than boys did. While also considering the magnitude of the said improvement, no significant difference in the effectiveness of the learning module was found between genders. The group of academically highest-achieving students improved their test scores the most after participating in the STEAM-learning module. This is an important, somewhat surprising finding, as often informal, outside of school learning has been found to benefit especially students with lower grade point averages.

AB  - With the introduction of "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS"), teachers have been called to find meaningful and engaging ways to teach science content while incorporating engineering practices and, to a lesser extent, computing and computational thinking. The task becomes even more complex when they also have to integrate mathematics under the umbrella of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education. To be of high quality, this integration needs to be intentional and specific, with consideration given to both content and context (Bryan, Moore, Johnson, & Roehrig, 2015). This article describes an integrated STEM unit where students worked on a project requiring an interdisciplinary solution authentic to complex problems in the real world (English, King, & Smeed, 2016). It also highlights core features that supported disciplinary engagement, improved interdisciplinary learning, and increased awareness and interest in engineering specifically and STEM more broadly, with the goal of providing a framework to support engineering education as situated within the broader context of STEM learning.

AB  - An interdisciplinary course was designed to educate students about the important role of patents in the economy and society through the lens of chemical innovations. The course consisted of six units that covered a wide variety of topics including an overview of the patent system and the importance of patents in a knowledge economy, career options for chemistry students in the patent field, the process for getting a patent, how to read and understand chemical patents, developing a patentable idea, ethics and biotechnology patents, drug patents, and public policy issues. A diverse range of chemical innovations were analyzed, including fragrances, pharmaceuticals, nicotine chewing gum, hair dyes, toner compositions, vaping formulations, and pesticides. Suggestions and examples are provided for incorporating patents into existing chemistry courses to teach fundamental chemistry concepts, emphasize the real-world applications of chemistry, examine the role of chemistry in society, encourage entrepreneurial identification, and explore how chemistry is linked with many other contexts including law, business, ethics, and public policy.

AB  - The European Commission policy approach of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) is gaining momentum in European research planning and development as a strategy to align scientific and technological progress with socially desirable and acceptable ends. One of the RRI agendas is science education, aiming to foster future generations' acquisition of skills and values needed to engage in society responsibly. To this end, it is argued that RRI-based science education can benefit from more interdisciplinary methods such as those based on arts and digital technologies. However, the evidence existing on the impact of science education activities using digital media and arts-based methods on RRI values remains underexplored. This article comparatively reviews previous evidence on the evaluation of these activities, from primary to higher education, to examine whether and how RRI-related learning outcomes are evaluated and how these activities impact on students' learning. Forty academic publications were selected and its content analysed according to five RRI values: creative and critical thinking, engagement, inclusiveness, gender equality and integration of ethical issues. When evaluating the impact of digital and arts-based methods in science education activities, creative and critical thinking, engagement and partly inclusiveness are the RRI values mainly addressed. In contrast, gender equality and ethics integration are neglected. Digital-based methods seem to be more focused on students' questioning and inquiry skills, whereas those using arts often examine imagination, curiosity and autonomy. Differences in the evaluation focus between studies on digital media and those on arts partly explain differences in their impact on RRI values, but also result in non-documented outcomes and undermine their potential. Further developments in interdisciplinary approaches to science education following the RRI policy agenda should reinforce the design of the activities as well as procedural aspects of the evaluation research.

AB  - We propose an innovative approach to teaching friction. Our approach aims to educate students on its microscopic nature by highlighting its origin in intermolecular interactions. We have designed a teaching sequence (TS) based on a set of experimental investigations of the properties of a gecko-inspired tape at different length scales. The TS has been conceived to unravel the peculiar behavior of this man-made, commercially available biomimetic material and to train students to identify the connection between the micrometer-scale patterning and the peculiar tribological properties. Specifically, our approach compares friction (and adhesion) to wetting, occurring at solid/solid and solid/liquid interfaces, respectively. The aim is to scaffold a correct mental model of real interfaces and disclose the common origin of both phenomena in intermolecular interactions. The TS has been devised according to the design-based research scheme and it was inspired by the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE) and the 5E paradigms. It has been tested and tuned with students at level 3 in the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), during several on-campus stages. We report here the details and results of pre- and post-tests, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, we measure success in terms of the students' comprehension of the link between contact area and friction and of the role of intermolecular forces. We are confident that the learning experience with our TS will lead students to recognize the enormous potential impact of surface patterning in technological applications, in a curiosity-driven manner that will likely result in students' interest in quantitative studies of science and technology.

AB  - This article discusses the potential of multidisciplinary peer-mentoring groups to facilitate individual and institutional change. To do this, we view peer mentoring as a form of "critical education praxis" (Mahon et al. 2019), the purpose of which is to create a space for reflexive thinking and asking critical questions. The data were collected by interviewing all thirteen participants -- doctoral students and more established scholars -- of a multidisciplinary peer-mentoring pilot project. The results show a variety of both individual changes and desired changes within the university, which were brought into view as a result of the sharing of experiences, views and ideas in an open, confidential, multidisciplinary space. Based on these results, we argue that multidisciplinary peer mentoring has a high potential to offer an excellent space for collaborative, critical dialogue, which could ultimately facilitate change among individual academics, but also potentially more widely within higher education institutions.

AB  - Methods traditionally used to teach and train in STEM fields are being used to educate for careers in homeland security, Wall Street investments, and financial planning. An example of this trend is the increasing number of courses offered at institutions of higher education, such as financial engineering, computational finance, and risk analytics. These jobs draw heavily on STEM knowledge and skills, and represent some of the most rapidly growing or wealth producing sectors of the U.S. economy. To better prepare non-STEM majors entering these fields, we developed an interdisciplinary science course for nonscience majors with the goals of reducing the negative perceptions and attitudes towards the science general education curriculum. This interdisciplinary course also created a venue to teach non-science majors how to deal with real world STEM issues. By engaging students in activities which promoted skills critical in STEM fields, we designed a course that integrated a sampling of content in physical and life sciences, while at the same time increasing scientific curiosity and literacy. This new course, STEM 1200-Scientific Decisions in Everyday Life was taught employing active engagement techniques and student-centered demonstrations to increase conceptual understanding of scientific concepts. Results of a Wilcoxon Signed Rants test on a pre- and post-course assessment question showed a significant gain in students' confidence in their conceptual understanding as a result of the engaging demonstrations.

AB  - Undergraduate-level laboratory experiments that integrate multidisciplinary chemistry concepts into a single activity are very appealing and thought-provoking for chemistry students. Here, we use the oscillating chemical reaction to introduce students to the analytical detection concept. The Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction is employed as a simple but efficient system to determine the content of ethanol in liquor samples. This experiment is based on the periodic solution color change from red to blue under the perturbation of ethanol, which can be simply followed by using a smartphone in video mode. Students can establish the calibration curve by plotting the average times required for the change in the solution color oscillating pattern from blue to red to blue, defined as the oscillation period, against ethanol concentrations. Using this strategy, students can quantify the ethanol concentrations in alcoholic samples without the need for sophisticated instruments or skilled operators. Also, this designed experiment allows all students to conduct the activity within a traditional laboratory block of time.

AB  - This study focuses on an educational game titled "Cellverse," a two-player cross-platform VR project intended to teach high school biology students about cell structure and function. In "Cellverse," players work in pairs to explore a human lung cell and diagnose and treat a dangerous genetic disorder. "Cellverse" is being designed by the Collaborative Learning Environments in Virtual Reality (CLEVR) team, an interdisciplinary team consisting of game designers, educational researchers, and graduate and undergraduate students. Using a design-based research approach, we have enlisted the help of both subject matter experts and user testers to iteratively design and improve "Cellverse." The objective of this paper is to share how user and expert feedback can inform and enhance the development of learning games. We describe how we gather and synthesize information to review and revise our game from in-game observations, semi-structured interviews, and video data. We discuss the input of subject matter experts, present feedback from our user testers, and describe how input from both parties influenced the design of "Cellverse." Our results suggest that including feedback from both experts and users has provided information that can clarify gameplay, instruction, subject portrayal, narrative, and in-game goals.

AB  - Recent US science standards conceptualize science as a set of shared multidisciplinary ideas and practices in common with engineering and computer science (CS). At the core, this portrayal requires an understanding of CS as a viable career path and set of discrete knowledge and skills, including those related to computer programming. However, research repeatedly shows inservice and preservice teachers to be unfamiliar or uncomfortable with reform-based instruction and CS-related careers. This exploratory study uses a Draw-a-Programmer Test (DAPT) instrument (adapted from the Draw-a-Scientist [DAST], Engineering [DAET], and Computer Scientist [DACST]) to investigate how preservice teachers understand and visualize computer programming. Here, we detail the development and testing of this tool across two preservice elementary science and technology courses. Participants in this study included 52 preservice teachers in the last semester of their teacher preparation program enrolled in these courses. Data were collected using the DAPT instrument and were analyzed using open coding of respondents' depictions and written descriptions of computer programming. Findings revealed that participants held somewhat stereotypical, yet distinct conceptions of CS and computer programming (i.e., separate from science and engineering) which may provide concrete entry points into fostering computational thinking skills. Implications are discussed as they relate to elementary teacher education and research.

AB  - A growing number of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and health sciences (STEM-H) faculty are interested and find value in learning how to conduct research in the education setting of their discipline. Recent funding initiatives have been announced that aim to expand education research efforts and capability with discipline faculty in order to properly evaluate and ultimately improve STEM-H education. This study explores the impact of an innovative professional learning workshop series for faculty in university STEM-H disciplines who are interested in learning how to study their teaching and its impacts more rigorously.STEM-H faculty came to the workshop series with a variety of motivations, including to better understand and evaluate their teaching practices, to acquire better methods of studying and sharing what they learn, and to improve their education research skills overall. Our interdisciplinary research team collected data through open-ended pre- and post-series surveys, and individual 6-month post-series interviews. We engaged in consensual qualitative analysis to extract themes. Findings indicated STEM-H faculty left the workshop series with (1) deepened perspectives of education research complexities, (2) stronger insights and awareness about key components of education research, and (3) identified actionable next steps to pursue their individual education research goals. We explore potential follow-up steps as we build and institutionalize education research support structures to sustain this interest.

AB  - Introductory courses in biology often lack sufficient emphasis on quantitative skills and interdisciplinary problem solving, leaving many students unprepared for more advanced biology coursework and hampering their ability to pursue biology research careers. MathBench Biology Modules were created to enhance the quantitative skills of biology students by leveraging the unique advantages of the online environment (e.g., self-pacing, opportunities for practice, and immediate, individualized feedback). Using a pre-/post-design, we tested the ability of MathBench modules to improve student quantitative skills and their attitudes towards the integration of math and biology in a community college introductory biology course, where instructors face multiple challenges to integrating quantitative content. Ten sections of the course incorporated MathBench into laboratory and lecture content (MathBench group, N = 124 students), while five sections covered the same laboratory and lecture content without MathBench (comparison group, N = 31 students). On average, students who used MathBench experienced gains in their quantitative skills, while those in the comparison group did not. For students with the lowest level of preparation in math, using MathBench was associated with improvements in quantitative skill only if they were concurrently enrolled in a math class. Neither group of students demonstrated changes over the semester in their attitudes towards the integration of math and biology. Qualitative data indicated that MathBench group students could identify multiple aspects of how MathBench contributed to their learning, including providing new content, alternative approaches to learning, and additional opportunities to practice new skills. Our work demonstrates how learner-centered technologies can be used effectively to supplement traditional instruction in the community college context.

AB  - The current K-12 educational system often does not engage students in interdisciplinary learning. To address this need, we developed an integrated STEM + L (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math, and Digital Literacies) afterschool programme in which middle school students took discipline-specific roles (writer, scientist, artist, and engineer) and worked in small groups to produce multimodal science fictions. The study aims to investigate the effect of discipline-specific roles on students' interdisciplinary and collaborative learning processes. Two groups were chosen as comparison cases because their final products indicated low and high levels in integrating science and literacy respectively. Analysing and visualising students' individual role-changing patterns and examining their discourse in role-specific interactions revealed the following features for high-quality interdisciplinary learning: (1) Students need to be willing and able to enact not only expected roles, but also other roles; (2) Students need to develop awareness of their own and others' role enactment; (3) Collaboration between students with different roles may follow a possible trajectory from solo-construction, to co-construction, to re-construction. This study also proposes instructional strategies related to the design of discipline-specific roles to facilitate interdisciplinary learning in STEM education.

AB  - Today, multidisciplinary cooperation is an important objective of higher vocational education in Europe as well as other countries. The aim of this study was to explore how, and to what extent, fourth year bachelor students from different domains cooperate in multidisciplinary teams at two research centers. Data for 71 students were collected with a semi-structured questionnaire, followed by focus group discussions in 14 groups. Results indicated that students accomplished multidisciplinary cooperation to varying degrees, depending on differences in disciplinary program backgrounds, student characteristics, the research center, the thematic group they belonged to, and the quality of the 'graduation research assignment.' For example, students experienced pressure from their training college to conduct their research autonomously, and this affected the degree to which the goal of multidisciplinary cooperation was reached during the final assignment before graduation. The results of this study were useful for improvement of the professional learning environment in which training colleges and research centers cooperate.

AB  - Is the reductionist approach to teaching chemical principles in the laboratory adequate for students to make effective evaluations? In this work, using the example of sunscreens, students first assessed the analytical chemistry parameters of the active ingredients, later comparing and contrasting them with organic chemistry information for effective practical chemical evaluation in the laboratory. Students evaluated three commercially available brands of sunscreens by a simple, two component experiment analyzing five SPF values with UV spectroscopy using the Beer-Lambert Law to rate the most efficient sunscreen by analytical determination. To explain the differences in degree of photoprotection for sunscreens with the same SPF values in the three brands, students connected the values of molar absorption constant from Beer-Lambert Law for the UV absorbing active ingredients to their organic chemical structures and composition correlating the concentration and application amount with health and regulatory policy, protection performance, and product price. Responses from survey questions asked after students had completed the laboratory experiment and reviewed the molecular structures and regulatory information indicated that the complementary organic and the interdisciplinary regulatory information accompanying the experimental analysis and characterization positively informed and influenced their chemical evaluation.

AB  - Purpose: By envisioning the learning environment as an eco-social system, this study aims to map interrelated enablers of students' sustainability-oriented learning (SoL) in the context of a university course at the interface of science and society. Design/methodology/approach: A case-study approach was used to delineate what enables student learning in a university-wide transdisciplinary Master of Science course. A sample of 102 students, university and societal stakeholders participated to this study, by sharing their experiences and views through focus groups and questionnaires. Findings: A main finding is the development of a configuration of six intertwined enablers that through their interplay help to cultivate students' SoL, in the course under exploration. Originality/value: This study paves the way for a re-orientation of how to explore learning in complex environments. It shows that adopting a relational, situated and systems approach is not only feasible but is also desirable to understand and guide learning practices in complex environments.

AB  - The authors present a new approach to show how interdisciplinary collaborations among a group of institutions can provide a unique opportunity for students to engage across the science-policy nexus using the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Through collaboration across seven higher education institutions in the United States and Australia, virtual student research teams worked together across disciplines such as economics, ecology, and other earth and social sciences to address research questions centered on sustainable development goals. The teams presented their findings in person to diplomats and delegates at the 2019 United Nations Conference of the Parties meeting in Madrid, which also had strong qualitative impacts on their perceptions of international science-policy interfaces.

AB  - A new project-based laboratory (PJBL) was developed for general chemistry students to tackle the steps involved in chemical water quality analysis using an accessible, real-world hydrologic system (the lakes of the Lower Grand Coulee, Washington). This PJBL was developed in a joint general chemistry and environmental geology course by a chemist-geologist teaching team, and it emphasized an interdisciplinary approach for a more complete understanding of the geochemistry of the lake system. Students worked through the project following industry protocols for sample collection in the field, chemical laboratory determination of dissolved solids, alkalinity, and dissolved metals, and interpretation of the results within the unique geological context of the lakes. Foundational concepts in solution chemistry, such as solubility product, pH, and alkalinity, were essential in the discussion of the lake water trends and broader geologic processes. In particular, students could relate chemical weathering of basaltic bedrock to the measured lake water constituents and could observe how the groundwater- and evaporation-controlled fluxes of water in the closed basin produced a downstream increase in alkalinity and dissolved load. Collectively, the steps involved in the project meet the essential criteria (as defined by other authors) for a complete chemistry PJBL. This PJBL can be readily adapted to a wide range of groundwater or surface water systems and can be framed in a more or less interdisciplinary context. Many students, without prompting and on confidential evaluations, rated this as the most valuable learning experience in the year-long academic coursework.

AB  - Calculus is typically one of the first college courses encountered by science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors. Calculus often presents major challenges affecting STEM student persistence, particularly for students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM. For life sciences majors, calculus courses may not offer content that is relevant to biological systems or connect with students' interests in biology. We developed a transformative approach to teaching college-level math, using a dynamical systems perspective that focuses first on demonstrating why students need math to understand living systems, followed by providing quantitative and computational skills, including concepts from calculus, that students need to build and analyze mathematical models representing these systems. We found that students who complete these new math courses perform better in subsequent science courses than their counterparts who take traditional calculus courses. We also provide evidence that the new math curriculum positively impacts students' academic performance, with data that show narrowing of the achievement gap, based on students' math grades, between student subgroups in the new math courses. Moreover, our results indicate that students' interest in the concepts and skills critical to the quantitative preparation of 21st-century life sciences majors increases after completing the new contextualized math curriculum.

AB  - How do we engage students outside their major discipline? Recent curriculum changes have led to increases in nonlaboratory science course offerings for nonmajors to not only bolster science literacy but also demonstrate the relevance and impact of science on their everyday lives. At Elon University, we deliberately designed the course, Culinary Transformations, to connect food and chemistry utilizing the overarching themes of a recipe and the scientific method. ACS anchoring concepts were linked to a series of experiential learning components, including hands-on activities and engagement with community partners. Analysis of final exam data indicates positive achievements in chemistry competencies.

AB  - This book presents a wide range of international perspectives that explore the different ways the diverse forms of drama supports learning in science. It illustrates how learning science by adopting and adapting theatrical techniques can offer more inclusive ways for students to relate to scientific ideas and concepts. The theatrical processes by which subject matter can be introduced, thought about, discussed, transformed, enacted and disseminated are shown to be endless. The first section of the book considers different ways of theorising and applying drama in classrooms. The second section provides a range of case studies illustrating how role play, performance, embodiment and enquiry approaches can be utilised for learning in primary, secondary and tertiary education contexts. The third section demonstrates how different research methods from questionnaires, particular kinds of tests and even the theatrical conventions themselves can provide rich data that informs how drama impacts on learning science.

AB  - To understand how integrated science education (ISE) can be transferred into successful classroom practices, it is important to understand teachers' perceptions and self-efficacy. The focus of this study is twofold: (1) to understand how teachers perceive ISE and (2) to assess if science teachers' perceptions of and experiences with integrated education correlate with their views on self-efficacy in relation to ISE. Ninety-five Finnish science teachers participated in an online survey study. A mixed method approach via exploratory factor analysis and data-driven content analysis was used. Self-efficacy emerged as a key factor explaining teachers' perceptions of and their lack of confidence in implementing ISE as well as their need for support. In addition, teachers regarded ISE as a relevant teaching method, but challenging to implement, and teachers primarily applied integrated approaches irregularly and seldom. Furthermore, teachers' experiences with integrated activities and collaboration correlated with their views on integrated education and self-efficacy. These findings indicate teachers need support to better understand and implement ISE.

AB  - This case study analyzes engagement during situated learning students engaged in the Global Game Jam, a three-day game development event. The themes identified as indicators of engagement for thematic analysis during this research were from the National Center for Educational Statistics' (NCES) National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE). The situated learning experiences provided to 30 college students, over three years, afforded them opportunities that otherwise had not existed in the curriculum. While the initiative was hosted in the Department of Computer Science, students from many disciplines were involved, The engagement with the local business incubator created opportunities for students to work with companies, sell their software, and connect with entrepreneurs as mentors. Finally, this case study exemplifies how faculty can leverage the power of activities to scaffold learning and engage learners in computer science, with the community, and with other disciplines through interdisciplinary teamwork. Of the nine indicators for engagement considered from the NSSE, reflections from students indicated that all students experienced at least five. This two-day event provided an opportunity for the university to build experiences of student engagement with students with minimal cost. The design of this problem-based simulation situated learning experience may build engagement for students outside of computer science and engineering disciplines.

AB  - The 2019 science results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress showed that 8th-grade students, especially economically challenged and emergent bilingual students, made few gains in science and reading achievement. Researchers have found that scientific language may be a significant barrier to student comprehension. Researchers have advocated for integrating effective literacy strategies into the science curriculum to assist students in science and reading outcomes. We investigated the enactment of literacy-infused science strategies of a group of participating seventh-grade science teachers in a federally funded project following monthly virtual professional development sessions. Results indicated that teachers self-reported an overall increase in their use of literacy-infused science strategies after participating in monthly literacy-infused virtual professional development.

AB  - In this paper, we propose novel transdisciplinary STEAM practices to enable students and teachers to model architecture using technology. Architectural modelling can foster students' mathematical knowledge and computational thinking while connecting them to other disciplines such as culture and history. Our study focuses on enabling architectural, cultural, and historical diversity in educational practices. Moreover, the study tries to foster participants' modelling skills and innovative technology use as augmented reality and 3D printing. Thus, this paper will describe three case studies from Austria, Libya, and Indonesia and how these STEAM practices were used in different ways to allow participants to express their diversities through modelling diverse architectural constructions cross-culturally. We followed a qualitative data analysis approach for the participants' interviews, questionnaires and artefacts including architectural modelling, disciplines connections and lesson plans. The data analysis resulted in emerging themes emphasizing STEAM practices' possibilities to connect architecture to culture and history and highlighting the participants' cultural diversities in each of the three case studies.

AB  - The Eurocentric canon remains the predominant focus of music education often excluding the role of music and experiences of Black individuals and people of color. This singular perspective creates an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of the comprehensive nature of music and the humans who create, perform, and engage with it. In this article, the author shares her experience as a Black music educator and her aspirations for a music profession that incorporates the full range of human music engagement and expression. The paper begins with a reflection on W.E.B. DuBois's double consciousness followed by an exploration of the nuances, complexities, contradictions, and beauty of being a Black educator in a primarily white field. Subsequently, the essay presents four conceptual principles for a reimagined, inclusive music education approach, drawing inspiration from Sylvia Wynter's "new science of the Word." These principles advocate retelling the music education narrative to incorporate historically marginalized voices, reorienting music education to be human-centered, embracing interdisciplinary approaches to view music teaching and learning, and acknowledging the power of music in uplifting the human condition. Finally, this paper proposes a pathway for reconciling diverse identities prevalent in American culture with music education and academia.

AB  - This article reports on a modified faculty learning community (FLC) composed of university faculty from science education and a variety of engineering disciplines. This research investigated the efficacy of an intentional, long-term, ongoing, interdisciplinary collaboration to benefit the development of science teacher education, including engineering, across the kindergarten to college spectrum (K-16). The successful implementation of the modified FLC, and systematic structure provided by project leadership, led to beneficial results for both education and engineering faculty members. A multiple case study approach was used to evaluate faculty motivation to participate in an interdisciplinary FLC; whether FLC participation contributed to the professional growth and was able to overcome any challenges for faculty participants; which characteristics of FLCs contributed to project success and mitigated any challenges; and if effective collaboration and overcoming challenges was supported by the overall structure of the modified FLC. Findings indicated that faculty experienced valuable professional growth; with only a minor exception, challenges within groups were able to largely be addressed and did not hinder group progress; and that FLC project leadership structure helped guide groups to successful outcomes. Findings conclude with benefits and advice for others on how to establish successful structured interdisciplinary collaborations and mitigate challenges encountered. Ultimately, FLC projects from this study contributed to the support of K--12 teachers in successfully using the Next Generation Science Standards, including the engineering design component, within their classrooms.

AB  - This article argues that cross-disciplinary linkages -- that is, relationships among phenomena studied by those in different disciplines -- often serve to destabilize, at least temporarily, systems of stability that are theorized to operate within the sets of phenomena studied within most disciplines. It surveys across disciplines both systems of stability and mechanisms of instability, and derives several implications for interdisciplinary and disciplinary research practice. In particular it argues that systems of stability deserve to be included within conceptions of disciplinary perspective. It speculates on how a general connection between stability and instability might be explored. The article thus informs our understanding both of what interdisciplinarity is and how it is best performed.

AB  - This research intends to provide understanding of the impact that a module consisting entirely of collaborative interdisciplinary science tasks had on students' group work behaviour, attitude and motivation. It was hypothesised that implementing a module based entirely of group tasks would develop positive attitudes and increase student accountability. Previous research indicates that large introductory modules in higher education fail to nurture student motivation to engage with course work. In this study 303 students completed surveys and focus groups that examined the level and nature of group work, student feelings towards group work, and student motivation to complete tasks and attend timetabled class sessions. The findings suggest that in order to complete the science tasks, students typically completed sections individually and consolidated their individual parts to form a complete solution. Collaboration occurred when students completed numerical aspects of the task as students felt these sections demanded group members to share ideas. Collaborative work can promote positive student attitudes, increase students efforts to work on tasks and attend timetabled class sessions. These findings imply that collaborative work may act as a means of promoting attendance and facilitating student engagement in module activities throughout the semester. This study highlights the need for educators to assess learning outcomes achieved in higher education and to distinguish between tasks that promote working collaboratively and collaborative learning.

AB  - In recent years, science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) approaches in education have received growing attention in the political arena and in educational research and practice. A concern consistently raised in the research literature regarding interdisciplinary STEM education is that the role played by mathematics is understated such that it may be overshadowed by the other disciplines. This study contributes to the discussion by presenting a review of 4,812 studies, of which 37 with descriptions of STEM activities were selected, analysed and synthesised to identify the various roles played by mathematics in these STEM activities. This process produced an analytical framework that captures the various roles mathematics can play, which can be categorised into two major categories: mathematics as the specific aim of the activity or mathematics utilised as a tool. Two cases selected from the review are presented in this study to demonstrate how the framework can be employed in analysing STEM activities. Furthermore, we propose using the framework when developing STEM activities as a tool to ensure explicit awareness of the various roles mathematics can play.

AB  - Nine years after reconceptualizing the nature of science for science education using the family resemblance approach (FRA) (Erduran & Dagher, 2014a), the time is ripe for taking stock of what this approach has accomplished, and what future research it can facilitate. This reflective paper aims to accomplish three goals. The first addresses several questions related to the FRA for the purpose of ensuring that the applications of FRA in science education are based on robust understanding of the framework. The second discusses the significance of the FRA by highlighting its capacity to support science educators with the exploration of a wide range of contemporary issues that are relevant to how teachers and learners perceive and experience science. The third goal of the paper offers recommendations for future directions in FRA research in the areas of science identity development and multicultural education as well as curriculum, instruction, and assessment in science education.

AB  - Purpose: The visible ill-effects of the developmental enterprises in the ex-colonies and the tendency towards technocratic totalitarianism, in many ways, have altered the way modern humans perceived the idea of "progress" and "development" historically since the Cold War. This paper presents a deconstructive-transdisciplinary critique of the pervasive ideology by focusing on three nodal points in the stages of "development": (1) the rise of technocratic modern science; (2) the making of the Third World; and (3) de-legitimisation of its indigenous knowledge paradigms. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the first-hand accounts of the researchers, social scientists, activists and environmentalists, this paper presents an extensive critique of the violence involved in the development enterprises and recommends possible ways to move beyond the developmental hegemony. This paper is a theoretical investigation that adopts an interpretative, pluralistic, transdisciplinary approach, in order to deconstruct the development ideology and analyse the ramifications of the developmental propaganda and practice as they unfolded in the Global South. Findings: This paper highlights the need to decondition the social imaginary from the hegemony of developmentalism and its by-product scientism and "technological rationality" for an inclusive, pluralistic, democratic social order. Research limitations/implications: The focal area of this work is India in particular and Global South in general. It studies the era between the 1950s and 1980s when the major development enterprises took place and studies the consequences they entailed. Social implications: The scope of this paper encompasses every socio-economic, ecological and epistemological domain affected by the detrimental effects of the developmental enterprises in the Global South. Originality/value: The originality of this work lies in its transdisciplinary approach. The scope of this paper is extensive and covers nearly every domain of human existence that has been affected by the development debacle and technocratic totalitarianism in the post-War era.

AB  - The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) have spurred renewed interest in the epistemologies that students adopt as they engage in science practices. One framework for characterizing students' epistemologies is the "epistemologies in practice" framework (Berland et al. (2016), "Journal of Research in Science Teaching," 53(7), 1082-1112), which focuses on students' meaningful use of four epistemic considerations: Nature, Generality, Justification, and Audience. To date, research based on the framework has primarily examined students' use of the epistemic considerations in the context of diagrammatic modeling. However, with computational technologies becoming more prevalent in science classrooms, the framework could be applied to investigate students' engagement in computational modeling. Moreover, computational modeling could be particularly beneficial to a fast-growing population of multilingual learners (MLs) in the U.S. K-12 context, who benefit from leveraging multiple meaning-making resources (e.g., code, dynamic visualization). This study examined MLs' meaningful use of four epistemic considerations in the context of computational modeling in an elementary science classroom. Fifth-grade MLs (N = 11) participated in two interviews about computational models they had developed as part of two NGSS-designed instructional units that integrated computational modeling (in addition to other model types). Findings indicated that, while students used all four epistemic considerations across the interviews, some considerations (Nature and Generality) were used more frequently than others (Justification and Audience). Beyond diagrammatic modeling, "computational" modeling offered unique affordances for MLs to meaningfully use the considerations as well as to communicate this use, though not without some emergent challenges. Overall, this study highlights the promise of computational modeling for providing a rich sense-making and meaning-making context for MLs to use epistemic considerations. The study also highlights the importance of attending to both epistemic and linguistic aspects of MLs' science learning as well as the potential of interdisciplinary research for studying this learning.

AB  - This article investigates alternative ways doing of mathematics in an Early Childhood Education Teacher Programme using aesthetic forms of expression, the body and reflections on ethics, gender and responsibilities in the transition from student teacher at university to a qualified preschool teacher of children aged 4-5 years. The purpose of the article is to explore an interdisciplinary mathematics workshop in which student teachers investigate mathematics with body- and hands-on crafting to better understand how young children experience learning situations. The research design draws on feminist activist social science research, including in-making and crafty research methods. Theoretically and methodologically, inspiration is drawn from relational materialism and Donna Haraway's scientific engagement with 'speculative fabulations' and Anna L. Tsing's development of 'arts of noticing'. The study shows that learning mathematics through the body, concrete materials, scientific concepts and fiction can be helpful in the transition from student teacher to preschool teacher.

AB  - The Science, Business and Policy Program (SBP) of the University of Groningen has been a work-based learning program for science master students since two decades. This program, a direct consequence of the Bologna declaration of education in Europe, has a distinctive position in European science curricula. Here, we use a web-based survey (N = 242), comparing alumni perceptions on the SBP program (N = 111) with a research oriented master (ROM, N = 131). Alumni from both programs predominantly had a content-driven motivation to choose for either the ROM or SBP format. For SBP alumni, this preference was also inspired by the master's focus on society and a career outside academia. We assessed self-perceived learning outcomes using an extended version of the Science Student Skills Inventory. Both groups were positive about the academic level of their program. Scientific content knowledge and practical research skills were perceived as sufficient by both groups, although significantly higher in the ROM group. Both groups were equally positive about obtained skills in academic reasoning and would have preferred more disciplinary content knowledge. The SBP group perceived their skills on teamwork, multidisciplinary working, leadership, ethical thinking and project work to be significantly higher compared to ROM alumni. The SBP group felt significantly more prepared for a career outside academia and the ROM group for a career in academia. Relatively the ROM group missed career preparation. Both specific work-based learning and classical research approaches were seen as valid ways to obtain a high-quality, science master level, although for different career ambitions.

AB  - Learning scientists have historically been interested in understanding how learning happens and in creating innovations to facilitate learning in real-world situations. Recently, the field has recognized that advancing standalone innovations is not enough to address systemic problems in education; instead, the focus must be broadened to sustain these innovations. Drawing on an interdisciplinary body of literature on infrastructure, this paper presents a framework--the IMPROV framework--that offers theoretical, methodological, and practical tools for infrastructuring innovations in the learning sciences. Infrastructuring can be defined as the ongoing process of creating functional infrastructures for activities in a particular context. I describe six inter-connected areas of infrastructuring to highlight ways that learning designers and researchers could surface existing infrastructures, facilitate coherence-making negotiation activities, engage practitioners in collaborative design, and continuously evaluate infrastructuring activities. It is hoped that such advances will increase the relevance and sustainability of innovations in education and provide infrastructure to further improve them.

AB  - This article proposes an alternative (or additional) place for the use of robotics within the secondary school curriculum. Robotics provides a unique opportunity to engage students in genuinely multidisciplinary learning that challenges their misperceptions about the nature of science/technology and engages them with 'big questions'. After establishing the context and pedagogical framework for delivering science/technology and big questions sessions within the classroom, this article provides a practical description of how the session has been delivered with students.

AB  - Teacher qualifications are a crucial element for successfully implementing integrated STEM education. Research suggests that a STEM education program should be compulsory for all STEM-related teachers. In this study, as STEM education researchers, we asked teachers from different disciplines about their expectations from a professional development (PD) program for integrated STEM education. Six hundred sixty-four teachers participated in the study. We examined the PD expectations of middle school science, mathematics, and computer science teachers regarding pedagogical knowledge, technological knowledge, benefits, and PD program design. In addition, we discussed how these expectations changed based on teachers' subjects. Qualitative data were analyzed through content analysis. In terms of pedagogical knowledge, teachers want to use innovative approaches while integrating ICT into the learning and teaching process. Teachers' expectations of developing ICT competencies in terms of technological knowledge are at the forefront. In the design of such programs, the most critical expectations of teachers are to provide collaborative working environments, thus increasing their opportunities to work with colleagues from different disciplines and their capacity to do interdisciplinary work. Teachers' willingness to participate in a PD program related to integrated STEM education has four underlying expectations: student benefit, professional benefit, personal benefit, and context benefit. Teachers' expectations vary according to the subject area.

AB  - Research shows that interdisciplinary learning approaches increase student knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. However, there is little empirical evidence about teacher enactment of interdisciplinary curricula, especially at the middle school level. In the Designing Biomimetic Robots (BioRobots) project, teachers received professional development and enacted an interdisciplinary robotics curriculum in middle school classrooms. The purpose of this study was to explore how a science and an engineering teacher enacted an interdisciplinary curriculum, designed to support teachers in both disciplines. We sought to understand the choices they made during curricular implementation and the ways in which they supported students' use of disciplinary practices. We conducted participant observations, collected teacher implementation logs, and interviewed teachers. Analysis was through deductive coding and analytic memos. Results indicate that both teachers' enactment aligned with the overarching curricular goals. However, as others have found, the specific material adaptations and enactment choices they made were all influenced by their disciplinary background, goals, and the school context. Careful design of this educative curriculum supported the teachers to teach disciplinary content and practices outside their area of expertise. One implication for the design of educative curriculum is to make explicit the commonalities across the disciplines.

AB  - In the future of education, concepts of sustainability and recycling have to become integral parts of core subjects which require interdisciplinary collaboration beyond subject borders. Project-based Learning offers the perfect educational environment for such integration of knowledge not limited by single subject curricula or school curricula in general. At the same time, it offers a hands-on approach to actively involve students in the creation of products as well as the training of skills for critical thinking and problem-solving, but also increases their awareness regarding sustainability and environmental challenges. In this context, the goals of a circular economy are supported by such an educational approach combined with an environmental focus.

AB  - The diversity of racial/ethnic representation in the health services and policy research (HSPR) workforce plays a crucial role in addressing the health needs of underserved populations. We assessed changes (between 2012 and 2022) in the racial/ethnic composition of students and faculty from departments of Health Policy & Management (HPM) and Health Education & Behavioral Sciences (HEBS) among the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health member institutions. We analyzed annual data from over 40 institutions that reported student and faculty data in 2012 and 2022 within each department. Racial/ethnic populations included American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), Asian, Hispanic, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (NH/PI), Black, White, Unknown, and Multiracial. We conducted analyses by department and examined racial/ethnic composition by student status, degree level, faculty rank, and tenure status. We found statistically significant increases in Black assistant professors (HPM and HEBS) and tenured faculty (HPM), Hispanic graduates and tenure-track faculty (HPM), Asian professors (HPM: full and tenured, HEBS: associate and tenured), and Multiracial students and graduates (HPM and HEBS). Statistically significant decreases were observed in White professors (HPM: assistant and full, HEBS: all ranks) and tenure-track faculty (HPM and HEBS), AI/AN associate professors and tenured faculty (HEBS), Hispanic associate professors (HPM), Asian assistant professors (HEBS), and NH/PI students (HPM and HEBS). Our findings highlight the importance of increasing racial/ethnic representation. Strategies to achieve this include facilitating workshops to raise awareness about the structural barriers encountered by Hispanic faculty, providing research support, evaluating promotion processes, establishing more pathway programs, and fostering interdisciplinary academic environments studying AI/AN or NH/PI populations.

AB  - Emerging careers in technology-focused fields such as data science coupled with necessary graduate outcomes mandate the need for a truly interdisciplinary pedagogical approach. However, the rapid pace of curriculum development in this field of inquiry has meant that curricula across universities has largely evolved in line with the internal disciplinary strengths of each institution rather than in response to the needs of graduates. To assist with the development of data science subjects the themes and content that contribute to each subject should be objectively validated. We propose the use of an objective test for data science curricula to quantify whether a particular degree programme maintains an interdisciplinary perspective unconstrained by single discipline bias. The test analyses a given curriculum and quantifies the subject components by category using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

AB  - This article explores the recontextualization of science in the Malawi Standard 6 syllabus for science and technology. It illustrates how relations of power and social control are enacted, using Bernstein's concepts of classification and vertical and horizontal discourse. The syllabus incorporates five 'disciplines': science, technology, health, housecraft and marketing. Integration of science and non-science content weakens inter-disciplinary boundaries. Horizontal discourse is more prevalent than vertical discourse, further weakening access to powerful knowledge inherent in science. Horizontal discourse is particularly evident in housecraft, much of which appears more relevant to future employment than to everyday life in Malawi. Indigenous or local knowledge is validated through its inclusion in the syllabus. The syllabus illustrates Bernstein's concerns about the adverse effects of including horizontal discourse into vertical discourse, thereby limiting opportunities for social mobility. The article ends by questioning the relevance of Bernstein's theory of the pedagogic device for developing countries.

AB  - This study investigated how history education can be transferred to the virtual world in line with aesthetic and reality concerns through computer-aided design programs and how this transfer can contribute to the instructiveness of historical science. The study hypothesized that advanced technologies enable more effective visualization of historical events and places and that historical knowledge transferred to the virtual environment makes the use of past knowledge more accessible and interactive in future educational approaches. In the study, historical and formal analysis methods from qualitative research methods were used. In the first stage, a literature review was conducted and geographical and period characteristics were used as data in the design phase. In the second stage, historical information was transferred to the digital environment and presented using gamification and interaction techniques. The theoretical basis of the study; It is supported by the Digital Game-Based Learning Theory proposed by Zin, Jaafar, and Yue and Richard E. Mayer's Media and Learning Theory. The findings of the study reveal that it is possible to revitalize historical science in the digital environment thanks to technological developments and computer- aided programs and that this method can make significant contributions to the field of education. The contributions and advantages of digital methods over traditional methods were evaluated, and as a result of the study, it was seen that history and technology work in an interdisciplinary, effective and integrated manner. This research offers a unique contribution to history education with its interactive and game-based structure. The application model designed within the scope of this study was experienced by 28 students. As a result of the findings obtained from the survey, it was determined that game-based learning and virtual environment models have a positive contribution to history education.

AB  - Climate change (CC) has widespread impacts on human and natural systems and thus threatens the future of contemporary youths. Only a few studies on climate change education (CCE) have been published in Finland, and no research has been conducted on upper secondary education. Thus, this study investigated Finnish university students' views on CCE in upper secondary schools. According to them, the most common goals in CCE are increasing and structuring knowledge, developing thinking skills, and encouraging action both today and in the future. The respondents considered preconceived notions and opinions stemming from their inner circles, the media, and social debate to be the most difficult factor in teaching about CC. CCE was perceived to provide either a weak or relatively weak capacity to follow a climate-friendly lifestyle. By increasing and diversifying teaching and strengthening multidisciplinarity, climate-friendly lifestyles can be improved. The respondents' views on current and future CCE differed most clearly concerning motivation and inclusion, which are not prevalent in contemporary teaching. The results indicate, however, that the university students were motivated to increase and develop CCE, and according their answers, their own capacity to address different aspects of CCE was relatively good.

AB  - With policies that strongly emphasize reading, teachers need interdisciplinary strategies that not only represent professional scientists' practices but also support students' engagement and learning in both science and reading. Opportunities abound for teachers to help students recognize the fluid connections between disciplines such as science, reading, social studies, and mathematics as complementary components of everyday life. This article presents practices that support both reading and science instruction, building learning across subject areas. The applications in this article blend language and science and provide opportunities for students to engage in each of the dimensions of "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS"). The authors propose that elementary teachers integrate "touch," "talk," and "text" in their science instruction to support authentic scientific inquiry and disciplinary literacy for elementary students.

AB  - Assessing university resource allocation or misallocation is necessary to understand its impact on research and teaching productivity. To achieve this insight, this study conducts a two-stage data envelopment analysis to judge the "teaching and research efficiency" and "revenue efficiency" of 61 universities in Vietnam. We analyze what variables have the most effect on the efficiencies of the universities through improving results. Moreover, this research applies scale elasticity to distinguish the benchmark performance leader among Vietnam universities. Results indicate that universities are more efficient in terms of "revenue efficiency" than "teaching and research efficiency." The scale elasticity decomposition findings show that multidisciplinary universities perform better than those specializing in science and technology and social science and economics. Finally, the competitive map to performance advancement strategies is exhibited. This map helps the university management to enhance their efficiencies.

AB  - Since educational design research (EDR) was introduced to educational research at the beginning of the 1990s, it has gained recognition as a promising research approach that bridges the gap between research and practice in education. This paper aims to investigate how EDR has been utilised and developed and which challenges it has faced by systematically reviewing 21 Finnish EDR doctoral dissertations on mathematics, science, and technology education published between January 2000 and October 2018. The findings indicate that all dissertations yielded practical and theoretical contributions. Moreover, common EDR characteristics, including the use of educational problems in practice as a point of departure, research in real-world settings, evolution through an iterative process, development of practical interventions, and refinement of theoretical knowledge, were found in all dissertations. Most of the doctoral researchers were confronted with challenges, such as high demand for EDR with limited resources and difficulties associated with multidisciplinary teamwork. However, the dissertations were diverse in terms of research contexts, practical educational problems, research outcomes, research methodologies, scale, and collaboration. This systematic review not only enhances the understanding of the utilisation, development, and challenges of EDR but also provides implications for future EDR.

AB  - This design-based research investigated the context and impact of a three-year practice-based professional development (PD) project introducing science teachers to pedagogical shifts required for full implementation and synergy among disciplinary literacy components of "Next Generation Science Standards" and "Common Core State Standards- Literacy." Participants included 42 middle school teachers from 12 primarily urban districts from one northeastern state. Researchers utilized a Theory of Change to guide the study. The interdisciplinary project team immersed teachers in experiencing innovative, standards-based, three-dimensional (3D) earth and space science (ESS) curricular units with embedded disciplinary literacy (DL) strategies. Teachers then adapted the 3D+DL units and implemented with students. Researchers used a convergent parallel mixed methods design to examine quantitative and qualitative data in the form of classroom observations to determine fidelity of implementation of 3D+DL practices, frequency of 3D+DL practices on the self-reported Science Literacy Survey, and focus group interviews to assess impacts of the PD project on teaching. Analyses revealed that teachers valued and embraced 3D+DL instructional shifts that supported teacher and student sensemaking in science. Teachers attributed project success to (a) project team collaboration to develop ESS units, (b) adaptability of ESS units, (c) explicit and direct instruction of 3D+DL, and (d) teacher sharing and reflecting on student success. The shift in teachers' understanding and practices of 3D+DL teaching and learning is likely attributed to teachers having the opportunity for sensemaking as learners with rigorous ESS units prior to implementing 3D+DL instruction with their students, which may provide guidance for future PD.

AB  - College students are often urged to "find their passion," but if students believe that passions or interests are fixed, they may not develop interest in fields beyond the academic identity with which they enter college. Can a brief intervention that portrays interests as developable, not fixed, boost interest, and even grades, in mandatory math and science coursework among students who do not identify as a "math or science person"? This would be especially significant because college provides the foundation for developing skills and interests that guide later professional paths. After a successful pilot study at a small liberal arts college (N = 175), we conducted a randomized, controlled field-experiment with matriculating first-year undergraduates (N = 580) in the school of arts and social sciences of a large university. Students completed a 30-min growth-theory-of-interest (vs. control) online module before starting school. At the end of their first and second semesters, they reported their interest in their two required first-year math/science courses. Official final grades were obtained at the end of the year. As predicted, among those who entered college less identified with math and science, the intervention (vs. control) increased interest and final grades in both first-year math/science courses (one conditional effect was marginal). The results suggest that by representing interests as not merely "found" but as having the potential to grow, colleges can encourage the development of skilled, interdisciplinary scholars.

AB  - This design case covers a graduate course in educational software design that focuses on semester-long projects in response to client requests. The course was intended to address the need for professionals across disciplines, such as instructional design, computer science, and human-computer interaction design, to usefully collaborate on educational software projects. The ability to work on a multi-disciplinary team was fostered in several ways: through recruiting students across multiple majors; providing readings and student presentation topics related to language, processes, and techniques used by each discipline; and by scaffolding the work of multi-disciplinary student groups in a major semester-long project.

AB  - The Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona) is a world-class research center devoted to understanding fundamental questions about human health and disease. In addition to conducting multidisciplinary research of excellence, IRB Barcelona is committed to maintaining an open dialogue with the public about its work, fostering scientific vocations and promoting scientific culture in society. In this regard, the institute has several public engagement and science education initiatives to reach these goals. In this article, we highlight two projects directed toward primary school and secondary school students, respectively: the Tandem Project and the Crazy About Biomedicine Programme. Although each of these activities has slightly different objectives and target audiences, they share the commitment of the institute to contribute to the science education of young students. We believe that it is the responsibility of research institutes to promote these kinds of initiatives, which have the potential to spark passion for science and thus foster scientific vocations. The new generation of scientists is in our hands.

AB  - In this chapter, eight foci relevant for science educators are presented and illustrated by paradigmatic examples and discussed in two parts. The first part "from science education to practice and authorities" discusses the four foci of: (1) developing concepts for instruction; (2) responding to the needs of schools; (3) connecting researchers, teachers, and stakeholders; and (4) implementing research results into practice. The second part "from practice and authorities to science education" includes a further four foci: (5) reframing recent scientific research as science content for schools; (6) considering non-formal teaching-learning processes; (7) helping to create curricular and structural changes; and (8) being aware of his/her own responsibilities. The paradigmatic examples discussed are from recent research projects in science education, for example, the development of new instruments for formative and summative assessment, the comparison of different test formats like multiple-choice problems and concept map problems, the implementation of a new interdisciplinary curricula, the development of a so-called MobiLab, and the collaboration with scientists and entrepreneurs in nanoscience. It is discussed why the foci and examples are important to researchers and educators and which lessons can be learnt.

AB  - We propose cross-disciplinary learning as a construct that can guide instruction and assessment in programs that feature sequential learning across multiple science disciplines. Crossdisciplinary learning combines insights from interdisciplinary learning, transfer, and resources frameworks and highlights the processes of resource activation, transformation, and integration to support sense-making in a novel disciplinary context by drawing on knowledge from other prerequisite disciplines. In this article, we describe two measurement approaches based on this construct: (a) a paired multiple choice instrument set to measure the extent of cross-disciplinary learning; and (b) a think-aloud interview approach to provide insights into which resources are activated, and how they are used, when making sense of an unfamiliar phenomenon. We offer implications for program and course assessment.

AB  - To help undergraduates make connections among disciplines so they are able to approach, evaluate, and contribute to the solutions of important global problems, our campus has been focused on interdisciplinary research and education opportunities across the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. This paper describes the mobilization, planning, and implementation of a first-year interdisciplinary course for STEM majors that integrates key concepts found in traditional first-semester biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics courses. This team-taught course, Integrated Quantitative Science (IQS), is half of a first-year student's schedule in both semesters and is composed of a double lecture and a weekly lab and workshop. Features of this first-year course, including themes and concepts covered each semester, some of the materials developed, lessons learned, challenges, and preliminary measures of success are described.

AB  - The inclusion of socioscientific issues (SSIs) in the science curriculum is a well-established trend internationally. Apart from claims about its innate value, one of the rationales for this approach is its potential for helping to counter declining interest and participation. SSIs involve the use of science and are of interest to society, also raising ethical and moral dilemmas. Introducing such problems presents a significant and usually cross-disciplinary challenge to curriculum developers and teachers. The aim of this paper is to examine how this challenge has been met when judged against contemporary views of the issues concerned. It first explores how SSIs have been interpreted in an important and innovative science course for students aged 14-16 in England, entitled Twenty First Century Science. This paper analyses the Twenty First Century Science textbooks, focusing in detail on two SSIs, reproductive genetic technology and climate change. For each of these issues, the key ideas present in the social science literature surrounding the problems are outlined. This review is then used as an analytical framework to examine how the issues are presented in the textbooks. It is argued in this paper that the perspectives the textbooks take on these issues largely do not include perspectives from social science disciplines. It goes on to suggest that the development of future SSI-based curricula needs to take account of these wider, often interdisciplinary, perspectives.

AB  - Interdisciplinary approaches to research in the sciences have become increasingly important in solving a wide range of pressing problems at both global and local levels. It is imperative then that science majors in higher education understand the need for exploring information from a wide array of disciplines. With this in mind, interdisciplinary instruction has the potential to bring new insights and methods to enhance learning and promote critical thinking skills while itself modeling the benefits of interdisciplinary practice in research. This paper explores an interdisciplinary collaboration between a librarian and a chemist seeking to improve student research and critical thinking skills through the utilization of problem-based learning. A module exploring the interdisciplinary nature of science was implemented for an advanced Biochemistry class and delivered in a library setting. Initial findings of this pilot project suggest that the implementation of a carefully constructed, problem-based curriculum has the potential to improve research skills and multidisciplinary thinking as well as engender a more holistic view of chemical research.

AB  - The objective of ESD is to make people think differently about lifestyles as well as economic and political structures, to raise awareness for complex problems, to sharpen political judgment and to empower people to act. A means to achieve these objectives is to engage students in action-oriented learning. The ESD courses aimed at implementing transdisciplinary projects to go beyond the acquisition of knowledge about sustainable development but to make students act. The courses were in line with ESD objectives but came with specific challenges particularly with regard to implementing real life projects.

AB  - One of the aims of education is to produce wise and responsible citizens who are aware of their impact on the environment and can address and solve daily life problems. From this point of view, science education leading to science literacy is helpful for all students, regardless of their future careers. In this paper, we first review the definitions of science literacy in the literature and present the strategies for its development. In Slovenia, we refer to the ongoing national project NA-MA POTI. Most of the strategies studied focus on primary and secondary schools. However, for the development of science literacy in primary and secondary education, teachers themselves must achieve a sufficient level of science literacy. The research was conducted with a small group of prospective teachers, focusing on three components of science literacy: asking research questions, making hypotheses, and designing an experiment. In addition, we analysed the curricula of the science didactics courses in the teacher education program. The findings show a great need for a systematic change in the curricula. Finally, proposals and ideas for improving the curricula for the didactics of science and the syllabus of the Subject teacher study program are presented.

AB  - Contemporary science educators must equip their students with the knowledge and practical know-how to connect multiple disciplines like mathematics, computing and the natural sciences to gain a richer and deeper understanding of a scientific problem. However, many biology and earth science students are prejudiced against mathematics due to negative emotions like high mathematical anxiety and low mathematical confidence. Here, we present a theoretical framework that investigates linkages between student engagement, mathematical anxiety, mathematical confidence, student achievement and subject mastery. We implement this framework in a large, first-year interdisciplinary science subject and monitor its impact over several years from 2010 to 2015. The implementation of the framework coincided with an easing of anxiety and enhanced confidence, as well as higher student satisfaction, retention and achievement. The framework offers interdisciplinary science educators greater flexibility and confidence in their approach to designing and delivering subjects that rely on mathematical concepts and practices.

AB  - The paper reports about the outcome of a systematic review of research on family resemblance approach (FRA) to nature of science in (NOS) science education. FRA is a relatively recent perspective on NOS being a system of cognitive-epistemic and social-institutional aspects of science. FRA thus consists of a set of categories such as aims and values, practices, knowledge and social organizations in relation to NOS. Since the introduction of the FRA, there has been increasing interest in investigations about how FRA can be of use in science education both empirically and practically. A journal content analysis was conducted in order to investigate which FRA categories are covered in journal articles and to identify the characteristics of the studies that have used FRA. These characteristics included the target level of education and focus on pre- or in-service teachers. Furthermore, epistemic network analysis of theoretical and empirical papers was conducted to determine the extent to which the studies incorporated various key themes about FRA, such as its transferability to other domains and differentiation of the social-institutional system categories. The findings illustrate an increasing number of empirical studies using FRA in recent years and broad coverage in science education. Although the social-institutional system categories included intraconnections, these were not as strong as those intraconnections among categories within the cognitive-epistemic system. Future research directions for the use of FRA in K-12 science education are discussed.

AB  - Recent reforms in science education shift the focus of instruction to supporting students' sensemaking about phenomena. At the same time, discussions of equity in science education have become more common and more contested. For emergent bilingual (EB) learners, there is growing consensus that these trends together imply valuing diverse linguistic and cultural resources that students draw upon to make sense of the world. However, asset-based pedagogies often do not attend to the role of oppression and the co-construction of linguistic and racial marginalization. Furthermore, culturally responsive pedagogies push beyond valuing student assets to challenge the end goals of education, emphasizing the development of critical consciousness. Through this case study of one thematic unit within a transitional bilingual physical science class, this study puts forth "pedagogías entrenzadas" as a purposeful braiding of asset and critical pedagogies that attend to science, language, and cultural responsiveness. The study took place in a Title I school in the suburbs of a large midwestern city where the majority of students are from Latin American immigrant families. "Pedagogías entrenzadas" are articulated through the analysis of classroom episodes that attended to language, science, and cultural responsiveness in combination. By attending to these three facets in braided ways, the teacher created ruptures in systems that structurally exclude EB students. We present three classroom episodes in conjunction with additional evidence from a larger data set to demonstrate the ways "pedagogías entrenzadas" created spaces where (1) generative themes and words created opportunities for holistic sensemaking; (2) there were opportunities to consider and critique language and science; and (3) heterogeneity in linguistic, cultural, and academic resources was upheld and valued. The implications of this pedagogical work extended outside of the classroom, where the teacher successfully advocated with colleagues for the creation of an asset-based bilingual science program.

AB  - Research from the interdisciplinary "science of learning" indicates that children learn best when they are actively engaged in learning that is meaningful, socially interactive, iterative, and joyful. These principles coalesce in active playful learning, especially "guided play." This active, playful pedagogy enhances learning through intentional instruction that activates students' autonomy and intrinsic motivation while teachers guide them toward a learning goal. In this paper, we provide a framework for facilitating guided play through a 3-part equation of incorporation of cultural values, the science of how children learn, and the science of what children need to learn to thrive in school and beyond. A summary of the research supporting the efficacy of this approach is provided, as are recommendations for how to implement the equation through guided play in our schools.

AB  - Comparative education relies on experiences, expertise, data, and criticism derived from multiple contexts and diverse levels to generate insights, facilitate understanding, and explain change. Marked by connectivity, our contemporary era vastly increases the (potential) diffusion of ideas essential for scientific advance. Three interlocking trends emphasise the growing relevance of comparative educational research. Firstly, "competition" has become more potent -- among scholars, their organisations, and within as across countries. Secondly, educational studies, as science more generally, are increasingly conducted in "collaboration" -- across disciplinary, cultural, linguistic, and organisational boundaries -- enhancing the potential for discovery while producing influential scholarship. Thirdly, while educational research and policymaking are increasingly "comparative," comparative knowledge stores are often only selectively used. To counter such reductionism, in-depth comparative institutional analysis across divides of academy, politics, and practice remain crucial. The multidisciplinary field must claim its relevance more persuasively, even as scholarly exchange, mobilities, and cultural knowledge endure as vital foundations.

AB  - STEM and computer science (CS) education are some of the most important research topics of the last decade. The idea that CS should be a part of STEM is becoming more and more common. The most important goals of integrating CS into STEM are to develop students' computational thinking (CT) and problem-solving skills. STEM education creates a natural context for integrating CT into learning and teaching processes. However, applied studies are needed since the subject is new and open to development. In this study, we designed an interdisciplinary unplugged programming activity to integrate CT into STEM activities which we then implemented in a professional development course (PD) with the participation of STEM teachers. To evaluate the effectiveness, an open-ended questionnaire was given to the teachers and the results were analyzed. Accordingly, the teachers stated that the activity was exemplary in applying the interdisciplinary approach and enabling the perspectives of different disciplines to be seen by other subject-area teachers. Also, using unplugged programming activities in teacher education provides an important example. Teachers who want to conduct unplugged programming activities in their classrooms, learn how to integrate CT into STEM, are interested in the practice to support their students' research skills, and aim to support students' 21st-century skills can also use this activity. The interdisciplinary structure of the activity and its example of integrating CT into STEM will guide practitioners and researchers in the field.

AB  - Students in introductory physics courses encounter harmonics when they study standing waves on strings and in pipes. The Fourier spectrum, which plots amplitude against harmonic number, can describe all periodic tones imaginable. However, most sounds are aperiodic and therefore have additional spectral components. A real-world application that includes frequencies outside the harmonic series can be found in guitar pedal effects used by rock musicians. This interdisciplinary paper gives the teacher an opportunity to connect frequency spectra to a real-world invention used in the world of rock music. Here the musician wants to extend the natural sound of the guitar by including strange effects to enhance the rock music experience. Students are sure to find this audio application of physics interesting.

AB  - With the enormous reliance on plastics in the world today, bisphenol A, an additive used in the synthesis of many plastics, such as polycarbonate, has been found almost everywhere in our environment including in soil, in natural waters, and inside organisms including humans. A multidisciplinary experiment is presented that involves using flatworms ("Planaria"), which are model organisms common to undergraduate biology courses, to study the extent of retention or absorption of bisphenol A following exposure. "Planaria" were exposed to micromolar concentrations of deuterated bisphenol A in order to distinguish the amount of the compound retained from the (undeuterated) bisphenol A that is present as a contaminant in the environment. Liquid extraction was used to remove retained deuterated BPA from "Planaria," and the extract was derivatized and quantified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. This experiment is geared toward students in a laboratory research course or independent study experience. It would also be appropriate in analytical or environmental chemistry courses to help students understand how contaminants in our environment brought about from manufacturing processes can be measured and quantified. Students will learn standard techniques in extraction and analysis to quantify their findings.

AB  - Design activities can serve as a concrete experience to address the similarities and differences between science and engineering, and also demarcate engineering from tinkering. They can lay the foundation for concept development of targeted disciplinary ideas. Minor, but crucial, changes to classroom tinkering activities along with targeting and carefully scaffolding to science and engineering concepts are essential for promoting discipline-specific and integrated STEM learning outcomes, while also accurately portraying disciplinary expertise that interdisciplinary efforts draw upon.

AB  - Background/Context: Education scholars have examined how state policy and informal practice can widen or reproduce racial and gender inequalities in graduate education. Just one empirical study, which focused on psychology programs, has identified organizational practice that supports recruitment and retention of graduate students of color. Focus of study: To identify organizational conditions and specific activities that support diversity in STEM graduate programs, the authors conducted a yearlong case study of a physics program that, for the last decade, has trained about 10% of the Black Ph.D.'s in physics, nationally. They identified and described concrete efforts to enhance access and inclusion, and sought to understand how this program distinguished itself from a traditional physics department. Participants: Study participants consisted of 16 faculty, administrators, administrative staff, and students affiliated with the Applied Physics program at the University of Michigan. Research Design: Data for this qualitative case study was collected through eighteen interviews, two student focus groups, observations of everyday life and special events in the program, and a large amount of documentary data. Guided by the constant comparative method, the analysis assessed convergence and divergence across types of data and across faculty, administrator, staff, and student perspectives. Major findings represent four areas of consensus across participant roles. Findings/Results: Four themes explain how Applied Physics has increased access to and inclusion in a field known for its inequality. The program institutionalized a flexible, interdisciplinary intellectual paradigm; they reconceptualized their vision of the ideal student and reformed admissions accordingly; they empowered administrative staff to serve as cultural translators across racial and faculty-student boundaries; and they worked to create a family-like climate that gave them a competitive advantage over other physics programs. Conclusions/Recommendations: We interpret the findings from the perspective of Charles Tilly's boundary change mechanisms, and conclude that the common thread among the four themes was the program's willingness to erase, relocate, and/or deactivate boundaries that had implicitly created barriers to access and inclusion for underrepresented students. The paper recommends specific steps that graduate programs can take to analyze the symbolic boundaries operating in their own programs, and invites scholars to utilize the boundaries perspective in future research on educational inequality.

AB  - A significant challenge to the community of chemistry education is the creation of materials that can be used in nonscience settings, including those of social science and humanities classrooms. As part of a larger effort to engage new communities in understanding how science data can impact such settings, including in the community, an experiment to detect the level of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the air was implemented in university sociology and history classrooms. The use of an authentic scientific method within these settings generated important data for classroom use in classroom sociological and historical discussions. The impact on student attitudes and learning was also determined.

Data were collected from faculty members of the Management and Organizational Behavior Teaching Society (MOBTS), a member of the AACSB Business Education Alliance, the American Society of Business and Behavioral Sciences (ASBBS), an interdisciplinary professional organization comprised of faculty teaching in accounting, finance, management, marketing, organizational behavior, and computer information systems, and other research panels during 2021 (N = 94). Findings from regression analysis indicated that the techno-complexity subconstruct is positively related to a faculty's perception of student cheating in online classes. In contrast, the techno-insecurity subconstruct was marginally significant and positively related to the faculty's perception of student cheating in online classes. Techno-overload, techno-invasion, and techno-uncertainty subconstructs were not identified as statistically significant in predicting a faculty's perception of student cheating in online classes.

AB  - Drawing on a social identity framework of mathematical development, the authors present a model, Improving Girls' Math Identity (IGMI), designed to address two key "leaks" in the female STEM pipeline: undergraduate and middle school. IGMI involves a supportive professional development network for undergraduate women preparing to transition into mathematics-related careers, and a mentorship program connecting middle school girls with these undergraduates to develop metacognition, problem-solving, and spatial skills. Preliminary evidence demonstrates that the model successfully strengthens undergraduates' problem-solving abilities, improves resilience and persistence in pursuing STEM fields, and increases investment in supporting future cohorts of women in mathematics and science.

AB  - Due to intercontinental connections provided by air and shipping, tourism, freight transfer, flexibility and expanding labor mobility, expanding the potential of human capital, the borders between states and their societies have been erased, and the international cultural society has become more diverse. The relevance of this study is conditioned by the activities of the centres established in the European Union for transcultural education, transdisciplinary research in the field of sociology, etc. One of the key features of their activities is the understanding of the concept of ethnicity as defining for these centers. The purpose of the study was to investigate the conceptual activities of European centres of transcultural education, to clarify the features of ethnolinguistic science as the main background for the establishment and development of the study of the phenomenon of ethnicity in general. The leading approach to research has become the gradual application of a complex of interrelated methods, such as collection and processing of factual research material, description and analysis of dictionary entries, analysis of the concepts of the activities of European centers, etc. The object of the study is the structural components of the concept of ethnicity. The study identified the principles of functioning of European centres for transcultural education in the context of introducing the experience of educational centres for integration, adaptation, and development of the national identity of immigrants.

AB  - In a world of burgeoning societal issues, future scientists must be equipped to work interdisciplinarily to address real-world problems. To train undergraduate students toward this end, practitioners must also have quality assessment tools to measure students' ability to think within an interdisciplinary system. There is, however, a dearth of instruments that accurately measure this competency. Using a theoretically and empirically based model, we developed an instrument, the Interdisciplinary Science Rubric (IDSR), to measure undergraduate students' interdisciplinary science thinking. An essay assignment was administered to 102 students across five courses at three different institutions. Students' work was scored with the newly developed rubric. Evidence of construct validity was established through novice and expert response processes via semistructured, think-aloud interviews with 29 students and four instructors to ensure the constructs and criteria within the instrument were operating as intended. Interrater reliability of essay scores was collected with the instructors of record ([kappa] = 0.67). An expert panel of discipline-based education researchers (n = 11) were consulted to further refine the scoring metric of the rubric. Results indicate that the IDSR produces valid data to measure undergraduate students' ability to think interdisciplinarily in science.

AB  - In this article, we present the first results of the project OPEN-MATH. The research project aims at acknowledging the need for learning environments with differentiation strategies for all. We developed a model for inclusive mathematics learning, based on the Theory of Objectification and a broad idea of differentiation realized through Open Learning. It poses an interdisciplinary research issue that requires the collaboration of two sub-disciplines pertaining to the area of educational studies: Inclusive Education and Mathematics Education. The results we present here are related to the dialogue between theory and practice, whose outcome is a teaching and learning model for inclusion in mathematics. The construction of the teaching and learning model moves along two complementary paths: (1) concerning the theoretical point of view, we implemented connecting theory strategies to network Open Education and the Theory of Objectification; and (2) concerning the methodological point of view, we implemented Educational Design Research. The new teaching-learning model is the result of theoretical and methodological validation in real contexts according to an interdisciplinary approach. This study shows the strengths of interdisciplinary research for the pursuit of inclusive mathematics and high standards of learning.

AB  - Exposure to information about genetics is at an all-time high, while a full understanding of the biocultural complexity of human difference is low. This paper demonstrates the value of an "anthropological approach" to enhance genetics education in biology, anthropology, and other related disciplines, when teaching about human differences such as race/ethnicity, sex/gender, and disability. As part of this approach, we challenge educators across social and natural sciences to critically examine and dismantle the tacit cultural assumptions that shape our understanding of genetics and inform the way we perceive (and teach about) human differences. It calls on educators from both social and natural science disciplines to "de-silo" their classrooms and uses examples from our biological anthropology and sociocultural anthropology classrooms, to demonstrate how educators can better contextualize the "genetics" of human difference in their own teaching. Numerous opportunities to transform our teaching exist, and we are doing a disservice to our students by not taking these critical steps.

AB  - Purpose: This research aims to identify the intentions behind becoming an entrepreneur and the perception of entrepreneurial failure among different groups of students. There has been significant research discussing the motivations behind becoming an entrepreneur. However, such a research study is often focused on individuals who are already in the entrepreneurial process. Therefore, this research focuses on the understanding of the entrepreneurial process specified on the intentions of becoming an entrepreneur and the associated risk, in the context of a learning process. Design/methodology/approach: The perspectives of students towards becoming an entrepreneur and their perception of associated risk are identified. A comparative exploratory case study method is used. Three cases developed in the light of empirical evidence consist of Business, Law and Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) students. Findings: Major results show that the law and STEM students were on the same line in terms of motivational factors, such as being career driven. In contrary, the business students were more driven by personal factors such as leaving something behind and building something meaningful. Originality/value: Whilst studies have attempted to understand entrepreneurial intentions, little work has considered students and their views on becoming entrepreneurs. Even with studies that looked at this subject matter, the focus was mainly business students. The authors build on previous work and construct the authors' views based on multi-disciplinary student base to know more about their intentions to become an entrepreneur. The science and law students were more influenced by external factors, whereas business students were focused more on their personal goals. Such classification of the diverse intentions based on student discipline opens a new and promising research avenue to better develop entrepreneurial education not only for business students but across all disciplines in higher education.

AB  - Family and consumer sciences (FCS) is an interdisciplinary field in which professionals, regardless of their specialty area, will most likely need to interact with individuals and families in poverty. Several tools are available to help instructors teach college students about poverty. The Community Action Poverty Simulation (CAPS) has been widely used throughout FCS programming (Nickols & Nielsen, 2011); however, other poverty simulations (e. g., Spent https://playspent. org) are not referenced in the literature. More than 100 students in college-level family resource management courses completed the Spent poverty simulation from 2015 through 2019. In this paper, we provide an overview of the state of poverty and the use of poverty simulations in higher education. The authors offer tips for readers looking to implement a virtual poverty simulation in their FCS courses.

AB  - This essay argues the importance of interdisciplinary, contemplative, place-based pedagogy. The Ecology and Colour in 1m[superscript 2] study has students from the sciences and the arts observe a small quadrat in their local community over several weeks, engaging in both scientific and creative expression. The connection to Aldo Leopold's teaching principles and its relevance during our current screen fatigue pandemic and increasing disconnection from the natural world are outlined. We review contemplative practice in relation to education, such as sit spots or "site-specific" learning. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the Ecology and Colour in 1m[superscript 2] study and aligned with Leopold's emphasis on fostering a personal connection with nature, our paper also includes three narratives and examples of student reflections and visual artwork created during this project.

AB  - This article analyzes the process of institutionalizing interdisciplinary graduate programs in Brazil, which has over more than four decades of experience implementing masters and doctoral problem-oriented programs designed to operate outside the disciplinary structure of universities. Brazil has a high degree of centrality and government regulation, requiring systematic performance reports. The main focus of this case study is the bottlenecks and lessons emerging from programs focused on sustainability, environmental management, and environment and society, all of which are strictly supervised by a national system of accreditation and evaluation. The article includes detailed presentation of one particular graduate program that has existed for twenty years, the Sustainable Development Center at the Universidade de Brasília. Several overall topics are also considered, including the idea that interdisciplinarity is an opportunity to integrate knowledge needed for confronting complex problems and does not compete with disciplinary efforts towards progress in science.

AB  - A case study entitled 'New Age Atlantis or Mysterious Seventh Continent' was developed as an exemplar model to show how the teaching methods and themes of Global Education (GE) can be used in geography lessons. The main intent of this article is to share an example of good practice about the use of this case study in geography lessons in Czechia. The aim of the study was twofold: to develop an understanding about how plastics contribute to ocean pollution, as a serious and current ecological topic in Global Education; as well as to show how the characteristics and movement of ocean water are related to the topic of ocean pollution. The main research goal was to study how pupils were able to put their skills and knowledge in practice by fulfilling the objective of the teaching activity -- to understand global ocean pollution. The teaching activity is based on methods which develop principles of critical thinking, learning by living, brainstorming, discussion, and group teaching. The teaching activity also allows for cross-curricular links to occur between school geography and other subjects including biology, physics, civic education, ecological education, and personal and social education. The teaching activities for the 'New Age Atlantis' case study is aimed at pupils aged between 12 to 15 years. The case study results confirm that as pupils collaborate and communicate with their peers and teachers, they learn to critically accept the opinions of others and, at the same time, to defend their own opinions. All of the pupils were able to understand and recognize the problem at hand.

AB  - This article discusses the latest developments of the Sucre4Stem tool, as part of the Sucre initiative, which aims to promote interest in computational thinking and programming skills in K-12 students. The tool follows the Internet of Things approach and consists of two prominent components: 1) SucreCore and 2) SucreCode. SucreCore incorporates an advanced microcontroller packaged in a more compact design and enables wireless connectivity. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming tool, supports two different sets of blocks depending on the education grade, and facilitates wireless communication with SucreCore. At the educational level, Sucre4Stem fosters new group dynamics and encourages students to experiment real-world projects by promoting the "programming to learn" approach to concepts from other disciplines as opposed to the strategy widely applied in schools of "learning to program" in isolation.

AB  - A significant problem in today's school science education is that students often perceive fundamental scientific principles and natural laws as isolated pieces of knowledge without connections between them or to natural phenomena. Instead, students too often are engaging in activities which are distinct and do not follow a meaningful learning sequence, thus depriving them of the opportunity to transfer knowledge and build on past experiences make connections between the different fundamental principles of our world. In our work, we proposed to teachers the use of the "Big Ideas of Science", a set of overarching core ideas, as a cross-disciplinary 'backbone structure' for science education that could support their efforts to facilitate students' ability to see and make the connections between previously and newly acquired knowledge as well as between science subjects taught in school classroom and everyday life. The results presented in this paper confirm that teachers indeed found such an approach beneficial for their students and that the "Big ideas Of Science" could contribute in teaching science more effectively.

AB  - Increasing the scientific knowledge of the population through education is a development strategy towards a sustainable future. However, there is no equity in the access to science education and scientific knowledge. The aim of this paper is to present and analyse a science kit named "Energy, Environment and Sustainability" (KEAS). Based on research conducted in Guinea-Bissau, it explores strategies to promote science education for a sustainable future. The strengths and limitations of the KEAS were studied using different data collection methods, including interviews, observation, survey, focus groups and document analysis. The participants were teacher trainers from the Guinea-Bissau School of Education. It is concluded that the KEAS is a feasible and suitable teaching strategy appropriate to the context, having the potential to contribute to learning about the environment and sustainability. Further, it addresses real problems for which students should acquire knowledge and skills in order to be able to make informed choices.

AB  - The article deals with interdisciplinary aspects of learning in the case of physics and psychology. It describes the lab-based academic course focused on: observation and experimentation; discovery of new scientific facts; measurement; identification of errors; the study of psychological characteristics of people (time perception, the reaction time, thresholds). The above techniques are commonly used by both physicists and psychologists. Students are interested in these topics. They are very important, but are excluded from traditional physics and psychology courses.

AB  - Public administration is a highly diverse and evolving field of scientific inquiry. The study domain is characterised further by often-competing paradigmatic perspectives and seemingly endless teaching modalities. There seems to be an increasing realisation that answers to complex societal challenges cannot be solved within the knowledge frameworks of individual disciplines. As a result, interdisciplinary teaching emerged to expose students to approaches, theories and methodologies from various disciplines of the social and natural sciences, in search of potential answers to these challenges. In spite of the qualities and potential contributions of interdisciplinarity, there may be fewer positive consequences for teaching efforts. This article intends to reflect on the potential consequences, both positive and negative, that interdisciplinary studies have on the teaching of public administration. The article will review the possible advantages or contributions of interdisciplinarity to the teaching of public administration, and reflect on the possibly less-desired consequences of interdisciplinary collaboration on curriculum design and teaching methods.

AB  - Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (NST) education is at the forefront of an emerging interdisciplinary frontier, ready to address global challenges. In this context, our research adopts a distinctive approach--using software applications in digital games to introduce young children to NST concepts and analyse resulting learning outcomes. The three-step research unfolds strategically, aiming to assess the effectiveness of two distinct digital technologies (computers and tablets) at an introductory level, influencing children's understanding of Nanotechnology concepts. One hundred fifty second-grade students, divided into experimental and control groups, participated in an exploration facilitated by the Test for the NANOtechnology Elementary Knowledge Assessment (TENANO). This tool meticulously measures the depth of children's knowledge about size, a fundamental aspect of NST. The experimental groups, especially the tablet group, significantly outperformed their post-test control counterparts. This marks a pioneering stride in early primary education. By leveraging children's familiarity with digital technology, this research harnesses the recent health crisis to advance NST education through interactive games, leaving a distinctive mark on early-primary NST education and paving the way for transformative educational methodologies.

AB  - For English as a foreign language (EFL) graduate students in STEM, with the need to publish in an international journal comes the double burden of developing general English language skills and discipline-specific writing skills. To help these students effectively, discipline-specific scientific writing (SW) instruction is necessary but has been scarce in Asian contexts. This study investigates how discipline-specific SW courses were developed for graduate students at a Korean science and engineering university, if the courses were successfully implemented, and what could be done to improve the offering of such courses. The study uses a mixed methods research design, informed by the research paradigm of pragmatism. The dataset used in the present study includes interviews, questionnaire surveys, and performance measurement. Interviews were conducted with six language and five content professors and nine teaching assistants, and 42 students involved in the development and offering of the SW courses. A purposive sampling approach was used in selecting interviewees. In addition, two types of questionnaire surveys were conducted among the students who had taken the courses: 225 participated in the university survey and 312 in the program survey. In addition, a pretest and posttest were given to measure students' improvement in their SW performances. For data analysis, text analysis and descriptive statistics were used. The results show that the courses were well received by all those involved. Students expressed appreciation for their instructor's individual attention and feedback on their writing. Moreover, students' posttest scores showed substantial improvement. On the other hand, the study raises such issues as difficulties in collaboration between the language and content professors and the need to enhance the course's relevance to students' major fields. The study concludes by offering suggestions on how to improve the interdisciplinary aspect of SW courses for STEM students and by providing a recommended model of interdisciplinary collaboration among language and content professors and teaching assistants.

AB  - Offering core academic credits (e.g., math, science) for completing agriculture, food, and natural resources (AFNR) coursework at the secondary school level has the potential to increase the strength of the AFNR program as well as student interdisciplinary learning. Informed by the Career and Technical Education Student Typology, we explored the scope of core academic offerings in Michigan AFNR programs, including the frequency of core academic offerings, AFNR course types in which core academics are offered, and types of core academic credit obtained. Findings indicate 95.00% of Michigan teachers responding to the survey offered some form of core academic credit through their AFNR coursework. Additionally, findings suggest science is the most obtained core academic credit and the predominance of core academic credit is being offered in introductory course types within AFNR programs. These findings, among others, were synthesized into three conclusions which focus on the frequency of core academic offerings, strength of science as an integrated discipline, and identified opportunities to expand core academic offerings. The paper concludes with a roadmap for continued efforts to enhance core academic offerings and AFNR programs via a combination of research and practice.

AB  - K-12 classroom settings are not yet incorporating emerging technologies such as ubiquitous computing, augmented reality, nor even touch surfaces, despite the significant impact that such media have made in many other aspects of our lives. Unfortunately, classroom environments have not generally evolved to support students in the new modes of collaboration, idea sharing, and inquiry that characterize many of our research-based innovations. Responding to this challenge, our research was conducted by a multi-disciplinary design team including educational researchers, a high school physics teacher, and technology designers. We embarked on a series of design-based research projects to investigate a smart classroom infrastructure that scaffolds students and teachers in new forms of collaboration and inquiry, including a substantive role for large projected displays and small touch surfaces, as well as a dependency on students' physical location within the room. This paper describes our designs, including: (1) the role of large displays for communicating aggregate and ambient information, (2) the role of real-time communication between students, (3) the application of intelligent software agents to enact real-time pedagogical logic, (4) support for learning across contexts, and (5) orchestration of inquiry roles, materials and environments. These designs are particularly relevant for the Learning Sciences community, as they offer insight into how the orchestrated classroom can support new forms of collaborative, cooperative and collective inquiry. One important outcome of this work is a set of design principles for supporting smart classroom research.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratory research was not possible in different educational programs at Delft University of Technology and Erasmus University Medical Center due to the taken measures. Therefore, a team of faculty from both institutions developed an alternative transdisciplinary research group project that was fully performed online. The overall project was named the Corona Research Super Project. This project provided an opportunity for students to fulfil the requirements for their degree while complying with the guidelines of the University, Medical Center, and government. It also gave them an opportunity to participate in something that felt meaningful during a stressful time since all sub-projects contributed to developing knowledge on the current COVID-19 pandemic. This article describes the process of setting up this educational project, the resources provided to the students, and the format of transdisciplinary work. Furthermore, it also provides a theoretical view on how to think about research projects when you cannot be side by side in a laboratory and how to make this into meaningful research education. By sharing our experience of setting up this program in unprecedented times and providing a format, we hope that other universities will use this approach to develop comparable transdisciplinary educational programs. We believe that these sorts of programs are essential for in depth transdisciplinary training of scientists of the future

AB  - Past research has often shown a lack of student output in English medium instruction (EMI) classes (e.g., An et al., 2021; Lo & Macaro, 2012) and this study seeks to identify possible reasons. Guided by literature on wait time (Rowe, 1986) and teacher higher-order thinking questions (Chin, 2007), this study explores whether these two pedagogical moves have the same impact on classroom interaction in EMI science classes. 30 EMI science lessons were recorded from seven EMI high school programs in China, taught by 15 native speakers of English to homogenous groups of Chinese students. Correlation tests showed that when there was more wait time after a teacher question, the students produced lengthier responses with more linguistic complexity, took up more talk time, and asked more questions. However, greater use of teacher higher-order thinking questions, coded by Chin's (2007) framework of constructivist questions, did not correlate with any student output measures. This suggests that wait time may be a more effective factor leading to more student output in EMI classes than asking higher-order thinking questions. Qualitative analysis showed teachers' follow-up moves may have also played a role in the limited success of higher-order thinking questions.

AB  - An interdisciplinary undergraduate atmospheric science modeling course was cotaught at a midsize public university by three professors from atmospheric science, statistics, and design using a blended learning approach. The in-class portion of the course taught upper-level students numerical weather prediction modeling and statistical evaluation methods. Online modules were used to teach data visualization techniques and three foundational design principles upon which their efficacy depends: legibility, visual hierarchy, and appropriate use of color. Geoscience students need data visualization skills to prepare for careers in government, industry, and research that increasingly require work with big data and communication with diverse collaborators and audiences. This article focuses on the instructional approach for the visualization component of the course--specifically, the three teaching innovations used: online modules, an interdisciplinary teaching team, and design-focused data visualization instruction. Although course enrollment was low at four students, several valuable lessons were learned that can improve the teaching of visualization in geoscience courses, including the utility of structuring visualization instruction around two separate but complementary visualization skills: visualization for analysis and visualization for sharing knowledge. Evaluation of students' visualization work at the conclusion of the course demonstrated improvement in the foundational design principles as well as improved ability to select appropriate visualization strategies for different situations. The methods used to assess these improvements are presented alongside illustrative examples of student work. Pre- and postcourse surveys indicate the students felt more confident in creating data visualizations upon completion of the course, and qualitative assessments of student work confirm increased application of foundational design principles in visualizations created by the students. The authors argue that teaching visualization as an online supplement to other geoscience instruction is a potentially replicable model for improving students' learning about visualization. This is especially true when such instruction relies on open-source programs and materials and leverages interdisciplinary expertise in course design.

AB  - Modern science education the world over deliberately remains in the objective, rational, positivist paradigm. In South African classrooms, this paradigm is often alienating for young learners who then stop learning science at the end of Grade 9. Literature indicates that an arts-rich education improves learner engagement, attitudes and test scores, as evidenced by science Nobel laureates who engage more with the arts than other scientists. The research reported in this study involved the presentation of a lesson on acids and bases to 222 Grade 9 learners in 4 schools in the greater Tshwane region to establish whether their interest levels in the subject would improve when using a poem and video that characterise, describe and demonstrate scientific concepts. An in-class intervention of 40 minutes was used with identical Likert-scale, pre and post-tests analysed using the Wilcoxon and "t"-test. The results showed that the arts-rich lesson engaged learners in a manner which holistically improved their interest levels. The results were independent of gender, home language and the type of large, urban, government school that they attended. The results were not significant for the small, semi-rural, private school research site.

AB  - This study developed and validated an assessment that measures interdisciplinary understanding using the topic of carbon cycling, the Interdisciplinary Science Assessment for Carbon Cycling (ISACC). This work was motivated by the need to assess interdisciplinary understanding, defined as the ability to solve problems requiring knowledge and skills from multiple disciplines. Levels of a construct map for interdisciplinary understanding were generated and refined in the construct-modeling design process (Wilson 2005). Key concepts in carbon cycling to be assessed were determined based on experts' concept maps and analysis of the Next Generation Science Standards. The final version of the ISACC includes 11 multiple-choice (MC) items and eight constructed-response (CR) items covering nine key concepts. Of these 19 items, six are single-disciplinary items and 13 are interdisciplinary items. Four hundred fifty-four students in grades 9-16 were recruited and administered the ISACC. For the CR items, scoring rubrics were developed and used by a group of evaluators to code student responses. Two item response theory models, a two-parameter logistic model and a generalized partial credit model, provided evidence of the construct validity of the items. All items reflected unidimensionality and local independence and showed moderate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.782). All except one were a good fit to the models. The findings suggest that the ISACC is a promising tool to assess interdisciplinary understanding of carbon cycling. Future directions include research into test fairness across gender and ethnic/racial groups and further development to cover typical high school students' knowledge more thoroughly.

AB  - Non-science majors often lack motivation to take science courses required for their graduation, because these courses are usually taught in a lecture format and are disconnected from their everyday life and needs related to future careers. This two-phase action research, utilizing argumentative writing (AW) supported with online simulation, was conducted over three academic years in a college chemistry course designed for non-science majors. Phase 1, a quasi-experimental design (n = 134), examined the treatment effects of AW projects and determined the components of AW that contributed to student gains in conceptual performance. The results showed that students in the AW group scored significantly higher in conceptual performance than the control group. Five AW components predicted student gains in conceptual performance: accuracy of claim, relationship between claim and question, relationship between claim and evidence, use of multiple examples, and use of appropriate writing style. Phase 2, a single group design (n = 118), explored the inter-relationships between pre-/post-course knowledge, pre-/post-course motivation, and students' performance on AW projects. The results showed that students' motivation to learn chemistry at the beginning of the course is a significant predictor of their conceptual performance. Pathway analysis found that the performance of AW projects in low motivation students was affected by extrinsic motivation (grades, career). Their performance in AW projects did not affect their post-course knowledge. In contrast, the performance in AW projects by high motivation students was affected by intrinsic motivation and self-determination. They cumulatively built knowledge through AW projects that eventually affected post-course knowledge.

AB  - This paper explores the potential of Project-Based Learning (PBL) approach in a multidisciplinary art classroom involving STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) education. The PBL approach involves a dynamic classroom approach, which emphasises on long-term learning, interdisciplinary and student-centred art activities. This implementation would benefit the teaching strategies in art projects; helping students understand lessons, improving communication and soft skills, as well as enhancing leadership skills and creativity. However, there are some concerns related to the PBL approach: (1) difficulties in finding appropriate teaching strategies; (2) choosing suitable projects; (3) selecting relevant measurement tools or assessing rubrics; and (4) developing learning content to suit the objective and the main purpose of the art curriculum. In identifying this approach's potential, a study was carried out involving two art teachers in their respective classrooms. Data was collected through interviews, observations, and document analysis of their teaching strategies, which included three main phases of PBL implementation in creating art projects. The findings suggest that the PBL pedagogical design has the ability to improve teaching strategies and with potential to replace a traditional, teacher-led art classroom. The approach is effective in guiding teachers to manoeuvre an authentic art lesson while benefiting the students through emphasis on the artistic process of creating a STEAM project, while focusing on culminating the necessary art content through active collaboration, exploration of real-world challenges and curricular activities' problem-solving. However, a number of challenges were identified, such as curriculum demand, learning content, teachers' and students' attitude, and access to instruments. Hence, a number of suggestions and recommendations are proposed to help resolve the challenges. The implications of the study on arts curriculum, school systems and other higher institutions are also discussed.

AB  - Twenty-first-century biology is inherently interdisciplinary. Every aspect of biology, from molecules to organisms to ecosystems, is richly informed by the physical, mathematical, and computational sciences. It is both an exciting and daunting time for biology educators--exciting because of the vast opportunity for important new discoveries that will come about in an interdisciplinary context, yet daunting for many current biology educators who were not trained within such a framework. The call for transformation of the undergraduate biology experience to better address interdisciplinarity is not new. At St. Olaf College, a liberal arts college with an undergraduate-only population of [approximately] 3000, school administrators are fortunate in that their relatively small size allows for a certain degree of nimbleness as they consider changes that foster interdisciplinarity. In this essay, the authors share some perspectives and examples that have emerged for them over the past 10 years or so as they have attempted to offer a broadly interdisciplinary environment in which their students and faculty explore and understand biology.

AB  - Having stepped down as editor of Educational Technology Research & Development after 15 years of service, and having learned much from Steve Ross, who served as editor for 18 years, and from many of the leading scholars in the broad and multidisciplinary field of educational technology, I have been thinking of the value added by the research and developments of so many talented and dedicated academics. The innovative learning environments and careful studies I have read these last 15 years leads me to wonder why there seems to be so little progress in the field of educational technology. In other fields such as automotive engineering or medical research there have been remarkable gains. In fields that inform education such as brain science and social behavior, we have also seen significant and sustained progress. Why has there not been more progress in and impact of educational technology research and the many innovative learning environments that have been created in recent years? That is the question that motivates these remarks.

AB  - Cognition is not just 'in the head'; it extends well beyond the skull and the skin. Non-Cartesian Cognitive Science views cognition as being embodied, environmentally embedded, enacted, encultured, and socially distributed. The Douglas Fir Group (2016) likewise recognizes languages as emergent, social, integrated phenomena. Language is the quintessence of distributed cognition. Language cognition is shared across naturally occurring, culturally constituted, communicative activities. Usage affects learning and it affects languages, too. These are essential components of a theory of language cognition. This article summarizes these developments within cognitive science before considering implications for language research and teaching, especially as these concern usage-based language learning and cognition in second language and multilingual contexts. Here, I prioritize research involving corpus-, computational-, and psycho-linguistics, and cognitive psychological, complex adaptive system, and network science investigations of learner--language interactions. But there are many other implications. Looking at languages through any one single lens does not do the phenomena justice. Taking the social turn does not entail restricting our research focus to the social. Nor does it obviate more traditional approaches to second language acquisition. Instead it calls for greater transdisciplinarity, diversity, and collaborative work.

AB  - This research aims to determine science student teachers' views and conceptions of the interdisciplinary sexual health education course. Also, the current study inferiorly purposes to eliminate their misconceptions after the course. Data were obtained from in-class student products, course evaluation forms and course field notes. Within a qualitative methodology, they were descriptively evaluated and analyzed. The science student teachers under investigation stated that the interdisciplinary sexual health education course was very effective at freely talking about sexuality. Further, they depicted that they were able to easily get more accurate, reliable and memorable information from primary sources by asking the specialists/experts during the course. Overall, it can be concluded that the course remedied their misconceptions of the sexuality.

AB  - Discipline-based education research (DBER) is an emergent, interdisciplinary field of scholarship aimed at understanding and improving discipline-specific teaching and learning. The number of DBER faculty members in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) departments has grown rapidly in recent years. Because the interdisciplinary nature of DBER involves social science, senior STEM faculty members may find it challenging to evaluate the quality or impact of DBER scholarship. This essay aims to address this issue by providing guidance on evaluating the scholarly accomplishments of DBER faculty members in a way that is useful to departmental colleagues and administrators during the tenure and promotion evaluation process.

AB  - Calls to bring interdisciplinary content and examples into introductory science courses have increased, yet strategies that involve course restructuring often suffer from the need for a significant faculty commitment to motivate change. Minimizing the need for dramatic course reorganization, the structure, reactivity, and chemical biology applications of classes of biological monomers and polymers have been integrated into introductory organic chemistry courses through three series of semester-long weekly assignments that explored (a) Carbohydrates and Oligosaccharides, (b) Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins, and (c) Nucleosides, Nucleotides, and Nucleic Acids. Comparisons of unannounced pre- and post tests revealed improved understanding of a reaction introduced in the assignments, and course examinations evaluated cumulative assignment topics. Course surveys revealed that demonstrating biologically relevant applications consistently throughout the semesters enhanced student interest in the connection between basic organic chemistry content and its application to new and unfamiliar bio-related examples. Covering basic material related to these classes of molecules outside of the classroom opened lecture time to allow the instructor to further build on information developed through the weekly assignments, teaching advanced topics and applications typically not covered in an introductory organic chemistry lecture course. Assignments were implemented as homework, either with or without accompanying discussion, in both laboratory and lecture organic courses within the context of the existing course structures.

AB  - Social studies promotes civic competence by equipping students with the knowledge, values, beliefs, attitudes, and skills needed in a democratic society (Allen & Stevens, 1998; National Council for the Social Studies [NCSS], 1994). However, the multidisciplinary characteristics of civic issues entail an integrated curriculum covering different aspects of human social behavior (Naylor & Diem, 1987; NCSS, 1994). Therefore, social studies draws its content mostly from various social sciences such as anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, sociology, and so forth (Martorellla, 1998; NCSS, 1994; Turkish Ministry of National Education [MoNE/MEB], 2018; Turner, 2004), which makes it "the most inclusive of all school subjects" (Ross, 2001, p. 19). This study investigated the interest of preservice teachers in the core social science disciplines covered in the social studies curriculum; namely, economics, geography, history, political science, and sociology (Maxim, 2006; MoNE/MEB, 2018; Turner, 2004) and preservice teachers' planned teaching efforts for social studies topics associated with these disciplines.

AB  - In both 2016 and 2019, the NCLEX-RN (National Council Licensure Examination -- RN computerized exam) test plan outlined 15% of content as "pharmacological and parenteral therapies". The test plan also includes physiological sciences. The topics of pharmacology encompass the review of drug action in living organisms, such as humans. As such, reviewing correlations of molecular structure and functional groups is a recurrent topic in pharmacological education and prerequisite courses. Many nursing students are required to participate in a specific curriculum, prior to matriculation, which covers pharmacology as it pertains to healthcare. The interdisciplinary topics of healthcare and chemistry, advanced pharmacology, pharmaceuticals, and biochemical pathways in human physiology are apparent in multiple undergraduate nursing program curricula. Here, we have an opportunity for the development of a first year Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) chemistry for health professions course that would introduce molecular structure-function relations concerning pharmacological topics and human physiology chemical pathways. A chemistry computer lab exercise was design to complement undergraduate health professions nursing school chemistry classroom lectures on molecular structure--function relations. Online 2D molecular drawing software was employed as a tool for visualizing a list of molecules to primarily help students understand OTC (over-the-counter) drug "active ingredient" structure pertaining to drug function and biological agents in human physiology. Student responses highlight positive feedback to this useful exercise and further recommendation for use in ongoing undergraduate health professions courses.

AB  - Funded by innovative programs at the National Science Foundation and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Richmond faculty in biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and computer science teamed up to offer first- and second-year students the opportunity to contribute to vibrant, interdisciplinary research projects. The result was not only good science but also good science that motivated and informed course development. Here, we describe four recent undergraduate research projects involving students and faculty in biology, physics, mathematics, and computer science and how each contributed in significant ways to the conception and implementation of our new Integrated Quantitative Science course, a course for first-year students that integrates the material in the first course of the major in each of biology, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, and physics.

AB  - Contemporary research suggests an urgent need for educators to improve the quality of STEM teaching and learning. We developed a semester-long model curriculum for STEM teaching and learning. The overarching goal of this study was to establish an authentic inquiry approach to advanced laboratory courses that is interdisciplinary, collaborative, and utilizes algorithm-generated student grouping strategies. We assessed the effects of the model curriculum on student understanding of scientific concepts and processes, perceptions of their learning, and attitudes toward science and research. Students in a biology laboratory course collaborated with students in biochemistry and mathematics courses. The differences between pre- and post-Participant Perception Indicator (PPI) survey responses (relative to the baseline semester) indicated that, when paired with similarly-performing students, higher-performing students are more likely to report improvements in "understanding," "skills," "integration of learning," and "meeting learning objectives." Mid-level performing students report significant improvements in "understanding," "attitudes," "integration of learning," and "meeting learning objectives." Lower-level performing students report regressions. Performance quiz data reveal improvements in understanding of scientific concepts following the implementation of our model curriculum. Our findings warrant future studies on the relationships among grouping, student perceptions, and academic performance.

AB  - The research explores the potential of incorporating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education approach and critical thinking to enhance historical consciousness. The study employs an ex post facto quantitative method, specifically a correlational design to analyse the variables. The research population comprises 425 students from diverse backgrounds in Banten Province schools that have implemented the STEM approach. A sample size of 202 students is determined using a predefined error rate. Data collection involves tests and questionnaires assessing historical thinking skills, STEM approaches, and historical consciousness. Statistical analysis, including partial and simultaneous multiple correlation tests, reveals a significant and very strong positive relationship between STEM approach, historical thinking skills, and historical consciousness. This suggests that the interplay of these factors enhances history learning and encourages a deeper understanding of historical events, promoting critical thinking, and historical consciousness. The study emphasizes the importance of integrating STEM methodologies into history education to provide students with a holistic understanding of historical events and their societal implications. Such an approach bridges the gap between STEM and history, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and promoting informed and empathetic citizens. Future research should explore diverse samples, employ qualitative methods, and investigate curriculum designs and teaching strategies that effectively integrate STEM and history education.

AB  - For well over a century, the journal "Science Education" has been publishing articles about the teaching and learning of science. These articles represent more than just a repository of past work: they have the potential to offer insights into both the history of science education as well as well as the dynamics of field-specific change. It can be difficult, however, for educators, researchers, reformers, and policymakers to grasp the nuances of over 100 years of scholarship given the overwhelming amount of textual material. To address this problem, we have used latent Dirichlet allocation, an automated machine-learning algorithm from the field of natural language processing, to perform an automated literature review and classification of the corpus of work in "Science Education." Using this technique, we have classified research in the journal into 21 distinct topics, falling into three thematic groups: science content topics, teaching-focused topics, and student-focused topics. We have also quantified the rise and fall of these topics and groups over time, and used them to begin to extract insight into the development of the field, including the effects of national policy changes on topics of interest to the research community, the interrelationships between different research topics, and the effects of intellectual cross-pollination. Based on this analysis, we argue that this technique shows great promise for even larger-scale analyses of educational literature and other textual data.

AB  - Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) incorporate research opportunities into the existing curriculum often by providing alternatives or replacing the traditional cookbook-based laboratory courses. Over the past 50 years, CURE courses have been shown to benefit both students and faculty members alike. Despite the large number of available publications on CUREs, few focus on their implementation at the first-year level. This article reports the design and implementation of a new interdisciplinary CURE based on antibiotic discovery that combines General Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Microbiology concepts allowing self-enrolled first-year students to satisfy the requirements for General Chemistry Laboratory I. The applicability and success of this CURE course is demonstrated through the significance of student-generated experimental results, improvement in competence tests, and affective surveys.

AB  - Course outlines for science teachers, designed and developed at 6 universities, were critically analysed and compared with the guidelines for science education set out in the national policy framework known as the Minimum Requirements for Teacher Education Qualifications (MRTEQ) to identify the characteristics of a competent science teacher. Researchers used qualitative means to elicit data from the curriculum documents and in-depth interviews with science teacher educators at the institutions that participated in the study. The analysis of data focused on identifying views and perspectives that informed selection and organisation of curriculum content and pedagogical approaches. The findings that emerged from the data analysis point to both convergence and divergence among science teacher educators in terms of (i) interpretations of the policy on the minimum requirements for teacher qualifications, (ii) conceptualising hybridisation of academic content knowledge from different disciplines in the fields of science, and (iii) conceptualisation of pedagogical content knowledge for integrated approaches to teaching and learning of knowledge. A lack of uniformity in the conceptualised academic content and the conceptual framework to develop pedagogical content knowledge for the interdisciplinary school subject, Natural Sciences, pointed to the challenges facing departments of sciences education to produce competent teachers.

AB  - We reflect on the use of photovoice methods in a hybrid classroom environment for an interdisciplinary course titled Climate and Society at the University of Miami. The activities, based on our team's hyperlocal method of community-based climate adaptation engagement, create opportunities to engage with the complexities of climate science and policy solutions in unique and powerful ways. Our principal contribution is a series of exercises that can be done by educators anywhere in the world, providing a foundation for reflection and rich conversations. We conclude with recommendations and tools to aid educators in recreating the exercise in many settings.

AB  - An interdisciplinary team-teaching session was introduced to high school students who participated in the Oakland University William Beaumont Future Physician Summer Enrichment Program. The rising prevalence of adolescent obesity necessitates innovative educational strategies that effectively engage high school students in understanding the complex physiologic mechanisms and nutrition concepts underlying its development. This submission presents a session that is designed to integrate the physiological concepts and nutrition that are associated with the development of obesity. Foundational information about the different food ingredients and physiology of the gastrointestinal organ system followed by concepts associated with the development of obesity and its complications were introduced. The session was delivered using combined educational approaches such as a dialogical-narrative approach and hands-on application activities by two discipline experts, physiology and nutrition. This innovative approach was well received, as evidenced by high satisfaction rates among participants. While direct measures of critical thinking and practical skills development were not captured, the positive feedback suggests that students appreciated the engaging, hands-on application of theoretical concepts. The sessions fostered an awareness of personal health responsibilities, with students actively participating and connecting learned material with practical scenarios. We believe that using combined educational approaches in interdisciplinary team-teaching sessions promotes inclusiveness and interactive engagement and enhances long-life learning.

AB  - The integration of the arts and humanities into the core of curriculum along with the sciences and technological disciplines is an emerging issue in educational research. This article seeks to contribute to this research and curricular approach, for which we analyze the emergence of the STEAM movement, its implementation in class, and its social, economic, and educational consequences. The main conclusion reached is that, without ignoring the economic rationality in education, it is necessary to go further in order to embrace a more social and democratic conception of schooling, trying to take advantage of this historical moment to transform education toward a more humanistic approach--without neglecting the scientific facet--that offers a well-rounded education to new generations while, at the same time, responds to the social and economic demands of our current world.

AB  - In response to a desire to strengthen the economy, educational settings are emphasizing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curriculum and programs. Yet, because of the narrow approach to STEM, educational leaders continue to call for a more balanced approach to teaching and learning, which includes the arts, design, and humanities. This desire created space for science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education, a transdisciplinary approach that focuses on problem-solving. STEAM-based curricula and STEAM-themed schools are appearing all over the globe. This growing national and global attention to STEAM provides an opportunity for teacher education to explore the ways in which teachers implement STEAM practices, examining the successes and challenges, and how teachers are beginning to make sense of this innovative teaching practice. The purpose of this paper is to examine the implementation of STEAM teaching practices in science and math middle school classrooms, in hopes to provide research-based evidence on this emerging topic to guide teacher educators.

AB  - Prior to the recycling process, raising awareness of plastic waste impact, e.g., polluting oceans worldwide, is undoubtedly a first attempt to tackle this pandemic environmental issue. With this in mind, the presented practical session is an effort to entice an interdisciplinary audience of science undergraduates toward a sustainable future. The associated assignment focuses on a collaboration of undergraduate chemistry students and engineering undergraduates with a minor program in chemistry. Acting on an adequate uncluttered mind map of practical guidelines, the students acquire and exchange multiple "good laboratory practice" skills. By this, engineering undergraduates get acquainted with chemicals, e.g., polymers, while future chemists get an impression of how economics is concerned to maintain a balance between economy and ecology, i.e., a circular economy. In a grand finale, the students present their interdisciplinary communication skills via a poster exhibition: "chemistry meets economics." Moreover, via this interdisciplinary approach the traditional polymer chemistry laboratory session, still a substantial part of the organic chemistry curriculum in the polymer chemistry courses, gets a makeover and will be integrated into a modern, advanced curriculum.

AB  - Cyberbiosecurity and workforce development in agriculture and the life sciences (ALS) is a growing area of need in the curriculum in higher education. Students that pursue majors related to ALS often do not include training in cyber-related concepts or expose the 'hidden curriculum' of seeking internships and jobs. Exposing students through workforce development training and hands-on engagement with industry professionals can provide learning opportunities to bridge the two and is an area of growth and demand as the workforce evolves. The objectives of this work were (1) to learn key concepts in cybersecurity, including data security, visualization, and analysis, to name a few, through class activities and engagement with professional partners and (2) to understand what knowledge students gained from participating in the course could transfer over for when they enter the workforce. Three themes emerged from the study where students, through direct engagement with industry partners, gained more insight about the industry applicable to their studies; they established work environment expectations for entering internships and official job placements and established ways in which the workforce development training informed their future careers.

AB  - Using an autoethnographic approach, this article draws on my personal experience as an Asian Pacific American (APA) political theorist who has navigated between different institutional spaces to reflect on a phenomenon that I call "elastic racialization" of APAs in higher education and its implications on our pedagogic agenda and curriculum. While the existing notion of "differential racialization" critically captures the ways in which racial minority groups have been racialized in different ways in accordance with the changing interests of the dominant group, the concept is often used in a broad U.S. national context such that even though it underlines fluidity in the social construction of race, the racialized meanings of particular racial groups can become fixed understandings and paradigms. As a result, we stop short of exploring further how the differential racialization of people of color--for instance, APAs as the "model minority" and the "perpetual foreigner"--can take on more protean forms in particular locations and contexts. Through a self-reflective analysis, I discuss how my racialized positionality in academia has taken on a more nuanced, elastic quality in different institutional contexts: shifting between "racial stranger" in the predominantly White space of political theory within political science and "racial underling" in the multiracial space of an interdisciplinary academic unit. Elastic racialization systemically effaces APA experiences/issues in the teaching/learning agenda of political science and other (inter)disciplinary fields, underlining the resilient multiformity of racism that requires a protean and multipronged approach of counter-racialization in higher education.

AB  - The primary aims of environmental education and courses at universities are for students to develop an environmental mentality and to be able to apply that mindset to solving real-world issues. In this study, pre-service elementary students participated in active learning environments through creating educational radio program activities by researching scientific information on seven topics: water, air soil, global warming, population, green chemistry and artificial intelligence. Presentations of their radio programs were followed by construction of mind maps to exhibit knowledge of the environmental concepts they had learned. This approach demonstrated useful knowledge for future classroom applications for teaching about environmental issues. Mind maps were used to help university students establish patterns between concepts and thoughts, understand cause-effect relationships, and organize and systematize their complex knowledge about environmental issues. A case study design was implemented. Participants were second-year students enrolled in a public university's Elementary Teaching Program in Izmir, Turkey. Results indicated that the incorporation of educational radio activities with mind maps to consider the most prominent environmental education issues and their alternative solutions raised students' awareness of how lesser-known issues are related to the environment. Students concentrated on a cognitive and affective process; learning to look at multidimensional environmental issues from many viewpoints by adding new concepts to those they previously knew.

AB  - The technological advancement and rapid development of artificial intelligence have led to a growing number of studies investigating pedagogical innovations incorporated with emerging technologies in this digital era. An increasing amount of empirical evidence has suggested the potential benefits of incorporating digital technologies and artificial intelligence in various educational contexts, such as the K-12 education, and a change in learning modality in the unprecedented period of COVID-19. In chemical education, various types of emerging technologies, such as eye-tracking techniques, learning analytics, robotics, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR), have seen wide applications and promising prospects. In this paper, a systematic review of emerging technologies adopted in chemical education during this era of digitalization and artificial intelligence is presented. The current study aims to identify the major types of technologies adopted in chemical education and analyze the empirical findings from relevant studies. A total of 45 studies between 2010 and 2021 were analyzed through a literature search in three inter-disciplinary databases: Web of Science, Scopus, and the Educational Information Resource Center. Full-text retrieval and analysis of the included studies were conducted. The present study finds that AR and VR applications were most extensively investigated among the identified types of technologies adopted in chemical education, while the major focus areas were associated with virtual chemistry laboratories, visualization and interaction with chemical structures, and classroom hands-on activities. The evidence presented in this study also indicates the promising applications of artificial intelligence and learning analytics in the analysis of students' feedback and behavior, assessment of students' understanding of chemical concepts, and investigations of students' reasoning and cognitive processes during chemical tasks such as spectral interpretation. Furthermore, areas requiring more research, investigations, potential future applications, as well as pedagogical implications of education for sustainable development will be identified based on the evidence presented in this study. The findings of this study are expected to give insight on the evolving areas of chemical education research and technology-enhanced teaching and learning.

AB  - Teaching and learning in universities have shifted towards online education, and there is not enough scientific knowledge about suitable pedagogical design principles to guide the construction of hybrid learning spaces for today's university students. In this design-based research, we studied the benefits and challenges in reaching the expected learning outcomes of an e-course, "Collaboration and Professional Interaction Skills." The practical purpose was developing the pedagogical design of this e-course. The scientific objective was to build on the research about design principles that guide teachers in constructing e-courses, enabling in-depth learning in hybrid learning spaces. The pedagogical design was guided by six design principles. Empirical data (21 students' assignments and reflections, teacher's observations, data from the digital learning management system) were collected in two research cycles. Students were from different degree programmes of educational sciences. Thematic analysis of students' individually and collaboratively authored assignments was carried out in both research cycles. The most emphasised benefits and challenges concerned the combination of working and creating knowledge together, virtually, in a multidisciplinary group. Based on the results, practical recommendations were made for university-level pedagogical designs that facilitate effective and active collaboration and interaction, and learning of such competence.

AB  - To understand how Geography and Geographical Information Science (GIS) can contribute to Interdisciplinary Research (IDR), it is relevant to articulate the differences between the different types of such research. "Multidisciplinary" researchers work in a "parallel play" mode, completing work in their disciplinary work streams and exchanging outputs as and when needed. This will ultimately result in separate publications by participants from each discipline and fosters a loose continued connection between researchers (Aboelela et al., 2007). "Interdisciplinary" research is described in language from all disciplines involved. Data and analytical methods are also more mixed, requiring researchers from one discipline to learn, at least in part, about methodologies from the others in order to complete their work. Publications are shared and language will be established that is intelligible to all involved fields (Aboelela et al., 2007). Examining the above, Geography and GIS fit very well into the multidisciplinary context. They can contribute tools, methods and techniques to problems, while permitting researchers to work within their own discipline. The potential of Geography and GIS for interdisciplinary research can also offer a useful approach to address the interdisciplinary challenge of finding a common language between two or more other disciplines, permitting integration of data and analytical methods. This article briefly introduces the papers presented at a symposium session held at the Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute for British Geographers) 2012 Annual Conference in Edinburgh, entitled "Geography in Interdisciplinary Research: Threat or Opportunity?" Submissions were invited that focused on the importance of Geography and GIS in interdisciplinary research, both as a separate discipline contributing methods, tools and techniques and also as an integrator and unifying factor, with the potential of providing a common starting point to overcome the challenges of bringing interdisciplinary teams together. The article concludes that the papers in this symposium highlight a number of factors that cause difficulties with interdisciplinary research, requiring effort from all parties to overcome. The ability of a team to move beyond the multi-disciplinary and into the interdisciplinary context depends to a great extent on the interest of team members in research, methods and data from other disciplines.

AB  - This is a hermeneutic phenomenological study that describes and interprets Wong's, the first author lived experience in the borderlands of science and Buddhist mindfulness as a science education doctoral student in Thailand. I explore my experiences in learning with multiple mindfulness teachers, including Thich Nhat Hanh from Buddhist traditions. and Additionally, I explore the affordances of being in the borderland of science and Buddhism, and how Buddhism can expand the border of science education through the inclusion of important topics, such as mindfulness, emotional wellbeing, and interbeing. This study also examines the roadblocks that are preventing deeper integration of science and mindfulness, including empiricism, scientism, individualism, materialism, and dualism. My standpoint is that to overcome the 21st grand challenges, teachers of science need to have the courage to cross the borders of various disciplines and help students develop essential skills for cultivating a healthy, balanced, and mindful lifestyle.

AB  - This study examines the efficacy of a novel college sustainability course in promoting relevant environmental knowledge and interest in careers related to environmental aspects within the Taiwanese educational context. The core content of the course covers the essential concepts of sustainability and introduces students to environmental issues and their interrelation with the nexus of food, energy, and water, as well as related economic and social issues. This action competencefocused course was designed to allow students to develop their understanding of sustainability through a combination of engaging lectures, novel group activities, case studies, exercises, and team projects. The sample consisted of 44 Taiwanese undergraduate and graduate students majoring in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Participants' interest in STEM careers and perceived knowledge were measured by a pre-test and post-test administered before and after the program, respectively. Analyses of variance, correlation analyses, and cross-lagged panel regression analyses were conducted to test four hypotheses. Results of repeated-measure analysis of covariance indicated that knowledge increased significantly from pre-test to post-test, but not career interest. Results of a cross-lagged panel regression analysis also indicated that pre-test knowledge was a significant positive predictor of post-test career interest. By creating an engaging class atmosphere and promoting experiential self-learning activities, this course was highly effective in enhancing students' knowledge of key sustainability aspects. Implications for interest development theory and sustainability pedagogy are also discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of science instruction given through the game and physical activities course in accordance with interdisciplinary teaching approaches on students' science achievement and retention. The participants were 82 third grade students from a public elementary school. Three classes were chosen as experimental groups and one class was chosen as a control group in the school. The instruction period lasted for five weeks in all groups. The data were collected by an achievement test and an education portal achievement (EPA) test. The pretest-posttest control group design was used in the study. Data obtained from the tests were analyzed through one-way analysis of variance and post-hoc analyses. The findings indicated that some of the experimental groups were more successful than the control group with large effect sizes. The results suggested that the game and physical activities course incorporating interdisciplinary teaching approaches could be used in increasing students' science achievement and retention of science knowledge.

AB  - Primary practitioners are tasked with the simultaneously exciting and daunting task of delivering a breadth of curriculum subjects to primary-age children. This makes the choice of profession a varied and engaging vocation in which no day is the same as the one before. When looking ahead at science medium-term planning, it may seem like a considerable challenge to cover all the necessary learning objectives in just six weeks. Primary science is often viewed as the 'non-core' core subject. In this article, the author addresses the challenges of offering high-quality science experiences in the classroom while also meeting the range of curriculum expectations. The ideas presented demonstrate a fraction of the ways in which science can be established at the core of the primary classroom.

AB  - In 2014, Metropolia University of Applied Sciences implemented a fundamental change in its curriculum from small single topic 3-5 credits courses into 15 credits multidisciplinary courses implemented by teacher teams. This paper focuses on how teachers of Information Technology programs experienced the reform. Research data include teacher feedback and opinions that were collected during training sessions and interviews. Team teaching is a substantial change for teachers that raises concerns about time management, getting enough compensation for the work and possible loss of teacher autonomy. However, teacher teams that managed to overcome these challenges saw a variety of benefits in the new approach. Not only was team teaching seen as a means for providing students with the skills they need, but it also was discovered as a way to enhance the teacher's own professional development.

AB  - The authors consider STEM and STEAM education initiatives as forms of integrated teaching and learning. With evidence from education research and the neurosciences, a case is made for the inherent connections between emotion and learning as essential to STEAM pedagogy. In this article, the authors' "ArtScience" integration project for teacher candidates (TCs) is described, and elicits the following questions: "do teacher candidates (TCs) exhibit emotions directly related to the ArtScience integration project? If so, what are those emotions? How do those emotions connect with the TCs' perceptions of integration?" Anecdotal evidence and collected data in the form of reflection papers are analyzed and discussed. The authors suggest that STEAM integrations take into account the importance of emotion in multidisciplinary teaching and learning.

AB  - Object of the study: The broad object of this study is the academic field of the book and the book as an area of interdisciplinary teaching. Purpose: to prove that the 21st-century cross-media and hybrid media ecosystem emancipates Book Science from the rest of the sciences in whose objects it can partake only as a constituent using one of its elements, properties or attributes. Tasks: to identify and summarise the theoretical and methodological differences between conventional Book Studies and the specific Book Science; to update and conceptualise the understanding of the book as a traditional means of communication in the light of the modern perspectives of digital transformation; to offer a framework of an innovative media science of the book. Hypothesis: Returning to the matter of the book as a medium, the hypothesis to be tested in this study is: "the book is set to be vindicated as a basic scientific category and be studied by a science of its own as an agent of communication, while the scientific book -- as a communicator of "good" science. Methods: analytic and synthetic processing of primary and secondary resources, the selective monographic method, systematisation and summarisation of data from scientific-methodical and normative-legal documents on the issue examined. Results: Based on a working hypothesis, this study provides theoretical knowledge in Book Science and proposes points of support toward future fundamental and applied research in Book Science. Significance of the study: Overall, our findings suggest that 1) the research on the new theoretical views about the book will facilitate an increase in the academic interest in book-related professions, encourage the design and update of university curricula and programmes in Book Science, to support interdisciplinary research of book and digital media culture; 2) it is expected that the present text will provide the factors militating against the introduction of innovations in higher education and doctoral programmes in Book Science insofar as books as products of the publishing industry, and thus subject to market forces, drive back business interest in higher education toward book-related professions; appropriate measures to overcome the challenges outlined have been suggested.

AB  - This article reports a session from the virtual international 2021 IUBMB/ASBMB workshop, "Teaching Science on Big Data." The awareness of using publicly available research data sets for undergraduate training is low in certain parts of the world. Final year projects always revolve around wet-lab based projects. The challenges occur during COVID-19 pandemic when it forces full lockdown to the nation, but at the same time faculty members need to provide consistent training to the students and projects to work with. We aim to identify supervisors in the faculty that are ready to convert their proposed project from wet-lab to an online-based project. As coordinators of the course we created an online survey to identify projects that can be converted into dry-lab/online projects. Our surveys identified only 32.5% projects implemented dry-lab/online based projects. Most academicians described that they are not ready or familiar to apply changes for their research design. With the unknown future of the world living with COVID-19 and directional changes of life science research toward big data driven research indeed we should be ready to adopt such changes. Awareness on reusing public data sets as tools for research should be provided to strengthen undergraduate training. Life science undergraduates should be exposed to reusing public data sets as these materials are readily available case studies that allow in depth exploration to answer specific research questions. Members of the faculty should take part to pave the way for them, ensuring that they understand that life science research revolves around a multidisciplinary field.
