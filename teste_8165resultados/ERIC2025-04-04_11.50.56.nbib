AB  - Contribution: This study extends the embedded expert literature by examining a cross-college partnership between engineering and education faculty and its impact on the engineering faculty's teaching practices. Background: Previous embedded expert models focused on disciplinary expert models that required extensive educational training to prepare embedded experts to work with instructors to transform courses using active learning strategies. Intended Outcomes: This study employed a novel approach to the embedded expert model by utilizing science, math, and technology education faculty to support undergraduate engineering instructors in transforming teaching practices. Active learning strategies and culturally relevant pedagogy were emphasized in this multisemester transformation process. Anticipated outcomes included decreases in the drop, withdrawal, and failure rates in transformed courses, and an increase in overall GPA for students enrolled in these courses. Application Design: The embedded educational expert approach supported instructors in electrical engineering, biomedical engineering and academic inquiry scholarship, and chemical engineering. Course interventions included adaptive assessment, project-based learning (PBL), peer-assisted learning, and case studies. Findings: Observation, interview, survey, and course level support the multidisciplinary embedded expert model for transforming instructors' teaching practices and improving student pass rates within multiple engineering departments.

AB  - Undergraduate field courses are important learning experiences in many of the natural sciences, but they are not accessible to many students. Virtual field experiences (VFEs) have been evolving as a plausible alternative. A Delphi study, a method to seek systematic and iterative ideation from experts in a discipline, was conducted to synthesize best practices for achieving specific student outcomes through VFEs. Twenty-six participants with expertise in aspects of VFEs were included in the study and were asked about VFE design considerations and student learning outcomes. Panelists ranked five learning outcomes as most important: soft skills, affective outcomes, sense of being a scientist, interdisciplinarity, and problematization of issues addressed by science. The panel identified five design characteristics as most important for achieving those outcomes: alignment to learning goals, social interaction, attention to student contexts, authenticity, and pedagogical approach. Panelists acknowledged the difficulty of achieving some of these goals through VFEs but emphasized the importance of real-time social interaction with peers and outside experts. They encouraged an asset view of VFEs, highlighting the ability to include more diverse environments and people and to provide an experience catered to specific student needs and contexts.

AB  - Sustainability education (SE) is included in school curricula to integrate the principles, values, and practices of sustainable development (SD) into all education. This study investigates lower secondary school subject teachers as educators for sustainability. A survey was used to study the perceptions of 442 subject teachers from 49 schools in Finland. There were significant differences between the subject teachers' perceptions of their SE competence, and the frequency with which they used different dimensions of SE (ecological, economic, social, well-being, cultural) in their teaching varied. Teachers' age had a small effect, but gender, school, and its residential location were nonsignificant factors. Teachers could be roughly classified into three different subgroups according to their perceptions of the role of SE in their teaching; those who considered three SE dimensions rather often and used holistic sustainability approaches in their teaching (biology, geography, history); those who considered two or three dimensions often but were not active in holistic teaching (mother tongue, religion, visual arts, crafts, music, physical and health education, and home economics) and those who used one SE dimension or consider only one holistic approach in their teaching (mathematics, physics, chemistry and language). Subject teachers' awareness of their SE competence is important to encourage them to plan and implement discipline-based and interdisciplinary SE in their teaching. The specific SE expertise of subject teachers should be taken into account in teacher training and education.

AB  - The main goal of this article is to explain the transdisciplinary training model developed at the National University of Education (UNAE) in Ecuador, based on the ancestral worldviews of "Buen Vivir" (Good Living). "Good Living" is a philosophical and political concept of the Kichwa indigenous peoples in the Andean Region, where human beings are interconnected with planet Earth and the whole cosmos. In 2008, Ecuador became the first country in the world to recognize the Rights of Nature in its Constitution, in order to face climate change and to restore the ecological footprint. This article first unifies scientific knowledge with ancestral wisdom, creating an inter-epistemological dialogue using a transdisciplinary approach. Second, the article explores the epistemological notions of transdisciplinary education: self-training, hetero-training, eco-training, and onto-training. Third, the article argues that as a result, Educational Sciences of Good Living emerged to (re)design regenerative cultures that face socio-ecological challenges of the Anthropocene age. In sum, the article argues that training transdisciplinary educators implies an intercultural, decolonial, and biocentric approach that promotes their inner spiritual self-awareness, among other perceptive, affective, emotional, rhetorical, poetic, epistemic, creative, artistic, cognitive, and philosophical dimensions.

AB  - Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) represent an economical and practical way for institutions to equitably offer research experiences to large numbers of students. Although the benefits of CUREs are well documented, most CURE models are not guided by theory and are discipline specific, which limits their application. We used a community of practice framework to develop an interdisciplinary, authentic CURE course (Science Bootcamp) for first-year STEM majors. We describe the details of Science Bootcamp, then present assessment data verifying that the course includes key CURE design features (opportunities for collaboration, discovery/relevance, iteration) and successfully establishes a community of practice. Students who participated in Science Bootcamp reported psychosocial gains (e.g., increased belonging and science self-efficacy) from pre-CURE to post-CURE, a pattern distinct from a comparison group. Psychosocial gains, in turn, were positively associated with students' intention to remain in STEM. We also found that each CURE course design feature was related to at least one psychosocial outcome. Our authentic, interdisciplinary CURE model is flexible, scalable, and economical, making it feasible for institutions to integrate this approach into their own undergraduate-based research initiatives.

AB  - Organizational patterns can serve as a teaching strategy for instructors and as a learning tool for students to develop their expository writing skills, which are commonly required for assignments (for example, laboratory reports and research papers) in Food Science courses and in their future careers. The article discusses the importance of organizational patterns for teaching expository writing through an interdisciplinary collaboration. The teaching collaboration occurred with professors from Food Science, English, and Anthropology in an introductory Food Science course (FSCI 232) taught at California State University Long Beach (CSULB). In FSCI 232, students learned how to use organizational patterns to interpret and explain the content of an infographic obtained from the Food Technology magazine, published by the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT). The infographic "Global Obesity's Expanding Girth, the World is Getting Fatter" served as a visual stimulus to help students identify these patterns, focusing on inquiry and analysis of scientific data and skills required for technical writing. Furthermore, the article illustrates those other potential applications of organizational patterns using the infographic could extend to interdisciplinary content (that is, Food Anthropology), which facilitates the development of cultural competency and sensitivity in food systems. Additionally, the article provides sample activities for teachers to use in their classrooms. To summarize, organizational patterns can serve as an effective teaching strategy to enhance students' writing skills across Food Science and related disciplines.

AB  - This paper presents the course of events of a five-day summer camp on environmental chemistry with high emphasis on chemical analysis. The annual camp was optional and open for students of all disciplines and levels. The duration of the summer camp was five and a half days in the Feldberg Lake District in northeast Germany (federal state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania). The participants took part in the continuation of the examination of the lakes in the region, which leads back more than 50 years. They gained hands-on experience in environmental characterization of various lakes and classification by determining chemical, physical, and biological parameters such as phytoplankton, zooplankton, and macrophytes. Short lectures are presented by professionals covering a theoretical background of limnology, environmental chemistry, a variety of analytical methods, freshwater biology, and the specifics of the region. The camp in its present form was established in 1995, and about 20 students took part in the camp per year. Camp development, considerations regarding employed analytical methods, balance of theory, and other implications are discussed.

AB  - This paper discusses the relationship between multidisciplinarity and research performance in the academic context. The paper explains how scholars' scientific performance is affected by the multidisciplinarity of the network of colleagues with whom they conduct their research. Furthermore, this paper explores the potential moderating role of academics' social capital, assuming that relational dynamics can mitigate the potential problems associated with disciplinary diversity. To build the proposed model, the paper draws on previous literature on diversity and social capital. The resulting hypotheses are tested through a quantitative study developed on the basis of a sample of scholars in the field of management. Information about multidisciplinarity and research performance was extracted from the Scopus database, while social capital variables were measured through social network analysis techniques. Econometric estimations were used to test the proposed relationships. The findings suggest that the effect of multidisciplinarity and researchers' performance can be depicted as an inverted U-shaped relationship, so an optimal intermediate level of diversity can be found. Estimations also show that relational, cognitive and structural social capital moderates this curvilinear relationship, making it possible to achieve higher research performance at higher levels of multidisciplinarity.

AB  - Robert Sternberg's (2017) Active Concerned Citizenship and Ethical Leadership (ACCEL) framework provides a helpful way to align gifted education with the complexities of 21st-century socioeconomic and cultural environments. The recommendation that we shift away from pseudoquantitative precision in conceptions of giftedness aligns with similar recommendations in other fields including political science, economics, and mathematics. The emphases on ethics and wisdom are reinforced by analyses of the need for more ethical awareness in societies. These analyses arise from research and theory in other fields, including ethical philosophy, political science, economics, history, sociology, and journalism. These transdisciplinary similarities are interpreted to be conceptual triangulation supporting the importance of Sternberg's model as a catalyst for the development of more holistic conceptions of giftedness and talent.

AB  - The early years of physiology education in medical curricula provide unique challenges. As well as inculcating concepts that are seen as difficult, modern curricula require that students learn in context in case-based learning courses. Additionally, regulating bodies stress that the soft skills of compassion, communication, and empathy are embedded throughout curricula. This has driven work in our organization involving drama and final-year medicine students during which they collaborate in realistic simulations of doctor/patient interactions. We adapted this transdisciplinary approach to second-year physiology tutorials. This emphasized the holistic importance of physiology to patient care, while also embedding "human factors" skills from the very earliest stages of the curriculum. After preparing by attending acting classes based on aspects of Konstantin Stanislavski's "System," the authors supervised tutorials in which drama students participated in a "physiology of hypofertility" session for second-year medical students, playing a 34-year-old woman with premature menopause (or their partner). Opinion (from all students) was evaluated by Likert questionnaires (which included open questions). A focus group of drama students was also interviewed, and the conversation was recorded for thematic analysis. Positive Likert scores were recorded for the authenticity of the tutorials, skills development, fostering empathy, and motivating students to improve. All participants evaluated the tutorial as highly enjoyable. These scores are reflected in positive open commentary on the questionnaires and in the focus group interviews. The results suggest that even basic science tutorials give opportunities for interdisciplinary study and enhancement of behavioral skills while gaining enthusiastic student acceptance.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity requires the collaboration of two or more disciplines to combine their expertise to jointly develop and deliver learning and teaching outcomes appropriate for a subject area. Curricula and assessment mapping are critical components to foster and enhance interdisciplinary learning environments. Emerging careers in data science and machine learning coupled with the necessary graduate outcomes mandate the need for a truly interdisciplinary pedagogical approach. The challenges for emerging academic disciplines such as data science and machine learning center on the need for multiple fields to coherently develop university-level curricula. Using text mining, we empirically analyze the breadth and depth of existing tertiary-level curricula to quantify patterns in curricula through the use of surface and deep cluster analysis. This approach helps educators validate the breadth and depth of a proposed curriculum relative to the broad evolution of data science as a discipline.

AB  - In this article we discuss interdisciplinary teaching and research in Latin America through the lens of Mexican perspectives, in particular the experiences at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The history of these experiences goes back to the creation of the frst interdisciplinary education programs in Mexico in the 1970s and the foundation of the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in the Sciences and Humanities in 1986 at the UNAM. With this Center's contributions as the framework, we examine objectives and instruments of academic policy in our country in order to understand how methods of evaluation work. We study not only the ways of academic interdisciplinarity but also the main theoretical and epistemological focuses in university environments. From this analysis of Mexican experience, we obtain important information that can be useful in the process of integrating knowledge amongst other countries of Latin America.

AB  - Engineering students require nontechnical skill sets to combat the 21st century's complex engineering challenges in addition to possessing technical skills. To provide multidisciplinary experience to undergraduate engineering students and to study the formation of engineers, a research team at West Virginia University offered a multidisciplinary course in two academic semesters. In this course, engineering students collaborated with students from social science disciplines to solve a complex, open-ended transportation engineering problem. Focus group sessions were conducted among the participating engineering students at the end of both semesters to document their experiences and perceptions of the cross-disciplinary course. This study applied unsupervised machine learning-based text mining approaches to extract students' relevant experiences and perceptions from the focus group text data. From the analysis, four clusters were identified, where engineering students highlighted their awareness/understanding of the cross-disciplinary majors, appreciation of the cross-disciplinary majors, and communication and collaboration issues in the group presentation and report writing tasks. Engineering students initially perceived challenges in working with cross-disciplinary majors that eased as the semester progressed. Students acknowledged their lack of nontechnical skills as engineers. They appreciated the ideas the social science students provided, which helped them improve their problem-solving skills and become more productive. Students also highlighted several improvements for the future offerings of the course (e.g., more focused and concise communication among professors and peers) and suggested possible approaches to resolve the concerns. The findings of this research provide an in-depth understanding of the potential of multidisciplinary courses in the engineering curriculum and ways to enhance the experiences of participating engineering students in such offerings in the future.

AB  - Understanding ecological concepts is crucial in tackling environmental issues like climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction. These concepts also serve as a teaching framework, encouraging learners to effect positive change. This research was conducted with grade 9 learners from three schools in Bloemfontein, South Africa, randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. It used a positivist paradigm and Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour as a theoretical framework, incorporating a quantitative experimental research design. The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS), a standardised attitude survey, was administered to experimental and control groups as a pre-and post-test. Data analysis involved descriptive and analytical statistics. Results show a positive influence on learners' applied conceptual understanding of ecological concepts, favouring the experimental group postintervention [F(1,350) = 36.45, p <0.0001] at a 5% significance level. Puppetry, therefore, can create dynamic, interactive learning environments as a teaching tool, enhancing learner engagement, understanding, and appreciation of ecological concepts. It aids in information retention by associating them with unique experiences. This teaching tool can boost learners' positive perspectives on ecology, enabling learners to make informed decisions and contribute to a sustainable environment. This paper aims to contribute to the scholarship of innovative teaching methods and an interdisciplinary approach to science teaching and learning.

AB  - A national survey of chemists (n = 174) explored the self-reported format and focus of postsecondary inorganic chemistry instructional laboratory curricula. Multiple instructional laboratory course formats were observed, including stand-alone inorganic chemistry instructional laboratory courses, inorganic chemistry laboratory instruction as a component of a multidisciplinary instructional laboratory course, and the absence of an inorganic chemistry instructional laboratory experience. Additionally, the types of synthetic, characterization, and purification methods, as well as the professional skills addressed in the surveyed courses, varied greatly. The results of this work have direct implications as a "current state of the curriculum" description for inorganic chemistry educators designing and revising instructional laboratory courses. Additionally, these results speak to (1) the need for professional organizations to reinforce the importance of postsecondary inorganic chemistry in the chemistry major curriculum, (2) the demand for quality curricular materials that are easily adaptable to multiple instructional laboratory contexts, and (3) the call for further research on how the inorganic chemistry (and broader chemistry) instructional curriculum is enacted.

AB  - Data science is a highly interdisciplinary field that comprises various principles, methodologies, and guidelines for the analysis of data. The creation of appropriate curricula that use computational tools and teaching activities is necessary for building skills and knowledge in data science. However, much of the literature about data science curricula focuses on the undergraduate university level. In this study, we developed an introductory data science curriculum for an out of school enrichment program aimed at middle grade learners (ages 11-13). We observed how the participants in the program (n = 11) learned data science practices through the combination of nonprogramming activities and programming activities using the language R. The results revealed that participants in the program were able to investigate statistical questions of their creation, perform data analysis using statistics and the creation of data visuals, make meaning from their results, and communicate their findings. These results suggest that a series of learner-centered nonprogramming and programming activities using R can facilitate the learning of data science skills for middle-school age students.

AB  - The aim is to describe the development of a novel interdisciplinary graduate school, using the Swedish National Graduate School for Competitive Science on Ageing and Health (SWEAH) as a case example. We explore doctoral students' perceptions of being part of SWEAH and provide implications for practice. Written self-reports reflecting 78 students' experiences and perceptions were analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings reveal that affiliation with SWEAH is highly valued. The students emphasized the tailored courses and learning activities and reported that it was instrumental in deepening their knowledge and broadening their research perspectives. The findings demonstrate how students navigate between disciplinary and interdisciplinary contexts and become enculturated with intellectual mindset and understanding of the importance of network building. The graduate school adds an interdisciplinary layer of learning, influenced by peers and researchers, and demonstrates the importance of community building within interdisciplinary environments and how it can be achieved.

AB  - Interdisciplinary collaborations to help students compose for discipline-specific contexts draw on multiple expertise. Science, technology, education, and mathematics (STEM) programs particularly rely on their writing colleagues because (1) their academic expertise is often not writing and (2) teaching writing often necessitates a redesigning of existing instructional materials. While many writing studies scholars have the expertise to assist their STEM colleagues with such tasks, how to do so--and, more fundamentally, how to begin such efforts--is not commonly focused on in the literature stemming from these collaborations. Our article addresses this gap by detailing an interdisciplinary Writing in the Disciplines (WID) collaboration at a large, public R1 university between STEM and writing experts to redesign the university's introductory biology writing curriculum. The collaborative curriculum design process detailed here is presented through the lens of wayfinding, which concerns orientation, trailblazing, and moving through uncertain landscapes according to cues. Within this account, a critical focus on language--what we talk about when we talk about writing--emerges, driving both the collaboration itself and resultant curricular revisions. Our work reveals how collaborators can wayfind through interdisciplinary partnerships and writing curriculum development by transforming differences in discipline-specific expertise into a new path forward.

AB  - Bibliometric analysis, an approach introduced by the library and information sciences, attempts to unravel the relationships between a large number of scientific literature by using quantitative methods. "Economics of Education Review" was founded in 1981 to meet the needs of a growing number of research in the economics of education. The journal has evolved to become a top field journal that focuses on high quality research in an interdisciplinary field that combines educational studies and economics. It specializes in human capital production and the returns to human capital as well as in education policy and finance. We examine collaboration patterns using an approach introduced by the library and information sciences. The current research shows hidden patterns among scientific actors to offer a comprehensive understanding of the knowledge structure of this top field journal by employing network analysis such as bibliographic coupling, co-authorship and co-citation analysis. It also presents a thematic overview by analyzing author keyword co-occurrence and by classifying articles into six thematic clusters to highlight past themes and current trends in the field of economics of education. Our results suggest a shift in the focus of research, with more topics on measuring the impact of preschool programs, quality education, higher education attainment, gender, race and peer effects playing an important role in this area of scientific research.

AB  - Career development of Science students seems dependent on more than disciplinary education, such as the nature and focus of career preparation. In this study we compare graduate outcomes of science students at the University of Groningen, completing two master-level program streams with different focal points, by using career progress surveys from alumni (n=242) with self-reported societal development data. The first program is a classical research-oriented master (ROM), that aims to prepare students for a career within academia. The second program, called Science, Business and Policy (SBP) focusses on a societal profile and aims to prepare for a career outside academia. SBP is different from ROM because it has a practical and multidisciplinary orientation (vs a theoretical and mono-disciplinary orientation in ROM) and it includes a long work-placement outside academia, a form of work based learning. The differences in the tracks translate to differences in career paths. Both profiles resulted in good but distinct career opportunities, corresponding to alumni's discipline and sector. Although ROM-alumni felt especially prepared for an academic career, only a quarter actually continued in academia and many we employed in education. In contrast, most SBP-alumni were employed in business or policy. Targeting specific job preparation seems more successful with a societal profile. Reflecting on skills, in both groups research-related skills decreased during careers while soft skills increased. Alumni were generally satisfied with their first job and also with their current job, with SBP-alumni scoring significantly higher on satisfaction with income, status, appreciation and perspective. It can be concluded that diversification in educational profiles changes the societal career paths of science students. [Note: The page range (119-121) and (104-135) shown on the PDF is incorrect.

AB  - Much of physics involves the construction and interpretation of equations. Research on physics students' understanding and application of mathematics has employed Sherin's symbolic forms or Fauconnier and Turner's conceptual blending as analytical frameworks. However, previous symbolic forms analyses have commonly treated students' in-context understanding as their conceptual schema, which was designed to represent the acontextual, mathematical justification of the symbol template (structure of the expression). Furthermore, most conceptual blending analyses in this area have not included a generic space to specify the underlying structure of a math-physics blend. We describe a conceptual blending model for equation construction and interpretation, which we call symbolic blending, that incorporates the components of symbolic forms with the conceptual schema as the generic space that structures the blend of a symbol template space with a contextual input space. This combination complements symbolic forms analysis with contextual meaning and provides an underlying structure for the analysis of student understanding of equations as a conceptual blend. We present this model in the context of student construction of non-Cartesian differential length vectors. We illustrate the affordances of such a model within this context and expand this approach to other contexts within our research. The model further allows us to reinterpret and extend literature that has used either symbolic forms or conceptual blending.

AB  - The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) education communities are increasingly facing challenges caused by social, technological, economic, environmental, and political changes. Addressing these issues requires AEC educators and practitioners to systematically rethink and reform many of their current practices. Anecdotal evidence in AEC education already exists with respect to pedagogical improvements made by individual technologies such as immersive computing, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data, cyberinfrastructure, and photogrammetry. However, an effective learning-centered environment is more complex than what any single technology can accomplish. In addition, the relationship between technology-intensive learning and digital inequity in AEC education remains, to the most extent, unclear. We envision the next-generation learning-centered environment for AEC education to be technology-intensive, interdisciplinary, industry-linked, and equitable. This paper aims to present a shared vision of the next-generation learning-centered environment for AEC education. To achieve this goal, two interrelated workshops were organized with the participation of different stakeholders, including researchers, educators, and professionals from multiple disciplines of architecture, engineering, construction, computer science, learning science, education, and social sciences. This paper is based on the combined outcomes of the two workshops, organized in four themes: (1) AEC curricula and industry practice, (2) technology and learning, (3) interdisciplinary education, and (4) digital inequity. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by creating a pathway to timely reflect on new learning strategies, new technologies, and future industry and societal needs in AEC curricula, thus producing a more adaptive AEC workforce for the 21st century. The findings of this work can be adopted by educators to develop a roadmap for creating the shared vision of the next-generation learning-centered environment for AEC education.

AB  - This article presents the Data Science Ethos Lifecycle, a tool for engaging responsible workflow developed by an interdisciplinary team of social scientists and data scientists working with the Academic Data Science Alliance. The tool uses a data science lifecycle framework to engage data science students and practitioners with the ethical dimensions of their practice. The lifecycle supports practitioners to increase awareness of how their practice shapes and is shaped by the social world and to articulate their responsibility to public stakeholders. We discuss the theoretical foundations from the fields of Science, Technology and Society, feminist theory, and critical race theory that animate the Ethos Lifecycle and show how these orient the tool toward a normative commitment to justice and what we call the "world-making" view of data science. We introduce four conceptual lenses--positionality, power, sociotechnical systems, and narratives--that are at work in the Ethos Lifecycle and show how they can bring to light ethical and human issues in a real-world data science project.

AB  - When teaching physics, it is often difficult to get biology-oriented students to see the relevance of physics. A complaint often heard is that biology students are required to take physics for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) as part of a "weeding out" process, but that they don't feel like they need physics for biology. Despite this impression held by students, there have been calls for better physics education for future physicians and life scientists. Research is being performed to improve physics classes and labs by linking topics in biology and physics. Described here is a laboratory experiment covering the topics of resistance of materials and circuits/Kirchhoff's laws in a biology context with their direct application to neurons, axons, and electrical impulse transmission within animals. This experiment will also demonstrate the mechanism believed to cause multiple sclerosis. The apparatus was designed with low-cost and readily available materials in mind.

AB  - The world is facing severe global challenges such as climate change, food security, rising migration, social justice, or the current corona crisis. In these times, citizenship education seems more important than ever. How can this citizenship education relate to mathematics and science learning? The research project MaSDiV (Supporting mathematics and science teachers in addressing diversity and promoting fundamental values) connected mathematics and science with citizenship education by modeling real-life problems relevant to society. In this paper, we present the foundational design features of the PD course as well the results from the accompanying evaluation of this PD course, which was implemented by partners in six countries to support teachers in connecting mathematics and science education with citizenship education. More specifically, we investigate how participating teachers experienced the PD program; how their self-efficacy beliefs, learning-related beliefs, as well as teaching practices change; and which factors contributed to that change. In order to investigate the outcome of the PD program, we surveyed N = 311 mathematics and science teachers' pre- and post-participation of the PD in six different European countries. Among others, our results show that in general, most participating teachers reported a high overall satisfaction with the course across all six participating countries. They also indicate that teachers' self-efficacy beliefs about using relevant contexts, their learning-related beliefs about the benefits of using contexts, as well as their own teaching practice changed significantly after participating in the MaSDiV PD course.

AB  - This study explores the views of Indonesian junior high school pre-service science teachers (PSTs) towards teaching based on socio-scientific issues (SSIs). Questionnaires were analyzed qualitatively and descriptively. The PSTs (N=62) acknowledged that student competencies ranging from personal to socially relevant skills as well as character formation can potentially be developed through SSI-based instruction. The PSTs mentioned several challenges which may hinder implementation of SSI-based instruction. These include the interdisciplinary and controversial nature of SSIs, a lack of familiarity regarding SSIs, the lack of necessary student skills, insufficient teacher expertise, and curriculum constraints. The PSTs viewed SSIs as able to potentially enhance their personal competencies through SSI-based instruction, mostly with regard to pedagogical skills. The relevance of SSI-based instruction was, however, not seen in as positive a light as the participants' views on the need of character building. The PSTs' intentions to later implementing SSI-based instruction ranged from medium to high.

AB  - Nowadays, discussing global environmental issues has become regularly included in STEM-based higher education, emphasizing the importance of the youth in finding "ad hoc" solutions for the climate crisis. One of the most commonly applied strategies is promoting sustainable choices among students, especially linked to their lifestyle choices, or implementing small changes to aim for large-scale cumulative effects. Herein, a learning and research activity designed for undergraduate students is presented, aimed at raising their awareness of a less discussed type of global warming contributors, namely greenhouse gases (GHGs), being a fundamental example of gaseous waste produced at universities as part of STEM education programs. In this extracurricular project, a multidisciplinary group of students performed a series of real-time measurements of exemplary GHGs emissions during the chemistry-oriented practical courses taken by their peers. As a result, qualitative and quantitative information about the gaseous waste produced in the student laboratories was obtained and linked to various laboratory activities, raising student consciousness about the frequently neglected gases produced in the laboratory that also contribute to the environmental crisis. This research activity enables students to apply analytical chemistry to evaluate their own chemical footprint in the laboratory. Furthermore, this project aims to illustrate the importance of engaging students in extracurricular learning and research activities.

AB  - Scientific research endeavors are increasingly collaborative in nature. As researchers work together in groups of increasing size to develop project goals and implement plans, traditional 1-1 single faculty-student mentor models are less relevant as students need input and guidance from the multiple faculty members contributing to the collaborative project. Instead, faculty-student mentorship models would benefit from being re-envisioned to facilitate faculty mentors advising multiple student team members and students seeking feedback from multiple faculty team members, while also facilitating complimentary student peer mentorship opportunities. In this article, we present a case study of how student mentorship support was initially designed and managed in a large, complex, and multidisciplinary collaborative science curriculum development effort: the Earth Science Experiential and Indigenous Learning (EaSEIL) project.

AB  - This book contains the full text of papers and posters presented at the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2024), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (WIARS). Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2024 received 729 submissions, from more than 50 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. The conference accepted for presentation 284 submissions (39% acceptance rate). This is the Volume 2 of the book titled Education and New Developments 2024, that showcases the outcomes of dedicated research and developments undertaken by authors who are driven by their passion to enhance research methods that directly relate to teaching, learning, and the practical applications of education in the present day. Within its pages, you will find a diverse array of contributors and presenters who expand our perspectives by delving into various educational matters. This second volume focuses on the main areas of PROJECTS AND TRENDS and ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES.

AB  - Previous research has analyzed the meaning and value of STEM education and explored both its current possibilities and future development. However, STEM education experts have not reached a consensus on the goals of STEM education, making its promotion more challenging. Thus, this study examined which particular STEM education goals should be emphasized through a survey questionnaire. The study employed a stratified random sampling method to collect survey data from secondary teachers of STEM-related courses (i.e., science, technology, and mathematics) in Taiwan. A total of 645 valid survey responses were collected and then analyzed by independent t-test and analysis of variance to examine teachers' perceptions about 17 critical competencies proposed as education goals relevant to STEM education. The findings revealed that STEM teachers generally had positive attitudes and high levels of acceptance toward implementing the 17 proposed STEM education goals through integrative STEM education. However, the proposed goal of "cultivating students' entrepreneurial capabilities" received lower scores and should not be used at the secondary level. It may be introduced as an important education goal in tertiary STEM education. In addition, STEM teachers with different backgrounds (e.g., STEM teaching experience, perceptions of STEM teaching methods) perceived the competency goals as having different levels of importance in STEM education. Teachers' willingness to teach STEM using a transdisciplinary integration method increases when they have access to sufficient resources and support.

AB  - Nowadays robotics is one of promising avenues in the sphere of emerging technologies. In the teaching/learning environment we deal with educational robotics, which is a mixture of theory and practice, knowledge of computer technology, Mathematics and Physics. The two vectors are combined in educational robotics: the educational vector and the technological vector. As an academic discipline and an area of practical application, Robotics means a very broad spectrum of modern knowledge of diverse academic engineering specialties (fields of expertise). That means that Robotics is interdisciplinary in nature. The work provides an overview of the research aimed at studying Robot -- Man interaction. Besides, the work considers some promising international cooperation between children from around the world on the development of robotics, and the experience and benefits gained from such cooperation. As an example of the international cooperation in the sphere of Robotics, the two countries, Russia and Kazakhstan, are considered. The article gives an example of the international cooperation of some educational centers, describes the experience of the work on robotics with children of various ages, and the cooperation of various schools working in this field in Kazakhstan and Russia. The working experience in the sphere of social robotics aimed at helping people has become a priority for the children from the interdisciplinary teams from Russia and Kazakhstan. Interaction and cooperation in the sphere of robotics was also used for introducing unconventional curricula, which included courses on robotic technologies as tools for considering social aspects of robotics and artificial intelligence.

AB  - This article describes a general education course offering, Physics and the Arts. During the development of this course, physics and arts faculty collaborated closely. We cover the usual physics phenomena for such a course--light, color, and sound--in addition to gravity, equilibrium, and spacetime. Goals of the course are to increase students' engagement with physics and to develop students' ability to conduct scientific investigations. After the first offering of the course, instructors added two objectives: to involve artistic works regularly and to reduce math anxiety among this group of nonscience students. The laboratory activities follow a guided inquiry style and are listed in the article. The culminating lab activity requires that students create an artistic work of their own design, and the goal of the piece is to present a physics phenomenon or idea. Assignments and assessments related to the culminating lab activity are described in detail. The course increases scientific engagement of our students.

AB  - In the period following a global pandemic, the promotion of health and wellbeing is a priority area for schools. This accompanies growing calls for health and wellbeing education to be delivered through a whole-child/whole-school approach that connects across subject areas. While it may be clear to most people that a purely scientific sexuality education is undesirable, it is also clear that biology plays a vital role in developing students' understanding about a variety of health and wellbeing topics, including those around sex, sexuality and sexual health. In this article, we explore the contribution of the biology teacher to an integrated health and wellbeing education in schools through a case study comparison of the English Relationships, Sex and Health Education curriculum and the English biology curriculum. Biology teachers in England and many other national and regional jurisdictions operate in a compartmentalised system which can create frustration and anxiety for both students and teachers when navigating the complexities of how sensitive topics are delivered in different disciplinary siloes. Epistemically insightful approaches, conceptualised at the macro-, meso- and micro-level of school organisational structures, may provide a way for biology teachers and educational leaders to address and overcome some of these challenges.

AB  - Entrenched compartmentalisation of subjects in secondary school means that students lack opportunities for learning how disciplines relate to each other and how knowledge can be applied in real-world contexts. This article examines what it means to 'think like a scientist in a multidisciplinary arena' and why this is (and should be) an integral part of secondary school science education. To this end, the article outlines a workshop, 'Renoir's painting', for key stages 3 and 4 (ages 11-16), which aims to develop students' understanding of the power and limitations of science and how science relates to other disciplines.

AB  - Science communication is a diverse and transdisciplinary field and is taught most effectively when the skills involved are tailored to specific educational contexts. Few academic resources exist to guide the teaching of communication with non-scientific audiences for an undergraduate science context. This mixed methods study aimed to explore what skills for the effective communication of science with non-scientific audiences should be taught within the Australian Bachelor of Science. This was done to provide a basis from which to establish a teaching resource for undergraduate curriculum development. First, an extensive critique of academic literature was completed to distil the communication "skills" or "elements" commonly cited as being central to the effective communication of science from across the fields of science, communication, education, and science communication. A list of "key elements" or "core skills" was hence produced and systematically critiqued, edited, and validated by experts in the above four fields using a version of the Delphi method. Each of the skills identified was considered by experts to be mostly, highly, or absolutely essential, and the resource as a whole was validated as "Extremely applicable", within the context of teaching undergraduate science students to communicate with non-scientific audiences. The result of this study is an evidence-based teaching resource: "12 Core skills for effective science communication", which is reflective of current theory and practice. This resource may be used in teaching or as a guide to the development of communication skills for undergraduate science students in Australia and elsewhere.

AB  - Systematic studies on the effectiveness of in-service teacher professional development (PD) are important for science education research and practice. Previous studies have mostly focused on certain outcomes of PD, for example, the effectiveness of PD for improving teachers' knowledge or students' learning outcomes. This study, however, explores multiple outcomes of PD, from teachers' change in knowledge and practice and how teacher change influences students' beliefs and ultimately their understanding of interdisciplinary science concepts. The sample included 509 students from 23 classrooms within 5 elementary/middle schools. The results showed that teacher attendance in professional learning communities and interdisciplinary science research related positively to teachers' scores on a pedagogical content knowledge test. Students whose teachers had more than 150 PD hours in the past academic year performed significantly better on an interdisciplinary science test. Follow-up analyses suggested that student understanding of the nature of science possibly mediates the positive effect between PD hours and student understanding of interdisciplinary science concepts.

AB  - In this article we present a framework for interdisciplinary service learning as border pedagogy grounded on Dewey's educational philosophy and critical social theory. The project Stoa Malakopi allowed design and social science students from two universities in the US and Greece to collaborate in a necessity-driven field of inquiry through engagement with local knowledge. Evaluation showed that students embraced polyphony, reflexivity and situational problem solving as conditions for meaningful university-community partnerships.

AB  - Helping students to become more resilient to online misinformation is widely recognised as an essential task for education in a rapidly digitalising world. Students need both scientific knowledge and epistemic insight to navigate online spaces containing sensationalised reports of scientific and technological developments. Epistemic insight involves epistemic curiosity and the ability to think critically about the nature, application and communication of knowledge. This includes developing an understanding of the power and limitations of science and a curiosity regarding its relationship with other disciplines. We present a workshop designed for school students aged 16-18 titled 'Can science and technology cure loneliness?', designed to develop students' epistemic insight through investigating loneliness through a multidisciplinary perspective. We discuss how the design and pedagogy of this workshop might help students to build epistemic humility--the recognition that no single disciplinary perspective can complete our knowledge about a given topic. As part of a broader programme, epistemic insight-based pedagogies have the potential to develop students' resistance to science- and technology-related misinformation and prepare them for their potential role in shaping our scientific and technological future.

AB  - Molecular storytelling combines three-dimensional (3-D) structure visualization, chemical and biological knowledge, and multidisciplinary functional information from various bioinformatics data resources to generate new knowledge. It prepares students for independent and interdisciplinary learning, facile navigation of public databases to gather relevant information, and experience in exploration of other topics of interest in science. Regardless of students' career choices, molecular storytelling experiences and an appreciation for a structural view of biology can help students become informed citizens. In the article the authors describe a storytelling approach to engage students in learning about the connection between 3-D shapes of biomolecules and their biochemical and cellular functions. The novelty in this approach lies in integrating the exploration of molecular form, with discussion about its functions, gathered from scientific literature and key biological databases. By using this approach, students can learn to: (1) ask questions related to the topic; (2) explore and read the related scientific literature; (3) gather information from a number of authentic bioinformatics resources; (4) identify relevant experimentally determined structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB; see "On the web"); (5) visualize, analyze, and compare molecular structures in order to understand their functions, or design new molecules with novel properties; (6) integrate various types of data and information to generate new knowledge; and (7) justify their conclusions using evidence from these resources.

AB  - This literature review offers compelling evidence for the significant role music and song can play in cultivating student engagement in elementary school science lessons. With students disengaging from science education, there is concern about the lack of necessary scientific literacy skills required in today's world. To explore whether music and song could be used engage students in science we conducted a thorough search of composite education databases for relevant scholarly articles published 1993-2021. Synthesis of the resulting 26 articles revealed four themes: the common goal of engagement, evidence of learning improvement, broad utility of music and songs as pedagogical tools, and limited long-term studies. While acknowledging the limited evidence presented in these articles, we emphasize that incorporating music and song into science lessons not only enriches the educational environment but also contributes to an arts-infused education known to enhance student performance across a wide range of curriculum domains. We recommend further research with a particular focus on investigating the impact of music and song on science engagement and learning over the long-term in elementary school science classrooms.

AB  - Providing interdisciplinary learning opportunities in agriculture, food, natural resources (AFNR), and science is critically important. School-based agricultural education offers a valuable platform to connect AFNR and science; however, interdisciplinary teaching requires willing and able teachers. The current study considered the intentions of school-based agriculture teachers to teach science within AFNR curriculum. Using the theory of planned behavior, attitude toward teaching science, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and perceived science knowledge were considered as independent variables to teaching science within AFNR curriculum. The explanatory model was analyzed using structural equation modeling. In total, school-based agriculture teachers intended to teach science in 39.91% of AFNR curriculum. Only perceived science knowledge was a statistically significant, negative predictor of intended science teaching. Findings pinpoint the need for additional research into the unexpected relationship between perceived science knowledge and science teaching intentions. The need and nature of potential explorations, along with specific recommendations for practice, are discussed.

AB  - In this paper, we draw on recent research on so-called Fermi problems and situate the fundamental principles underlying this type of tasks and their use from a task design perspective. We use the models and modelling perspective on teaching and learning to elaborate on aspects related to the design of single-use, as well as sequences of, Fermi problems. In addition, we discuss a framework (called the Fermi problem activity template [FPAT] framework) for supporting the design and use of Fermi problems to facilitate students' learning within particular mathematics content areas and/or aimed at particular concepts or higher-order thinking skills. We also illustrate how the FPAT framework can be used to (i) facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations with other subjects such as the social sciences, but in particular with the other STEM subjects; and (ii) support teachers in adapting and implementing Fermi problems in their classrooms.

AB  - Scholars in the field of education for sustainable development argue that it is vital that educators take emotions into account when teaching about global problems such as climate change. How to do this in the best way is still debated, however. This article aims to contribute to this discussion by arguing for the importance of critical emotional awareness (CEA). CEA is vital for future teachers to gain, but also for their future students to learn to be able to fight sustainability problems in everyday life and in occupational roles. Through theoretical argumentation and insights from empirical studies, the article elaborates on the following questions: Why is CEA important? What components does this concept consist of? Some key characteristics are that CEA combines insights from emotion research and critical social science. It should be anchored in multidisciplinary emotion theories and research and should acknowledge both emotions and ways to cope. It is also vital to recognize that emotions and emotion regulation take place at individual and interactional levels and are, furthermore, influenced by larger societal emotion norms. CEA implies that these aspects are critically discussed in learning situations and that teacher education should give teachers the skills to lead such discussions.

AB  - While it has been recognized that science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education requires an interdisciplinary approach, integrating multiple subjects in a meaningful way remains challenging for teachers. This study aimed to design a STEM curriculum, emphasizing explicit and continuous scaffolding of students' reflection on scientific and engineering knowledge. The primary goal was to foster knowledge integration in their engineering designs and enhance their attitudes toward STEM. The study involved fifty tenth-grade students who were guided to discuss and reflect on relevant scientific and engineering knowledge and to apply mathematics for data collection and analysis during the design of their technology products. The research instruments included an assessment of the progression of knowledge integration in students' engineering designs through student journals and pre- and post-test surveys on attitudes toward science, technology, engineering, and the learning environment. The results reveal that the introduction and explicit scaffolding students' reflection on scientific and engineering knowledge led to a gradual improvement in knowledge integration within their engineering designs. Students also significantly enhanced their attitudes toward STEM and the learning environment compared to the general school curriculum. This study contributes to interdisciplinary learning that promotes the integration of scientific and engineering knowledge in students' engineering design processes, and to interdisciplinary assessment that evaluates students' knowledge integration across learning progressions and outcomes.

AB  - This article focuses on the important instructional technique of integrated or interdisciplinary instruction with reference to the teaching of science but with implications for all school subjects. Readers are provided with a definition of the concept of the discipline and the importance of communicating the basic nature of a discipline to students in school settings. This leads to the concept of the levels of intradisciplinarity and later to the true "border crossing" that occurs when students must draw upon knowledge and practices from multiple disciplinary traditions when engaged in problem solving. The article concludes with a discussion of a recent trend in science instruction and consider the challenges of some forms of STEM curriculum designs.

AB  - Ecological learning is enriched when students can apply course content to their own communities and gain an understanding and experience for deploying sustainable practices. Such merging of content, application, and place requires an interdisciplinary approach to grapple with the ecological and cultural issues more holistically that sustainability education explores. Guided by the ecological pedagogy of David Orr, founder of the Oberlin Project, we devised a pilot study that combines course content in environmental science, cultural studies, and writing with place-based, experiential, and hands-on learning to empower students to critically analyze their lifestyles and engage in activism for change.

AB  - E-science, or networked, collaborative and multidisciplinary scientific research on a shared e-infrastructure using computational tools, methods and applications, has also brought about new networked organizational forms in the transition of higher education towards the entrepreneurial academy. While the under-representation of women in ICTs is well-recorded, it is also known that the potential of new organizational forms such as networked structures to promote gender equality remains ambiguous, as they tend to perpetuate already existing inequalities due to their embeddedness in larger and longer-term structural or institutional gender effects. Based on a year-long ethnographic study in a networked academic e-science collaboration in Sweden and 45 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with its affiliated researchers, this article analyzes the multi-level obstacles to achieving gender equality in e-science to highlight the ways in which gendered disparities persist in this new, project-based academic networked organization in Sweden, hereafter called eSec. At the "organizational level" eSec remains deeply embedded in the traditional disciplinary and institutional academic setting, inadvertently reproducing existing gender imbalances across sciences. Furthermore, as a project-based organization, it is also embedded in the shift towards an entrepreneurial university model driven by new managerialism, the latter having a well-documented adverse effect in gender equality. This represents "a "structural-level" obstacle which leads to especially female junior faculty leaving academy for industry. An "individual level" obstacle is observed alongside these as disavowal ("Verleugnung") of gender disparities, an affect identified as a key mechanism of subjectivation in neoliberalism.

AB  - Art integration is a rich and complex approach to teaching and learning that not only aligns with new initiatives in education that prioritize conceptual and procedural skills but could also contribute to education's transformation. Framing art integration as a transdisciplinary field with a distinct conceptual framework, epistemology, and practices provides a full account of art integration that practitioners and advocates alike may find useful for conceptualizing the field, promoting it in education, and developing it further. Moreover, viewing art integration through the lenses of Systems Theory and the New Sciences reveals its potential as a pedagogy of fusion and flow that could transform teaching and learning across the curriculum. One form of art integration, Art Research Integration (ARI), is presented here to illustrate the qualities of a transdisciplinary, Systems Thinking/New Sciences vision of art integration.

AB  - Project-based learning (PBL) is a promising teaching method for integrated science education that has gained momentum in educational research and curriculum reforms, especially as a method to enhance 21st century skills and connected worldview. How teachers implement PBL greatly affects students' content understanding and development of skills. The purpose of this qualitative study is to highlight active teachers' PBL practices and their perceptions of the advantages and challenges of implementing PBL to better promote the implementation of PBL in teacher education programs and in integrated science education. This study consisted of two parts: (1) a qualitative-led survey and (2) a case study. First, the data for the survey was collected from January to March 2017 through an online reporting form of an international StarT programme. This programme supports the implementation of interdisciplinary and collaborative PBL in science, mathematics and technology education. 244 teachers from early childhood education to upper secondary school participated from 28 countries. Second, 12 PBL units reported by the teachers were chosen for a case study. The teachers exploited PBL practices that were theme- and inquiry-based, collaborative and engaging to students. However, closer inspection revealed variation and defects in the practices particularly in relation to assessment, using reflection and student-centred approach. In addition, teachers reported several challenges relating to the implementation of PBL. The results indicate that teachers see PBL as beneficial but need support with the implementation. Science teachers' pedagogical competence in PBL could be promoted through collaborative learning in which students, teachers and other participants are learning from each other.

AB  - Science, technology, society, and environment (STSE) education has recently received attention in educational research, policy, and science curricular development. Fewer strides have been made in examining the connections between STSE education and learning/teaching physics. Examples of moving STSE theory into practice within a physics classroom can be found in the educational literature and are alluded to the physics literature. This article examines the literature on connecting STSE to physics and attempting to find relevancy for students learning the science from educationalists' and physicists' perspectives.

AB  - The design of biological systems is a multidisciplinary activity in which biomedical engineers collaborate to build novel biological systems that address society's needs. One of the most relevant skills for designing biological systems is engineering systems thinking (EST). Among the EST elements, the EST cognitive competencies are comparatively less explored. Particularly, there is a lack of understanding of how undergraduate engineering students manifest EST cognitive competencies in synthetic biology so instructors and curriculum designers can better scaffold students' learning. In this study, we contribute to that gap by addressing the question: "To what extent do multidisciplinary undergraduate teams exhibit EST cognitive competencies when designing a biological system to address societal needs?" We followed a Qualitative Descriptive Research approach to analyze the EST cognitive competencies of five teams who successfully framed a problem and developed a functional biological system as part of their participation in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition. We coded the publicly available teams' wikis where they registered their design process using the Capacity for Engineering Systems Thinking (CEST) model and procedures from document analysis. The wikis included evidence of seven of the ten EST cognitive competencies from the CEST model. The studied undergraduate participants framed complex problems, designed systems that typically included various subsystems (e.g., biological, mechanical, electrical) and integrated multiple disciplinary concepts and tools. The participants used various approaches to handle the interconnection and synergistic properties of the elements in their biological systems, such as representing their systems at different levels of detail. Competition judges and advisor can support their teams' EST using our findings. Furthermore, we propose a framework to explore the EST cognitive competencies of undergraduate students in the context of biological synthetic design and suggest how instructors and other interested readers may use our findings to develop learning environments that promote EST.

AB  - The Search for Exoplanets is an interactive computer simulation, the product of a collaboration between the Departments of Physics and Astronomy and Computer Science at Purdue University. Our goal was to create a computer simulation that would introduce students to scientific principles, research methodology, and analysis of data with which planets in another solar systems are discovered and characterized. We sought to create a simulation that would be engaging, realistic, an accurate model of research, and appropriate to the level of knowledge and abilities for a monthly outreach program, Saturday Morning Astrophysics at Purdue.

AB  - The main issue of this paper is the discussion around the question "How can we teach and motivate the why-generation learners and the generation Z learners?". The aim of our project was to find out teaching and learning methods that teachers and learners can use in 21st century classroom. Strategies how to engage gen Y and gen Z learners in the learning process should be found. During our research various methods were used: problem based learning, project based learning, team work, inquiry based learning, interdisciplinary approach, experiments--from very simple and low cost experiments to computer based experiments and remote laboratories. It was found out, that generation Y so as gen Z learners can be motivated by various instructional methods based on their own activity. Their own doing seemed to be more important for them than learning itself. It is necessary to use educational materials including charts, graphic presentations, cartoons. Also it was found out that a very useful tool for our students can be the mind mapping. Mind maps and concept maps are not common during students instruction at secondary and high schools in the Czech republic. We prepared a set of concept maps on the basis of high school physics textbooks, from mechanics, molecular physics, via electricity and magnetism to optics, and nuclear physics. In this paper the outcomes of our project will be presented so as some examples of interdisciplinary modules that have been prepared--"real-world" physics modules with everyday life problems that can be integrated into the high school curriculum physics (physics in the kitchen, crime scene investigation, environmental physics), non-traditional experiments, properties of non-Newtonian liquids (experiments with dilatant fluids, oobleck, the suspension of starch, the Weissenberg effect, Barus effect, the Kaye effect), modern physics--nanotechnology (cooperation with the Regional Centre of Advanced Technologies and Materials--a faculty establishment). The findings of this project are incorporated into the subject "Didactics of Physics" in the undergraduate physics teacher study programme at the Faculty of Science.

AB  - Many graduate training programs in global change recognize the importance of policy and appreciate the complex, multi-stakeholder nature of policymaking in practice. However, few engage directly with diverse stakeholders, an important goal in transformational education, through traditional curricula. We present the results following analysis of a course designed to provide graduate students with an immersion-based experience focused on the flow of information between science, advocacy, policymaking, and management as they relate to invasive species, an important driver of global change threatening many facets of the human condition. In this course students constructed a conceptual model of these interactions. Then, in an immersive experience, they directly engaged with a diverse group of stakeholders, including government agency officials, policymakers, and land managers. Finally, to drive transformational learning, students were challenged to refine the conceptual model and develop a revised framework that more accurately reflected the true co-production (transdisciplinary) nature of these interactions. Thematic analysis of student perceptions revealed a shift from a science-centric view to one where science was but one of many inputs responsible for shaping invasive species policy. This immersive approach, founded in face-to-face interactions among diverse stakeholders, represented a transformative shift in student thinking toward the importance of co-management and collaboration in addressing invasive species.

AB  - Agricultural systems are complex and can be used as examples to teach science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) concepts. However, inclusion of agriculture in core STEM courses is often limited. Three professional development sessions for K-12 teachers were offered in 2021-2022 (hybrid or remote sessions) and repeated in 2022-2023 (in-person sessions) to highlight ways that agricultural plant production systems could be incorporated into core courses like biology, environmental science, chemistry, and math. Teacher participants asked how knowledge level and confidence were influencing their inclusion of agriculture into STEM courses before and after the sessions, and gains in knowledge on content-based questions were also evaluated. Response rates in Year 1 ranged from 8.0% to 38.5%, and usable response rates in Year 2 ranged from 47% to 68%. The availability of lessons or activities and teacher content knowledge both increased teacher likelihood to incorporate in three sessions. However, the additional time needed to incorporate new lessons was identified as affecting the likelihood to incorporate materials after the Year 1 ecology session. Teacher confidence to incorporate agricultural lessons or activities into their courses increased in four of the sessions, though teachers became more aware that limited resources are available to help increase adoption. Awareness of how agriculture can be used to meet learning standards also improved teacher confidence in four sessions. Average score on knowledge-based questions increased in all six sessions, but was only significant for two sessions. These sessions were successful at increasing teacher knowledge and confidence to incorporate agriculture into STEM courses.

AB  - This work describes an alternative approach for introducing the concept of pH in high school. We develop an experimental protocol to demonstrate in classroom as pH affects the life of microorganisms. At the same time, we constructed low-cost equipment and a homemade culture media using ordinary products, which they are easily found by the teachers in any commercial store. It was observed that in pH lower than 3 and higher than 13 the growth of microorganisms is inhibited. We applied this interdisciplinary activity to students from six different schools. The results showed that teaching the concept of pH, contextualized with its effect on the growth of microorganism, was significant for the students. Our goal with this kind of activity is to allow students to understand the concept of pH through the application of knowledge allowing them to intervene in their daily lives.

AB  - Finland has recently reformed the national school curriculum, basing it on so-called twenty-first century skills. The curriculum prescribes that schools must organise at least one multidisciplinary learning module per year. In this case study, we investigate the implementation of such a module in secondary school (grade 9) from the perspective of the school headmaster and science and mathematics teachers. The data comprise interviews with the headmaster, teachers, and protocols from collegiate meetings. Despite some gains experienced by teachers concerning cooperation with colleagues, the results reveal challenges connected to diffusely defined learning goals, as well as to the vagueness of goals concerning the role of different subjects in the module. The study shows the importance of offering research-based support and time for shared sensemaking for stakeholders to avoid the problems identified when implementing multidisciplinary teaching.

AB  - Science students should use mathematical and computational thinking to explain phenomena, but few examples of teachers engaging students in this important scientific practice have been found. This article describes a strategy for enhancing a lesson in which students use a mechanistic model to explain friction by adding mathematical and computational thinking. This helps students express their ideas more precisely with models that have predictive power. The approaches described in this article could be a framework to engage students in mathematical and computational thinking in other topics in physics (e.g., studying collisions related to drop height and resultant bounce height for a ball) and in other disciplines (e.g., the study of population ecology in the life sciences). Adding mathematical and computational thinking is appropriate and important for all students as they go about making sense of the world in science class.

AB  - This study examines the views of assessment of programme directors at a Portuguese public university (n = 60). Data were collected through a questionnaire which included closed and open-ended questions. The participants hold different professional categories and come from medical and health sciences, exact sciences, engineering and technology, social sciences and humanities. Data suggest the use of a variety of assessment methods, through a mix of learner-centred and traditional methods. The year of study, the type of course, the nature of the programmes and the institutional regulations were identified by the programme directors as factors that may influence the selection of the assessment methods. The participants considered assessment practices to be in general adequate, but there is room for improvement, namely through an integrated and interdisciplinary approach.

AB  - The authors present a model for program-wide assessment of the effectiveness of writing instruction in a chemistry laboratory course. This model, which involves collaboration between faculty from chemistry, the Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) program, and the Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning, is based on several theories and established practices from science education and WAC. Multidisciplinary experts scored writing samples and debriefed their findings. The quantitative and qualitative feedback prompted the modification of writing objectives and the realignment of course assignments. The interdisciplinary and collaborative process described could be implemented in a wide range of courses to provide insights on curricular effectiveness and tailor writing assessments to course writing objectives.

AB  - Despite the importance of chemistry in addressing many of society's most significant challenges, there is a growing stigma associated with chemicals in our nation, often termed "chemophobia". We sought to appeal to the public, not only through education, but also through art as an avenue for appreciation with the development of a new one-of-a-kind chemistry-art summer program. In the Community Engagement in Science Through Art (CESTA) summer program, chemistry, sculpture, and engineering students work collaboratively to design and construct an interactive art piece that brings chemistry to the local community. The program was designed to develop a unique and critical set of cross-disciplinary communication skills among our student participants while fostering a broad appreciation of the importance of other fields and their contribution to society. The schedule consisted of a brainstorming phase, including team development activities and field trips to science and art museums, prior to the building phase in which students presented and discussed sketches and small-scale prototypes of their ideas. Each summer culminated with the construction and public unveiling of a final collaborative sculpture. The outpouring of community and media interest in this program suggests promise for the opportunity to use art to improve the public's relationship with chemistry.

AB  - Environmental Education has become over recent decades an emerging area of knowledge; its evolution has been conditioned not only by different regional dynamics, but also by international guidelines and trends. Therefore, the literature reports multiple and diverse pedagogical, curricular and transdisciplinary approaches to this topic. Likewise, studies on the dynamics and trends in the generation and production of knowledge are relevant to both teachers and researchers in every field of knowledge. In this sense, it is presented a bibliometric study that aims to analyse the international scientific production on Environmental Education on the Web of Science (WoS) within the categories Education and Educational Research and Education, Scientific Disciplines for the last two decades (2000-2019). The information obtained was analysed using different bibliometric techniques, like descriptive statistics, degree of collaboration and co-occurrence maps generated by VOSviewer (version 1.6.15) software. The results show the accelerated increase in the production of knowledge in this area, they present the main research contexts, as well as some educational and research perspectives. Also, the collaboration between authors and universities was identified.

AB  - Many university and high school introductory physics courses include a laboratory portion where students follow a manual to conduct "cookbook" experiments. Here, we present an authentic research project for introductory physics students that focuses on kinematics that can be done outside a formal laboratory space. This experiment can be done in a high school or a university setting. Because it is not confined to a formal laboratory space, students can perform the experiment outside of a formal time period dedicated for labs, and over the course of a semester. This activity was developed as a part of an integrated science and mathematics program where students used their knowledge in kinematics to observe the psychology of animal behavior. Students were guided to write a research proposal for their experiment and to carry it out over a semester. The following describes the activity, experimental methods, and sample data.

AB  - The article presents the application of 3D technologies in STEAM education through a conducted scientific research, highlighting the role of 3D modeling and 3D printing as an innovative approach in achieving an interdisciplinary learning model. The research included the following stages: preparation for designing a detailed 3D steam locomotive model; analysis of process difficulties; giving students and lecturers the opportunity to perform a specific modeling task, using basic primitives from solid geometry, as well as a questionnaire to analyze and evaluate the skills and knowledge of the participants in the 3D modeling field. In this context, the preparation process of a 3D steam locomotive model for educational purposes, using Autodesk 3ds Max software, is presented, and the 3D printing technology FDM is examined. We issued a challenge to the participants in the research to design a non-complex 3D model, using unfamiliar 3D modeling software Blender, within a limited time. The questionnaire covered topics in education, science, art, STEAM, and 3D modeling. The goal is to showcase the role of the integration of 3D technologies in educational environments with the idea of developing key skills and knowledge in learners.

AB  - This paper illustrates how years 1 and 2 students were guided to engage in data modelling and statistical reasoning through interdisciplinary mathematics and science investigations drawn from an Australian 3-year longitudinal study: "Interdisciplinary Mathematics and Science Learning" (https://imslearning.org/). The project developed learning sequences for 12 inquiry-based investigations involving 35 teachers and cohorts of between 25 and 70 students across years 1 through 6. The research used a design-based methodology to develop, implement, and refine a 4-stage pedagogical cycle based on students' problem posing, data generation, organisation, interpretation, and reasoning about data. Across the stages of the IMS cycle, students generated increasingly sophisticated representations of data and made decisions about whether these supported their explanations, claims about, and solutions to scientific problems. The teacher's role in supporting students' statistical reasoning was analysed across two learning sequences: "Ecology" in year 1 and "Paper Helicopters" in year 2 involving the same cohort of students. An explicit focus on data modelling and meta-representational practices enabled the year 1 students to form statistical ideas, such as distribution, sampling, and aggregation, and to construct a range of data representations. In year 2, students engaged in tasks that focused on ordering and aggregating data, measures of central tendency, inferential reasoning, and, in some cases, informal ideas of variability. The study explores how a representation-focused interdisciplinary pedagogy can support the development of data modelling and statistical thinking from an early age.

AB  - The science of biology has been transforming dramatically and so the need for a stronger mathematical background for biology students has increased. Biological students reaching the senior or post-graduate level often come to realize that their mathematical background is insufficient. Similarly, students in a mathematics programme, interested in biological phenomena, find it difficult to master the complex systems encountered in biology. In short, the biologists do not have enough mathematics and the mathematicians are not being taught enough biology. The need for interdisciplinary curricula that includes disciplines such as biology, physical science, and mathematics is widely recognized, but has not been widely implemented. In this paper, it is suggested that students develop a skill set of ecology, mathematics and technology to encourage working across disciplinary boundaries. To illustrate such a skill set, a predator-prey model that contains self-limiting factors for both predator and prey is suggested. The general idea of dynamics, is introduced and students are encouraged to discover the applicability of this approach to more complex biological systems. The level of mathematics and technology required is not advanced; therefore, it is ideal for inclusion in a senior-level or introductory graduate-level course for students interested in mathematical biology.

AB  - This paper describes an interdisciplinary effort involving faculty from five different disciplines who came together to develop an interdisciplinary, open, general education cybersecurity course. The course, Cybersecurity, Technology, and Society, brings together ideas from interdisciplinary studies, information technology, engineering, business, computer science, criminal justice, and philosophy to provide students an interdisciplinary introduction to cybersecurity. We provide an overview of the rationale for the course, the process the authors went through developing the course, a summary of the course modules, details about the open education resources used as readings, and the types of assignments included in the class. We conclude by offering recommendations for others developing similar courses.

AB  - Our population is aging, calling for communities to be more age friendly and younger individuals to be more aware of aging issues that will impact their personal and professional lives. However, colleges provide few opportunities for students to prepare themselves for a more age-diverse world. Drawing on a new general education core curriculum that calls for students to gain and integrate information within four different knowledge perspectives, we describe a multidisciplinary course that uses information from the physical and social sciences to examine age-friendly community problems and solutions. Topics included environmental health, industrial ecology, and sustainable energy in the context of social-psychological well-being across the life span. Research activities and design projects gave students hands-on opportunities to apply multidisciplinary approaches to complex problems and gain age-related knowledge. Evaluations indicated that the course successfully accomplished its learning objectives, and several lessons were learned about delivering an age-friendly, multidisciplinary course.

AB  - Educational Data Mining (EDM) is an interdisciplinary field that encapsulates different fields such as computer science, education, and statistics. It is crucial to make data mining in education to shape future trends in education for policymakers, researchers, and educators in terms of developments. To have an all-inclusive understanding of EDM studies, a comprehensive examination of both the intellectual and social structure of the field with a global perspective and its evolution over time is required to provide adequate comprehension of the past, present, and as well future research direction for this research field. In this respect, this research study aims to explore the performance analysis of the EDM, the intellectual structure of the EDM, the social structure of the area, and the temporal modeling of the EDM through bibliometric analysis. In this bibliometric analysis, the existing body of knowledge that covered 2010-2021 was presented on educational data mining to provide future directions in the field of education. The results of the study showed the number of publications increased by 1325% (8 to 114) over the years. It has been determined that the most influential journals in the field are "Computers & Education", "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications" and "Educational Technology & Society" and the most influential authors are "C. Romero", "S. Ventura" and "R.S. Barker", and the USA, Spain, and China seem to be the most influential countries in the field of EDM. The themes of "CLASSIFICATION" and "SYSTEMS" in the first sub-period (2010-2013) of EDM, and "LEARNING ANALYTICS", "PREDICTION OF ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE" and "SOCIAL MEDIA" in the second sub-term (2014-2017) and the third and last sub-period (2018-2021), "PREDICTION OF ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE", "MACHINE LEARNING", "PROCESS MINING", "PARTICIPATION", "KNN", "J48" and "BAYESIAN NETWORK" themes were identified as engine themes. In addition, as a result of the thematic evolution map, it was discovered that the themes "DEEP-LEARNING (DL)" and "EMOTION" are emerging themes for future studies for shaping the future of education based on sustainable goals.

AB  - How, when and what kind of learning takes place are key questions in all educational environments. School graduates are expected to have reached a development level whereby they have, among many fundamental skills, the ability to think critically, to plan their studies and their future, and to integrate knowledge across disciplines. However, it is challenging to develop these skills in schools. Following existing curricula, disciplines are often taught separately and by different teachers, making it difficult for students to connect knowledge studied and learned from one discipline to that of another discipline. The Next Generation Science Standards on teaching and learning natural science in the United States point out important crosscutting concepts in science education (NGSS, 2013). In Estonia, similar trends are leading to an emphasis on the need to further develop scientific literacy skills and interdisciplinary learning in students. The changing environment around us must be reflected in changes in our school system. In this paper, we report on research that intends to answer the questions: (a) "How much do Estonian students develop an interdisciplinary understanding of science throughout their high school education?", and (b) "Is their thinking more interdisciplinary after two years of studies in an Estonian high school?" Additionally, we analyzed the results based on the type of school the students attended, and we examined the use concept mapping to assess interdisciplinary learning. This research is part of an overall study that involved students from 44 Estonian high schools taking a science test similar to the three-dimensional Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) test (hereafter called PISA-like multidimensional test) as well as constructing concept maps, while in 10th and 12th grade. In this paper, we report on the analysis of the results for 182 of the students, concentrating on the analysis of the concept maps they constructed. The results suggest that there were changes in the students' interdisciplinary knowledge, but these were small and varied depending on the students' school type. They also suggest that changes may be needed in the Estonian educational system to increase the students' level of interdisciplinary understanding of science.

AB  - Interdisciplinary curriculum supports cognitive development through well planned lessons at early age. This article focuses on a specific experimental study done in 2010 on Grade 7 learners in a Lebanese private school to aid them in empowering their skills and competencies to solve a real life problem. The objective of this experimental study is to prepare students for Grade 10 to create the necessary chemistry between learners and Physics as a discipline. The problematic can be stated as: The synergy of teachers' team work to design an interdisciplinary curriculum implementing ICT in classrooms facilitates the transfer and construction of knowledge and scaffolds learners with necessary skills and competencies from an early age to solve physics problems. The results were very optimistic showing 57% development of the study group members in comparison with only 10% for the control group members. Further studies are necessary on larger samples and for longer duration to expose learners to different topics and trace the effect of interdisciplinary curriculum after 4 years.

AB  - Research has revealed that a small percentage of weekly instructional time in the elementary grades is dedicated to teaching science. Additionally, elementary educators receive limited preparation to teach science concepts compared to math or literacy skills. Therefore, this study examined if utilizing poetry to teach science concepts had a significant influence on elementary pre-service teachers' (PSTs) self-efficacy (SE) and expected outcomes (EOs) toward teaching science. Instructors in elementary literacy and science teaching methods courses collaborated to model strategies that integrated poetry within a science unit and mentored the PSTs in creating poems. Following the three-week integrative unit, analyses of the survey responses revealed significant increases in the PSTs' EOs resulting from their science teaching when integrating poetry. 92% of the PSTs believed poetry would help them integrate more science instruction and in greater depth. Moderate positive correlations were found between PSTs' SE toward teaching science and gains in: (a) perceived knowledge of science concepts, (b) belief that poetry would help integrate more science instruction, and (c) belief that integrating poetry would help students learn science concepts better. This study provides implications for informing teacher preparation programs, professional development experiences, and integrated curricula efforts to expand science instruction in elementary curricula.

AB  - Laboratory-based "practical" classes are an essential component in teaching molecular biology for undergraduate students. Universidad Regional Amazonica Ikiam is a higher education institution located in the Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest, a high biodiversity place, including amphibians. Based on this, we have established a practical molecular biology program with eight sessions that contextualize the biodiverse surroundings of the University. This program stimulates synchronization of information between theory and practice and improves research skills. During these sessions, students are motivated to identify and characterize antimicrobial peptides from Ecuadorian frog skin secretions, using molecular biology techniques and biochemistry and microbiology knowledge. This practical course was held twice with a total of 56 students from the fifth semester of the biotechnology engineering. The evaluation of the practical program was carried out through a questionnaire applied to students using the Likert scale. Overall, this form of teaching had high receptivity and presented benefits for student learning. Interestingly, 80% of respondents strongly agreed that this course provided tools and knowledge for the development of their undergraduate dissertation. Therefore, practical courses tailored to the student's context can stimulate student learning and interest. Additionally, this experimental methodology is interdisciplinary and can be applied to other research fields and subjects.

AB  - "Science and Children" and "Science Scope" are peer-reviewed science practitioner journals that publish articles for science educators who teach children of ages 5-10 years and 10-13 years, respectively. As such, these articles are a reflection of the science concepts that are being communicated to science educators. This comprehensive literature review was completed to determine the extent to which the articles included in these journals from 1990 to 2014 focused on biology topics, incorporated other non-science subjects and science disciplines, and encouraged inquiry-based learning. The results indicate that out of the 2701 total articles, 557 (21%) focused on biology. The biology topic covered most often by both journals was animals. The biology topics covered least often were fungi, photosynthesis, respiration and viruses. The findings are taken into consideration and the educational implications for the journals and educators are discussed.

AB  - This study aims to describe the history of interdisciplinary education and the current trends and to elucidate the conceptual framework and values that support interdisciplinary science teaching. Many science educators have perceived the necessity for a crucial paradigm shift towards interdisciplinary learning as shown in science standards. Interdisciplinary learning in science is characterized as a perspective that integrates two or more disciplines into coherent connections to enable students to make relevant connections and generate meaningful associations. There is no question that the complexity of the natural system and its corresponding scientific problems necessitate interdisciplinary understanding informed by multiple disciplinary backgrounds. The best way to learn and perceive natural phenomena of the real world in science should be based on an effective interdisciplinary teaching. To support the underlying rationale for interdisciplinary teaching, the present study proposes theoretical approaches on how integrated knowledge of teachers affects their interdisciplinary teaching practices and student learning. This research further emphasizes a need for appropriate professional development programs that can foster the interdisciplinary understanding across various science disciplines.

AB  - The main purpose of the living technology curriculum is to cultivate students' interest in learning science and technology, and further to utilize their experience of learning instructions and develop their ability to integrate interdisciplinary knowledge and skills. In recent years, as countries have begun to emphasize the concept of interdisciplinary integration in the school education, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, STEM) focuses on cultivating interdisciplinary talents. With this, STEAM highlights the role of ART because other dimensions of STEM are expected to be effectively integrated through the cultivation of aesthetics; the purpose of this study is to design a STEAM curriculum for elementary school children and to explore the impact of STEAM education on the creativity. The content of this course is based on the PBL (Project-Based Learning) with the teaching activities combining with "Chinese Paper-cutting" and "BBC micro: bit". The teaching process is used the strategy of creative thinking instruction. The research method adopts a one-group pretest-posttest design based on a purposive sampling of 21 students from one class in an elementary school. The research tools included the records of learning feedback and the creativity assessment. The empirical findings show that the project-based learning incorporating STEAM activity has a positive significant influence on students' development of creative recognition. Since the empirical results are constricted by the short-term STEAM course, the STEAM course with the art-oriented still benefits the STEAM education and Learning effectiveness of elementary school students. The implication of interdisciplinary interactive Lamp of Paper Carving with Micro:Bit is expected to contribute to further development of STEAM course. Since the curriculum is only last for few weeks, it is too short to affect the emotional facet of creativity. Future researches are suggested to extend the teaching period and evaluate the long-term influence of PBL STEAM on students' learning attitude.

AB  - There is wide agreement that ethical considerations are a valuable aspect of a data science curriculum, and to that end, many data science programs offer courses in data science ethics. There are not always, however, explicit connections between data science ethics and the centuries-old work on ethics within the discipline of philosophy. Here, we present a framework for bringing together key data science practices with ethics topics. The ethics topics were collated from 16 data science ethics courses with public-facing syllabi and reading lists. We encourage individuals who are teaching data science ethics to engage with the philosophical literature and its connection to current data science practices, which are rife with potentially morally charged decision points.

AB  - We have observed that as the theoretical landscape in behavioral science continues to proliferate and diversify, it is not uncommon that distance between subspecialties emerge, artificially accentuating differences between camps. This may occur at the risk of losing sight of the common ground, and worsening communication between subspecialties. In this paper, we propose conceptual "crosswalking" as a means to preserve interdisciplinary communication within the behavioral sciences. This is illustrated using Bronfenbrenner's Person-Process-Context-Time (PPCT) Model, mapped onto therapeutic modalities with a focus on ecological systems. Recommendations for future crosswalking are made.

AB  - Polymers are present in most organic materials in the field of cultural heritage science and art conservation. This makes the study of polymer chemistry necessary in art conservation graduate training programs. Given each program approaches this important topic in different ways, the present paper describes areas of common ground and problems we, as faculty in two of the programs in North America, have found, and how we have addressed them: from stressing the importance of polymer science as part of a holistic educational model to emerging art conservators, to addressing the characterization and degradation of polymers in cultural heritage. While they are seemingly different, both approaches successfully accomplish our overall goal: instill scientific curiosity and problem solving using the extremely ubiquitous class of materials we know as polymers. Consequently, our strategies and the practical exercises we are describing can be easily applied to other areas where polymers are present.

AB  - For those interested in understanding cultures of learning in both formal and informal science educational contexts, ethnography is often the research approach of choice. Yet ethnography, as a research approach, is far from monolithic. The myriad of nuances, distinctions, and open questions of ethnographic research, employed as full-scale ethnographies or as ethnographically informed approaches to broader qualitative research, can be a source of numerous tensions in science education research and educational research in general. In order to trouble and learn from these tensions, we employed a novel, analytic approach of meta-ethnography. We relied on Bakhtinian dialogic analysis to contrast questions of ethnographic methodology and method across four multidisciplinary studies of learning cultures rooted in varied levels of ethnographic methods. Commonalities in methodological tensions between the studies include the role of the researcher, the temporal scope, and analysis and representation. We proposed an ethnographic continuum as one way to envision our ethnographic studies without bounding them by the traditional nomenclatures.

AB  - Myocardial contraction is triggered whenever a wave of electrical impulses passes through the heart. The pattern of electrical excitation spreads coordinately over the structure of the heart. This results in a measurable change in potential across the surface of the body of a subject. The recording of the resultant signal from specific body points is known as an electrocardiogram (ECG). Students can directly record an ECG signal from the headset input of a smartphone with an electric lead and a suitable sound app. This allows interdisciplinary teaching by applying physics concepts to physiology

AB  - In the United States, school curricula are often created and taught with distinct boundaries between disciplines. This division between curricular areas may serve as a hindrance to students' long-term learning and their ability to generalize. In contrast, cross-curricular pedagogy provides a way for students to think beyond the classroom walls and make important connections across disciplines. The purpose of this paper is a theoretical reflection on our use of Expansive Framing in our design of lessons across learning environments within the school. We provide a narrative account of our early work in using this theoretical framework to co-plan and enact interdisciplinary mathematics and computer science (CS) tasks with a team of elementary school educators and school district personnel. The unit focuses on the concepts of exponents in mathematics and repeat loops as a control structure in computer science. Using a narrative approach, we describe what occurred during the collaborative planning of lessons and subsequent enactments in two fifth-grade classrooms and one computer lab and provide a practitioner-oriented account of our experience.

AB  - In this article teachers will find a rationale and examples for connections between literature and other disciplines, such as history, science, art, political science, philosophy, and psychology. The article addresses the goal of the Connections standard, as defined by the "World-Readiness Standards for Learning Languages" (W-RSFLL) (NSFLEP, 2015), namely, to help students expand their knowledge, engage in critical thinking, and attempt to solve problems creatively. With this goal in mind, it examines two literary avenues for making connections: first, literature in the original language, and second, literature in translation. It demonstrates connections with history, political science, and art within a language or literature course. Some examples include the question of immigration through Marie-Thérèse Coliman-Hall's short story "Bonjour Maman, Bonne fête, Maman, [Greetings, Mama; Happy Mother's Day, Mama"]; the role of colonialism in French history through the poetry of Léopold Sédar Senghor; and the question of national identity through Daudet's La Dernière Classe ["The Last Class"]. The article also addresses literature in translation through examples taken from the author's personal experience in teaching an interdisciplinary course. Among the topics are the role of memory through Bergson and Proust, and Einstein's "space-time" through Proust and Bakhtin. This topic includes folk-tales, accessible in the original and translation. Finally, the article illustrates a multi-disciplinary approach to atomic warfare through the film "Hiroshima mon amour." It emphasizes the role of the language teacher in guiding students to make connections between language and content disciplines, notably through the three modes of communication, and illustrates the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to problem solving and critical thinking.

AB  - Purpose: Historically, graduate education's goal was to prepare academics; now most science, technology, engineering and/or mathematics (STEM) graduate students (GSs) go on to nonacademic careers. STEM GSs must be equipped for success regardless of career aspirations, which can be done by strengthening GSs' professional identities. This study aims to explore an interdisciplinary partnership designed to strengthen STEM GS professional identity. Design/methodology/approach: The STEM Partnership Project (SPP), asked STEM GSs to serve as disciplinary experts and teach STEM content to elementary teacher candidates (TCs) so the TCs could design and teach an elementary science lesson. GSs also enrolled in a one-credit course to support SPP participation and activities. Over five semesters, the authors collected data from 28 STEM GSs across different disciplines and degree programs in the form of course assignments, surveys and interviews. Findings: The SPP supported the development of a professional identity by having GSs serve as and feel like experts; increasing GSs' sense of belonging in their field; increasing GSs' self-confidence that they could (learn to) teach a wide variety of audiences; and raising GSs' awareness of their ability to serve others via their field. Originality/value: The SPP's outcomes were consistent across STEM disciplines, did not require GSs to take on large amounts of coursework, nor did it cost much beyond materials for the various lessons. Furthermore, the key components that strengthened GSs' professional identities could be adapted for different contexts and institutions.

AB  - This study examines and explores the challenges, issues, and problems with their solutions regarding Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education along with the awareness enjoyed by science teachers. The selection of papers for this study was done through systematic literature review techniques. The 11 themes were generated through the thematic analysis of the papers that is, STEM education and its awareness; its challenges, issues, and problems; its curriculum; inquiry and learning environment; technologies; learning and models of integration; a blended learning approach; students' problem-solving abilities and skills; its implementation and evaluation; it's research and current trends; and interdisciplinary collaboration and intervention. Policy and planning, infrastructure, and the state of society were found the main factors of the poor conditions of STEM education. STEM research studies suggest that a curriculum with a blended learning approach has to be integrated by interventions of models depicting technological and inquiry-based environments to bring awareness among teachers, which strengthens the students' problem-solving abilities and skills.

AB  - Improving the interest of high-school students towards chemistry (and science in general) is one of the goals of the Italian Ministry of Education. To this aim, we designed a context-based activity that actively involved students in six different laboratory experiences interconnected by a case study of the murder of Miss Scarlet, from the famous game Clue. Key points of the activity were: the interest aroused by the subject of crime scene investigation; the direct involvement of the students in all stages of the work (from the realization of the experiments to the resolution of the case); the use of a multidisciplinary approach for addressing a complex scientific problem; the work in chemical laboratories with modern instrumentation; the team work and the supervision by young tutors. To verify the hypothesis that such a multidisciplinary activity could foster the interest for the discipline, an evaluation was performed using a self-report questionnaire designed to assess changes in the situational interest raised by the internship. It was found that the activity significantly increased interest and attitude toward chemistry, mainly for students with lower scores in pleasure for the study of chemistry, self-efficacy and self-concept in chemistry

AB  - This book explores the connections made in and through arts-based educational research through four themes: socially engaged connections, cultural connections, personal and pedagogical connections, and making connections during the COVID-19 pandemic. It emerges from the 3rd bi-annual 2020 Artful Inquiry Research Group symposium on the theme of "connections". The symposium brought together artists, community members, teachers, students, and researchers through a virtual platform to examine the way(s) in which the arts can help connect people, ideas, and spaces/places in a pandemic reality. Art plays a predominant role in each chapter as authors weave their research and art-based understandings together. This book is a valuable teaching resource for undergraduate and postgraduate courses in teaching, anthropology, digital ethnography, autoethnography, cultural studies, and communications. It is of interest to higher education students, academic researchers, and teachers exploring arts-based methodologies in the fields of creative practice and creativity studies, communications, critical studies, sociology, sciences, teacher education, and the arts.

AB  - This article proposes that the reader be nourished by avant-garde elements for new educational practices in the teaching and learning of mathematics. The writing is based on an investigation that was carried out with high school students from Puerto Rico. From a qualitative paradigm with a research design in action, it was explored how students in higher grades resolve situations within their environment. Emphasis was placed on how they analyze through situations in context, and how they build knowledge through the search for a possible solution to the problem through the Project Based Learning strategy. The emphasis in treatment was for students to experience a transdisciplinary environment. Their impressions from the study were the revealing focus of how students learn when they are presented with a situation in their environment, taking roles themselves, solving them it through a project. As part of the project they used their knowledge of science and mathematics to solve the situation. Similarly, they learned mathematical concepts that are part of the Trigonometry course and that are measured in the academic achievement tests called PR Goals, previously known as Puerto Rican Academic Achievement Tests (PPAA).

AB  - Responsible citizenship and sound decision-making in today's information age necessitate an appreciation of the role of uncertainty in the process of generating data-based scientific knowledge. The latter calls for coordinating between different types of uncertainties, related to three types of relevant reasoning: statistical, scientific, and nature of science uncertainties. This article examines separately the uncertainties that young students articulate as they engage in activities designed to concurrently foster all three types of reasoning, and also explores how these different types can interrelate. The context of Citizen Science is particularly suited for this goal, providing a unique pedagogical opportunity for learning scientific content by engaging learners in authentic scientific practices, including data analysis. Based on literature from the three fields of statistics, science and nature of science education, we offer an integrative framework, Deterministic Relativistic and Middle ground (DReaM), which consists of nine sub-categories of uncertainty articulations. We utilize it to analyze an instrumental case study of a pair of middle school students' (ages 13 and 14) participation in a pilot study of an interdisciplinary extended learning sequence, as part of the Radon Citizen Science Project. The results of an interpretative microgenetic analysis identified all nine DReaM uncertainty articulations sub-categories. These are illustrated in the Findings section with key scenes from the pair's participation. The discussion depicts how these sub-categories manifested in this particular case study and suggests interrelations between them in a more extended depiction of the DReaM framework. We conclude with the pedagogical implications of the extended framework.

AB  - The United States is currently experiencing its most severe measles outbreak in decades, driven in part by parents' belief that vaccines cause autism. That harmful misinformation is contrary to scientific evidence (DeStefano et al. 2013). The CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world's largest multidisciplinary scientific society, is concerned that fewer and fewer members of the public understand "the very idea that science is a special way for separating truth from falsehood" (Holt 2017). The proliferation of misinformation has become so serious that, as an editorial in "The Science Teacher" noted, "evidence-based reasoning seems under assault" (Metz 2017). In response, the authors have developed and tested a free, research-based, one-week curriculum unit for use in grades 6-12. In the sections presented in this article, the authors expand upon the reasons for creating the unit, describe the materials, discuss the pilot test conducted in six schools, and then indicate how the unit aligns with national education standards. This unit is aligned with both the "Common Core State Standards" and the "Next Generation Science Standards."

AB  - Cheminformatics is a widely used interdisciplinary field that is important for many chemistry areas. Cheminformatics skills are necessary for dealing with a large amount of chemical information and are considered essential for various tasks such as data analysis, visualization, storage, etc. This paper presents the basic cheminformatics chemistry semester-length course for first-year chemistry students, organized at the Novosibirsk State University. Students in the course learn literature and structural databases, search engines, chemical structure drawing and representation, graphing software, text formatting, scientific writing, and report representation. The course could be replicated as an entire course in chemical informatics or could be used as separate modules in other courses. We describe the face-to-face course and the adaptation to an online teaching model during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The students' and lecturers' feedback about the course program and results are also presented. We hope that this work can assist faculty members in teaching cheminformatics.

AB  - Effective education depends on various factors, with textbooks and courses being essential for preparing students for real life situations. Therefore, it's crucial that textbooks are thoughtfully developed and chosen. This study investigates how middle school mathematics textbooks approved by the Ministry of National Education for the 2021-2022 academic year address the connections between "Mathematics - Science" and "Mathematics - Nature." As a descriptive research study, it seeks to reveal the current state of these connections. Data was collected through document analysis, a qualitative research method. Within the scope of this study, eight middle school mathematics textbooks were examined, two from each grade level. The analysis was organized according to the curriculum, emphasizing science and nature themes, as identified through curriculum goals and educational literature. These themes were identified by examining the mathematics curriculum goals and literature on effective mathematics education and textbooks. The research found that while content associations with science and social sciences were somewhat adequate, they were lacking in nature and art. Additionally, connections to daily life were well-represented and designed to engage students. It is recommended that future efforts should aim to enhance textbook preparation to better align with contemporary educational needs.

AB  - Three preK-6 U.S. university methods instructors-researchers (literacy, science, social studies) joined 17 Title I school teachers for collaborative lesson planning and teaching within the preK-5 school setting. Each team's goal was to create and teach interdisciplinary curriculum units using U.S. English language arts Common Core State Standards with social studies and science. A year-long instrumental case study design was used to examine (a) how teachers perceived collaborative professional development to create interdisciplinary unit plans and (b) how teachers viewed outcomes of teaching interdisciplinary units of their own design. Practice articles regarding Common Core State Standards curricula integration are plentiful; however, this study offers researched insights. Collectively, research from various locations and school cultures benefits those needing to structure realistic professional development designs.

AB  - Research in science education with multilingual learners (MLs) has expanded rapidly. This rapid expansion can be situated within a larger dialogue about what it means to provide minoritized students with an equitable education. Whereas some conceptions of equity focus on ensuring all students have access to the knowledge, practices, and language normatively valued in K-12 schools ("equity as access"), increasingly prominent conceptions focus on transforming those knowledge, practices, and language in ways that center minoritized students and their communities ("equity as transformation"). In this article, we argue that conceptions of equity provide a useful lens for understanding emerging research in science education with MLs and for charting a research agenda. We begin by tracing how conceptions of equity have evolved in parallel across STEM and multilingual education. Then, we provide an overview of recent developments from demographic, theoretical, and policy perspectives. In the context of these developments, we provide a conceptual synthesis of emerging research by our team of early-career scholars in three areas: (a) learning, (b) assessment, and (c) teacher education. Within each area, we unpack the research efforts in terms of how they attend to equity as access while pushing toward equity as transformation. Finally, we propose a research agenda for science education with MLs that builds on and extends these efforts. We close by offering recommendations for making this research agenda coherent and impactful: (a) being explicit about our conceptions of equity, (b) paying attention to the interplay of structure and agency, and (c) promoting interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - This study investigated the relationships among technostress creators (techno-complexity, techno-insecurity, techno-invasion, techno-overload, and techno-uncertainty) on the motivation to teach online using the Motivation to Teach Online -- Faculty Version scale. Data were collected from faculty members of the Management and Organizational Behavior Teaching Society (MOBTS), a member of the AACSB Business Education Alliance, and the American Society of Business and Behavioral Sciences (ASBBS), an interdisciplinary professional organization comprised of faculty teaching in accounting, finance, management, marketing, organizational behavior, and computer information systems early 2020 (N = 307). The findings indicated that techno-stressed faculty are less motivated to teach online. Techno-insecurity and techno-overload subconstructs were statistically significant pre-pandemic. Techno-insecurity was statistically significant during the pandemic. Gender and years of teaching online were not observed among faculty to modify online teaching motivations. Results are presented to supply institutions of higher learning with evidence to support faculty with online learning undertakings while leveraging opportunities to manage enrollment.

AB  - This paper focuses on a transdisciplinary research project in a historically underrepresented public school in Toronto, Canada. At the intersection of elementary science, technology, and arts-based curriculum, the project employs the feminist new materialist practice of "diffraction" (Barad, 2007) in an after-school robotics club. Following a Baradian ethics, an emphasis is placed on the process of designing machines, which illuminates the need for different modes of measurement in educational research that account for the ongoing relationships within collective learning environments.

AB  - Game-based learning has received significant attention in educational pedagogy as an effective way of increasing student motivation and engagement. The majority of the work in this area has been focused on digital games or games involving technology. We focus on the use of traditional game design in improving student engagement and perception of learning in teaching computer science concepts in higher education. In addition, as part of an interdisciplinary effort, we discuss the interplay between game-based learning in higher education and disciplinary cultures, addressing the lack of empirical evidence on the impact of game design on learning outcomes, engagement, and students' perception of learning.

AB  - This discussion examines the ever-increasing impact of top-down nation-wide educational reforms on teachers in Japan, exemplified in the 2020 reform. Its unique contribution is a suggestion of an interdisciplinary framework: programming education and English as a foreign language education in elementary schools. Many elementary school teachers are not specialists in computer programming or English education as discipline specialties, yet they face the obligation to teach both subject areas under the authority of the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology. Their lack of training in these curricular areas creates a high level of anxiety as they initially perceived daunting new challenges in their work performances. Concerning programming education, many teachers are not even digital natives, working in schools where "IT rooms [are] covered with dust". The research highlighted here resulted from the authors' engagement in professional development workshops for teachers, "Integrated Programming English Education," demonstrating how much these two disciplines share commonalities and how teachers can effectively use them in their daily teaching. The study results reveal how interdisciplinary frameworks can disrupt deficit norms in teaching single-disciplinary subjects overly used in Japanese education, and simultaneously increase teacher agency through the connectivity of programming and English language education.

AB  - This paper is inspired from a scene in the movie "Memento" (2000), where the eyeglass prescription for a myopic eye can be estimated since the virtual image of a distant wall seen through the lens and a nearby actor outside the view of the lens are located at the same distance. The estimate illustrates that there are times when the power of physics allows one to arrive at a sophisticated measured result with no equipment. This fascinating example also provides for a nice interdisciplinary connection between physics and medical optics. Due to copyright restrictions on incorporating a movie in class, teachers may use the author's photo and video included here or have their students make similar media with their smartphones.

AB  - Behavior analysts collaborating within interdisciplinary teams are likely to find themselves at difficult crossroads. Some of these crossroads include implementing alternative treatments, defining and determining risk and harm, and evaluating research and interventions. The purpose of this paper is to highlight some of these crossroads and provide guidelines on successfully navigating them. We contend that it is possible to navigate these crossroads while minimizing harm or risk for the client, adhering to the principles of science and behavior analysis, and remaining respectful of all members of the interdisciplinary team. That is, we can maintain the scientific tenets of philosophic doubt, empiricism, and experimentation, while remaining humble, and ensuring our clients access the most effective interventions available.

AB  - Focusing on health education as its context, this article considers the question of how to equip students with strategies to identify and resist misinformation. In doing so, it confronts a key problem for health services nationally and globally, which is the problem of entrenched compartmentalisation. The relationship between these two key issues is explored with reference to a workshop on health misinformation. The workshop was designed through co-creation with researchers in education and was trialled with foundation-level students studying biomedical science and pharmacology. Feedback from participating students included that the workshop provided valuable aspects of interdisciplinary learning that they felt were 'missing' from their education to date. The article concludes by discussing the opportunity for science education in schools and colleges to address and potentially head off problems that persist beyond school and that are recognised to need urgent attention in health discourse.

AB  - This study is a two-iteration design-based research project that investigated how youths' science learning and socio-emotional attitudes toward science were influenced by a summer camp with a personal genetics approach. A multidisciplinary team developed a 2-week camp curriculum that included personal DNA tests, family genealogy projects, and fitness tracker data. The learners included 120 youths, aged 10-14, in six camps held in three sites. Data collection included matched pre- and post-scores for genetic knowledge and self-reported affiliation with science, views of science supports, self-efficacy, and science curiosity scores, as well as youths' daily workbook entries. Our analysis included t-tests, Mann-Whitney tests, Pearson and Spearman correlations, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc tests. The findings showed significant science learning gains (related to heredity, genotype, and phenotype) for five of six camp conditions. Also, the youths showed gains in socio-emotional attitudes for both iterations, emphasizing malleability of socio-emotional connections to science. Completing workbook pages was not associated with an increase in knowledge gains or socio-emotional attitudes. This study recommends the inclusion of personal DNA data in summer camp environments to support science learning and increase socio-emotional attitudes toward science. It also suggests structured workbook activities common in schools may not support youths' science learning or socio-emotional attitudes in out-of-school programs. Finally, the study's concluding design conjecture map connects the camps' activities to learners' behaviors to learning outcomes in a way that advances the informal science education field's use of personal data in out-of-school-time programs for adolescents.

AB  - Science history shows us that interdisciplinarity is a spontaneous process that is intrinsic to, and engendered by, research activity. It is an activity that is done rather than an object to be designed and constructed. We examine three vignettes from the history of science that display the interdisciplinary process at work and consider the implications for education. We consider recent examples of interdisciplinary science education, including where interdisciplinarity involves students in authentic scientific research. We conclude that the reconciliation of research and education is a meaningful role for interdisciplinary practice in science education. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Does early exposure to information literacy promote long-term student success? This paper describes a longitudinal case study testing the hypothesis that students who engage with scientific literature and develop information literacy early in their undergraduate studies will achieve higher grades on literature-based assignments in future coursework. We reasoned that students with previous experience in the scientific literature will develop more efficient and effective strategies to search and evaluate the literature and will ultimately favor higher-quality journals. To test these hypotheses, student performance data were collected during scientific literature-based assignments in two upper-division undergraduate lecture courses, Biochemistry 1 and Biochemistry 2. Data were analyzed from two student populations: students with prior information literacy instruction and critical practice from an Honors General Chemistry course sequence, and those students who had not undergone this training. The results indicate that, in Biochemistry 1, students with this prior information literacy training tend to use more professional, expert-like tools for exploring scientific literature and earn statistically higher scores on literature-based projects. However, by Biochemistry 2, the gaps close in both the exploration of the scientific literature and grade performance. This indicates that once students develop a foundation in information literacy, their sophistication in finding information and their performance on subsequent literature-based tasks improve. There was a small and statistically insignificant tendency for groups containing more students with prior information literacy training to cite more articles from the primary literature. However, the quality of the citations, as measured by journal impact factors, did not differ between the populations. The results of this interdisciplinary case study suggest that teaching information literacy to science students has both immediate and long-lasting benefits.

AB  - The Pre-College Summer Program at the University of Connecticut is designed to introduce upper-level high school students (rising juniors and seniors) to college life by allowing them to live on campus for a week while taking a college-level course. Within the context of this program, we developed a class designed to introduce high school students to the multidisciplinary process of drug discovery and development. While the targeted audience is made up of students that are interested in the science aspects of drug development (chemistry, pharmacology, etc.), the course also attracts students interested in the clinical side of drug discovery including pharmacy and medicine. The goals of this manuscript are to outline the rationale behind our course and detail the individual lecture and lab components that the students experience during their week on our campus.

AB  - A call for educational reform motivated this school system to devise an enhanced version of STEM in their middle school. This case provides rich descriptions of how eighth grade middle school teachers, from multiple disciplines, enacted a STEAM team model that integrated Language Arts into STEM. These STEAM team teachers were systematically studied during field observations of 100+ class sessions using what they referred to as "transdisciplinary co-teaching," flexible scheduling, and multiple types of physical spaces to further engage students. Different dimensions of co-teaching were observed. The most frequently observed was "reconstructed," followed by "predisciplinary," "correlated," and "shared." Types of instruction other than "reconstructed," did not fit the school's proposed definitions of "transdisciplinary co-teaching." Thoughts are shared on lessons learned.

AB  - STEM education and research has gained popularity internationally over the last decade. However, there is a lack in specifications in existing K-12 STEM classroom observation protocols of how features of an integrated STEM experience/lesson would lead to desired outcomes and how those outcomes should be measured. To bridge this gap, we propose the development of a new integrated STEM classroom observation protocol (iSTEM protocol). This article describes the ongoing development work of the iSTEM protocol, which features two creative attempts. Firstly, the productive disciplinary engagement framework is adapted to design a classroom observation protocol that provides a coherent frame of design principles to be met to achieve desired 3-dimensional pedagogical outcomes. Secondly, "interdisciplinarity" of student engagement was interpreted in terms of the extent to which students take a systematic and disciplinary-based approach to make and justify decisions during STEM problem-solving. The iSTEM protocol comprises 15 items (4-point scale) rated holistically for the extents to which evidence was found in the observed lesson for (1) the 3-dimensional pedagogical outcomes of productive interdisciplinary engagement (five items) and (2) problematising, resources, authority, and accountability design principles (10 items). The accompanying iSTEM profile visually represents and communicates the strengths and inadequacies in design principles, thus providing explanations for extents of students' productive interdisciplinary engagement. The iSTEM protocol will contribute as a research tool for STEM education researchers and as a pedagogical guide for STEM classroom teachers to improve their design of STEM learning experiences.

AB  - This article explores how the past mobilities of academics affect their current research output (and its multidisciplinarity). Five types of mobility are used simultaneously in the analysis. Field mobility and transnational educational mobility are associated with academics' educational path, whereas transnational job mobility, intra-sectoral job mobility and inter-sectoral job mobility refer to their career path. The analysis is based on a representative sample of academics based in Hong Kong and Macau. Results show that intra-sectoral job mobility (up to a threshold) and transnational job mobility positively affect research output and its multidisciplinarity, whereas inter-sectoral job mobility, field mobility and transnational educational mobility exert slight or no effect. Nested analyses of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and non-STEM academics as well as experienced and junior academics offer further insight into the roles of these mobilities. Impacts of mobile experience were stronger among junior than senior academics, and in STEM fields than non-STEM fields. The article discusses these findings along with the significance of considering mobilities rather than mobility when analysing academic trajectories and the determinants of academic research production.

AB  - In some European countries inquiry-based learning (IBL) has become popular in primary and secondary mathematics education, especially for scienceconnected content. On the other hand, problem-based learning (PBL) and project-based learning (PjBL) have a longer history in mathematics, science, technology, engineering (STEM) and in some other fields in higher education. We analyse a selection of n=112 high quality research articles about the use of IBL, PBL or PjBL in mathematics, and its interdisciplinary connection with other subjects, level of education, type of research method, research design and participants for each study. Based on these characteristics, we identify the differences between the approaches in mathematics education. Finally, detailed examination of a subsample of experimental studies, where effect size is or can be measured, describes differences in interdisciplinary connections between the target approaches and indicate what kind of studies are still missing in mathematics education.

AB  - Teacher performance has been linked with both self-efficacy and subject knowledge confidence suggesting that it is important to address these aspects within initial teacher training programmes. This study investigated the development of pre-service teacher's science and engineering subject knowledge confidence and teaching self-efficacy following participation in a paired-peer, multidisciplinary STEM project and assesses which aspects of the work may have resulted in any changes observed. A group of 10 pre-service teachers were paired with undergraduate engineering students to develop science through engineering challenges and to enact these with children. Multimethod pre and post evaluation assessed the impact of participation on the subject knowledge confidence and teaching self-efficacy levels of the pre-service teachers, alongside qualitatively exploring possible reasons for any changes. Results indicated that significant increases in both subject knowledge confidence and teaching self-efficacy had occurred. In exploring which aspects of the work may have contributed to these changes, data suggested that the paired-peer aspect of the project may have been beneficial. Immersing pre-service teachers in similar collaborative projects early in their career may provide opportunities to shape positive dispositions towards STEM subjects for pre-service teachers and so evaluations of how this can be built into teacher training programmes are required.

AB  - Research has shown that hands-on projects promote stem education, namely via problem-solving. CanSat, literally 'satellite in a can', is a stem educational project promoted by the European Space Agency. This paper addresses this issue by researching this STEM project and trying to understand how secondary students solve problems in the STEM CanSat project. We use qualitative techniques of data collection and analysis. The results showed that students used sophisticated thinking strategies to process information within this interdisciplinary project: (a) cognitive testing, cognitive organization, cognitive regulation, and monitoring, in addition to computer language and physical-mathematical calculations, are cognitive and metacognitive behavior strategies revealed in the CanSat; (b) problem-solving was suggested as a specific model, where students' higher cognitive and metacognitive ordering processes deepen in project development; (c) computational, lateral, or divergent and convergent thinking were detected as thinking types of students associated with and mobilized in the course of problem-solving. The findings of this research have practical implications for STEM education in space science. Hands-on projects using problem-solving are an essential strategy to promote STEM. This project reinforces this. Additionally, they are a starting point to promote meaningful learning and new thinking types.

AB  - Collaboration between chemistry lecturers and literacy lecturers led to the development and implementation of an interdisciplinary project with the object of addressing two pertinent challenges in chemistry education. The first challenge is the tendency of students to approach different topics in science as separate units of knowledge, which hinders cumulative knowledge building. The second challenge is the effective incorporation of scientific communication skills into science curricula. In the course of this project students completed various assignments in the fields of chemistry and scientific communication, while exploring the characteristics and properties of individual ionic compounds. Feedback on the first two iterations of this project was obtained by electronic surveys. The results revealed that the project succeeded in enabling students to appreciate the interconnectedness of various topics within the chemistry curriculum. It also supported the development of students' scientific communication skills and helped them realize the significance of these skills in a science context. Furthermore, it revealed the importance of concerted communication by the lecturers with the students to maintain the collaboration between the different disciplines.

AB  - Experiments using smartphones allow for teaching physics concepts in a fun and engaging way and including interdisciplinary approaches. The exploratory character of the experimental activities, along with the smartphones' embedded technologies, when applied in the high school classroom, also has the potential to awake the students' intrinsic motivation, contributing to more meaningful learning. Here, using two smartphones running free apps and a personal computer for data analysis, we present an experiment proposal to quantitatively study the acoustic Doppler effect in secondary schools. One of the smartphones acts as the sound source (SS) emitting a wave signal in a frequency range audible to the human being. The other one acts as the sound receiver (SR). We measured the Doppler frequency due to the relative movement between the smartphones and got good results with this frequency deviating about 1% from that one emitted by SS. This amount is large enough to be detected by SR and allows the teacher, quantitatively, to explain the physical phenomenon to the students.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted students' motivation for learning. As students return to schools in the post-pandemic era, their motivation for learning continues to deteriorate due to challenges in adapting to the new educational norms. This study aimed to enhance the motivation of secondary school students towards learning chemistry, particularly during the period when their motivation has tended to be low upon returning to regular schooling after the pandemic. To achieve this objective, the researchers developed and implemented a self-designed game-based learning approach called STEM-PT Traveler during lessons focused on the periodic table. STEM-PT Traveler incorporated elements of enjoyable learning and play, introducing an interdisciplinary perspective to periodic table lessons. The effectiveness of STEM-PT Traveler in improving motivation was compared to an alternative student-centred, non-game-based learning approach using an explanatory mixed-method design. Two intact classes from a public secondary school were randomly assigned to two groups--one group utilized the game-based learning approach (N = 45), while the other group employed the non-game-based approach (N = 46). The multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) findings from pre-test and post-test questionnaires administered before and after treatment revealed significant differences in overall motivation and in the subscales of intrinsic motivation, career motivation, and self-efficacy. Non-significant differences were observed for grade motivation and self-determination. Qualitative interviews conducted with both groups after the treatment provided additional insights into the questionnaire outcomes. Specifically, during the interviews, students highlighted that the game facilitated engagement with the periodic table elements due to their intrinsic value. Additionally, the game provided a career perspective and instilled a belief that excelling in chemistry is instrumental. This study suggests that a game-based approach is an effective alternative to the predominantly used teacher-centred teaching of the periodic table and advocates for the integration of interdisciplinary perspectives into lessons on the Periodic Table.

AB  - There is widespread misuse of statistics in research, particularly in the life sciences, which is one of the contributing factors to reproducibility concerns in research. However, the formal quantitative training that life sciences research trainees receive is often quite limited. Our survey of statistics requirements in undergraduate life sciences programmes offered by the top research-intensive universities in Canada, the U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities, confirmed that training in statistics tends to be limited and more general in nature. To help raise awareness and address these limitations, this paper shares findings of this statistics requirements survey and describes the evidence-based framework for a second-year undergraduate course at the University of Toronto, which was introduced to integrate statistics instruction with the life sciences research process. We hope these insights will inform future quantitative course offerings, and ultimately, better prepare students to effectively engage with statistics in life sciences research.

AB  - This activity is designed to illustrate an application of resistive forces in the introductory physics curriculum with an interdisciplinary twist. Students are asked to examine images of riverbed boulders after a flood and estimate the water flow that was needed to push the boulders downstream. The activity provides an opportunity for students to gain an understanding of the physics of natural phenomena with applications to environmental science and environmental engineering, to gain a stronger appreciation for physical modeling and estimation, and to become "environmental detectives"!

AB  - Integrated STEAM instruction continues to be a major focus of K-12 education. In effort to better understand STEAM education, we reviewed existing frameworks for implementing integrated STEAM in classrooms. We found that existing frameworks largely focused on the lens of the teacher, thus leaving the student perspective of STEAM learning experiences out of conversations centered on both research and practice. The purpose of this theoretical paper is to center STEAM education on students' rights, obligations, and duties within integrated STEAM instruction as a way to refine understanding of students' positions in STEAM learning experiences. We use theoretical considerations and evidence to explore new ways for transdisciplinary STEAM to be conceptualized from a student perspective. We conclude with considerations and implications for future STEAM education research.

AB  - This paper, presented in three parts, overviews the current understandings of the Earth System and the relatively recent interdisciplinary field of Earth System Science (ESS) from a school education perspective. The representation of ESS in the Australian Curriculum is explored through the Cross Curriculum Priority area of Sustainability and the Australian Curriculum: Science (F-12), although the focus is up to Year 10. Initially the most current ESS framework and concepts (Steffen et al. 2020) are introduced (Part I). In the first of two follow-up journal articles an analysis of the Sustainability Cross Curriculum Priority area and the Australian Curriculum: Science indicated that several key ESS understandings and system-thinking skills were present. How the most current ESS understandings and abilities could lead to a far deeper understanding of the Earth System are then considered and those that may need more attention from students and teachers are highlighted (Part II). The final article outlines several research-informed pedagogies to help learners develop more scientific understandings of the Earth System, and appropriate related abilities (Part III). These Earth System goals and pedagogies needed to be considered in the ACARA review of the Australian Curriculum: Science and the Sustainability Cross Curriculum Priority area -- to that end, this paper was submitted to the appropriate committees. We believe the suggested ESS additions and emphases could comprise one pathway toward a more comprehensive and confident Earth System literacy and a stronger engagement in the Earth and other sciences at every school level, and to the curriculum as a whole. Better-informed, sustainability decision-making and actions by students as today's, and tomorrow's, citizens is the hoped-for outcome.

AB  - Since 2009, the U.S. National Science Foundation Directorate for Biological Sciences has funded Research Coordination Networks (RCN) aimed at collaborative efforts to improve participation, learning, and assessment in undergraduate biology education (UBE). RCN-UBE projects focus on coordination and communication among scientists and educators who are fostering improved and innovative approaches to biology education. When faculty members collaborate with the overarching goal of advancing undergraduate biology education, there is a need to optimize collaboration between participants in order to deeply integrate the knowledge across disciplinary boundaries. In this essay we propose a novel guiding framework for bringing colleagues together to advance knowledge and its integration across disciplines, the "Five 'C's' of Collaboration: Commitment, Collegiality, Communication, Consensus, and Continuity." This guiding framework for professional network practice is informed by both relevant literature and empirical evidence from community-building experience within the RCN-UBE Advancing Competencies in Experimentation-Biology (ACE-Bio) Network. The framework is presented with practical examples to illustrate how it might be used to enhance collaboration between new and existing participants in the ACE-Bio Network as well as within other interdisciplinary networks.

AB  - Research investigating how the brain develops and learns profoundly impacts education. Understanding the brain mechanisms responsible for learning and memory and the factors that influence them, such as age, environment, emotions, and motivation, can transform educational strategies by contributing to the development of programs that optimize learning. Including neuroscience education in teachers' training requires teaching them a multidisciplinary approach to science, which presents a challenge. Furthermore, the potential educational advances from the incorporation of neuroscience into teachers' training are hindered by significant obstacles such as translating research into the classroom; this includes the spread of neuromyths and the products, practices, and programs based on them. Our group has 9 years of experience in developing courses for training teachers. However, in 2020 the world faced the COVID-19 pandemic, which imposed on society a new way of carrying out its daily activities, including teaching. This study reports the experiences of our group as we developed the ninth edition of the Neuroscience Applied to Education teachers' training in an online format that included synchronous and asynchronous activities. Sixty teachers participated in the course. The synchronous meetings lasted 1.5 h/wk and addressed different themes: neuroscience and education, neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neurobiology of learning and memory, factors that interfere with learning, and pedagogical innovation. According to the teachers' perceptions, the course was fundamental for them in terms of acquiring new knowledge about neuroscience. Everyone agreed on the possible applicability of the concepts covered to improve their pedagogical practice and teaching environment.

AB  - I first met Jim Greer at the NATO Advanced Study Institute on Syntheses of Instructional Sciences and Computing Science for Effective Instructional Computing Systems in 1990 in Calgary, Canada. It was during this meeting that I came to realize that Jim was one of those rare individuals that could help "translate" computer science principles to non-computer scientists. Through this translation process new knowledge could be developed through interdisciplinary partnerships with psychology and education. In this paper, I describe the manner in which Jim influenced my own journey in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Education. In particular, he has influenced two directions in my research, one direction is the manner in which technology can influence teaching and learning for individuals working solo. The second direction is how technology can influence teaching and learning through collaboration. In both situations I will discuss Jim Greer's influence on my research with respect to learner modelling, educational data mining, and visualization. In the context of solo learning, I will discuss BioWorld, a system that fosters clinical reasoning in medical students, emphasizing the role of student modeling and educational data mining for fostering and identifying performance differences in clinical reasoning. In the context of collaborative learning, I will discuss HOWARD, an online platform for supporting small group problem-based learning in medical students. In particular, I will discuss the role of learning analytics used in a pedagogical dashboard to foster teachers' interpretation of group learning.

AB  - This paper introduces a new pedagogic approach to the teaching of political science. In engineering education, the Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate (CDIO) pedagogy provides an active, experiential learning experience, structuring learning around four key phases in product development. Applied to the undergraduate Politics and International Relations (IR) classroom, this pedagogical innovation in learning, teaching and assessment is adapted to policy development. This design-build-test pedagogical approach has been highly successful in engineering education, supporting students to be "industry-ready engineers" on graduation. Results across 3 cohorts suggest that this pedagogical innovation is also highly successful when transferred to Politics and IR, supporting political science students develop "society-ready" attitudes, attributes and skills, greatly enhancing the student experience and increasing their attainment, engagement, inclusion and wider graduate outcomes. Civic engagement and the ability to understand and respond to a range of stakeholders are also improved. This paper presents the pedagogy and the module to which it was applied as a case study, before highlighting opportunities for political science educators to transfer the pedagogy to their own teaching context.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research from the learning sciences has helped us understand a great deal about the way that humans learn, and as a result we now have an improved understanding about how best to teach and train people. This same body of research must now be used to better inform the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies for use in education and training. In this paper, we use three case studies to illustrate how learning sciences research can inform the judicious analysis, of rich, varied and multimodal data, so that it can be used to help us scaffold students and support teachers. Based on this increased understanding of how best to inform the analysis of data through the application of learning sciences research, we are better placed to design AI algorithms that can analyse rich educational data at speed. Such AI algorithms and technology can then help us to leverage faster, more nuanced and individualised scaffolding for learners. However, most commercial AI developers know little about learning sciences research, indeed they often know little about learning or teaching. We therefore argue that in order to ensure that AI technologies for use in education and training embody such judicious analysis and learn in a learning sciences informed manner, we must develop inter-stakeholder partnerships between AI developers, educators and researchers. Here, we exemplify our approach to such partnerships through the EDUCATE Educational Technology (EdTech) programme.

AB  - Picturebooks offer powerful supports for teaching diverse content across different curriculum areas. Research and curriculum resources document their use in inquiry-based education practices, particularly in relation to science and philosophy. There is, however, little theoretical analysis of this use or cross-curricular comparisons. Applying a systematic literature review process, this paper examines existing empirical research on the use of picturebooks in formal inquiry-based education contexts. The analysis considers the context in which the picturebooks were used, including curriculum context and class level, the role played by the picturebooks in the inquiries and the value ascribed to the use of picturebooks. The review proposes a framework for understanding and contrasting the varying roles played by picturebooks in inquiry-based education approaches. This framework involves seven uses: invitations, provocations, mentors, models, resources, touchstones and destinations. Varying benefits are attributed to the use of picturebooks, including their practicality, inclusivity, complexity, aid to cognitive learning, emotional engagement and association with child readers. These benefits emphasise both the accessibility and the complexity of picturebooks. The review proposes that inquiry approaches should attend to picturebook form and content and the interdependency of the two. The review's analysis supports extended use of picturebooks across the curriculum, including in history, geography, citizenship and science education, as well as in interdisciplinary approaches.

AB  - Grounded in an indigenous holistic worldview and borrowing from the four Rs (values of relationships, responsibility, reciprocity, and redistribution), this article supports the inclusion of translational science and the integration of core metacompetencies into social work doctoral education as innovations in the field of social work science. The author argues that these innovations will enhance the ability of social-work-trained researchers to serve on transdisciplinary research teams, which are necessary to address complex metaproblems found in the natural world. Further, the author asserts that transdisciplinary scientific integration is helpful to social work science, as it builds awareness and appreciation of social work scholarly inquiry, promotes the inclusion of social work values in scientific research, and helps erode the scientific hierarchy that has traditionally existed between the natural and social sciences. By leveraging personal experiences in transdisciplinary education, the author offers a conceptual framework for innovations in doctoral education.

AB  - The current initiatives at European level urge more emphasis on the implementation of inquiry-based science education (IBSE). Although there are existing studies on the effect of IBSE on understanding science, fewer attempts have been made regarding the development of various inquiry skills. In this research, a model of consistent implementation of inquiry activities across the three subjects of mathematics, physics and informatics was developed and its efficacy with regard to selected inquiry skills development was examined. In order to evaluate the efficacy, a test assessing the level of inquiry skills development was designed. This test was taken by 300 high school students both before and after experimental teaching. In between students were exposed to coherent and intentional multidisciplinary inquiry-based learning within a period of approx. four months. The results showed a statistically significant increase on test scores that is gender independent, however the class specialization played a significant role. The results indicate that the designed model of coactive IBSE implementation is efficacious for inquiry skills development and therefore applicable in school practice.

AB  - While many university students take science courses in multiple disciplines, little is known about how they perceive common concepts from different disciplinary perspectives. Structure-property and structure-function relationships have long been considered important explanatory concepts in the disciplines of chemistry and biology, respectively. Fourteen university students concurrently enrolled in introductory chemistry and biology courses were interviewed to explore their perceptions regarding 1) the meaning of structure, properties, and function; 2) the presentation of these concepts in their courses; and 3) how these concepts might be related. Findings suggest that the concepts of structure and properties were interpreted similarly between chemistry and biology, but students more closely associated the discussion of structure-property relationships with their chemistry courses and structure-function with biology. Despite receiving little in the way of instructional support, nine students proposed a coherent conceptual relationship, indicating that structure determines properties, which determine function. Furthermore, students described ways in which they connected and benefited from their understanding. Though many students are prepared to make these connections, we would encourage instructors to engage in cross-disciplinary conversations to understand the shared goals and disciplinary distinctions regarding these important concepts in an effort to better support students unable to construct these connections for themselves.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the formulation of science education curriculum in Indonesian Islamic universities through an integrated paradigm of science and religion. This study used literature review method to form a knowledge metaphor. Because this integration pattern covered philosophical, methodological, material, and strategic levels, it could not be normatively measured. The integrated paradigm of science and religion should be implemented in an interdisciplinary integrated curriculum. Both science and religion should be concentrically distributed to distinction courses to well-formulate the integrated curriculum.

AB  - Writing studies and writing center scholars have recently focused much- needed attention on how graduate student writers are taught, mentored, and supported. This scholarship also points to a persistent and stubborn conundrum: Graduate students must write their way into disciplinary belonging, yet most advisors lack a language for, or even awareness of, the specialized practices and tacit expectations shaping written discourse in their fields. While graduate student-serving writing centers help fill this writing-support gap, a reliance on English and humanities graduate students for staff reproduces a status quo in which the genre awareness and rhetorical vocabulary needed to mentor advanced academic writers are neither widely distributed nor recognized and valued. This essay offers the counter example of a graduate writing center whose consultants hail primarily from master's and doctoral programs in the sciences and social sciences. Using feminist social reproduction theory to examine this case study of one graduate writing center, the authors explore how multidisciplinary staffing resists the enclaving of writing process and rhetorical knowledge and points to a future in which the responsibility for mentoring graduate student writers is visible, valued, and shared.

AB  - The Catalyst Scholarship Program at Hunter College of The City University of New York (CUNY) was established with a four-year award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to fund scholarships to 40 academically talented but financially disadvantaged students majoring in four disciplines of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Scholarships were awarded to students in their junior or senior years majoring in computer science, geosciences, mathematics and physics to create two cohorts of students that spend a total of four semesters in an interdisciplinary community. The program included mentoring of undergraduate students by faculty and graduate students (peer-mentoring), a sequence of three semesters of a one-credit seminar course and opportunities to engage in research activities, research seminars and other enriching academic experiences. The program resulted in increased retention rates relative to institutional averages. This article describes the program, presents an overview of accomplishments and lessons learned, results of an assessment performed at the end of the fourth year of the award and a discussion of the process of establishing the program, from the original plans to its implementation at the institution.

AB  - The new degree in the Global Digital Humanities has been launched by the Faculty of Humanities and Education at Mondragon University on its new urban campus of Bilbao AS Fabrik. In a time of increasing urbanisation, universities must reflect on their relationship to surrounding cities and regions and develop ways to incorporate the urban and regional setting in their educational offerings. This BA shows the value of a transdisciplinary Action Research approach in facing complex social challenges and contributing to innovative social transformations in the city and region. The new campus also marks the beginning of an internal university process to develop mutual knowledge and greater permeability between different degree programmes in pursuit of a new organisational culture and practice that moves beyond narrow disciplinary models.

AB  - The development of communication and other soft skills among computer science students is not usually an easy task. Often, curricula focus on technical skills, with team projects being used for the improvement of communication skills. However, these teams usually comprise solely of computer science students. In this paper, we present a didactical methodology, called MIMI, which can be used in a short, intensive, programme for undergraduate students. This methodology has been implemented in real projects that have run annually since 2014. We advocate the use of team-based projects, with an important requirement that each team is both multidisciplinary and multinational. Additionally, the period of teamwork is short and intensive. A significant role in the project is given to team mentors. A mentor is a person, usually a university lecturer, who helps the team organize their work and tracks if the team's planned didactical results are being achieved. The program has proved to stimulate an increase of soft skills among the students who participated and, in particular, among the computer science students. The detailed description of our process will allow others to implement and build similar events in their university or company environments, the focus of which is a Multinational, Intercultural, Multidisciplinary & Intensive (MIMI) methodology approach.

AB  - To date, little research has been conducted on subject leadership by primary and/or junior secondary school heads of department (HODs). Unlike their senior secondary school counterparts, South African science HODs have the more complex task of leading in the multidisciplinary context of natural sciences (NS1). Such leadership comes in addition to the complications of role ambiguity, limited time and authority that are inherent in the HOD position. Using interviews and 360° multi-rater by four teachers and subject meeting observations, data were transcribed and categorised into themes that describe the instructional leadership practices of three NS HODs in South Africa. This paper is part of a more comprehensive PhD study. It suggests that providing leadership for NS teaching is more complex in practice than has been reported to date. In the context of increasing focus on accountability and national testing, the unintended consequence has been the neglect of the junior secondary NS teachers by the HODs. Furthermore, the data suggest that the HODs tend to limit their attention to areas of their own specialisation. The paper concludes with a conceptual framework that provides guidance for improving instructional leadership by the HODs in such multidisciplinary contexts, especially for the junior secondary school levels. It also recommends the restructuring of the conglomerate departments to make them more effective.

AB  - In the preferable educational future imagined here, the year 2030 has seen massive conceptual and structural change throughout systems of education. In the higher educational landscape envisioned only 10 years in the future, institutions of higher education have moved beyond the goals of valuing diversity, equity, and inclusion and beyond recognizing the importance of interdisciplinary curricula focused on sustainable problem-solving. It has embraced those as central tenets as it evolved into the nimble, culturally responsive, and innovative site of learning it aspired to be since the late 20th century. Our institutions of higher education are now designed to educate the adaptive creatives that all professions and future professions require (Aoun, 2017). The catalyst for this transformative change is examined, though not in predictive ways meant to determine new educational policy. It draws from the pandemic, protests, and elections (PPE) that came to define 2020, and it explores a potentially powerful metaphor from a science fiction short story by Alice Sheldon to encourage a reframing of current education praxis. The focus here is on a brief, creative exploration of a future educational scenario that need not be that far out of our aspirational reach.

AB  - The reason for the interest in the use of learning technologies that protect health in education is not to harm the physical and psychological health of learners in the process of training and education. After the creation of new types of innovative educational institutions, the knowledge load of learners increases, the increasing learning load can disrupt the normal development of students' central nervous system, vision, musculoskeletal system. This seriously harms the health of students. Only 5-15% of school leavers are healthy. To partially eliminate this problem, the project "Healthy Education-Healthy Nation" is being implemented in Azerbaijan to develop education. During the implementation of the project, its goals were expanded psycho-pedagogically in a local school. The goal was to develop students' thinking while maintaining their health. To achieve this goal, changes were made in the learning process: (1) The purpose of training was replaced by the purpose of learning; (2) Active training was replaced by constructive learning; (3) The structure of the knowledge of programs is based on a complete and fuzzy model; and (4) Tasks that ensure the operational development of student thinking, price criteria were created to measure the level of development. The article reflected the work done within the project. [For the full proceedings, see ED626585.]

AB  - This meta-analysis evaluated how well learners' conceptual understanding, environmental attitudes, and pro-environmental behavior were improved by the Socio-Scientific Issues (SSI)-based approach based on the literature (2017-2021). The research analyzed various studies on the efficacy of SSI-based techniques, such as argumentation, case-oriented approaches, and problem-based learning. The findings showed a strong positive influence on learners' understanding of intricate environmental concerns and their propensity for sustainable conduct. While the study found that the SSI-based approach fosters critical thinking and involvement in several noteworthy ways, it also uncovered potential publication biases in certain aspects. Furthermore, the research stressed the necessity of context-specific strategies and interdisciplinary collaboration to improve the robustness and application of SSI-based interventions in climate change education. The results highlight how the SSI-based approach can cultivate proactive, environmentally conscientious, knowledgeable citizens ready to address urgent global concerns.

AB  - Storytelling via digital media can effectively spotlight pressing societal and environmental concerns. In Hawai'i, these issues encompass addressing climate change impacts and amplifying Indigenous viewpoints within academic contexts. This report discusses "Communicating Creativity," a course offered by the School of Communication and Information at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. This four-week summer intensive course was part of Na Ko'oko'o, a Hawaiian leadership program for Native Hawaiian students and other students with strong commitments to Native Hawaiian communities. Students enrolled in the course spent one week at the Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) on Moku o Lo'e, Kane'ohe Bay, O'ahu. The course aimed to guide students in creating media content (filmmaking) rooted in Hawaiian epistemologies and praxis, bridging Indigenous knowledge with Western scientific perspectives through art, creativity, and visual communication in order to promote interdisciplinary dialogue. Additionally, it featured "talk story" sessions with Native Hawaiian cultural practitioners and HIMB faculty and students, exploring the interface between traditional knowledge and conventional science. This report reflects on lessons learned during the course and underscores the potential of experiential learning to drive socio-ecological change.

AB  - This article is concerned with the emergence of the science-business (SB) profession and the role of the SB professional (SBP) in both academia and business. Transferring science to markets can take a variety of routes depending on the stage of development and the people and skill sets involved. An SBP may co-develop opportunities for exploitation as part of a team in a university or in the business world in a spin-off or a mature company. In both settings, the SBP connects with scientists and co-develops knowledge or technology into an exploitable commodity. The need for this type of professional was the starting point for a new curriculum: a 3-year bachelor's programme in science, business and innovation that integrates fundamental sciences (physics, chemistry, mathematics), life and health sciences, energy and sustainability sciences, business/social sciences, innovation and entrepreneurship. The authors provide the context and rationale for the development of the programme and discuss how it meets its objective to address a critical skills need in both academic and business sectors.

AB  - Despite scientific advances that have informed our understanding of reading acquisition and development, a profound gap exists between empirical findings and the implementation of evidence-based practices in the assessment and instruction of reading in school settings. The debate regarding the practical implications of the science of reading (SOR), and its implementation in authentic school settings is palpable. As researchers, practitioners, policymakers, parents, and other educational stakeholders engage in this latest version of the debate on how best to teach children to read, a familiar, almost cyclical, narrative has emerged. As an interdisciplinary group of researchers, who study diverse facets of reading development, assessment, and instruction, it is troubling how little the current and past debates have focused on processes that could ensure that the instructional experience students receive in classrooms is informed by existing science. Specifically, we contend that the persistent gap between SOR and its school-based implementation exists because the field has yet to invest in the appropriate methodologies and processes to develop an effective model of translational science. We argue not only that much can be learned from previous iterations of this debate but also that advances in translational science provide a framework for how to address the debate on SOR differently and more productively in the current climate. Thus, we propose a roadmap for translational science for SOR, acknowledging the breadth of work done in translational science in other fields and recognizing and describing the added complexities in the emerging field of translational science in educational settings.

AB  - An online chemistry of art course was developed for K-12 teachers enrolled in a Master of Education in Interdisciplinary STEM Education program. This course focused on the chemistry involved in the preparation of artists' materials, art, and the authentication of art and artifacts. The specific course topics addressed safety in creating art; the Shroud of Turin; art forensics; pigments, paints, and dyes; color and light; and clay, glazes, and ceramics. Course content, class discussions, and a hands-on art project were used to show teachers how to teach chemistry through art, so that they could do likewise in their classroom. Teachers were given time in the course to design two lessons relating chemistry to art, so that they would have immediately useable lessons. They were also given time in the last few weeks of the semester to reflect on what they had learned and to write a statement describing their future use of course material in the classroom. The design of this chemistry of art master's course is described.

AB  - Students majoring in non-STEM fields often identify introductory biology courses as irrelevant and overly rigorous. Resistance to enroll in a required general education science course, coupled with negative attitudes toward the subject, can adversely affect the academic performance of students; this can especially be present in students from under-represented minority groups. Therefore, instructors have to intentionally design a curriculum that overcomes these factors as they educate non-major students enrolled in introductory biology. BioArt, a learning community, was formed between introductory biology and introduction to graphic design courses to improve the attitudes and academic performance of students in the biology course at a Historically Black College and University (HBCU). The BioArt model incorporated a common theme, project-based learning, and opportunities for experiential learning. To measure outcomes, traditional examinations, non-traditional assessments, failure/withdraw rates, and student attitudes were evaluated. Using this model, introductory biology became less intimidating, more relevant, and improved academic success among freshman minority students. Thus, the BioArt model can be utilized as an intervention at different institutions of higher learning.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss the individuals' "roles", "responsibilities", and "routine activities", along with their "goals" and "intentions" in two different contexts--a school science context and a university research context--using sociological lenses. We highlight the distinct characteristics of both contexts to suggest new design strategies for STEM learning environments in school science context. We collected our research data through participant observations, field notes, group conversations, and interviews. Our findings indicate that school science practices were limited to memorizing and replicating science content knowledge through lectures and laboratory activities. Simple-structured science activities were a means to engage school science students in practical work and relate the theoretical concepts to such work. Their routine activities were to succeed in schooling objectives. In university research settings, the routine activities had interdisciplinary dimensions representing cognitive, social, and material dimensions of scientific practice. Such routine activities were missing in the practices of school science. We found that the differences between school and university research settings were primarily associated with individuals' "goals" and "intentions", which resulted in different social structures. In school settings, more authentic social structure can evolve if teachers trust their students and allow them to share the social and epistemic authorities through establishing mentorship. We do not expect school science students to perform the tasks of scientists in the same manner, yet the desired school science activities should include mentorship roles and interdisciplinary perspectives and encourage school science students to pursue unanswered questions without looking for the right answer.

AB  - It would be safe to say that nearly every student enrolled in college knows someone who has been impacted by cancer. After all, cancer killed nearly 8.2 million people worldwide in 2012 (International Agency for Research on Cancer, 2014). Using this fact as the impetus for change, we decided to make cancer the focus of a "transdisciplinary" (Marshall, 2014) collaborative effort to simulate a reciprocal-learning experience between undergraduate biology and visual art students attending a university in Southeastern Michigan. The goal of the 2015 project was to create an active and authentic collaboration utilizing the university visual arts and biology curricula. By engaging and connecting scientific and artistic critical thinking processes, we wanted to know: could we design a class structure that would enable collaborative teams of art and biology students to create a visual model that represents a hallmark of cancer designed so that the model could also stand alone on artistic merit? In other words, could cancer visualization be transformed into works worthy of gallery display while maintaining scientific accuracy? In this paper we discuss the planning, implementation, results, and impact this work has had upon the way we now envision transdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change is a complicated issue involving scientific data and analyses as well as political, economic, and ethical issues. In order to capture this complexity, we developed an interdisciplinary student and faculty collaboration by (1) offering introductory lectures on scientific and ethical methods to two classes, (2) assigning the same technical and opinion texts about anthropogenic climate change to both classes, and (3) coordinating multidiscipline discussions with students about their common reading assignments. Student learning was documented using identical pre- and postcollaboration surveys. We hypothesized that students would be better prepared to understand and engage in public debate about anthropogenic climate change if they were first taught to distinguish clearly between scientific and ethical claims. Our results from pre- and postcollaboration surveys support our hypothesis; as students showed an increased understanding of the distinction between science and ethics, they were better able to critically analyze popular articles and to develop their own questions about anthropogenic climate change. The results also suggest that our students were more prepared to think critically about scientific inquiry than about ethical inquiry regarding anthropogenic climate change.

AB  - Embedding Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) into chemistry curricula has become a best practice due to the overwhelming evidence that these experiences deepen students' content comprehension, improve students' problem-solving skills, and increase retention within the major. For these reasons, faculty are often encouraged to develop CUREs for their courses, which typically take a substantial amount of effort and administrative/financial support. To justify these efforts, one of the most cited benefits of CURE development for faculty specifically is that they can pilot research projects and publish data produced during CUREs in scientific publications. However, there is less evidence in the literature that these benefits commonly occur. Based on direct upper-level, interdisciplinary CURE development experience and a national survey of faculty across institution types, it is clear that translating CURE data into publishable science is quite challenging due to several common barriers. Barriers identified include the need for follow up data that must be generated by either the faculty or a research student, the lack of reproducibility of data generated by novice students, and the lack of faculty time to write the manuscripts. Additionally, institution type (private vs public non-PhD granting; non-PhD granting vs PhD granting), faculty rank, and CURE level (lower vs upper-level courses), among other factors, impacted the likelihood of publication of CURE data. Based on these results and experiences, best practices for maximizing positive outcomes for both students and faculty with regard to CURE design and implementation have been developed.

AB  - The pervasiveness of Computer Science (CS) in today's digital society and the extensive use of computational methods in other sciences call for its introduction in the school curriculum. Hence, Computer Science Education is becoming more and more relevant. In CS K-12 education, computational thinking (CT) is one of the abused buzzwords: different stakeholders (media, educators, politicians) give it different meanings, some more oriented to CS, others more linked to its interdisciplinary value. The expression was introduced by two leading researchers, Jeannette Wing (in 2006) and Seymour Papert (much early, in 1980), each of them stressing different aspects of a common theme. This paper will use a historical approach to review, discuss, and put in context these first two educational and epistemological approaches to CT. We will relate them to today's context and evaluate what aspects are still relevant for CS K-12 education. Of the two, particular interest is devoted to "Papert's CT," which is the lesser-known and the lesser-studied. We will conclude that "Wing's CT" and "Papert's CT," when correctly understood, are both relevant to today's computer science education. From Wing, we should retain computer science's centrality, CT being the (scientific and cultural) substratum of the technical competencies. Under this interpretation, CT is a lens and a set of categories for understanding the algorithmic fabric of today's world. From Papert, we should retain the constructionist idea that only a social and affective involvement of students into the technical content will make programming an interdisciplinary tool for learning (also) other disciplines. We will also discuss the often quoted (and often unverified) claim that CT automatically "transfers" to other broad 21st century skills. Our analysis will be relevant for educators and scholars to recognize and avoid misconceptions and build on the two core roots of CT.

AB  - This study aims to examine the effects of the "Unlocking Research & Innovative Capability" program for university teachers. A total of 80 teachers from the Abai Kazakh National Pedagogical University were enrolled. All participants were divided into groups based on their age and teaching experience. Data were collected via surveys. The proposed program was found to have different effects across groups. Young university teachers (28 to 35 years; teaching experience, 3 to 5 years) exhibited improvement in all research and innovative capability variables, ranging from 0.84 in Interdisciplinary Cooperation to 2.63 in Innovative Teaching. The same is true for early middle-aged university teachers (36 to 45 years; teaching experience, 5 to 10 years) who showed improvement ranging from 1.52 in Interdisciplinary Cooperation to 3.00 in Integration of Technology. Older middle-aged university teachers (46 to 55 years; teaching experience, 10 to 20 years) exhibited improvement in their Innovative Teaching, Research Practice, and Integration of Technology; yet, it did not exceed 1.85 points. Older university teachers (older than 56 years; teaching experience, 20 years) demonstrated minimal improvement in all dimensions. This study was conducted as part of governmental research on "Managing the Development of Research & Innovative Capability in the Research University Staff under the Participatory Management Model" launched by the RK Ministry of Education and Science (Project number: AR14872123). The study emphasizes the importance of empowering university teachers as key drivers of research, knowledge generation, and innovative teaching. The present findings can be used to cultivate a culture of innovation and research in academic institutions.

AB  - According to the Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act of 2014, literacy refers to "an individual's ability to read, write, and speak in English, compute, and solve problems [emphasis added], at levels of proficiency necessary to function on the job, in the family of the individual, and in society" (Title 2, §203). Yet, according to the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (2017), over half of American adults are ill prepared to solve problems that include: two or more steps or processes, interpret simple statistics and data, integrate two or more pieces of information, or use reasoning to compare and contrast information across print and digital texts. Because adults navigate their literate world with their own experiences, solving novel complex problems where background knowledge may be limited or inaccurate/biased (like many risk literacy frameworks/domains) is a particular challenge (Greenberg & Feinberg, 2018). Yet, in adult literacy education, how often do we consider explicitly teaching problem solving in risk domains? This kind of problem-solving skill is also referred to as risk literacy, or "the ability to evaluate and understand risk" (Cokely et al., 2018, p. 481) in the context of literacy events (Purcell-Gates et al., 2011). This research digest focuses on using an interdisciplinary approach to teaching risk literacy in adult literacy education settings by applying findings and recommendations from decision science research.

AB  - It has been charged that transformative learning theory is stagnating; however, theoretical insights from relational ontologies offer significant possibilities for revitalizing the field. Quantum physics has led to a deep revision in our understanding of the universe moving away from the materialism and mechanism of classical physics. Some scientists observe that this shifting view of reality is catalyzing a profound cultural transformation. They have also noted significant intersections between the New Science and North American Indigenous philosophies as well as Eastern mysticism, all relational ontologies. These intersections as well as the theory of agential realism of Karen Barad, feminist physicist, are used to propose a next generation of transformative learning theory, one that is embedded in ontologies of relationality. The author came to relational ontology through environmental and sustainability education. This fruitful cross-fertilization helps illuminate a transformative approach to sustainability education or transformative sustainability education--which has not yet been explicitly theorized. Relationality demands an ethical, ontological, and epistemological transformation. The six criteria that emerge in the overlap between quantum physics, living systems theory from ecology, and Indigenous philosophies can reframe our understandings of transformative education, particularly toward socially just and regenerative cultures, completing the work of unfinished justice and climate movements. Pertinent to adult educators, Naomi Klein (2014) asks, "History knocked on your door, did you answer?" (p. 466).

AB  - The researchers developed an Integrated Constructive Robotics in Education (ICRE) model that represents a pioneering framework designed to revolutionize educational landscapes by integrating robotics into pedagogical settings. This research introduces the ICRE model, elucidating its multifaceted dimensions and envisioning its profound impact on educational paradigms. The ICRE model emerges as a comprehensive framework that amalgamates constructivist principles with robotics technology, fostering an environment conducive to active, experiential learning. Anchored in constructivist pedagogy, the model accentuates hands-on, immersive experiences where students engage in designing, programming, and manipulating robots. This tactile engagement not only stimulates curiosity but also empowers students to witness direct outcomes, cultivating a profound sense of agency and ownership in their learning journey. Central to the ICRE model is its versatility, catering to interdisciplinary activities that transcend conventional disciplinary boundaries. By nurturing a deeper conceptual understanding and honing higher-order cognitive skills within Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) subjects, the model serves as a catalyst for holistic development. The transformative potential of the ICRE model extends beyond technical skill acquisition, encapsulating motivational, cooperative, and creative dimensions. It addresses gender disparities within STEM education, endeavoring to mitigate gaps in interest and skills. Furthermore, the ICRE model emphasizes the importance of teacher training, equity in access, and collaboration between educators, researchers, and industry professionals. This paper unfolds a detailed conceptual framework of the ICRE model, articulating its core principles, applications, and implications. It navigates through its developmental journey, positing future trajectories and recommendations for its sustained evolution.

AB  - Here, we present an interdisciplinary educational project intended for high school chemistry that is focused on the establishment of a mathematical model to describe the relationship between conductivity and concentration, while linking chemistry to mathematics with the help of computer software. The project was designed to help high school students engage in methods and comprehend advanced topics beyond the typical high school chemistry curriculum, as well as to resolve a problem that no single disciplinary perspective is able to solve. This project provided students with a simple method to build mathematical models, which could be used to help them discover the relationship between discrete experimental data and mathematical equations. A postinstructional survey showed that, after completing the project, more students knew how to construct mathematical equations that fit discrete data.

AB  - In this study, the effects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) focused Arduino practical activities on problem-solving and entrepreneurship skills were analysed using qualitative and quantitative methods. Also, the contribution of these activities to teacher candidates and their effects on the learning-teaching process were discussed by evaluating their views. The study group consisted of 31 final-year teacher candidates studying in the science teaching department of a university in Turkey. The quantitative findings reveal that STEM-focused Arduino practical activities have a positive effect on improving the problem-solving and entrepreneurship skills of teacher candidates. Their opinions also support these results. The teacher candidates stated that the practical activities contribute to their professional development, support the development of 21st-century skills such as problem-solving and creativity and positively affect the learning-teaching process. As a result, STEM-focused Arduino practical activities are of significance in terms of adopting an interdisciplinary approach to education following the requirements of the century and developing problem-solving, entrepreneurial and productive individuals.

AB  - Research suggests that systems thinking is beneficial to education and it has been proposed that training students using systems thinking techniques may enhance their abilities to understand and solve some of the global grand challenges that society currently faces as outlined by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, before systems thinking can be incorporated into chemistry education, the perceptions of the instructors who would adopt this framework must be investigated. Therefore, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 instructors from the Department of Chemistry at the University of York. Responses were analysed using both qualitative (framework method) and quantitative (Likert-style) techniques. The instructors expressed positive opinions of systems thinking as all participants stated that systems thinking techniques should be implemented into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum to some extent. Examples of anticipated advantages to integrating systems thinking into curricula include benefits to student learning, the facilitation of interdisciplinary teaching/learning, enhanced student employability prospects, and societal benefits. Research has suggested that curriculum reform is only successful with support from instructors and so these positive opinions of systems thinking from participants with expertise from a variety of areas within chemistry show great promise for future implementation.

AB  - Many countries and regions have reached a consensus to promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in the past decade. A body of studies have demonstrated that the design and organization of interdisciplinary teaching activities are important for the effective implementation of STEM education. So far, however, little attention has been paid to the taxonomy of teaching models in STEM education. This paper aims to propose a taxonomy based on the dimensions of learning outcomes (i.e., product-oriented and knowledge-oriented) and teaching process (i.e., forward teaching model and reverse teaching model) in STEM education. Through the intersection of the above two dimensions, four teaching models in STEM education have emerged, including project-based learning (PBL), reverse engineering (RE), scientific inquiry (SI), and troubleshooting/debugging (T/D). In addition, four cases are introduced to explain how these four teaching models operate in STEM education. The implications of this work for future research are also discussed. It is promising that the study will be valuable to enrich the current research, and shed light on the theory and practice of STEM education.

These demonstrate how the insights we gain by viewing a challenge through the multidisciplinary lenses of science, history, geography and politics can be woven into a competition for pirates and an adventure story on the high seas.

AB  - Background: The ongoing transformation of the interplay between human beings and nature calls for new ways of learning. Although established educational practices merging sciences and arts have been studied before, the focus has been mainly on science or technology-discipline-orientated aspects. More research is needed on the characteristics of learning that address nature and the biological through art-based practices. Methods: Utilizing a case study approach, a week-long multidisciplinary project developed around bioart-making, and implemented in a Finnish upper secondary school, was scrutinized. The main data consisted of transcribed participant interviews and textual and visual material from a project blog. The data were analyzed using qualitative theory-driven content analysis to describe and understand the cross-boundary processes and human-nature interactions taking place within the project. Findings: Bioart-making constituted as a boundary object bringing together different understandings of nature. Identification, coordination, reflection, and transformation processes on different levels emerged as a part of and as an outcome of bioart-making. In and through these, learners interacted with nature through intertwined events of material-experiential utilization, cognitive knowledge-building, emotional connecting, and philosophical reflection. Contribution: This paper advances the theoretical discussion on integrative art-based practices' potential, especially in relation to learning that addresses nature and the biological.

AB  - The underwater robot (UR) is an embodiment of interdisciplinary technologies, integrating underwater communication, machinery, marine science, computer science, and robotics. Although URs enable a highly engaging and exploratory construction that can foster children's engineering education and ocean literacy, little work has explored UR design and education for children. In this paper, we present a study using URs to engage children in exploring engineering, robotics, environmental science, and marine sustainability. We introduce ModBot, a modular UR-making toolkit for children that uses hardware blocks and software applications for UR creation. We describe a study with 31 children (ages 5-8; 16 girls and 15 boys) and report how they learned UR concepts such as buoyancy and balance through playing with the ModBot kit and creating their own URs. This study is intended to investigate how URs can be used to spark children's interest in water environments and make a connection to robotics by the creation of their own URs.

AB  - As a human-friendly system, the artificial intelligence (AI) robot is one of the critical applications in promoting precision education. Alongside the call for humanity-oriented applications in education, AI robotsupported precision education has developed into an active field, with increasing literature available. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze directions taken in the past in this research field to interpret a roadmap for future work. By adopting structural topic modeling, the Mann-Kendall trend test, and keyword analysis, we investigated the research topics and their dynamics in the field based on literature collected from Web of Science and Scopus databases up to 2021. Results showed that AI robots and chatbots had been widely used in different subject areas (e.g., early education, STEM education, medical, nursing, and healthcare education, and language education) for promoting collaborative learning, mobile/game-based learning, distance learning, and affective learning. However, a limited practice in developing true human-centered AI (HCAI)-supported educational robots is available. To advance HCAI in education and its application in educational robots for precision education, we suggested involving humans in AI robot design, thinking of individual learners, testing, and understanding the learner-AI robot interaction, taking an HCAI multidisciplinary approach in robot system development, and providing sufficient technical support for instructors during robot implementation.

AB  - The science of learning (SoL) has powerful contributions to make to both the production of knowledge about learning and to the ways in which this knowledge can be successfully mobilized into educational practice. However, as a multidisciplinary field, it also faces some challenges if it is to bridge the research-practice gap. Using Levin's (2013) conceptualization of knowledge mobilization, this paper will describe the challenges and promising approaches to effective research translation and frame existing approaches across three interacting domains of: (1) knowledge production; (2) knowledge use; and (3) knowledge mediation. It will then present a novel partnership approach developed by the Science of Learning Research Center at The University of Queensland, Australia--the Partner Schools Program (PSP). Drawing upon existing promising practices, the PSP brings together educators, researchers, and research brokers in partnership to transform research into contextually relevant applications.

AB  - This practitioner-based book provides different approaches for reaching an increasing population in today's schools - English language learners (ELLs). The recent development and adoption of the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects (CCSS-ELA/Literacy), the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, the C3 Framework, and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) highlight the role that teachers have in developing discipline-specific competencies. This requires new and innovative approaches for teaching the content areas to all students. The book begins with an introduction that contextualizes the chapters in which the editors highlight transdisciplinary theories and approaches that cut across content areas. In addition, the editors include a table that provides a matrix of how strategies and theories map across the chapters.

AB  - Children can see the Moon with the naked eye and often are curious about the Moon and other objects in the sky, like the Sun and the stars. However, there is sometimes disagreement in early childhood about whether studying space is appropriate for young children. This activities described in this article engaged children who had different learning preferences. Some children adored a creative make-your-own constellation, while others were drawn to a crater science investigation. In this article, the authors introduce a space science study--starting with how children's interests were at the core--outlining interdisciplinary links and including a detailed description of the making Moon craters activity. This study of space took place in a prekindergarten classroom with children ranging from 3 to 5 years of age, but could easily be adapted for older children. The lessons were part of a thematic unit on outer space that developed after the class had learned about weather.

AB  - This book starts with the premise that beauty can be an engine of transformation and authentic engagement in an increasingly complex world. It presents an organized picture of highlights from the 13th European Science Education Research Association Conference, ESERA 2019, held in Bologna, Italy. The collection includes contributions that discuss contemporary issues such as climate change, multiculturalism, and the flourishing of new interdisciplinary areas of investigation, including the application of cognitive neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and digital humanities to science education research. It also highlights learners' difficulties engaging with socio-scientific issues in a digital and post-truth era. The volume demonstrates that deepening our understanding is the preferred way to address these challenges and that science education has a key role to play in this effort. In particular, the book advances the argument that the deep and novel character of these challenges requires a collective search for new narratives and languages, an expanding knowledge base and new theoretical perspectives and methods of research. The book provides a contemporary picture of science education research and looks to the theoretical and practical societal challenges of the future.

AB  - Industrial drug discovery teams encompass scientists from multiple specialties and require participants to communicate effectively across disciplinary boundaries. In this paper, we present an undergraduate or graduate classroom simulation of this environment. Over a series of five workshops, student teams of mixed scientific backgrounds perform five iterations of the chemistry cycle of small molecule drug discovery. Students analyze physicochemical, structural, and (fictional) assay data and use these to design new compounds for testing. Simulated assay results are returned to students who use the information in the design of subsequent compounds. After workshop 5, each team selects a single lead compound, supported by a potential synthetic route, a portfolio of assay data, and logical scientific decision-making. Our exercise provides students with opportunities for hands-on student-responsive data handing, team-building, and technical knowledge acquisition--all within an industrially relevant scientific scenario.

AB  - The goal of this case study was to examine how a group of young children in a historically marginalized neighborhood in the northern part of the Netherlands perceived their engagement in an out-of-school, STEM community-based program aiming to enhance young children's interest and self-identification with science. We collected data through semi-structured interviews with eight purposefully selected children and analyzed those through a constant comparative approach and with the use of open coding strategies. The findings revealed specific aspects of the design of the program that were perceived as motivating and engaging: the integrated multidisciplinary approach to exploring scientific concepts and opportunities for active engagement and personally relevant science experimentation. The findings are offered alongside a set of recommendations for the design of out-of-school, community-based programs that aim to support young children's engagement with science.

AB  - Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses computer-based algorithms and methods to gain insights from large and often complex datasets. Data science, which includes Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Machine Learning (ML), has been credited with the promise to transform Health Professions Education (HPE) by offering approaches to handle big (and often messy) data.To examine this promise, we conducted a critical review to explore: (1) published applications of data science and ML in HPE literature and (2) the potential role of data science and ML in shifting theoretical and epistemological perspectives in HPE research and practice. Existing data science studies in HPE are often not informed by theory, but rather oriented towards developing applications for specific problems, uses, and contexts.The most common areas currently being studied are procedural (e.g., computer-based tutoring or adaptive systems and assessment of technical skills). We found that epistemic beliefs informing the use of data science and ML in HPE poses a challenge for existing views on what constitutes objective knowledge and the role of human subjectivity for instruction and assessment.As a result, criticisms have emerged that the integration of data science in the field of HPE is in danger of becoming technically driven and narrowly focused in its approach to teaching, learning and assessment. Our findings suggest that researchers tend to formalize around the epistemological stance driven largely by traditions of a research paradigm. Future data science studies in HPE need to involve both education scientists and data scientists to ensure mutual advancements in the development of educational theory and practical applications. This may be one of the most important tasks in the integration of data science and ML in HPE research in the years to come.

AB  - The study examined the use of quality teaching and learning resources and how these affect the teaching and learning of Integrated Science. A total of 172 randomly selected second year Senior High School (SHS) students and 25 Integrated Science teachers purposively sampled served as the subjects for the study within six districts in the Central Region of Ghana. Questionnaires were used to collect the students' and teachers' needed data. This study's key findings revealed a lack of teaching and learning materials and the stereotyped nature of Integrated Science teachers' methods of teaching. It was noted that access, selection and usage of good and quality teaching and learning materials and methods influenced learning outcomes of students in SHS Integrated Science. However, it was observed that both government and private school teachers used similar teaching methods in delivering the Integrated Science content. It was concluded that for successful teaching and learning of Integrated Science, the challenges should be addressed by SHS education stakeholders. As a result, the paper recommended possible solutions that would ameliorate the challenges hindering the teaching and learning of Integrated Science.

AB  - Background/Purpose: The integration of ChatGPT within higher education holds significant potential for enhancing learning through personalized, adaptive, and interactive educational experiences. This study's aims were to investigate how academic engagement with ChatGPT in higher education has evolved within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The objective was to identify key trends, benefits, challenges, and implications of adopting this technology in higher education systems across the region. Materials/Methods: This study employed a bibliometric analysis of publications indexed in the Scopus database, focusing on those related to ChatGPT and higher education. VOSviewer software was used to generate network and overlay visualizations of key research topics and their co-occurrence patterns over time. Constructivist learning theory was applied as the theoretical framework to contextualize the findings and explore how ChatGPT can be used to support personalized learning in higher education. Results: The analysis revealed that ChatGPT and artificial intelligence are central to the academic discourse on AI in higher education, particularly in GCC countries, with notable increases seen in research output over recent years. Key findings include the positive impact of ChatGPT on personalized learning and student engagement, as well as the growing focus on ethical concerns such as data privacy and bias. The study also identified strong interdisciplinary connections, with AI research in education intersecting with fields such as computer science, linguistics, and cognitive science. Conclusion: The findings suggest that ChatGPT is becoming increasingly relevant and influential in higher education, particularly in the GCC region, where its adoption aligns with ongoing educational reforms and technological advancements. However, addressing ethical challenges and ensuring equitable access to AI-driven tools are crucial in order to maximize the positive impact of ChatGPT on learning outcomes. The study provides valuable insights for educators, educational policymakers, and academic researchers on the effective integration of AI technologies within higher education.

AB  - This article illustrates how two teachers, a general educator and a special educator, used an interactive process in planning an interdisciplinary science unit for an inclusive Kindergarten classroom and how they addressed Universal Design for Learning (UDL) components. This planning process included capitalizing on each teacher's knowledge and expertise, layering resources from within their learning community iteratively over time (not a one-meeting-and-done effort), and harnessing the power of multimodal, interdisciplinary learning. This iterative process was key in allowing teachers to evaluate student engagement and layer in UDL components to address evolving students' needs.

AB  - This paper discusses the potential of the creation and analysis of historical networks as didactic strategies in science education. To this end, we first argue the importance of combining critical approaches of the history of science with historical network research. This will be followed by a report of an empirical experiment in which the history of science high school students created historical networks of human and non-human objects using the ePistolarium platform in combination with other network visualization tools (Available at http://ckcc.huygens.knaw.nl/epistolarium/. Accessed on November 20, 2018). Finally, following this empirical exploration, we will explain how the creation of historical networks are in line with academic recommendations in Brazil, encouraging the development of projects by students and also using historical collections and computational tools, interdisciplinary teaching methodologies and approaches that can support the formulation of reflective questions about science. Negotiations between small groups of students that shape their historical networks in combination with mediations by the teacher in plenary meetings are the main characteristics of this educational project. Networks were made from students' observations, their research and their presentations. In successive meetings, the whole process was evaluated and the contribution of these historical networks to the history of science was discussed. Although we argue that historical networks can be a powerful instrument of collaborative learning, it will be demonstrated that their creation requires the supervision of teachers to prevent manipulations of historical data and biased interpretations hereof.

AB  - Mathematical and scientific knowledge are integral to preparing our population to be actively engaged and responsible citizens. Science and mathematics education, however, has mainly focused on concepts and skills detached from societal implications. In this paper we present an interdisciplinary international design research study in which we developed teaching and professional development materials connecting mathematics and science education to citizenship education. We outline the design research process, its theoretical basis as well as the design products. The study shows that it is indeed possible to develop such approaches supporting active citizenship and thereby the development of 21st century skills in mathematics education, thus strengthening the role of mathematics education in the STEM field.

AB  - Approaching elective courses and courses on special topics in Chemistry can seem daunting at times, given the varied backgrounds of the students, together with the broad nature of topics. Often, institutions may give incentives for creating sustainability related course offerings, but knowing where to start and how to organize the information presents a challenge, as can tailoring the content and organization to the diverse experiences, interests, and majors of the students. Herein is described a layout to simplify such an endeavor as well as a sample organization of content and representative activities of an interdisciplinary course entitled "Perspectives on Plastic". The proposed curricular structure comprises two key components: a systems-based approach and unique, spiral-like scaffolding of material. The systems-influence allows for students to make real-world connections to the material being taught in class, while the spiraling structure of how material is taught provides students with meaningful connections between individual concepts by cycling back to the same content areas with more comprehensive knowledge each time. Combined, these curricular aspects foster a deeper, more fulfilling understanding of a scientific topic by creating a network of interconnected themes and ideas.

AB  - In 2000, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study was conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). It is a worldwide study of 15-year-old students' performance in mathematics, science and reading skills. The study showed relatively poor results for German students' scientific literacy (Prenzel et al., 2001). Although the 2009 PISA study reported that these competencies had improved, there is still a demand in the German education system for the development of methods to improve student performance (Rönnebeck et al., 2010). In the light of this evidence, interdisciplinary teaching (IdT) is often considered to be a useful strategy. IdT is acknowledged as a form of education that is able to impart cross-linked and relevant knowledge to students beyond the bounds of individual disciplines (Ministerium für Schule und Weiterbildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen, 1999). This article presents two studies examining IdT's effectiveness in biology and physical education (PE) in the sixth form. This realisation of IdT has not yet been investigated by other studies. The two studies intend to answer the question "Does IdT support the students' skills and knowledge concerning practical application and problem solving better than subject-based teaching?" The first study was conducted with six courses and 141 students, and the second study had six courses and 206 students. Both were conducted for 3 hours a week for a period of 6 weeks. In order to compare effectiveness with that of regular lessons, the studies used a so-called test and control group design. This means that a test group took part in IdT lessons as mentioned above while a control group of peers received "regular" teaching as separate subjects. The effect of different lessons on the students' skills could then be compared. The findings of the studies indicate that there was an improvement in the test groups' knowledge, transfer and problem-solving skills as well as assessment skills in comparison with the control groups. Thus, the effectiveness of IdT units in biology and PE was demonstrated in these two studies. The realisation of the IdT concept presented in this article may function as an inspiration for teachers to use cross-disciplinary teaching units in their everyday teaching.

AB  - The article presents the authors' experiences in designing a storytelling map guide for the botanical gardens of Palacký University, Czech Republic, from a pedagogical point of view. The authors introduce a three-pillared original concept. The overall educational contribution is a combination of educational, thematic and technological knowledge which supports successful engagement in the storytelling process. In the Storytelling Map Guide for the Botanical Gardens and Greenhouse Collections, the first pillar represents the educational aspect. Botanical knowledge and familiarity with the study area, i.e. the Palacký University Botanical Gardens, represent the thematic pillar. The technological pillar is covered by knowledge of software, cartography and application design skills, including an overview of contemporary storytelling applications. Finally, the educational impact and benefits to students of geoinformatics are discussed.

AB  - The implementation of theatre as a didactic tool for teaching science provides a new perspective on the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in the construction of meaningful learning experiences. Gamification and collaborative work are functional strategies to teach scientific concepts in a creative way. However, there are still conceptual issues about spatial thinking that are difficult for students to understand owing to the lack of visualization of objects and their development through a characteristic chronicle. Here we show an innovative way to unifying science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) careers through the development of an interactive theatrical play inspired by "The Little Prince" novella, to promote a culture of integration of science, theatre and literature. One of the more significant findings to emerge from this study is that the didactic strategies used are key ingredients in order to design an unique theatre play based on a link between history of atomic models and literature towards full understanding of spatial macroscales and microscales thinking. Due to the successful in the qualitative assessment results, we are devising to continue exploring the use of these didactic strategies to achieve an integrated and greater impact on students' learning processes.

AB  - The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is a promising drug target due to its functional role as a catalytic dyad in mediating proteolysis during the viral life cycle. In this study, experimentally proven 14 HIV protease peptides were screened against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Fourteen middle and high school "student researchers" were trained on relevant computational tools, provided with necessary biological and chemical background and scientific article writing. They performed the primary screening via molecular docking and the best performing complexes were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations. Molecular docking revealed that HIP82 and HIP1079 can bind with the catalytic residues, however after molecular dynamics simulation only HIP1079 retained its interaction with the catalytic sites. The student researchers were also trained to write scientific article and were involved with drafting of the manuscript. This project provided the student researchers an insight into multi-disciplinary research in biology and chemistry, inspired them about practical approaches of computational chemistry in solving a real-world problem like a global pandemic. This project also serves as an example to introduce scientific inquiry, research methodology, critical thinking, scientific writing, and communication for high school students.

AB  - Students in senior pre-university education encounter difficulties in the application of mathematics into physics. This paper presents the outcome of an explorative qualitative study of teachers' beliefs about improving the transfer of algebraic skills from mathematics into physics. We interviewed 10 mathematics and 10 physics teachers using a semi-structured questionnaire that was based on an algebraic transfer problem. Almost all teachers acknowledged this transfer problem and considered it to be important. We found a continuum of teachers' beliefs about aspects influencing transfer, including beliefs on improving this transfer. Together with identified improvement aspects about coherent mathematics education, these may help reduce physics teachers' frustrations who spend extra time on re-teaching mathematics. Teachers think that transfer does not happen, because students see both subjects as separate disciplines. Contrary to most physics teachers, most mathematics teachers do not feel the need to collaborate with physics teachers. We found two extreme, opposite beliefs about the transfer of algebraic skills into physics. An intermediate group believes that only an integrated approach can solve the transfer problem. Some of the teachers' beliefs could be organised into a beliefs system. Further research could investigate to which extent such beliefs systems exist and which beliefs these contain.

AB  - Purpose: We intent to provide a comprehensive picture of Hungarian social science education, to review the constituents of social science literacy, a systematic analysis of the curriculum and its changes since 1989 and of the available research in this field. Design/methodology/approach: The findings are based on the analysis of educational documents (e. g. curricula) and the review of the research publications in the field. Findings: Social science education is cross-curricular in Hungary. Among the different knowledge fields history has a decisive and dominant role. Other social science topics are mostly abandoned in everyday teaching practice. There is a growing centralization of the educational arena (e.g. government approved limited number of textbooks) and a growing emphasis on national identity and patriotism and a decreasing emphasis on Europe. The cross-curricular nature of social science education would require well trained teachers who are able to think critically and in a complex way themselves, however teacher training and classroom practice also support the hegemony of history teaching.

AB  - Ireland's government placed a renewed focus on the teaching and learning of numeracy with the publication of a national strategy in 2011. Whole-school planning for numeracy was already a requirement for disadvantaged schools also known as Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) in Ireland. This single site case study explored how a disadvantaged school was teaching numeracy across the curriculum. It was discovered that teachers were unclear about the difference between numeracy and mathematics. Teachers' life experiences of mathematics shaped their views towards numeracy. Leadership played a role in shaping teachers' views of the importance of numeracy. Whilst all teachers could see the relevance of teaching numeracy in their subject area, the majority were unaware of what the school improvement plan for numeracy contained. The findings suggest the need for teachers to understand the concept of numeracy, the need for professional development to address this, in addition to developing teachers' identities and pedagogical practices in this area. Schools need to consider how leadership can put support in place to enable teacher learning. Policymakers need to consider and distinguish between mathematics and numeracy, and support schools' engagement with cross-disciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to embedding numeracy across the curriculum.

AB  - Attitudes towards science and scientific perspectives in the future depend on early childhood science experiences. Preservice teachers who are provided with the opportunity to develop positive attitudes and self-efficacy towards science teaching before they enter professional life are more likely to help preschoolers develop positive attitudes towards science in their professional life. The aim of this 12-week study was, therefore, to determine the effect of a shadow play workshop on early childhood preservice teachers' self-efficacy beliefs and attitudes towards science teaching and to investigate their workshop experiences and application processes. This study employed an explanatory sequential mixed methods design. The sample consisted of 24 first-year early childhood preservice teachers. Quantitative data were collected using the Early Childhood Teachers' Attitudes Toward Science Teaching (TSAS) and the Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument (STEBI) and were analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test and the dependent sample t-test. Qualitative data were collected through focus group interviews and observations and were analyzed using content analysis. Results showed that shadow play had a positive effect on participants' self-efficacy beliefs and attitudes towards science teaching, indicating that shadow play is an interesting, fun, and effective material that can be used in early childhood science education to turn abstract concepts into concrete forms. Results were discussed with reference to literature, and recommendations were made for future studies.

AB  - Introduction: Since the 1990's, psychology has demonstrated a strong commitment to the full spectrum of human diversity (Vera & Speight, 2003). Statement of the Problem: However, psychologists from underrepresented backgrounds and diversity science (DS) remain marginalized in psychology (Syed & Kathawalla, 2020), which affects the ease with which instructors can integrate diversity into psychology curricula and student learning. Literature Review: Accordingly, this paper provides instructors with a potential solution for increasing the representation of marginalized psychologists (MP) and DS in psychology courses through the "Interview with a Psychologist" project. This project was informed by the interdisciplinary psychological literature highlighting the importance of representing marginalized communities and their experiences in the classroom. Teaching Implications: The "Interview with a Psychologist" project is adaptable across academic settings. When implementing the project, instructors should be mindful of the minority tax on psychologists, avoid tokenism, and self-educate on diversity-related issues. Conclusions: As psychology departments pursue institutional efforts to diversify the field of psychology, the "Interview with a Psychologist" project ensures MP and DS are well-represented in psychology courses.

AB  - This paper presents the description and analysis of a didactic experience involving the participation of a university and a community school, developed as part of the National Science and Technology Week, at a public university in northeastern Brazil. For this purpose, the use of learning station rotation enabled innovation in the teaching of physiology integrated with biochemistry and health education contents. The didactic approach consisted of creating a learning circuit comprising seven stations. The central theme of the stations emphasized physiology, with specific foci on biochemistry and cardiorespiratory and endocrine health. Each station provided unique activities related to the central theme, including a station concerning digital technology in physiology. The school students were divided into small groups (6 or 7 people) that rotated through the stations, with a total of 81 students visiting each station. A qualitative assessment was performed using a Likert-scale questionnaire to measure the level of satisfaction of the students. It was found that this didactic approach increased the receptivity of the students to the contents, facilitated student-teacher dialogue, and provided an excellent tool for establishing an interface between the university and the community school. Overall, 76.5% of the students rated the activity as excellent.

AB  - The Advanced Interdisciplinary Research Laboratory (AIRLab) is a team-based multidisciplinary research course that focuses on the development of advanced skills including critical thinking, limits of knowledge awareness, metacognition, autonomy, professional capacity, and decision making in complex environments. For many students, AIRLab represents a first attempt at autonomous research, and as such, instructors emphasize teamwork skills development by way of the Kolb Learning Style Inventory and Agile project management techniques necessary for effective research progress. Recent AIRLab course refinements--by way of the introduction of weekly reflection reports, a new digital project management platform, a revised course marking scheme with greater focus on teamwork contributions, and the inclusion of the Earth Science discipline--has improved student learning and driven the course into new directions of interdisciplinary research. In this case, a novel decay-monitoring vessel was designed, permitting for continuous, multifaceted investigations of decay processes that govern fossilization.

AB  - University faculty are called upon to address complex, contemporary problems using interdisciplinary approaches. But do appointment, reappointment, promotion, and tenure (ARPT) criteria reflect and reward this fundamental change in the nature of scholarly inquiry? We conducted a content analysis of ARPT criteria at one university to determine how interdisciplinary work is valued across disciplines and over time. We found noteworthy differences between colleges and disciplines: generally, creative disciplines placed higher value on individual contributions, while the sciences supported interdisciplinary work. The emphasis on interdisciplinary work over time increased in only a few disciplines, as criteria became more current.

AB  - Biocompatible and biodegradable block copolymers composed of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and aliphatic polyester are a class of promising biomaterials. Herein, a teaching experiment was designed to furnish undergraduates with a reliable method to synthesize an amphiphilic poly([epsilon]-caprolactone)-PEG-poly([epsilon]-caprolactone) (PCL-PEG-PCL) triblock copolymer via ring-opening polymerization of [epsilon]-caprolactone using PEG as the macroinitiator and diphenyl phosphate as the green organocatalyst; the concentrated solution of synthetic polymer in water was then demonstrated as an injectable thermogel with a sol-gel transition upon heating. Ten students serving as volunteers successfully synthesized PCL-PEG-PCL copolymer, and then analyzed their specimens using various techniques including proton-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction and learned the principles of instruments. Finally, students prepared an aqueous polymer solution, and observed its interesting spontaneous physical gelation upon heating via the tube-inverting approach and dynamic rheological analysis. The experimental features captured the students' attention and made them more enthusiastic participants. This newly designed teaching experiment afforded senior undergraduates an excellent opportunity to consolidate basic concepts and principles in books with practical experimental sessions in the field of polymer chemistry, analytical chemistry, and materials science.

AB  - Resilience is understood as interactive processes that strengthen the individual and the family in the face of the demands of adversity or vulnerable situation. Resilience is fostered from a psychopedagogical approach when practices are developed that assist in facing challenges positively, having life projects and developing academic potentialities. Thus, the objective of this systematic review of the literature is cartography programs that promote resilience in children, adolescents, or youths who are facing a challenging condition, such as a disease or disability. The PRISMA declaration was used to guide this systematic search. The databases consulted were Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCOhost, ERIC and Dialnet Plus. Open access articles were selected between 2016 and 2021. The selection resulted in 15 educational programs. The results indicate that there are several models for building resilience, such as ecosystem, family, community, and academic models. In conclusion, interdisciplinarity is a cross-cutting axis for enhancing resilience in vulnerable settings.

AB  - Climate change is one of the most critical problems facing citizens today. Chemistry faculty are presented with the problem of making general chemistry content simultaneously relevant and interesting. Using climate science to teach chemistry allows faculty to help students learn chemistry content in a rich context. Concepts related to electromagnetic radiation and gases can be taught using an understanding of climate change and how greenhouse gases work. However, it would be important to know the level of prior knowledge that the students bring to the course and their confidence in that knowledge. Thus, a two-tiered instrument was developed to measure student understanding of climate change, the behavior of gases, and the mechanism of radiative forcing by greenhouse gases. The instrument was implemented iteratively at two institutions to allow for revision and replication. The final form of the instrument may be used in general chemistry classes or interdisciplinary courses to shape and guide instruction.

AB  - A special topics course combining two relevant and contemporary themes (forensic DNA analysis and illicit drug detection) was developed to stimulate student enthusiasm and enhance understanding of forensic science. Building on the interest of popular television shows such as "CSI" and "Breaking Bad," this course connects essential concepts in biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, organic chemistry, and general chemistry with criminal justice studies to kindle student interest using the forensic science theme. Available to students in criminal justice or natural science majors, the forensic science theme is the focus as students participate in interdisciplinary activities and discussions while exploring fundamental principles used to solve crimes. Requiring critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, the collaboration of students of different academic focus leads to the debunking of myths surrounding both police and forensic scientists, while developing an awareness of how law enforcement and scientists work together in reality.

AB  - In late 2013, Canada's national newspaper reported that the implementation of Ontario's "differentiation policy framework" was the province's "boldest step yet to compel universities and colleges to make hard choices about how they spend their resources...a draft policy designed to stretch limited provincial dollars by narrowing some schools' missions" (Bradshaw 2013, para. two). As part of this controversial reform agenda, the province's Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities required each of its 44 post-secondary educational (PSE) institutions to submit a Strategic Mandate Agreement in response to a set of priority objectives outlined under this rubric of "differentiation" aimed at avoiding duplication and waste of public resources (Government of Ontario 2013; Brock University 2013). Within the authors' own university's agreement, the central organizing principle was chosen as "transdisciplinarity." Under "Areas of Institutional Strength" the university pledged to focus its resources "on transdisciplinary community-based research with five new transdisciplinary hubs (Brock University and Ontario Ministry of Training, College and Universities 2014, 7). In response to these developments, this article presents a secondary analysis from a large, qualitative dataset collected during a two-year critical ethnography (Mitchell and Moore 2015). The study focused on transdisciplinarity as an organizing principle for educational reform and for researching sustainability science partnerships. The purpose was to investigate how this 21st century paradigm was being understood and deployed by key stakeholders.

AB  - "Science and Children" routinely addresses the challenges teachers face in integrating the "Common Core State Standards" ("CCSS") alongside the "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS") (e.g., Forsythe, Jackson, and Contreras 2018; Sweetman and Sabella 2018). This article aims to extend this interdisciplinary conversation by sharing insights garnered from working closely with a kindergarten teacher who positioned video as a key informational text in her literacy and science instruction. In using an instructional approach similar to an interactive read-aloud, the authors explain how teachers can strategically pause scientific videos to invite/prompt interactions that help children comprehend scientific concepts/content as well as engage in children's "real life" literacy practices employed by scientists to learn about the natural world outside of school. Ultimately, three strategic instructional practices for pausing video in the science classroom are outlined: (1) pausing to learn/extend scientific vocabulary; (2) pausing to practice "reading"/describing the natural world; and (3) pausing to talk as scientists.

AB  - The Environmental Studies curricular area, taught at primary school level in Portugal, is a challenging context for curricular interdisciplinarity and the achievement of small-scale research and creative and innovative experiences, inside and outside the classroom. From that assumption, we present, under the master course of primary teacher training, a pedagogical intervention developed with a class of 1st and 3rd year primary school children. Our research focus was to understand to what extent the realization of experimental activities, in a class with children of different school levels, promotes the learning of science and affects other school skills. In this sense, we built and validated teaching resources whose goal is to promote science learning in the classroom, complementing this formal space with another educational context, a laboratory in a higher education institution in the same city. This study has shown that these teaching resources have provided the capacity to building interdisciplinary skills. Considering the attitudes and the affective component, it seems that this was a significant time in the children's personal and social education process, combined with active learning and socializing. We support the idea that science education in the early years of schooling is promoter of scientific literacy.

AB  - Purpose: The article explores the roles of war and violent conflicts in citizenship education. Approach: This is a theoretical article, drawing on literature from the interdisciplinary fields of political science, history, citizenship education as well as field studies in different learning arenas, war memorial sites- and museums. Findings: There are divergent roles of war in citizenship education, and the typology of five didactic perspectives illustrates the challenges concerning the types of citizenship it aims at. Narratives of war could produce and contribute to different forms of citizenship or even represent the opposite of the concept. Research limitations: Further empirical research is needed to develop knowledge on how to deal with war and conflict in educational practice, both in schools and other learning arenas. Practical implications: The article contributes to addressing and structuring the challenges and potentials of didactic approaches to war and violent conflict in citizenship education.

AB  - This article examines the opportunities and challenges for the use of ICT in science education in the light of science teachers' Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). Some of the variables that have been studied with regard to the TPACK framework in science classrooms (such as teachers' self-efficacy, gender, teaching experience, teachers' beliefs, etc.) are reviewed, and variations of the TPACK framework specific for science education are expounded upon. In the conclusion, some of the aspects of TPACK in science education that need to be addressed in future are indicated, including the development of subject specific ICT-based resources and e-learning platforms; training to develop science teachers' integrated skills for the implementation of ICT in their subject teaching; the importance of the continuous encouraging of science teachers' for their participation in inservice training related to the use of ICT; and the examination of the role of science teachers' TPACK in the developing of students' 21st century trans-disciplinary skills.

AB  - A responsibility of faculty at liberal arts colleges is to help students make connections between bodies of knowledge through interdisciplinary programs. One opportunity for faculty to create interdisciplinary learning opportunities is with a short-term study abroad course. The purpose of this article is to provide a model of an interdisciplinary course that brought together two disparate non-language disciplines--biochemistry and communication--to study human longevity in a short-term study abroad experience. Providing course design and three overarching guidelines as they bridged the science of diet and nutrition and relational communication, the authors offer an interdisciplinary model for those interested in creating more meaningful short-term study abroad courses.
