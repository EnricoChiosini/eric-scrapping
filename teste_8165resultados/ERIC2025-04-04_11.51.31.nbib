AB  - Adventure learning (AL) provides learners with opportunities to explore real-world issues through authentic learning experiences within collaborative online learning environments. This paper reports on an AL program, designed using Keller's ARCS motivational model of instructional design, which encompassed more than 3 million learners worldwide. The implementation of AL was examined through two experimental lenses: 1) how student motivation is related to student and teacher characteristics and 2) how student motivation is related to the ways in which the program was used within the classroom. Qualitative and quantitative measures were analyzed, including 21 teacher interviews and surveys of 228 respondents who used the online curriculum in 300 separate courses in grades K-10 ranging from social studies to science to history courses.

AB  - Both the demand for, and supply of, mental health information has increased across all sectors. Academic, public and special libraries must locate, evaluate and select materials that support consumer education, academic teaching, interdisciplinary research, and professional credentialing. Selectors must navigate disciplinary barriers to develop materials in an interdisciplinary field that includes not just psychology, psychiatry, social work, sociology, gerontology, medicine, and neurology, but also public policy and law.

AB  - Two instructional experiments used randomized, controlled designs to evaluate the effectiveness of writing instruction for students with carefully diagnosed dyslexia, which is both an oral reading and writing disorder, characterized by impaired "word" decoding, reading, and spelling. In Study 1 (4th to 6th grade sample and 7th to 9th grade sample), students were randomly assigned to orthographic or morphological spelling treatment but all students were taught strategies for planning, writing, and reviewing/revising narrative and expository texts. Both treatments resulted in improvement on three measures of spelling and one measure of composition. Morphological treatment resulted in better improvement in spelling pseudowords, whereas orthographic treatment resulted in better improvement in rate of reading pseudowords. In Study 2 (4th to 6th grade sample), students were randomly assigned to explicit language treatment (phonological working memory + phonological-orthographic spelling + science report writing training) or nonverbal problem solving treatment (virtual reality-based computer simulation, drawing maps, and building clay models). Both treatments used science content material and resulted in significant improvement in spelling and reading pseudowords (accuracy and rate). The surprising finding was that hands-on, engaging science problem solving led to more improvement in phonological working memory than did specialized phonological instruction. Only when spelling instruction emphasized orthography or morphology (Study 1) did real word spelling improve.

AB  - An interdisciplinary, semester-long project is presented in which students grow Cucumis sativus (cucumber) plants from seeds and study the ability of the plants to remediate a heavy metal from contaminated soil or water or both. Phytoremediation strategies for environmental cleanup are presented as possible alternatives to chemical based clean-up methods. The project is presented to the students as a general topic, and the students or instructor can choose which experimental variables to study. The results of the projects presented here focused on the remediation of Cr(III) from aqueous media and Cr(II), Cr(III), and Cr(VI) from contaminated soil. This project introduces students to the concepts of phytoremediation, the use of atomic absorption spectroscopy for the analysis of metals ions, and research methodology. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - Changes in the economy, nature, production and society together with increasing scientific and technological knowledge make demands of transforming school teaching in the field of technology education. This article analyses current trends in Finnish technology education. The aim of the article is to explore briefly the integration between Science and Craft education and some of the current practices in technology education in Finland. Finnish technology education can be characterized as a design approach that has evolved from the craft-oriented tradition. Additionally, it involves many elements of computer controlling and electronic principles, but still much of the learning is focused on production skills. Approaches that are now dominant in craft education do not prepare students to meet the challenges of modern technology and working life.

AB  - This study investigates the way collaborative learning that occurs primarily outside the classroom affects college students' understanding of science. Collaborative learning is particularly important for the increasing number of nontraditional students who have limited time available for study groups and other peer learning activities occurring outside of class time. Using a national study of 4,644 college students of various academic majors, multiple linear regression was used to identify variables that enhance science learning. Time spent in peer learning settings, such as teaching science to peers and discussing science with peers, were the strongest predictors of understanding science; moreover, this finding was consistent even for nontraditional students who reported less frequency of engagement in such activities. The study suggests that science educators can enhance learning when they structure their courses to include peer learning that engages students with each other over science issues outside the classroom.

AB  - This article describes an undergraduate simulation that formulates Iraqi regimes following the removal of Saddam Hussein's Baathist regime. This exercise reinforces student comprehension and awareness for a range of legal and political topics--including group decision making, international law, diplomacy, and human rights--by actively engaging the students in policy formulation and group to group negotiations. In addition to presenting individual course concepts, this activity presents the advantages of multidisciplinary approaches by integrating related disciplines at the United States Air Force Academy. Contemporary social problems, foreign or domestic, require multifaceted solutions presented by particular specializations. Concerning the question of postwar Iraqi justice, political science students use their class expertise to design political institutions and legal studies. Students design the main legal apparatus as students from these respective disciplines then join together to execute the simulation. The four key components of active learning approaches--educational objectives, design parameters, procedures, and assessment and debriefing--are employed providing a full understanding of the goals, set-up, process, and advantages to synergizing across the curriculum for the issue of post-war Iraqi justice. The simulation has been successfully implemented three times with United States Air Force Academy cadets with feedback indicating positive results and providing inputs that modified the initial construct of the simulation.

AB  - This article is an account of a cooperative project to develop student writing within an interdisciplinary human sciences degree, in line with the 'Writing in the Disciplines' approach adopted in the USA that aims to develop student writing within mainstream teaching. The course tutor worked with a writing tutor to introduce a 'writing strand' into a first year course in archaeology. The project is described and evaluated with examples from students' writing. On both subjective and objective measures the project was a success: students became more positive about their writing and their end of course essays generally improved. The article focuses particularly on the use of the technique of 'freewriting' as a way of strengthening students' sense of their own voice and authority in their university writing.

AB  - Nanotechnology is an emergent technology that holds much promise and excitement. The ability to control and manipulate matter at the most basic level--atoms and molecules--offers possibilities that transcend traditional science discipline boundaries. This interdisciplinary nature of nanotechnology provides many avenues for teachers to connect the field to their courses. The science community is interested in nanotechnology primarily because the scale of the work opens new and largely unexplored terrain. To understand the reason for the excitement and promise related to nanotechnology, students must be able to conceptualize the nanoscale. Although there is not a rigid boundary of the range of sizes encompassed by the nanoscale, a common definition is that it is from 1 nm to 100 nm. The concept of how scale affects systems and organisms is central to many science disciplines, and it serves as one of only four unifying themes that Project 2061 has identified as important for all students. However, students and adults have difficulty conceptualizing nanoscale. Relative scale is easier to grasp than absolute scale, and the dominant reference benchmark for relative scale is one's own size. One strategy for enhancing students' understanding of nanoscale is to shift students' existing understandings of relative scale by helping them conceptually transport their strongest scale benchmark--themselves--into the nanoscale world. This article describes a set of activities to scaffold high school students' nanoscale conceptions and to help them appreciate the scale at which nanotechnology operates, both in a relative and an absolute sense.

AB  - Theories provide valuable guidance for research and practice. They provide a framework for generating testable hypotheses and integrating empirical evidence and, over time, a road map for the design and implementation of intervention strategies. With repeated use, a theory or set of theories can become the dominant lens through which investigators come to understand the domains in which they work. Although these theories may prove to be productive, investigators may habituate to the perspective afforded by a theory in the way that one can forget that one is wearing glasses. When this happens, theories can become static or fixed entities. As Noar and Zimmerman (2005) have illustrated, investigators rely on theories to guide their work but rarely directly test or question their underlying assumptions. Because of this pattern of behavior, the ongoing development or refinement of theories slows. In a series of provocative articles (Burke, Bird, et al., 2009; Burke, Joseph, Pasick, & Barker, 2009; Joseph, Burke, Tuason, Barker, & Pasick, 2009; Pasick, Barker, Otero-Sabogal, Burke, Joseph, & Guerra, 2009; Pasick, Burke, et al., 2009; Stewart, Rakowski, & Pasick, 2009; Washington, Burke, Joseph, Guerra, & Pasick, 2009), Pasick and colleagues have challenged investigators to stop and be mindful about the theories they employ and to consider the applicability of constructs that are routinely used in the behavioral sciences. This interdisciplinary team examined whether behavioral constructs such as self-efficacy, intention, and perceived vulnerability are conceptualized and operate differently across contexts. Although comparisons across context can take many forms, Pasick and colleagues focused on comparisons across different racial/ethnic populations. The questions posed by Pasick and colleagues are challenging and difficult to answer. Their findings provide an initial assessment of these issues and offer an opportunity to initiate a theoretical and empirical conversation about the applicability and utility of behavioral theories and the constructs they employ. With an eye toward the continued analysis of these questions, in this commentary the author considers a series of issues that may enrich the insights and impact afforded by these efforts.

AB  - A time of upheaval and innovation, the American Colonial Period (1600-1775) was marked by New World settlers' struggles to adapt to a life that lacked anything familiar or prefabricated. The period provides a rich opportunity to study the contributions of the colonists across multiple disciplines. In the fall of 2003, a team of eighth-grade teachers at Washington Junior High School in Toledo, Ohio, constructed a unit on Colonial life that spanned five disciplines: family and consumer sciences, history, language arts, science, and math. Prior to the field trip, students in family and consumer sciences class learned how Colonial women and children reused and borrowed fabric to make patchwork quilts that kept them warm and preserved their family's history and memories. In history class, students compared and contrasted lifestyles in the New England, Middle, and Southern Colonies. In language arts class, students studied Patrick Henry's and Samuel Adams' persuasive techniques that convinced their fellow colonists to oppose British policies. In science class, students explored the contributions of Colonial scientists and examined those ideas and inventions that helped shape the era. In math class, students charted Early American iron ore export data from 1732-1756 on stem-and-leaf and box-and-whisker plots and then wrote a brief description of the graphs, explaining how to interpret them. This multi-disciplinary study provided an opportunity for instructors to truly work together and to find connections between their own subjects. Students benefited by achieving a deeper, more complex understanding of this significant time in American history.

AB  - Scientific research has a culture that can be challenging to enter. Different aspects of this culture may act as barriers or entry points for different people. Recognition of these barriers and entry points requires identifying aspects of the culture of scientific research and synthesizing them into a single, descriptive framework. A systematic literature review encompassing a two-pronged search strategy, descriptive mapping of ideas, and consensus building, was performed to identify aspects of scientific research culture. This resulted in the Culture of Scientific Research (CSR) Framework, composed of 31 cultural aspects categorized as either Practices, Norms/Expectations, or Values/Beliefs. Additional evidence of validity was collected through a survey that asked biological researchers to indicate which aspects in the framework were relevant to their experiences of research. The majority of survey respondents (n = 161) perceived the 31 aspects in the CSR Framework as relevant to biological research. This framework provides a consistent structure for describing the experiences of people engaging with the culture of scientific research. The literature review included literature from multiple disciplines, so the CSR Framework should be broadly applicable. Future applications of the CSR Framework include identifying possible barriers and entry points experienced by groups currently underrepresented in scientific research.

AB  - Medical students must be prepared for working in inter-professional and multi-disciplinary clinical teams centred on a patient's care pathway. While there has been a good deal of rhetoric surrounding patient-centred medical education, there has been little attempt to conceptualise such a practice beyond the level of describing education of communication skills and empathy within a broad "professionalism" framework. Paradoxically, while aiming to strengthen patient-student interactions, this approach tends to refocus on the role modelling of the physician, and opportunities for potentially deep collaborative working relationships between students and patients are missed. A radical overhaul of conventional doctor-led medical education may be necessary, that also challenges the orthodoxies of individualistic student-centred approaches, leading to an authentic patient-centred model that shifts the locus of learning from the relationship between doctor as educator and student to the relationship between patient and student, with expert doctor as resource. Drawing on contemporary poststructuralist theory of text and identity construction, and on innovative models of work-based learning, the potential quality of relationship between student and patient is articulated in terms of collaborative "knowledge production," involving close reading "with" the patient as text, through dialogue. Here, a medical "education" displaces traditional forms of medical "training" that typically involve individual "information reproduction." Students may, paradoxically, improve clinical acumen through consideration of silences, gaps, and contradictions in patients as texts, rather than treating communication as transparent. Such paradoxical effects have been systematically occluded or denied in traditional medical education.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to discuss "small-group apprenticeships (SGAs)" as a method to instruct cell culture techniques to high school participants. The study aimed to teach cell culture practices and to introduce advanced imaging techniques to solve various biomedical engineering problems. Participants designed and completed experiments using both flow cytometry and laser scanning cytometry during the 1-month summer apprenticeship. In addition to effectively and efficiently teaching cell biology laboratory techniques, this course design provided an opportunity for research training, career exploration, and mentoring. Students participated in active research projects, working with a skilled interdisciplinary team of researchers in a large research institution with access to state-of-the-art instrumentation. The instructors, composed of graduate students, laboratory managers, and principal investigators, worked well together to present a real and worthwhile research experience. The students enjoyed learning cell culture techniques while contributing to active research projects. The institution's researchers were equally enthusiastic to instruct and serve as mentors. In this article, we clarify and illuminate the value of small-group laboratory apprenticeships to the institution and the students by presenting the results and experiences of seven middle and high school participants and their instructors.

AB  - In this study we examined curriculum integration in new ways by exploring the link between classroom context, the implementation of community-based, integrated science projects, and the subsequent student learning. The literature is inconsistent regarding the benefits of an integrated approach to curriculum. The research design was a multiple case study conducted in two classrooms in different schools. We employed a "worldly interpretive framework" that recognizes and embraces the importance of context in framing curriculum practices and outcomes. We found that similar projects in the two classrooms produced distinctly different (and equally valid) outcomes--focused either on bounded discipline-specific knowledge or, alternatively, on issues and problems that transcended disciplinary boundaries.

AB  - North Carolina State University (NCSU) is a Research Intensive (Research I) university located in Raleigh, the state capital. Increasingly over the past ten years, NCSU faculty interested in issues of teaching and learning have used the term "inquiry-guided learning" (IGL) to describe the kind of learning they are trying to promote. The term suggests classroom practices that help students to raise, sharpen, and follow through on their own questions, to respond to questions posed by the faculty member by asking further questions and seeking answers to them, and to develop a habitual sense of inquiry that will transcend the boundaries of the course. The assumption, and it is being continuously and self-consciously questioned in the IGL classroom, is that students retain information and concepts much better if they have internalized the related questions, and they learn better how to do research and evaluate evidence if they have made these questions their own. A further assumption is that students are more ready to apply the standards of critical thinking, such as accuracy, precision, clarity, breadth, depth, relevance and logic, to their work and thereby improve their critical thinking skills, if the work is propelled and guided by questions of importance to the students. Many departments in the university have one or two IGL courses for their majors, particularly as capstone courses, and three departments (Microbiology, Wood and Paper Science, and Multidisciplinary Studies) have designed a sequence of several IGL courses for their majors. This article reports on the self-designed major sponsored by the Division of Multidisciplinary Studies and procedures for assessing it. Since the entire program is inquiry-guided, and the outcomes of this learning coincide with general education learning outcomes, assessing the program amounts to assessing the extent to which general education objectives are achieved through the major. This article focuses on two specific outcomes, which are equally the desired outcomes of the major, of IGL, and of general education. The two are so interrelated that they could be considered a single outcome: developing a commitment to inquiry and being able to apply the standards of critical thinking to one's written and verbal presentations of an inquiry.

AB  - Today, geodesic domes are found on playgrounds, homes, over radar installations, storage facilities, at Disney's Epcot Center, and at World's Fairs. The inventor of the design, Buckminster Fuller, thought that geodesic domes could be used to cover large areas and even designed one to cover all of New York's Manhattan Island. This article details an activity that gives students a great opportunity to explore the basic math, science, and technological principles related to the design and construction of structures. They will also investigate the advantages and disadvantages of dome construction. (Contains 3 figures and 15 online resources.)

AB  - In the first of two National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded workshops, 30 professors of biology and computer science from 18 institutions met at Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts, on June 6-7, 2002, to share ideas on how to incorporate genomics research into undergraduate curricula. The participants included nine pairs or trios of biologists and computer scientists, anticipating or already implementing collaborations. In a before-and-after format, the two workshops are intended to encourage experimentation in the classroom (June 2002) followed by reflection on and evaluation of ideas (June 2003). This paper discusses the six main outcomes of the June 2002 workshop: (1) Confidence; (2) Compare and Contrast Programs; (3) Infusing Genomics; (4) Linked Courses; (5) Collection of Resources; and (6) Communication Across the Disciplinary Boundaries. Participants ranked the workshop a huge success toward helping them develop ideas for incorporating genomics into undergraduate curricula. (Contains 3 tables and 8 relevant websites.)

AB  - This paper suggests that some refinements might need to be considered to current codes of ethics for dissemination of research. The growth of research in music education over the last decade is reviewed, with examples from new journals, conferences and professional associations. It is argued that nowadays researchers have to address a multidisciplinary number of audiences and this should be taken into account in the regulations for conferences and publications with the incorporation of guidelines for contributors to address their specific audience and to explain any previous dissemination. The authorship of papers is also considered, in particular issues arising from multiple authorship, as well as the research participants' contribution to the final report. Some of these issues are discussed with reference to studies focussed on a particular topic (creativity in music education) within the context of music education research, but it is acknowledged that the discussion also applies to other fields of the humanities and social sciences.

AB  - Calls for reform in science education stress the need for inquiry-based, integrative methods that provide students with opportunities to solve authentic problems. Project INSITE, a four-year professional development effort in Indiana, was designed to help teachers integrate problem-centered science methods in their classrooms. This approach was characterized by use of a meaningful driving question anchored in a real-world context; student-conducted investigations that resulted in the creation of products; collaboration among students, teachers, and the community; and use of technology as a tool for gathering and sharing information. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the project suggest that it was generally successful in promoting positive teacher perceptions, fostering learner-centered classroom approaches, and leading to implementation of inquiry-based science in many classrooms.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this conceptual paper is to argue that leadership, including distributed leadership, is a concept of folk psychology and is more productively viewed as an emergent self-organising property of complex systems. It aims to argue the case on the basis that claims to (distributed) leadership outrun the theoretical and empirical resources distributed and other leadership theorists can offer to support them. Design/methodological approach: The paper employs contemporary scientific as well as traditional philosophical criteria in determining the knowledge claims made by distributed leadership theories. Of particular importance are the coherence theory of evidence that employs the super-empirical virtues, especially coherence to establish the scientific virtue of theory, and the conception of leadership as part and parcel of folk psychology. Findings: When considering the basis of claims to distributed leadership from a neuroscientific and empirical perspective, there is little basis in fact about the existence of (distributed) leadership as an ontological category. Talk of leadership is a conventional, commonsense label for vastly more complex and fine-grained causal physiological and neuronal activities within certain social contexts. In this sense distributed leadership is a conception available for reduction. Originality/value: The significance and originality of this paper lies in the fact that it proposes causal investigations of social phenomena such as leadership; demonstrates the importance and necessity of interdisciplinary research; and outlines exciting new research agendas that both question traditional taken-for-granted conceptions of social explanations and suggests directions of where solutions may be found in the future that are defensible by the best of current science.

AB  - UCLA's Howard Hughes Undergraduate Research Program (HHURP), a collaboration between the College of Letters and Science and the School of Medicine, trains a group of highly motivated undergraduates through mentored research enhanced by a rigorous seminar course. The course is centered on the presentation and critical analysis of scientific journal articles as well as the students' own research. This article describes the components and objectives of the HHURP and discusses the results of three program assessments: annual student evaluations, interviews with UCLA professors who served as research advisors for HHURP scholars, and a survey of program alumni. Students indicate that the program increased their ability to read and present primary scientific research and to present their own research and enhanced their research experience at UCLA. After graduating, they find their involvement in the HHURP helped them in securing admission to the graduate program of their choice and provided them with an advantage over their peers in the interactive seminars that are the foundation of graduate education. On the basis of the assessment of the program from 1998-1999 to 2004-2005, we conclude that an intensive literature-based training program increases student confidence and scientific literacy during their undergraduate years and facilitates their transition to postgraduate study.

AB  - What do the glory of ancient Rome and the chemistry of copper have in common? Bronze coins. Romans minted millions of them to be used throughout the empire and a significant number became lost, only for us to find, two millennia later. Over the years, the coins have reacted with oxygen, sulfur, and chlorine to corrode into chemical products that have distinct colors. By developing lessons around the coins, teachers can use the excitement of Roman history, the fun of chemistry, and the fascination of detective work to teach an interdisciplinary unit that students will remember for years. This article presents activities in which a student can be an investigator, an author, and a chemist to help solve 2000-year-old mysteries simply by cleaning and reading the inscriptions on Roman coins. A brief list of Internet resources concludes the article.

AB  - "Principles and Standards for School Mathematics" states that in the middle grades "measurement concepts and skills can be developed and used throughout the school year rather than treated exclusively as a separate unit of study" (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics 200, p. 241). This article describes a collaborative activity that combined a mathematics class and a technology design class in a setting that encouraged creativity, problem solving, and divergent thinking. The students in the math class had just completed a unit on calculating surface areas and volumes, and were expected to be able to use formulas to find the surface area and volume of basic three-dimensional shapes. The technology students had been working on the IDEATE design process, which gives six specific steps that students should follow in a design project: (1) Identify and define the problem; (2) Develop the design brief; (3) Explore possible alternatives; (4) Accumulate and assess the alternatives; (5) Try out the best solution; and (6) Evaluate the results. In this  collaborative activity, forty-five students from both classes, grouped into teams of three or four, were instructed to design and build a container to hold ice for 24 hours and to keep it from melting. The maximum volume of the container, the amount of water to freeze, and other restrictions were also given. Instructors were extremely pleased with the results of this unit, finding it to be a good interdisciplinary mix of mathematics and technology. The setting allowed students to practice content-area skills that they had learned in each class, as well as use higher-order thinking skills. Extensive use of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation, the top three levels of thinking skills in Bloom's taxonomy, were evident on a daily basis throughout the project. (Contains 6 figures.)

AB  - This article presents the conceptual foundations of the Education for Peace (EFP) integrative curriculum, reviews its contents, and briefly describes its impact on students, teachers, staff and parents/guardians in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The curriculum was developed in 2000, first employed in six pilot schools and then implemented in 112 primary and secondary schools in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as in a few schools in North America, thus far involving thousands of educators and tens of thousands of students. The curriculum is being published in nine volumes covering core aspects of peace education. This article reviews the curriculum's comprehensive and inclusive pedagogical approaches and unique conceptual formulation, which defines conflict as the absence of unity and unity as the main prerequisite for peace. The curriculum integrates insights from a wide range of disciplines on peace and education, including education, peace studies, conflict resolution, political science, law, religion, sociology, psychology and history. Within this integrative approach, each volume addresses one or more aspects of peace and peace education, drawing from the latest developments in the field and from lessons learned in the implementation of the EFP program. The final part of the article includes several first-hand statements attesting the efficacy of the EFP program.

AB  - This article describes a simple way to explain the limitations of statistics to scientists and students to avoid the publication of misleading conclusions. Biologists examine their results extremely critically and carefully choose the appropriate analytic methods depending on their scientific objectives. However, no such close attention is usually given to the choice of relevant statistical tools and to assessment of how statistical methods may influence the validity of the results. We thus encourage interdisciplinary science and we support collaboration between biologists and statisticians from the very beginning of a project.

AB  - Clinical teams are of growing importance to healthcare delivery, but little is known about how teams learn and change their clinical practice. We examined how teams in three US hospitals succeeded in making significant practice improvements in the area of antimicrobial resistance. This was a qualitative cross-case study employing Soft Knowledge Systems as a conceptual framework. The purpose was to describe how teams produced, obtained, and used knowledge and information to bring about successful change. A purposeful sampling strategy was used to maximize variation between cases. Data were collected through interviews, archival document review, and direct observation. Individual case data were analyzed through a two-phase coding process followed by the cross-case analysis. Project teams varied in size and were multidisciplinary. Each project had more than one champion, only some of whom were physicians. Team members obtained relevant knowledge and information from multiple sources including the scientific literature, experts, external organizations, and their own experience. The success of these projects hinged on the teams' ability to blend scientific evidence, practical knowledge, and clinical data. Practice change was a longitudinal, iterative learning process during which teams continued to acquire, produce, and synthesize relevant knowledge and information and test different strategies until they found a workable solution to their problem. This study adds to our understanding of how teams learn and change, showing that innovation can take the form of an iterative, ongoing process in which bits of K&I are assembled from multiple sources into potential solutions that are then tested. It suggests that existing approaches to assessing the impact of continuing education activities may overlook significant contributions and more attention should be given to the role that practical knowledge plays in the change process in addition to scientific knowledge.

AB  - The combination of federal exigency for Highly Qualified Teachers in every classroom (No Child Left Behind, 2001) and focus on teacher accountability has created a plethora of routes to teacher certification and continuing education. This urgent situation has placed a burden on schools of education to approach teacher education in creative and expedited ways, while concurrently placing focus on content knowledge and research-based pedagogy. In response, university faculty in teacher education and mathematics designed a mathematics community continuum (MCC) that expands and redefines the traditional relationship among schools of education, colleges of arts and sciences, and school districts. Within this community continuum, the authors used mathematics as a content vehicle and an urban mini-district as a ripe context to study teacher learning and development. The authors' goal with this project was to understand ways to envision and implement alternative structures for mathematics teacher education, as well as teacher education generally, which addressed federal demands and provided a model for exemplary design of university-school partnerships. In this paper, the authors discuss findings relative to the following question: "In what ways did the structure of the continuum help to advance the learning of mathematics and its teaching?" The authors outline the details of this community continuum, particularly as it pertains to mathematics teacher education and professional development. As part of this description, the authors provide a synthesis of relevant literature that framed the development of the continuum, as well as why this context provides a rich window for studying professional development, particularly in the area of mathematics. Finally, the authors outline how the findings of this research study inform understanding of alternative structures of mathematics teacher education at all stages of development.

To scrutinize effects of these factors on innovation competency, this study examined their correlations with innovation competency and their internal structure in order to comprehensively understand influential processes and paths for innovation competency enhancement in design education. The validated questionnaire was delivered to 296 students enrolled in design programs of universities in Taiwan. SPSS 18.0 and AMOS statistics were used to analyze collected data. To address research questions of this study, t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson correlation analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were performed. The following crucial conclusions were reached: (1) Students enrolled in design programs generally possessed high levels of professional competency, interdisplinary ability, social skills capability, team cohesion, thinking style, and innovation competency; (2) There were significant and positive relationships among these factors. This implies that these intrapersonal factors are highly relied on each other because they co-exist and interact with each other. Thus, any change in one factor would create chain effects; and (3) These highly correlated intrapersonal factors can be developed in real environment through understanding their interactive, hierarchical, and consecutive processes rather than through focusing on effects of a single factor. These conclusions could provide several suggestions for professionals, managers, and, more importantly, school educators in relevant fields. Two suggestions are provided for future high quality and comprehensive research to further understand and improve strategies needed for design education.

AB  - Constant changes in society and the public health domain force public health professionals into new roles and the development of new competencies. Public health professionals will need to be trained to respond to this challenge. The aim of this comparative study among Poland, the UK and the Netherlands is to identify competence needs for Master of Public Health graduates entering the labour market from a European perspective. A self-administered questionnaire was sent to employers in the three countries, rating the importance of competency in public health on a master's level. In all three countries, interpersonal competencies, like team working and communication skills, are rated as highly important. However, employers in the UK and Poland generally rate public health specific competencies as much more important than their Dutch colleagues. It is concluded that while public health specific knowledge is providing a useful starting point for entry-level public health professionals, employers increasingly recognise the value of generic competencies such as communication and team working skills. The results suggest a stronger emphasis on teaching methods that encourage active learning and the integration of skills, which is crucial for enhancing graduates' employability, and foster an open attitude to multidisciplinary working, which is essential in modern health care.

AB  - As part of the development of a Department of Writing Studies in the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota, the 99-year-old Department of Rhetoric in the College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences was dismantled. The bulk of Rhetoric faculty have been shifted to this new department of Writing Studies. The undergraduate majors and minors (in Scientific and Technical Communication [STC], for example) and the graduate programs (the MS in STC and the MA and PhD in Rhetoric and STC) were shifted to the new Department of Writing Studies. Of all major research institutions, the University of Minnesota has had perhaps the most convoluted relationship with rhetorical theory and practice. The rhetorical tradition has been at the heart of the Department of Rhetoric and will be at the heart of the Department of Writing Studies--though institutional realignments always mean change. The rhetorical has been essential to the Department of Communication Studies since the postwar period. And, the College of Liberal Arts has housed a number of interdisciplinary initiatives that have included rhetorical study: a Communications program, a freestanding program in Composition; a Center for Advanced Studies in Language, Style, and Literary Theory, and a Center for Writing (offering a graduate minor in Literacy and Rhetorical Studies). This fragmentation and dispersal of rhetorical studies is part and parcel of the complex positioning of rhetoric at a Midwestern university with roughly 50,000 students. The particular dismantling of the Department of Rhetoric strikes a chord because this is not the first time that a Department of Rhetoric has been dismantled at the University of Minnesota. An examination of the history of the dissolution of the first Department of Rhetoric and the fate of its programs can serve as an important foil for the critical analysis of the current institutional position of rhetorical studies. The dialogue on the institutional position of rhetoric is functioning at an interdisciplinary level (through the Alliance for Rhetoric Societies and its related initiatives) and at the disciplinary level (as the Consortium for Doctoral Programs in Rhetoric and Composition seeks disciplinary status in the National Research Council). This comparison will allow the author to anecdotally demonstrate what he believes are generalizable conditions affecting the development of programs centered on rhetorical tradition.

AB  - We propose that psychology graduates are uniquely placed to work in the cybersecurity industry due to their understanding of human behavior and the possession of skills needed to address cybersecurity issues. However, there are challenges in attracting psychology graduates to the cybersecurity industry as they may not be fully aware of how skills developed in a psychology degree can be applied to a cybersecurity career. This small-scale evaluation explored psychology students' understanding of what working in cybersecurity entailed and what psychology skills and knowledge (their psychological literacies) they thought were needed for working in psychology and cybersecurity roles. Undergraduate psychology students (N = 66) answered two open-ended questions about skills needed to work in cybersecurity and then judged the importance of nine psychological literacy items for working in cybersecurity and psychology. A content analysis revealed that students recognized not just the technical aspects of cybersecurity work but also aspects relating to human behavior. Seven of the nine psychological literacy items were perceived as significantly more important for working in psychology than cybersecurity. This study is the first to link psychological literacy to working in cybersecurity. The implications of the results are discussed in terms of supporting students to recognize their psychological literacies for cybersecurity careers and suggestions are made for awareness-raising initiatives.

AB  - Through play and physical activities (PAs), children have many opportunities to develop gross motor skills that require the use of large muscles for movement and control. Young children use gross motor skills as they engage in daily tasks such as sitting upright, maintaining control and balance while seated, walking down the hallway, moving forward and backward using a variety of locomotion strategies (i.e., tiptoe, gallop, and march), and manipulating objects (i.e., playing with balls, and carrying books and backpacks). The National Association for Sport and Physical Education (NASPE; 2002, 2010) recommends that preschoolers engage in at least 120 min of structured and unstructured PAs each day, recognizing that motor development occurs when children are provided with multiple opportunities for PA. Given the impact of motor skills on other areas of development, and the need to ensure that young children engage in high levels of PA, it is critical that teachers consider ways to intentionally embed opportunities to engage in and practice motor skills into the preschool day for all young children and particularly for those who may be experiencing delays. The purpose of this article is to provide early education practitioners with strategies for creating more opportunities for children to engage in gross motor activities within their already busy preschool day. Strategies for creating brief gross motor opportunities by inserting physical activity breaks throughout the day and enhancing the gross motor opportunities inherent in regularly occurring transitions are described.

AB  - Linear programming (LP) is taught in different departments across college campuses with engineering and management curricula. Modeling an LP problem is taught in every linear programming class. As faculty teaching in Engineering and Management departments, the depth to which teachers should expect students to master this particular type of modeling is often discussed. Does a student's understanding of this critical concept differ across the curriculum? The authors look at students' abilities to model LP problems in two different departments: Industrial Engineering and Management. The authors compare the results and look for differences and reasons for those differences.

AB  - The focus of the paper is on the transformative effect on student learning and engagement that results from using contemporary Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools and directed reflection to engage in spatial learning about the politics (literally) surrounding the student. I report on the pedagogical advantages of using spatial analysis (especially embedded in GIS maps) and reflection to foster student engagement with, and learning of, the multidisciplinary foundations of local political conflicts. I present a community politics course that employs GIS (emphasizing goals and learning methods), discuss new developments in GIS tools that enable projects such as the one evaluated here, describe the neighborhood analysis project used in the course and present a detailed, multi-semester assessment of student projects that employs both qualitative data based on student reflections and a more quantitative review of their work. This paper provides a discussion and assessment of applying (GIS) technology to student self-awareness of, and engagement with, political issues in their own hometown. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - We provide a protocol for rapid DNA extraction from spiders suitable for undergraduate practical sessions. Students who were previously naïve to the theory and laboratory technique of DNA barcoding were successfully able to extract and recover 29 DNA sequences from 16 species of small spiders in the family Linyphiidae. We anticipate that with careful selection of specimens, undergraduate students could participate in sessions which both benefit their professional development and further taxonomic understanding across a variety of organisms.

AB  - Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) is an urban public research-extensive institution located in downtown Indianapolis. In 1991, in preparation for the 1992 NCA accreditation visit, a newly-formed Council on Undergraduate Learning at IUPUI and the Academic Affairs Committee of the Faculty Council established a Commission on General Education to oversee development of a centrally coordinated approach to general education for undergraduates at IUPUI. At the time, general education was the responsibility of each school, and followed, primarily, a distributive model, wherein each school defined required areas, such as humanities, sciences, and social sciences, and then specified particular requirements within those defined areas. Bearing in mind both their initial charge to develop a centrally coordinated approach to general education and the NCA mandate to develop specific learning outcomes within the approach to general education, several members of the Commission on General Education attended the 1993 Lilly Endowment Workshop on the Liberal Arts. Out of that workshop, and in conjunction with several other campus committee conversations, the Commission initiated "a process approach" to general education. They set up a series of multi-disciplinary committees, day-long retreats, and town halls to explore fundamental values associated with general education. This process culminated in the IUPUI Principles of Undergraduate Learning (PULs). These PULs are significant not in their uniqueness--they are very similar to the undergraduate learning values in almost any institution of learning--but because that they are intended to permeate the undergraduate curriculum instead of being a set of courses or skills concentrated in a student's first two years of college. Students are expected not only to improve their level of competence in each of the PULs during their first and second years, but also to continue to improve their level of competence throughout their undergraduate learning experiences

AB  - Over the past forty years, Howard Barrows' contributions to PBL research have influenced and guided educational research and practice in a diversity of domains. It is necessary to make visible to all PBL scholars what has been accomplished, what is perceived as significant, and what is the scope of applicability for Barrows' groundbreaking findings. As more disciplines recognize Barrows' efforts and adopt PBL in education, it becomes crucial but challenging to sustain community memory so that PBL scholars are kept well informed of research innovations in various domains. In this paper, we review Barrows' scholarly efforts in PBL and reveal the impacts on subsequent studies in various domains. A bibliometrics analysis is conducted on Barrows' PBL publications and the corresponding citations to quantitatively measure Barrows' impact. Our findings demonstrate Barrows' exceptional contributions to PBL and the disciplinary differences in conducting PBL studies based on Barrows' work. It is also revealed that PBL scholars who share similar interests have rarely collaborated with each other. The PBL research community has a real opportunity to connect isolated research groups and reduce the fragmentation so that research innovations in one domain can be disseminated to inform other scholars.

AB  - The aims of this study were to objectively measure the physical performance and physical endurance of patients with traumatic brain injury with minimization of cognitive and psychological fatigue, and to compare the physical performance of brain injured patients  with that of healthy controls. This was a nonrandomized partially blinded controlled study. The study setting was the Outpatient Multidisciplinary Brain Injury Clinic in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation of a tertiary care university teaching hospital. Participants included an experimental group that comprised independently ambulant men (age 18-55 years) with mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury (n = 24) who complained of greater fatigue than before their injury and an age-matched and sex-matched control group (n = 24). The intervention included the Six-Minute Walk Test. The primary outcome measures were the Six-Minute Walk Distance, the Fatigue Severity Scale, Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination, and the Fatigue Visual Numeric Scale; the secondary outcome measures were the Physiological Cost Index of Walking and the Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion. The Six-Minute Walk Distance of the experimental group (452.33[plus or minus]68.816) when compared with that of the control group (518.08[plus or minus]92.114) was reduced by 12.7 and 30.5%, respectively, when compared with the predicted Six-Minute Walking Distance (650.04[plus or minus]79.142) for the same age and sex. The mean Fatigue Severity Scale values were 2.51 and 1.62 for the experimental and control groups, respectively. The mean Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Score for the patients was 85.5[plus or minus]7.265. In conclusion, the Six-Minute Walk Test is useful in segregating physical fatigue from cognitive and psychological aspects of fatigue when cognitive and psychological dimensions are known. The Six-Minute Walk Test can be used as a tool for exercise intensity prescription in men with mild-to-moderate brain injury, to avoid the deleterious effects of fatigue.

AB  - Manufacturing engineering provides a relevant context from which to envision interdisciplinary learning experiences because engineers integrate their knowledge and skills of manufacturing and algebra processes in order to plan the efficient manufacture of products. In this article, the author describes an interdisciplinary learning activity that was originally implemented as a Tech Prep project at Norview High School, Norfolk, Virginia. The project occurred over three days within 1 1/2-hour blocks; total activity time was 4 1/2 hours. This cooperative learning project required students enrolled in Manufacturing Technology and Algebra I to share their technical and mathematical expertise for the purpose of demonstrating how this knowledge and skill applies in real-world contexts.

AB  - Vertical connections, constructed using inquiry, give students the skills to reach new heights in both their academic and local communities. In this article, the authors present inquiry projects, developed by middle level teachers, to ensure that students use higher-level thinking skills to improve the community. Each project is connected to the previous year's to give students a deeper understanding of how research can help citizens build a sustainable community. Teachers work together to plan field studies and guide students in presenting their findings to others in the community using models, PowerPoint presentations, a web accessible database, and reports from field investigations. The projects are as follows: (1) healthy marine ecosystems--sixth grade; (2) interdisciplinary science: biodiversity and development--seventh grade; and (3) collaborating to create a better biosphere--eighth grade.

AB  - This article presents a rejoinder to the commentaries on the authors' article titled, "Instructionally Supportive Accountability Tests in Science: A Viable Assessment Option?" The commentaries offer a series of well warranted cautions regarding the adoption of any form of large-scale accountability testing. However, the authors contend that, taking these cautions into serious consideration, science education in the United States will soon be influenced greatly by 50 sets of NCLB tests. The authors assert that instructionally supportive accountability tests represent the most appropriate way to cope with the realities of the current NCLB-governed educational scene in the United States. Here, the authors briefly discuss a few specific points in the comments. They stress that instructionally supportive accountability tests can, in today's world, play a useful role in stimulating suitable science instruction.

AB  - Over the past few decades, the practice of education and training has been shifting from traditional knowledge transmission approaches to constructivist approaches of knowledge construction. This evolution is supported by research in cognitive science, education, and discourse processes. Constructivist theories of learning assume that students use their prior knowledge to construct new knowledge that is relevant to their individual experiences and the texts that they read. There also is a widespread belief that knowledge construction is facilitated by technology and multiple channels of communication. Given the enormous increase of networked multi-channeled technologies, researchers have been exploring how people construct knowledge in an interactive environment. The aim of this special issue is to identify some models of the cognitive discourse and linguistic processes that underlie knowledge construction and to analyze how such processes are supported in technologies with diverse channels of communication.

AB  - When the human genome project was conceived, its leaders wanted all researchers to have equal access to the data and associated research tools. Their vision of equal access provides an unprecedented teaching opportunity. Teachers and students have free access to the same databases that researchers are using. Furthermore, the recent movement to deliver scientific publications freely has presented a second source of current information for teaching. I have developed a genomics course that incorporates many of the public-domain databases, research tools, and peer-reviewed journals. These online resources provide students with exciting entree into the new fields of genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics. In this essay, I outline how these fields are especially well suited for inclusion in the undergraduate curriculum. Assessment data indicate that my students were able to utilize online information to achieve the educational goals of the course and that the experience positively influenced their perceptions of how they might contribute to biology.

AB  - Drawing from multiple theoretical frameworks representing cognitive and educational psychology, we present a writing task and scoring system for measurement of students' informative writing. Participants in this study were 72 fifth- and sixth-grade students who wrote compositions describing real-world problems and how mathematics, science, and social studies information could be used to solve those problems. Of the 72 students, 69 were able to craft a cohesive response that not only demonstrated planning in writing structure but also elaboration of relevant knowledge in one or more domains. Many-facet Rasch Modeling (MFRM) techniques were used to examine the reliability and validity of scores for the writing rating scale. Additionally, comparison of fifth- and sixth-grade responses supported the validity of scores, as did the results of a correlational analysis with scores from an overall interest measure. Recommendations for improving writing scoring systems based on the findings of this investigation are provided.

AB  - The purpose of this report is to describe student satisfaction with a near-peer interprofessional education (IPE) session for physical therapy and medical students. Ten senior physical therapy students worked in peer-groups to develop a musculoskeletal anatomy demonstration for first-semester medical students. Together with their classmates, they demonstrated observation, palpation, and musculoskeletal assessment of the shoulder and scapular-thoracic articulation to medical student dissection groups in the Gross Anatomy laboratory. The medical students were encouraged to consider the synergistic function of shoulder structures and the potential impact of a selected pathology: rotator cuff injury. The session provided the medical students with an opportunity to integrate their new anatomical knowledge into a framework for clinical musculoskeletal evaluation. The experience offered senior physical therapy students an opportunity to work in teams with their peers, internalize and adapt to constructive feedback, and seek common ground with members of another profession. Both student groups reported a high degree of satisfaction with the sessions and expressed a desire for further interaction. These positive perceptions by student stakeholders have prompted us to consider additional IPE exchanges for the anatomy course in the upcoming school year. Given the positive outcome of this descriptive study, we now plan to systematically test whether near-peer IPE interactions can enhance the degree that students learn key anatomical concepts.

AB  - Computer games are increasingly being considered as a means of promoting learning, especially the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) games in the classroom. This article extends this idea by proposing an innovative method of fostering interdisciplinary collaboration through the design of computer games. The game to be developed, "On the Case," is based on William Gibson's seminal "Neuromancer," and will be used to augment and enhance the learning experiences of literary studies students studying this text. However, these users will also assist in the design process before a prototype version of the game is developed by peers on game-design degree programmes. The article offers an overview of the design considerations behind the game, primarily in terms of the intellectual engagement such a game will promote, the learning it is designed to foster, and the mechanisms--game-play, environment, and learning design--through which it will do so.

AB  - This paper synopsizes a series of nine tutorials investigating how various chemical processes can be shown to have musical aspects. Both chemistry and music share a common language: mathematics. Interesting music can be created as chemical reactions--mediated by instrumentation and mathematics (e.g., spectrometry and discrete Fourier transformation)--yield data that can be combined with principles of music theory to produce sounds. Sound files resulting from converting data to musical notation are then playable and manipulable on the computer; the sound data can also be represented on musical staves and played on musical instruments. A musical form of the periodic table of elements is provided, as well as supplemental sound files and text documents for each of the nine tutorials. (Contains 5 figures, 1 table and 1 note.)

AB  - Lately in his Composition II course, Ken Hada has been attempting to combine composition in a pedagogically appropriate manner with his concerns for ecology and the environment. Merging ecological issues with composition courses offers interesting pedagogical possibilities, such as collaborative learning experiences, for example, between science and English faculty. The collaboration of science and writing evolve nicely into author-editor relationships between members of the classes (see Gessell and Kokkala). Similar dialogical and transactional relationships could be developed among any number of disciplines. Also, an ecology composition class could work nicely in areas of service learning or community service (see Herzberg), which has been a growing emphasis in many universities over the past decade. Linking students to their own histories of place and leading them to discover the ecological underpinnings of those places can be a significant step toward real writing. It can be a liberating movement away from merely satisfying the disconnected requirements imposed by an authoritative teacher in a mandated course conducted in an artificial setting.

AB  - Innovation often happens at the margin. For the past 5 years, in the academic equivalent of an ecotone, Aquinas College in Grand Rapids, Michigan has built and continues to refine offerings in its 4-year Bachelor of Science degree in Sustainable Business. Emerging out of the demands of a rapidly changing business world and the sustainable business movement, this degree program integrates and spans across disciplines. As the country's first undergraduate program of its kind, Aquinas' program-building effort for its signature Sustainable Business degree offers lessons and insights for those who might embark on a similar journey on the "sustainability frontier." Faculty creativity, administrative leadership, and external support all contribute to this innovative curriculum.

AB  - A need has emerged in the curriculum for more teamwork experience, for the development of better communication and critical thinking skills, and for the acquisition of specialized knowledge. A focus on the processes by which problems are solved has served our discipline well and can continue to serve us if in the classroom we make appropriate connections between fundamentals and engineering practice; the change implied need not require a wholesale revamping of the curriculum, nor of individual professors teaching styles.

AB  - With the current intensity surrounding the No Child Left Behind Act, science has moved to the back burner at many schools. Educators everywhere are allotting less time for science. Many teachers have adapted by bringing reading and writing into the science program, but more often than not this has meant using science textbooks to teach the elements of reading or assigning science research papers to teach basic writing skills. Neither of these scenarios truly presents either subject-science or literacy-at its full potential. Educators know literacy is a critical component of science inquiry, so why can?t  they meaningfully incorporate literacy skills in school science programs? Science educators, teachers, and professional developers from the Education Development Center in Newton, Massachusetts, an international nonprofit research and development organization focused on education and human services, say educators can. This  article, discusses thoughts on the critical relationship between science and literacy and describe a framework developed for a professional development institute to help elementary teachers effectively and meaningfully integrate these subjects.

AB  - What are the humanities, and how should they be cultivated? With respect to this crucial question, opinions differ as to how widely the humanities should be construed and pursued. Initially connoting the study of Greek and Roman classics, the concept now more generally covers arts and letters, history, and philosophy. But does it also include the social sciences, which are often distinguished from the humanities and grouped as a separate academic division with greater pretensions to scientific status? And should our pursuit of humanistic study be concentrated on the traditional methods and topics of high culture that give the humanities an authoritative aura of established nobility, or should it extend to new and funkier forms of interdisciplinary research such as popular culture or race and gender studies?

AB  - DNA microarray is an ordered grid containing known sequences of DNA, which represent many of the genes in a particular organism. Each DNA sequence is unique to a specific gene. This technology enables the researcher to screen many genes from cells or tissue grown in different conditions. We developed an undergraduate lecture and laboratory exercise using an interdisciplinary approach to the study of microarray technology. What made this approach unique was studying the evolution of the technology leading up to the formation of the MicroArray Quality Control Project (MAQC). Students realized that this technique has potential of saving lives, making it absolutely necessary to validate all results. Students were then able to complete their own microarray project, evaluate their results and continue to analyze a gene from the study, by further utilizing basic bioinformatic tools as well as critiquing primary journal articles.

AB  - A new, integrated laboratory curriculum was recently developed at the U.S. Naval Academy in response to the 1999 ACS Committee on Professional Training guidelines that required inclusion of biochemistry and a stronger emphasis on student research. To meet these ACS requirements and to introduce more student choice in the major, we embarked on a complete redesign of the laboratory program, reducing eleven credit hours of traditional laboratory courses into a cohesive, eight-credit, four-semester sequence of integrated laboratory courses covering the core areas of chemistry. These courses are designed along broader themes with many experiments simultaneously exploring concepts from two or more subdisciplines of chemistry. Although the integrated laboratory concept has been applied at other institutions, this curriculum is unique in its design and scope. The program begins in the sophomore year and is completed in the junior year, allowing students to pursue research and advanced courses in their senior year. The integrated laboratory concept offers many attractive benefits, although there are potential difficulties: several of these are discussed as well. This paper may assist faculty contemplating a similarly comprehensive curricular change to carefully weigh the factors necessary to determine the feasibility and sustainability of such a program in their own unique educational environment.

AB  - Electronic course materials, such a videos, PowerPoint presentations, and animations, have become essential educational tools in classroom-based geoscience courses to enhance students' introduction to basic geological concepts. However, during field trips, the ability to offer students these electronic conceptual supports is lacking where students and faculty are often without access to the electrical grid. The video iPod offers an inexpensive and reliable means by which to provide students access to a wide range of electronic course materials during field trips. GeoJourney, a nine-week fieldbased interdisciplinary introductory geoscience program at Bowling Green State University, is the first geology field program to use the entire range of the video iPod's capabilities to support electronic course materials while in the field. A video iPod was issued to each student at the beginning of the program, along with a battery back-up and a DC charging cable which was plugged into a custom wiring harness installed in the transport vehicles. Students were able to use the iPods during travel time, in the field on hikes and projects, and in their tents at night. Types of materials included videos, still images, animations, text, audio files, and enhanced podcasts. Students' response to the use of the iPods is overwhelmingly positive and suggest their use on GeoJourney also reduces "novelty space".

AB  - The goal of this project is to develop a unique simulation environment that can be used to increase students' interest and expertise in Computer Science curriculum. Hands-on experience with physical or simulated equipment is an essential ingredient for learning, but many approaches to training develop a separate piece of equipment or software for each topic area. We describe the development of a simulation environment that provides a foundation for cross-disciplinary exercises. The Wireless Intelligent agent Simulation Environment (WISE), which combines activities from virtual and physical versions of the Wumpus World game, provides a dynamic learning environment that can enhance a number of Computer Science courses. In this paper, we describe the WISE environment design. We also describe steps for integrating WISE into Computer Science curriculum. As a demonstration of the effectiveness of the tool, we describe its use in the artificial intelligence, multimedia, and wireless networks courses at the University of Texas at Arlington.

AB  - Within modular degrees it is sometimes possible for students to broaden their education by taking modules from outside their main programme of study. This is one significant aspect of modular degrees which has not been studied. In an effort to better understand this issue, the research reported in this paper explored the experiences: (1) of students taking modules from outside their programme of study and; (2) of staff teaching modules with significant numbers of students from other programmes. In total, 820 undergraduate students responded to an on-line survey; 12 academic staff members participated in interviews. The survey focused on students' reasons for choosing the module, their experiences of assessment and their perceptions of workload. Interviews with academic staff focused on the influence of non-programme students on teaching and assessment practices. The discussion addresses the implications of student choice and classroom diversity for teaching and assessment in modular systems. (Contains 2 figures, 2 tables, and 1 note.)

AB  - The following article presents a proposal for the redesign of a traditional course in Differential Equations at Middle Georgia College. The redesign of the course involves a new approach to teaching traditional concepts: one where the understanding of the physical aspects of each problem takes precedence over the actual mechanics of solving the problem, hence, integrating the physics and mathematics of the subject matter. Furthermore, a computational component of the course is developed and implemented. Thus, the use of technology becomes an integral part of the course, with the aim to enhance the student's comprehension of the concepts presented, as well as introduce them to a more "real-world" or "industry" approach to solving problems. Preliminary results indicate a positive reaction by the students to using technology in this course, as well as higher performance over the same course taught in a traditional manner.

AB  - Correlated data are very common in the social sciences. Most common applications include longitudinal and hierarchically organized (or clustered) data. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) are a convenient and general approach to the analysis of several kinds of correlated data. The main advantage of GEE resides in the unbiased estimation of population-averaged regression coefficients despite possible misspecification of the correlation structure. This article aims to provide a concise, nonstatistical introduction to GEE. To illustrate the method, an analysis of selectivity effects in the Swiss Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study on the Oldest Old is presented.

AB  - Undergraduate introductory human anatomy and human physiology courses are either taught as discipline-specific or integrated anatomy and physiology (A&P) sequences. An institution underwent a curricular revision to change the course approach from discipline-specific Human Anatomy and Human Physiology to an integrated A&P I and II sequence, allowing the unique opportunity to explore the potential role of contextual learning in academic achievement and content retention. Mediation and moderation analysis was used to evaluate lecture examinations, laboratory practical examinations, and anatomical content retention between the different course approaches. Undergraduate students in the integrated A&P I course approach performed significantly better on lecture assessments and had a higher anatomy content retention rate at the end of the year than students enrolled in the standalone Human Anatomy course. The lecture examination averages between Human Physiology and A&P II (the second course in the sequence), as well as the anatomy laboratory practical examinations, were not significantly different between discipline-specific and integrated course approaches. The results suggest contextual learning--providing physiological context to anatomical structures--increases the anatomical content retention and academic achievement overall.

AB  - Practice based interprofessional education opportunities are proposed as a mechanism for health professionals to learn teamwork skills and gain an understanding of the roles of others. Primary care is an area of practice that offers a promising option for interprofessional student learning. In this study, we investigated what and how students from differing professions learn together. Our findings inform the design of future interprofessional education initiatives. Using activity theory, we conducted an ethnographic investigation of interprofessional education in primary care. During a 5 months period, we observed 14 clinic sessions involving mixed discipline student teams who interviewed people with chronic disease. Teams were comprised of senior medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, pharmacy and physiotherapy entry level students. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with seven clinical educators. Data were analysed to ascertain the objectives, tools, rules and division of labour. Two integrated activity systems were identified: (1) student teams gathering information to determine patients' health care needs and (2) patients either as health consumers or student educators. Unwritten rules regarding "shared contribution", "patient as key information source" and "time constraints" were identified. Both the significance of software literacy on team leadership, and a pre-determined structure of enquiry, highlighted the importance of careful consideration of the tools used in interprofessional education, and the way they can influence practice. The systems of practice identified provide evidence of differing priorities and values, and multiple perspectives of how to manage health. The work reinforced the value of the patients' voice in clinical and education processes.

AB  - Politics without history has no roots; history without politics bears no fruits. If one inquires into the content of the relation between politics and history, then one discovers it is defined by symbiotic dependence. Those who are trained in history also take into account the political dimensions of history, and those educated in political science cannot neglect the historical factors inhering in current issues and problems. The fact that politics is part of history and vice versa has always been significant on both a theoretical level and in the practice of teaching history and politics. Currently, the relation between the teaching methodology applied to history and politics receives significant attention from the historical side, but is only seldom referred to from the political perspective. Nevertheless, at the present time there is no explicitly delineated educational approach that integrates the teaching of both of these disciplines. This article attempts to advance an approach that places historical and political learning in the field of tension spanning political history and historical politics. (Contains 44 notes.)

AB  - Social capital has recently emerged as an important interdisciplinary research area. It is frequently used as a framework for understanding various social issues in temporal communities, neighbourhoods and groups. In particular, researchers in the social sciences and the humanities have used social capital to understand trust, shared understanding, reciprocal relationships, social network structures, common norms and cooperation, and the roles these entities play in various aspects of temporal communities. Despite proliferation of research in this area, little work has been done to extend this effort to technology-driven learning communities (also known as virtual learning communities). This paper surveys key interdisciplinary research areas in social capital. It also explores how the notions of social capital and trust can be extended to virtual communities, including virtual learning communities and distributed communities of practice. Research issues surrounding social capital and trust as they relate to technology-driven learning communities are identified.

AB  - There is a need to train professionals across disciplines to work collaboratively on program development and implementation to address the caregiving issues prevalent in our aging society. The North Carolina State University Departments of Social Work and Family and Consumer Sciences provided a training opportunity for social workers and county extension educators. The goals of the "Institute" were to provide a continuing education program that cultivated partnerships to develop and implement innovative local programming for older adults and their families. The program was also intended to increase the partnership capacity in the involved counties. This paper describes and evaluates the continuing education program and the potential of this training model for community partnership-building in the service of elders and families.

AB  - In order to examine the implications of applying a teaching strategy that integrates a systems approach and project-based learning (PBL), it was implemented in two courses. The objective of the first course was to train preservice teachers to teach the subject of "Science and Technology to All" (mandatory subject in all of Israel's junior high schools), a mandatory methods course has been developed in the Department of Education in Technology and Science at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology: "Methods for Teaching Science and Technology for All". The course participants were pre-service teachers who were studying toward a teaching certificate in the Department of Education in Science and Technology parallel to their studies for a B.Sc. degree in one of the Technion's science Faculties. Most students in this course lack basic knowledge in engineering and technology. The second course was an introductory freshman course in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. The goal of the second course was to achieve certain objectives through experiential learning. These were to provide students with a clear overview of the different fields in mechanical engineering; to introduce them to the essence of engineering work and the processes of design and development of new technological products; to raise their awareness of the importance and necessity of analysis for finding optimal solutions for engineering problems, and to acquaint freshmen with the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and familiarize them with the different aspects of mechanical engineering expertise (Elata & Garaway, 2002). The innovation here is the integration of PBL and the systems approach, and the implementation of this combination in courses that up until today had been taught in traditional ways. This was an attempt to exploit this integrated approach to teach technology through a top-down process, without explaining the details to students lacking a technological background. This paper describes a qualitative study that followed the progress of the two classes. It presents what was learned during implementation of this approach in these two courses, as well as thoughts on future implications.

AB  - The contemporary world of knowledge, characterized by an explosion of information and ways of communicating it, requires creativity more than ever in handling scientific knowledge. Thus, science education, especially for the gifted, must encourage the development of creativity. But, as creativity is not something that can simply be taught, we must create the conditions for its development. The main condition is freedom to raise original unorthodox ideas, freedom to deal with complex issues even when the student's body of knowledge is insufficient, and, most importantly, freedom to fail. This article describes, through examples, the main principles of the science education program in the Israel Arts and Science Academy and how the foregoing ideas are translated and applied there.

AB  - Microplastic contamination of the environment is a major concern but detecting such contamination presents a challenge, particularly for particles <0.1 mm in size. Community scientists and students who participated in a plankton monitoring program and routinely examined samples of seawater using brightfield microscopy, often found fragments and filaments that were likely of anthropogenic origin. While in some cases this was clear from their structure and color, the origin of many particles remained questionable. To address this problem, optical components were added to microscopes for polarization and fluorescence detection. Plastics often show birefringence under crossed-polarizers due to alignment of the polymer chains within. They also bind Nile Red dye to give green, yellow, or red fluorescence emission, depending on the hydrophobicity of the polymer. Fluorescence excitation was achieved using a focused blue LED flashlight mounted externally to a microscope and emission was detected through a yellow plexiglass or gel filter. The required optical components cost a few tens of dollars and can be applied to any stereo (dissecting) microscope and most compound microscopes. These modifications were tested by community college students who set up their own microscopes and reported the presence of microplastics in the majority of their plankton samples. The equipment was also used at outreach events, where the observation of glowing microplastic particles suspended in natural water samples made an immediate impression with the public and demonstrated the magnitude of the environmental problem.

AB  - The American public is now faced with a baffling array of new environmental issues--much more complicated than the problems people faced 30 years ago. Scientists recognize new threats to the biosphere, the fabric of natural ecosystems, and the diversity of plants and animals that inhabit them. Unlike the obvious, toxic pollutants that spurred the environmental movement of the 1960s, there are now signs of subtle, diffuse, and long-term effects on nature, cast by the six billion humans on Earth, each in the pursuit of a higher standard of living. In the face of an increasing onslaught and complexity of environmental issues, people will make only limited progress in protecting the environment until they have a cadre of highly trained environmental scientists who understand how the Earth works, policymakers who can advise them on the best solution to environmental problems, and a citizenry that respects their judgments. The author has the privilege of running the Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences, the nation's first professional school of the environment where it trains a broad variety of students to address the science and policy issues facing environment. The author stresses that schools like the Nicholas School have an enormous impact on the quality of the environment in the United States. In the process of training environmental professionals, it is critical for schools like the Nicholas School to forge strong ties to other professional schools, especially medicine and business. As the population continues to grow, never has there been a greater need for broad-based and interdisciplinary environmental education. The Nicholas School and similar programs are poised to deliver that training to the broadest array of bright and committed students.

AB  - It's no secret that America's youth are now more out of shape than ever before. Study after study documents the sad saga of childhood obesity. Quick-fix remedies such as "Atkins for Kids" and child-friendly aerobics classes are proliferating. There are fat camps for kids and low-fat "candy." Still, an inescapable fact remains: As a nation, and particularly among children, Americans are becoming too heavy. Educators are on the front line of dealing with this phenomenon. Most know why it's occurring; it's the "What can I do about it?" that is the frustrating part. These authors describe how, in an attempt to counteract this disturbing trend, they launched a program designed to inform the youngest students of the lifetime benefits of health eating, getting enough exercise, and maintaining a healthy heart and body. "The Healthy K Club," a joint effort among the Physical Education teacher, the Science Lab teacher, and the kindergarten students, is a six-week multidisciplinary program that encompasses a wide range of skills. In addition to physical skills, it includes lessons and activities on nutrition, fitness, and age-appropriate anatomy. (Contains 4 photographs.)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of Summer Environmental Education Program (SEEP) on elementary school students' environmental knowledge, affect, skills and behavior which are the main components of environmental literacy. The sample consisted of 45 students (25 males, 20 females) studying in 4th through 8th grades and living in Orphanage in Antalya. Various data collection instruments (e.g. Environmental Knowledge Test, Affective Disposition toward Environment Scale, Children's Responsible Environmental Behavior Scale and Scientific Process Skill for the Environmental Test) were used for assessing students' different outcomes prior to and after SEEP. The open-ended responses were subjected to content analysis whilst the remaining data were subjected to statistical analysis (e.g. repeated t-test). The results revealed that students' environmental knowledge, environmental sensitivity, intention, environmental attitudes and responsible environmental behaviors significantly increased after intervention. Even though students' "cognitive skills" and "saving behavior" increased from pre-test to post-test, these increases were not statistically significant.
